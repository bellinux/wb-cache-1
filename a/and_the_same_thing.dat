The album Take a Bite was published by GWR in October 1988 and follows in the steps of Nightmare at Maple Cross, presenting powerful and melodic metal songs, tinged with the humour typical of the band. To promote the album, Girlschool did a UK tour with Gary Glitter, followed by a North American tour. In 1989, they travelled across Europe with Dio and to the Soviet Union with Black Sabbath, {{till the end of}} the year. After their return from Russia, GWR did not renew their contract and the band practically broke up. Musical tastes were changing worldwide in favour of grunge and more extreme metal genres, compelling most acts originated from the new wave of British heavy metal to disband or to reduce their activities, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> happened to Girlschool.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{has existed}} since humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined and formalized profession {{with the emergence}} of the architecture as distinct profession from the engineering during the industrial revolution in the late 19th century. Until then, the architect and the structural engineer were usually one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> - the master builder. Only with the development of specialized knowledge of structural theories that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries, did the professional structural engineers come into existence.|$|E

60|$|Most of {{the great}} controversies of the world, most of the wide {{religious}} differences that keep men apart, arise from this: from differences in their way of thinking.

25|$|There is {{a triple}} {{equivalence}} of categories between {{the category of}} smooth irreducible projective algebraic curves over C (with non-constant regular maps as morphisms), the category of compact Riemann surfaces (with non-constant holomorphic maps as morphisms), and {{the opposite of the}} category of algebraic function fields in one variable over C (with field homomorphisms that fix C as morphisms). This means that in studying these three subjects we are in a sense studying one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> It allows complex analytic methods to be used in algebraic geometry, and algebraic-geometric methods in complex analysis, and field-theoretic methods to be used in both. This is characteristic of a much wider class of problems in algebraic geometry.|$|E
500|$|The {{texts and}} images of the Book of the Dead were magical as well as religious. Magic was as {{legitimate}} an activity as praying to the gods, even when the magic was aimed at controlling the gods themselves. Indeed, there was little distinction for the Ancient Egyptians between magical and religious practice. The concept of magic (heka) was also intimately linked with the spoken and written word. [...] The act of speaking a ritual formula {{was an act of}} creation; there is a sense in which action and speech were one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> The magical power of words extended to the written word. Hieroglyphic script was held to have been invented by the god Thoth, and the hieroglyphs themselves were powerful. Written words conveyed the full force of a spell. This was even true when the text was abbreviated or omitted, as often occurred in later Book of the Dead scrolls, particularly if the accompanying images were present. The Egyptians also believed that knowing the name of something gave power over it; thus, the Book of the Dead equips its owner with the mystical names of many of the entities he would encounter in the afterlife, giving him power over them.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as alternative metal, nu metal, hard rock and rap rock by professional reviewers. Shinoda described the album's sound as a 1990s style of rock record: [...] "It's a Rock record; [...] "it's loud and it's Rock, but not in the sense of what you've heard before, which is more like '90s hardcore-punk–thrash". He described the [...] "weak" [...] status of modern rock in the music industry as an inspiration in recording a heavier rock album; to try to bring the sound of the 1990s back to the forefront. Shinoda criticized the modern state of alternative radio, stating [...] "There’s so much stuff that sounds like HAIM or CHVRCHES or Vampire Weekend that I’m full. The thing I’m hungry for is not that. I turn on the rock station in L.A. and it sounds like Disney commercial music.” This led to a response from CHVRCHES, with their lead singer Lauren Mayberry calling Shinoda's comment [...] "a pointless dig." [...] Bennington agreed with Shinoda's comments, as he said, [...] "The bands I was listening to when I was growing up were all doing really innovative shit—Jane’s Addiction, Alice in Chains, Nirvana... Bands like the Refreshments and the Rembrandts, that music fucking angers me to this day. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> is happening now, where there’s all this stuff that feels like the soundtrack to 'Friends' or 'The Wizards of Waverly Place.'” ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{scholars}} underlined however that, {{to a great}} extent, Solomos did {{not care}} about the completion of his poems. A phrase attributed to the poet is illustrative: [...] "Lampros will remain an abstract, because the whole poem does not reach the height of some days". Linos Politis notes on the fragmentary nature of the Free Besieged: [...] "He did not want or did not care to incorporate these lyrical pieces into a narrative group [...] He stuck to the pure, lyrical expression, {{without regard to the}} non-lyrical linking substance, thus advancing [...] to the conquest of a 'pure' lyrical sphere, long before his time. We detected something similar in Kritikos too <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> is applied to the rest of his 'fragmented' works". [...] Later on, Solomos was considered by several poets and critics as the forerunner of [...] "pure poetry" [...] and the fragmented nature of his work did not [...] "disturb" [...] any more; on the contrary, it was considered as an advantage.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 Chicharro {{was active}} {{mixing with the}} Alfonsist monarchists in the Tradicionalistas y Renovación Española alliance; by the local Castellon Liaison Committee he was agreed to {{represent}} it in the forthcoming elections. This gained him hostility among new radical Carlist activists like Jaime del Burgo, who despised fraternization with caciques and debris of the Alfonsine monarchy. Moreover, for the Carlist youth the landowners like Lamamié and Chicharro became marked men as privileged section of politically dominant potentates, who are [...] "obstructing the Agrarian Reform by the feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain". Though indeed within Carlism Chicharro formed the most reactionary faction, conservatism did not render him averse to new radical social movements. Discussing Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler he declared that Traditionalism, “though not one <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing,</b> is very sympathetic towards them, as they are waging war against Judaism, freemasonry and Marxism, building an organized corporative state. What is inacceptable to us is the state's overwhelming sovereignty and dominance. For us the family comes first, followed by municipality, region and state, which is the last element in this chain”.|$|E

There have been many cases of migrant workers seeking jobs in neighboring Turkey. [...] "Emigration rates to Turkey," [...] one analyst said, [...] "are so high that most of the residents of the Besler district in Istanbul are Nakhchivanis." [...] When speaking to British writer Thomas de Waal, the mayor of Nakhchivan City, Veli Shakhverdiev, spoke warmly of a peaceful solution to the Karabakh conflict and of Armenian-Azeri relations during Soviet times. [...] "I can tell you that our relations with the Armenians were very close, they were excellent," [...] he said. [...] "I went to university in Moscow and I didn't travel to Moscow once via Baku. I took a bus, it was one hour to Yerevan, then went by plane to Moscow <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> on the way back." [...] Recently Nakhchivan made deals to obtain more gas exports from Iran, and a new bridge on the Aras River between the two countries was inaugurated in October 2007; the Azerbaijani President, Ilham Aliyev and the First Vice-President of Iran, Parviz Davoodi also attended the opening ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|Expert trails include DJ's Tramline, {{a narrow}} trail that descends via {{a series of}} cliff steps. The trail is rarely open because {{of the amount of}} snow {{required}} to cover the boulders and cliffs scattered throughout the trail. DJ's Tramline has been included in Vermont Sports Magazine's [...] "Gnarly 10 Toughest Trails in the East". There are no double Black Diamonds on Cannon Mountain, only Black Diamonds, although the color/shape nomenclature for trail rating is always relative to the other trails on the mountain. The Tramline, for example, could earn double black diamond at another mountain, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> is possible in the reverse. It is therefore recommended that skiers take careful note of the mountain's average challenge, and to proceed with caution when attempting a new run labeled as [...] "advanced" [...] or [...] "experts only". Besides the Tramline, Avalanche is the steepest run, measuring at a 31 degree vertical pitch. Trails such as Paulie's Folly and Hard Scrabble also have a high vertical pitch. The Mittersill area consists of some of New Hampshire's only sidecountry skiing. Many glades and mogul runs can be found here. One of the longest glades in the east is Kinsman Glade, on skier's right of the tramline. The Front Five trails are accessed via Paulie's Extension or Lower Cannon. Three of them, Avalanche, Paulie's Folly and Zoomer, are marked black. The other two, Rocket and Gary's, have less pitch and no bumps. From the summit, trails include Cannonball, Skylight or Upper Ravine.|$|E
2500|$|He {{entered the}} top {{division}} {{for the first}} time in September 1990, alongside Akebono [...] and Takatōriki. He first reached a san'yaku rank in November 1991 when he was promoted to komusubi. In January 1992 he defeated Asahifuji in what was to be the yokozunas last ever bout, to earn the second of his two kinboshi or gold stars. Lacking his brother's weight and strength, he took longer than Takanohana to rise up the ranks, still being a maegashira wrestler as late as January 1993, the tournament that Takanohana earned promotion to ōzeki. However in the following tournament he won his first top division championship or yūshō with a 14–1 record. After a 10–5 in May 1993 and runner-up honours in July, he joined his brother at ōzeki rank, the first time that two brothers had been ranked at ōzeki simultaneously. [...] His second tournament title came in November 1995, when he defeated Takanohana (by then a yokozuna) in a playoff. This was to be the only time he fought his brother in a competitive match. He was injured in the next tournament however, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> happened after his third championship in January 1997. On that occasion he missed two tournaments and only just preserved his ōzeki status with a bare majority of wins upon his return in July 1997. He was a tournament runner-up on five occasions at ōzeki rank, four of those coming in 1996. Due to the dominance of Futagoyama stable, he was excused from having to fight several top wrestlers such as Takanonami, Takatōriki and Akinoshima.|$|E
