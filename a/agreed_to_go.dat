5|$|In June 1944, Bradbury {{received}} {{orders from}} Parsons, {{who was now}} the Deputy Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury {{to work on the}} explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army had closed in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|Back in London, the Claimant {{employed}} a solicitor, John Holmes, who <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{with him to}} Paris to meet Lady Tichborne. This meeting took place on 11 January at the Hôtel de Lille. As soon as she saw his face, Lady Tichborne accepted him. At Holmes's behest she lodged with the British Embassy a signed declaration formally testifying that the Claimant was her son. She was unmoved when Father Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E

5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar {{was driving}} her {{daughter}} to school in Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police. On 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 {{detonation}} of Joe-1 by the Soviet Union prompted {{an all-out}} {{effort by the}} United States, led by Teller, to develop the more powerful hydrogen bomb in response. Henry D. Smyth, Wheeler's department head at Princeton, asked him to join the effort. Most physicists were, like Wheeler, trying to re-establish careers interrupted by the war and were reluctant to face more disruption. Others had moral objections. Those who agreed to participate included Emil Konopinski, Marshall Rosenbluth, Lothar Nordheim and Charles Critchfield, {{but there was also}} now a body of experienced weapons physicists at the Los Alamos Laboratory, led by Norris Bradbury. Wheeler <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Los Alamos after a conversation with Bohr. Two of his graduate students from Princeton, Ken Ford and John Toll, joined him there.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the Bourbon Restoration, Lafayette lent his support to a number of conspiracies in France and other European countries, all of which came to nothing. He was {{involved}} in the various Charbonnier plots, and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the city of Belfort, where there was a garrison of French troops, and assume a major role in the revolutionary government. Warned that the royal government had found out about the conspiracy, he turned back on the road to Belfort, avoiding overt involvement. More successfully, he supported the Greek Revolution beginning in 1821, and by letter attempted to persuade American officials to ally with the Greeks. Louis' government considered arresting both Lafayette and Georges Washington, who was also involved in the Greek efforts, but were wary of the political ramifications if they did. Lafayette remained a member of the restored Chamber of Deputies until 1823, when new plural voting rules helped defeat his bid for re-election.|$|E
5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they thought him too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} as Notts County manager in May 1957, controversially replacing caretaker-manager Frank Broome. Broome, who had steered the club {{away from being}} relegated from the Second Division, was installed as his assistant manager. He found it tedious in making new signings due to financial constraints {{on the part of}} the club. He did though take on forwards Jeff Astle and Tony Hateley as apprentices, who would both go on to have long careers in the First Division. Lawton <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> without his wages for six months so as to improve the club's finances. County were though relegated at the end of the 1957–58 season, finishing one point short of safety, and Lawton was sacked. He received a total of just three months pay for his time at the club, having only a verbal offer of a three-year contract to fall back on, and nothing in writing.|$|E

5|$|The revenue cutter Bear {{arrived in}} St Michael, Alaska, midway through June. Her master, Captain Cochran, <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Wrangel Island {{as soon as}} he got {{permission}} from the United States government. It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe. After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue. On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing. At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September. In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.|$|E
5|$|On 20 May 1221 Maulay {{was accused}} of treason by Richard Mucegros and Hubert de Burgh before the king. The {{specific}} crime was alleged to be a plot to hand over Eleanor of Brittany, then held at Corfe Castle, to King Louis IX of France. Maulay was imprisoned for a short time, but on 4 June was released after surrendering Corfe to the king. He was allowed to retain his sheriffdom. The accusation may have owed more {{to the fact that}} Maulay had recently taken Mucegros' lands into custody because Mucegros had failed to make a payment due for a royal fine. The event may also have been used by de Burgh as an opportunity to weaken Maulay's patron and de Burgh's rival for power, Peter des Roches, while des Roches was out of England. The loss of Corfe by one of des Roches' primary supporters would have weakened des Roches' standing and power. In July Peter des Roches returned to England and in late July was instrumental in the clearing of Maulay from the charges of treason. Maulay was not given back custody of Corfe, but on 29 July the royal government discharged the 7000 marks that Maulay still owed for his marriage fine. The stated reason for the release of this debt was to compensate Maulay for his expenses while controlling Corfe, but the real reason appears to have been to compensate for the loss of Corfe. In late 1221 Maulay <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on crusade with Peter des Roches and Falkes de Breauté, another of des Roches supporters. The loss of Damietta in September meant that the three men postponed their departure, and in November 1221 Maulay was replaced as sheriff. In return for Maulay's agreement to the ouster, the Exchequer wrote off more debts that Maulay owed the government, this time over 8800 marks. Maulay retired to his lands in Yorkshire.|$|E
