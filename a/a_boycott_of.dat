5|$|In April 2011, over 120 {{international}} artists urged <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> {{both the}} Louvre and Guggenheim museums over concerns regarding the abuse and exploitation of construction workers employed {{to develop the}} complex. In December 2013, The Guardian reported that conditions for the workers at the construction sites amount to modern-day slavery.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, Obama {{instructed}} {{agencies to}} consider LGBT rights when issuing {{financial aid to}} foreign countries. He criticized Russia's law discriminating against gays in August 2013, stopping short of advocating <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 2014 Winter Olympics held in Sochi, Russia.|$|E
5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the Games by {{a large part of}} the Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
50|$|Similar boycotts {{have been}} {{proposed}} outside the Arab world and the Muslim world. These boycotts comprise economic measures such as divestment; <b>a</b> consumer <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Israeli products or businesses that operate in Israel; <b>a</b> proposed academic <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Israeli universities and scholars; and <b>a</b> proposed <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Israeli cultural institutions or Israeli sport venues. Many advocates <b>of</b> the <b>Boycott,</b> Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu use the 1980s movement against South African apartheid as a model.|$|R
50|$|In September 2006, Bacik {{was one of}} the 61 Irish {{academic}} signatories of {{a letter}} published in The Irish Times calling for <b>an</b> academic <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the state of Israel.In January 2009 she declared that she wants Ireland to break off diplomatic relations with Israel and in February 2009 called for <b>a</b> general <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Israeli goods.|$|R
50|$|People {{called for}} <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> because <b>of</b> low quality and unsafe Chinese products.|$|R
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the election.|$|E
5|$|The year 1968 {{had seen}} {{turmoil in the}} United States, {{including}} riots and the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. Prior to the Olympics in Mexico City in October 1968, some African Americans, led by activist Harry Edwards, had urged <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the Games, but found little enthusiasm among athletes, reluctant to waste years of effort. The atmosphere was made more tense by unrest in Mexico City before the Games which left dozens dead.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China's human rights record, and in {{response}} to Tibetan disturbances. Ultimately, no nation supported a boycott. In August 2008, the government of Georgia called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in Sochi, Russia, in response to Russia's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war.|$|E

5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting {{against its}} refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed have issued threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} from athletics, Brundage became a sports administrator, rising rapidly {{through the ranks}} in United States sports groups. As leader of America's Olympic organizations, he fought zealously against <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the 1936 Summer Olympics, which had been awarded to Germany before the rise of its Nazi government and its subsequent, escalating persecution of Jews. Although Brundage was successful in getting a team to the Games in Berlin, its participation was controversial and has remained so. Brundage {{was elected to the}} IOC that year, and quickly became a major figure in the Olympic movement. He was elected IOC president in 1952.|$|E

5|$|In 1765, Parliament {{passed the}} Stamp Act which {{required}} colonists {{to pay a}} new tax on most printed materials. News of {{the passage of the}} Stamp Act produced an uproar in the colonies. The colonial response echoed Adams's 1764 instructions. In June 1765, Otis called for a Stamp Act Congress to coordinate colonial resistance. The Virginia House of Burgesses passed a widely reprinted set of resolves against the Stamp Act that resembled Adams's arguments against the Sugar Act. Adams argued that the Stamp Act was unconstitutional; he also believed that it would hurt the economy of the British Empire. He supported calls for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> British goods to put pressure on Parliament to repeal the tax.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|Mason slowly {{moved from}} being a {{peripheral}} figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable {{for the inclusion of}} his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow {{for one of the most}} common court actions, replevin, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.|$|E
50|$|In March 1997, Price Pfister {{moved more}} of its {{manufacturing}} operations from the Pacoima plant over to Mexicali, Mexico, laying off approximately 300 U.S. workers. Many of the former workers protested the layoffs outside the plant, and later called for <b>a</b> <b>boycotting</b> <b>of</b> Price Pfister while protesting a nearby Home Depot, a home improvement store that sold Price Pfister products.|$|R

5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a continuation of <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} club colours {{are green}} and white, {{which have been}} used since {{the formation of the}} club in 1875. The strip typically has a green body, white sleeves and a white collar. The shorts are normally white, although green has been used in recent seasons. The socks are green, usually with some white detail. Hibs have used yellow, purple, black, white and a dark green in recent seasons for their alternate kits. In 1977, Hibs became the first club in Scotland to bear sponsorship on their shirts. This arrangement prompted television companies to threaten <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Hibs games if they used the sponsored kit, which resulted in the club using an alternate kit for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were among}} the most ardent. In some {{municipalities}} the women organized themselves into women's sections and in others even in exclusively female Fasci. The strongest and most numerous presence of women was in the Fascio of Piana degli Albanesi, where over a thousand of the 3,500 members were women in a town of 9,000 inhabitants. For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, who had tried to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication. In Piana the women organised <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.|$|E

5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to the colonies were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in the colonies. The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E
5|$|Cohen had {{acquired}} reprint {{rights to the}} magazines' back issues, although Wrzos did get Cohen to agree to print one new story every issue. Cohen was also producing reprint magazines such as Great Science Fiction and Science Fiction Classics, but no payment was made to authors {{for any of these}} reprints. This brought Cohen into conflict with the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), a professional writers' organization formed in 1965. Soon SFWA called for <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Ultimate's magazines until Cohen agreed to make payments. Cohen agreed to pay a flat fee for all stories, and then in August 1967 this was changed to a graduated rate, depending on the length of the story. Harry Harrison had acted as an intermediary in Cohen's negotiations with SFWA, and when Wrzos left in 1967, Cohen asked Harrison to take over. SF Impulse, which Harrison had been editing, had folded in February 1967, so Harrison was available. He secured Cohen's agreement that the policy of printing almost nothing but reprinted stories would be phased out {{by the end of the}} year, and took over as editor with the September 1967 issue.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Lithuania and Germany {{maintained}} a relatively normal relationship {{as they were}} united by anti-Polish sentiment. In January 1928, after long and difficult negotiations, Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty, which left Klaipėda on the Lithuanian side. However, tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany. An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro-Nazi activists. In response to these arrests and trials, Germany declared <b>a</b> <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Lithuanian agricultural imports. The boycott caused an economic crisis in Suvalkija (southern Lithuania), where farmers organized violent protests. However, after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro-Nazi prisoners received amnesty. In {{the wake of the}} amnesties, Lithuanian prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda, allowing Germany to strengthen its influence in the region.|$|E
50|$|After the August March on Washington, Artists and Writers for Justice, a group {{including}} Ruby Dee, Louis Lomax, and James Baldwin, proposed <b>a</b> mass <b>boycott</b> <b>of</b> Christmas shopping.|$|R
