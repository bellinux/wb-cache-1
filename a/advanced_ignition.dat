50|$|For {{reciprocating}} engines, {{the point}} in the cycle at which the fuel-oxidizer mixture is ignited has a direct effect on the efficiency and output of the ICE. The thermodynamics of the idealized Carnot heat engine tells us that an ICE is most efficient if most of the burning takes place at a high temperature, resulting from compression — near top dead center. The speed of the flame front is directly affected by the compression ratio, fuel mixture temperature, and octane rating or cetane number of the fuel. Leaner mixtures and lower mixture pressures burn more slowly requiring more <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> timing. It is important to have combustion spread by a thermal flame front (deflagration), not by a shock wave. Combustion propagation by a shock wave is called detonation and, in engines, is also known as pinging or Engine knocking.|$|E

Demands for newer, more advanced forms of ignition, are increasing as individuals strive to meet regulations that seek to reduce the level of pollutants in the atmosphere, such as CHx, NOx, and SO 2. Many aviation gas turbine manufacturers are interested in increasing combustion efficiency in engines, all the while reducing the aforementioned pollutants.

40|$|Spark plugs {{have been}} igniting {{combustible}} mixtures like {{those found in}} automotive engines for over a century, and {{the principles of the}} associated ignition techniques using thermal plasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time. However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pressures (i. e. turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneously reducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated exhaust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides. This “downsizing” to increase fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges in both obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this operating paradigm. In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transient non-thermal plasma can exploit certain non-equilibrium chemistry and physics to bypass these challenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion. Applied and fundamental experimental investigations of two different <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> techniques are presented: 1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct- injection single cylinder research engine and 2) repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharges igniting methane/air mixtures in a constant volume chamber. The engine experimental results show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions under boosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flame development. The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questions about the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observed combustion enhancement. These results highlight the critical importance of electrode design in <b>advanced</b> <b>ignition</b> techniques—the shape and position of electrodes greatly influences the hydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges.

40|$|Air-cooled utility {{engines are}} often {{equipped}} with cams {{designed to ensure}} maximum charging efficiency, but the resulting valve lift and timing often correlates to poor engine performance at low speeds and light loads, which manifests itself in poor combustion stability and elevated pollutant emissions. The poor performance at low-speeds and lightloads {{can be attributed to}} the presence of high levels of exhaust gas residuals (EGR) trapped in the cylinder. In this project the combustion stability and pollutant emissions of an air-cooled utility engine were investigated at low speeds and light loads with high residual fractions. An incylinder sampling valve was used to measure the amount of residual fraction in the charge. Varying the cam phasing, opening and closing times of both cams, effected a change in the amount of residual gas retained. A Fast Flame Ionization Detector (FFID) was used to measure the cycle-resolved hydrocarbon emissions from the combustion process, and a standard five-gas analytical emissions bench measured steady-state emissions. In addition, spark timing and different fuel mixture preparation techniques were tested to investigate their influence on combustion progress. The different fuel preparation systems included a stock carburetor, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system, and a homogeneous mixing system (HMS). The residual fraction was found to be relatively insensitive to the fuel mixture preparation system, but was to a moderate degree sensitive to the ignition timing. The residual fraction was found to be strongly affected by the amount of valve overlap and engine speed. The measured residual fraction was compared to three models used for EGR prediction in order to quantify their applicability to utility engines. The three models used for comparative analysis include: Yun and Mirsky [16], Fox, Cheng and Heywood [12], and an ideal gas model. None of the three EGR models investigated was able to accurately predict the residual fraction over the entire range of conditions tested. Cylinder pressure-derived parameters were used to evaluate combustion performance parameters for cycle-to-cycle analysis of the investigated operating conditions. The CMLFI showed a slight improvement in performance relative to the other fuel preparation systems. <b>Advancing</b> <b>ignition</b> improved the cyclic variability of the tested conditions, with an exception at very light load operation at low speeds.
