Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E

25|$|The {{roots of}} Czech {{nationalism}} {{go back to}} the 19th century, when philologists and educators, influenced by Romanticism, promoted the Czech language <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the Czech people. Nationalism became a mass movement {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. Taking advantage of the limited opportunities for participation in political life under Austrian rule, Czech leaders such as historian František Palacký (1798–1876) founded many patriotic, self-help organizations which provided a chance for many of their compatriots to participate in communal life prior to independence. Palacký supported Austro-Slavism and worked for a reorganized and federal Austrian Empire, which would protect the Slavic speaking peoples of Central Europe against Russian and German threats.|$|E

25|$|Recognition is an {{important}} part of all Camp Fire programs. It helps children and adults build self-esteem <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> their accomplishments. Official national recognition items are one of the features that make Camp Fire unique and special. For their participation, growth and achievements, youth receive distinctive items such as beads, emblems, pins and certificates. At the early levels, Camp Fire leaders help youth choose activities and guide them in earning the recognition items. As teens, members select their own activities and develop their own action plans for earning recognition items. For adults, recognition items signify outstanding achievement or the number of years they have been adult Camp Fire USA members. Adults in programming or board positions are also recognized on the local level for their important roles in Camp Fire.|$|E
500|$|Thus, Khachaturian {{and other}} leading composers were denounced by the Communist Party as {{followers}} of the alleged formalism (i.e. [...] " [...] music that was considered too advanced or difficult for the masses to enjoy") and their music was dubbed [...] "anti-people". It was the Symphonic Poem (1947), later titled the Third Symphony, that officially earned Khachaturian {{the wrath of the}} Party. Ironically, he wrote the work as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. He stated: [...] "I wanted to write the kind of composition in which the public would feel my unwritten program without an announcement. I wanted this work to express the Soviet people's joy <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> their great and mighty country." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "other poems", which Poe {{admitted}} [...] "perhaps savour {{too much}} of egotism; but they were written by one {{too young to have}} any knowledge of the world but from his own breast". These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He steps away from the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E

It was launched in 1962 to overcome the drawbacks faced by the economy at large, with vanilla production being the economy's cornerstone at the time. In an effort to spark innovation and new growing techniques, emphasis was shifted to [...] "shade house cultivation", with less-intensive labour required (due to the controlled indoor climate), and reduction in chemicals necessary for outdoor farming.

500|$|Kvinneakt was {{designed}} and created by Norman J. Taylor, a Seattle-based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington, between 1973 and 1975. The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full-length nude woman measuring 71" [...] x 38" [...] x 25". Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition. The works were purchased through a budget of $250,000; Kvinneakt was commissioned {{at a cost of}} $6,500. Funding sources for the project included Tri-Met (20percent) and the United States Department of Transportation (80percent). Of the 11 sculptures, only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough's (née Conchuratt) Cat in Repose were considered [...] "figurative". Claiming his intention was not to be vulgar, Taylor said: [...] "It's about grace and motion and a certain beauty <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> the human figure. That may be sensual, but that's far different from sex." [...] According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, Taylor intended the piece to be [...] "confrontational"; he admitted, [...] "the worst reaction you could give my work is no reaction." ...|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{attempted}} {{to justify their}} respective military goals in both active and reactive ways. The Roman quest for world domination {{was accompanied by a}} sense of mission <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> Western civilization and by ambitions to become a guarantor of peace and order. Roman sources reveal long-standing prejudices with regard to the Eastern powers' customs, religious structures, languages, and forms of government. John F. Haldon underscores that [...] "although the conflicts between Persia and East Rome revolved around issues of strategic control around the eastern frontier, yet there was always a religious-ideological element present". From the time of Constantine on, Roman emperors appointed themselves as the protectors of Christians of Persia. This attitude created intense suspicions of the loyalties of Christians living in Sasanian Iran and often led to RomanPersian tensions or even military confrontations.* McDonough (2006), 73 A characteristic of the final phase of the conflict, when what had begun in 611612 as a raid was soon transformed into a war of conquest, was the pre-eminence of the Cross as a symbol of imperial victory and of the strongly religious element in the Roman imperial propaganda; Heraclius himself cast Khosrau as the enemy of God, and authors of the 6th and 7th centuries were fiercely hostile to Persia.|$|E

500|$|Historian Michael Diamond {{reports that}} for British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s, [...] "xenophobia <b>and</b> <b>pride</b> <b>in</b> empire" [...] were {{reflected}} in the halls' most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, even decades after his death, while Gladstone {{was used as a}} villain. [...] Film historian Roy Armes has argued that historical films helped maintain the political status quo in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s by imposing an establishment viewpoint that emphasized the greatness of monarchy, empire, and tradition. The films created [...] "a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo." [...] Steven Fielding has argued that Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: [...] "historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership." [...] Stage and screen actor George Arliss was known for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929's Disraeli. Fielding says Arliss [...] "personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience....Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.".|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] <b>and</b> <b>Pride</b> (<b>In</b> the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
