What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for <b>a</b> <b>spatial</b> motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle {{has been attributed to}} the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by Atlus and Lancarse for the Nintendo DS. It {{was released in}} Japan in 2009, and in North America in 2010. The game is the fourth entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series, which forms {{the core of the}} Megami Tensei franchise. The story follows a special task force sent by the United Nations to investigate the Schwarzwelt, <b>a</b> <b>spatial</b> distortion that appears in Antarctica and threatens to engulf the world. Players take control of an unnamed protagonist, navigating the environments of the Schwarzwelt in first-person. Combat involves the player and recruited demons fighting against various enemies, with the protagonist having the option of talking with and recruiting enemies.|$|E
