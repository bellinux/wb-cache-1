5|$|The Kylfings (Old Norse Kylfingar; Finnic Kylfingid; Hungarian Kölpények; Old East Slavic Колбяги, Kolbiagi; Byzantine Greek Κουλπίγγοι, Koulpingoi; Arabic al-Kilabiyya) were {{a people}} of {{uncertain}} origin active in Northern Europe during the Viking Age, roughly {{from the late}} ninth century to the early twelfth century. They {{could be found in}} areas of Lapland, Russia, and the Byzantine Empire that were frequented by Scandinavian traders, raiders and mercenaries. Scholars differ on whether the Kylfings were ethnically Finnic or Norse. Also disputed is their geographic origin, with Denmark, Sweden and the Eastern Baltic <b>all</b> <b>put</b> forward as candidates. Whether the name Kylfing denotes a particular tribal, socio-political, or economic grouping is also a matter of much debate.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{visit of}} the {{commander}} of the Panzerjagdverbände (tank-hunting detachment) of Army Group Vistula, Oberst Ernst-Wilhelm Freiherr Gedult von Jungenfeld, all of the Panzerjagdverbände were to be centralized under Strachwitz' command. In April the Panzerjagdeinheiten (tank-hunting units) of Army Group Centre were <b>all</b> <b>put</b> under his command, this included Panzerjagdverbände A, B and C (Wehrkreis VIII), the Heeres-Panzerjagdbrigaden 1 and 3, two Volkssturm-Panzerjagdbrigaden and the Panzerjäger-Brigade Niederschlesien (Lower Silesia) and Free Ukrainians. Strachwitz deployed his men in small combat groups, sometimes operating behind Allied lines, which lured Soviet tanks into traps and attacked them with Panzerfausts. Combat reached its peak in April 1945, and some of his men were credited with more than ten enemy tanks destroyed each. The German front line of Army Group Centre at the time was in mid-Silesia along the Zobten, and via Schweidnitz and Jauer to Lauban. The main Soviet thrust was towards Berlin and Dresden, threatening the German troops in Silesia with encirclement. Strachwitz and his men fought under the command of Schörner until the German capitulation on 8 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported the steps and flooring were <b>all</b> <b>put</b> in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{setbacks}} in the south, overall, the Qianlong Emperor's military expansion {{nearly doubled}} {{the area of}} the already vast Qing Empire, and brought into the fold many non-Han-Chinese peoples – such as Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, Evenks and Mongols – who were potentially hostile. It was also a very expensive enterprise; the funds in the Imperial Treasury were almost <b>all</b> <b>put</b> into military expeditions. Though the wars were successful, they were not overwhelmingly so. The Qing army declined noticeably and had a difficult time facing some enemies: the campaign against the Jinchuan hill peoples took 2–3 years – at first the Qing army were mauled, though Yue Zhongqi (a descendant of Yue Fei) later took control of the situation. The battle with the Dzungars was closely fought, and caused heavy losses on both sides.|$|E

25|$|On August 15, 2004, Benoit was {{defeated}} by Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam. Benoit then teamed with William Regal at Unforgiven against Ric Flair and Batista in a winning effort. Benoit then feuded with Edge (who had turned into an arrogant and conceited heel), leading to Taboo Tuesday where Benoit, Edge, and Shawn Michaels were <b>all</b> <b>put</b> into a poll to see who would face Triple H for the World Heavyweight title that night. Michaels received the most votes and as a result, Edge and Benoit were forced to team up to face the then tag team champions, La Résistance, in the same night. However, Edge deserted Benoit during the match and Benoit was forced to take on both members of La Résistance by himself. He still managed to win the World Tag Team title. At Survivor Series, Benoit sided with Randy Orton's team while Edge teamed with Triple H's team, and while Edge was able to pin Benoit after a Pedigree, Orton's team won.|$|E
25|$|Dexter won the toss {{and decided}} to bat first. Following a slow start by Sheppard and Cowdrey, the run rate {{accelerated}} in the afternoon via a second wicket partnership of 248 between Cowdrey and Dexter. Cowdrey made his highest Test score of 182 in this innings and Dexter score 172. Barrington, who had surprisingly scored few runs in the series so far, made an unbeaten half-century. England declared at 480 for five and Pakistan again struggled against pace and seam. Imtiaz, Mushtaq and Hanif all scored 40-plus but then got out. Dexter wisely {{decided to use the}} giant Larter in short bursts and he claimed nine wickets in his debut Test (just as Coldwell had done in his debut at Lord's). Pakistan were all out in their first innings for only 183 and, on Saturday morning, were asked to follow on. Imtiaz played a fine innings on Saturday but, sadly, was out only two short of a century. Mushtaq, Burki and Mathias <b>all</b> <b>put</b> up resistance but Pakistan were 289 for six at the close and, after Mathias was run out in the first over on Monday, the end soon came. England won by an innings with well over a day to spare.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} ever NBL game on 6 March 2010, at Stadium Southland, the Sharks faced the Hawke's Bay Hawks {{in front of}} 1,500 fans. Their {{starters}} Martin Iti, James Paringatai, René Rougeau, Mike Rose and Daniel Munday <b>all</b> <b>put</b> up strong performances, with Munday scoring the team's first basket. After 40 minutes, the teams could not be separated, with the scores locked at 84-all. With an overtime period needed, the Hawks came out victorious, winning 105–90. After losing their next game 96–82 away from home to the Harbour Heat at the North Shore Events Centre, the Sharks took revenge against first-up opponents, Hawke's Bay, to achieve their first ever win. After their first win, they were bought back down to earth as they were thrashed by 44 points by the Wellington Saints. After seven games, Mike Helms replaced Rose as the Sharks' second import. The Sharks left themselves {{in a good position}} to reach the playoffs {{for the first time in}} their first season as they only needed to win two of four away games to end the season. Their away trip began with the Sharks losing in overtime to the second-placed Waikato Pistons at Hamilton Boys' High School. They then came one win closer to the playoffs with a win against the Taranaki Mountainairs. A loss to the Nelson Giants saw the Sharks needing to beat the lowly Manawatu Jets in their regular season finale. With a 96–88 win over the Jets, the Sharks claimed sixth spot and booked themselves a playoff berth. They went on to lose in their quarter-final match-up to the Nelson Giants, 82–67, ending their inaugural season in the NBL. Centre Martin Iti earned Rookie of the Year honours, while import swingman René Rougeau was named to the All-Star Five.|$|E

25|$|King Robert II died at Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire on 19 April 1390 and the chronicler Wyntoun informs that Robert was not {{buried at}} Scone until 13 August 1390, {{only a day}} before his son John, Earl of Carrick was crowned King as Robert III. Fife was {{retained}} as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan's hopes as he must have looked at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife's actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps {{the result of a}} combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England's court. In addition, Bishop Bur's involvement with Buchan's estrangement with his wife and then Bur's alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were <b>all</b> <b>put</b> to flame. Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews.|$|E
