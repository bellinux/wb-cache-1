500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> when he writes for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E
2500|$|The biosynthetic {{pathway to}} {{paclitaxel}} {{has been investigated}} and consists of approximately 20 enzymatic steps. The complete scheme is still unavailable. The segments that are known {{are very different from}} the synthetic pathways tried thus far (Scheme 1). The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 [...] which is a dimer of geraniol 1. [...] This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More ring closing through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4.

5000|$|Gagne {{joined the}} National Football League (NFL) soon after being {{drafted by the}} Chicago Bears in the 16th round (145th pick) of the 1947 NFL Draft. [...] Bears owner George Halas {{prevented}} Gagne from pursuing both football and wrestling (likely due to former Bears Football Hall of Fame great Bronko Nagurski having moonlighted as a professional wrestler {{during the height of}} his NFL career), and forced Gagne to make a choice. In a 2006 interview for WWE, Gagne's son Greg mentioned that wrestling was <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> paying <b>job</b> at the time than playing football (as recently as the 1970s, it was not uncommon for NFL players to have a second job during the NFL offseason to help make ends meet), and as a result, Verne chose wrestling over football.|$|R
25|$|In 1958, <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> paying <b>job</b> enticed Wood {{to leave}} West Texas {{for the first}} time as a head coach. He landed in Victoria, Texas where he reunited with Assistant Coach Morris Southall. That year, Wood also hired Kenneth West as an {{assistant}} coach. West had played for Wood at Stamford in 1951. The two grew to be longtime friends and coached together for twenty years. Their first season at Victoria, Wood, Southall, and West shocked many Victoria fans and brought the team a 6-4 winning season. Then Coach Wood brought Victoria another winning season in 1959 with six wins, three losses, and one tie. Wood was getting paid well in Victoria, making about $10,000, but a lack of fan support and homesickness for West Texas convinced him to move back west. He left Victoria with twelve wins, seven losses, and one tie.|$|R
40|$|There is {{virtually}} universal {{agreement in the}} scientific community that religion does not meet the requirements of science and that its contents can consequently be largely ignored. Yet what exactly is wrong with religion from a scientific point of view and why is religion still so widely spread around the globe? This article, which is strongly influenced by Harris 2005, identifies three items - widespread ignorance of the empirical (2. 1), rational (2. 2), and fallibilist attitude (2. 3) - as religion's primary epistemological or methodological faults. It is then attempted to show that philosophy and science, due to adhering to this "Holy Trinity of Science," do <b>an</b> equal or <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> than religion at satisfying five deep-seated and knowledge-related human needs - the meaning of life (3. 1), the origin of morals and ethics (3. 2), stopping the infinite regress (3. 3), comfort and security (3. 4), spirituality (3. 5) - for whose satisfaction many people still (incorrectly) turn to religion. The article concludes with an attempt to reconcile science and religion by adopting a decidedly nonphysicalist position, by making a near death experience based case for the natural immortality of the soul/consciousness, and by generally putting spirituality on a scientific and epistemologically sound footing...|$|R
2500|$|Chrysler's {{intention}} was to create an individual line of luxury cars, distinct from Chrysler branded vehicles. [...] This marketing strategy suffered because the cars were rarely (if ever) sold in stand-alone Imperial showrooms. [...] Cadillac and Lincoln did <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of separating their luxury marques from the lower priced cars that they sold.

6000|$|But an {{experiment}} {{conducted by a}} handful of people, who, after thirty years of immunity from the unintentional child slaughter that goes on by ignorant parents in private homes, numbered only 300, could do very little except prove that Communists, under the guidance of a Superman [...] "devoted exclusively to the establishment of the Kingdom of God," [...] and caring no more for property and marriage than a Camberwell minister cares for Hindoo Caste or Suttee, might make <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> of their lives than ordinary folk under the harrow of both these institutions. Yet their Superman himself admitted that this apparent success was only part of the abnormal phenomenon of his own occurrence; for {{when he came to the}} end of his powers through age, he himself guided and organized the voluntary relapse of the communists into marriage, capitalism, and customary private life, thus admitting that the real social solution was not what a casual Superman could persuade a picked company to do for him, but what a whole community of Supermen would do spontaneously. If Noyes had had to organize, not a few dozen Perfectionists, but the whole United States, America would have beaten him as completely as England beat Oliver Cromwell, France Napoleon, or Rome Julius Cæsar. Cromwell learnt by bitter experience that God himself cannot raise a people above its own level, and that even though you stir a nation to sacrifice all its appetites to its conscience, the result will still depend wholly on what sort of conscience the nation has got. Napoleon seems to have ended by regarding mankind as a troublesome pack of hounds only worth keeping for the sport of hunting with them. Cæsar's capacity for fighting without hatred or resentment was defeated by the determination of his soldiers to kill their enemies in the field instead of taking them prisoners to be spared by Cæsar; and his civil supremacy was purchased by colossal bribery of the citizens of Rome. What great rulers cannot do, codes and religions cannot do. Man reads his own nature into every ordinance: if you devise a superhuman commandment so cunningly that it cannot be misinterpreted in terms of his will, he will denounce it as seditious blasphemy, or else disregard it as either crazy or totally unintelligible. Parliaments and synods may tinker as much as they please with their codes and creeds as circumstances alter the balance of classes and their interests; and, as a result of the tinkering, there may be an occasional illusion of moral evolution, as when the victory of the commercial caste over the military caste leads to the substitution of social boycotting and pecuniary damages for duelling. At certain moments there may even be a considerable material advance, as when the conquest of political power by the working class produces a better distribution of wealth through the simple action of the selfishness of the new masters; but all this is mere readjustment and reformation: until the heart and mind of the people is changed the very greatest man will no more dare to govern on the assumption that all are as great as he than a drover dare leave his flock to find its way through the streets as he himself would. Until there is an England in which every man is a Cromwell, a France in which every man is a Napoleon, a Rome in which every man is a Cæsar, a Germany in which every man is a Luther plus a Goethe, the world will be no more improved by its heroes than a Brixton villa is improved by the pyramid of Cheops. The production of such nations is the only real change possible to us.|$|E
