5000|$|With {{the absence}} of any sign of forced entry or struggle, {{investigators}} theorized that Jennifer left her condo for work on the morning of January 24, locked the door, and was abducted at some point of the walk to her car or as she was getting into it. Two days later, on January 26, 2006, around 8:10 a.m., Jennifer's car, a black 2004 Chevy Malibu, was found parked at a condo complex approximately a mile away from her residence. Investigators were initially excited to learn that the complex had several hidden surveillance cameras installed and were viewing the place where her car was parked, as well as the exit. The surveillance video shows an unidentified [...] "person of interest" [...] dropping the vehicle off at approximately noon the day that Jennifer went missing. Family and friends of Kesse did not recognize the individual, whose physical features were not made clear on the video. Investigators were disheartened when they realized that the best video captures of the subject was obscured by the complex fencing in three separate snapshots, concealing their face. One journalist called the suspect, [...] "The luckiest person of interest ever". The FBI was called in to help determine the person's size and gender, but could only say the person was someone who was about 5'3" [...] to 5'5". NASA also assisted in the investigation by enhancing the video to help in identifying the suspect. Investigators interpreted that the valuables left inside the vehicle implied that robbery was not a motive in Jennifer's disappearance. A search dog tracked a scent from the car back to her apartment complex, leading investigators to believe that the suspect returned to her apartment parking lot after leaving the car. No other evidence was found along the route. After forensic examination of her car, only two pieces of evidence were found, a latent print and a small DNA fiber. Investigators believed the car was wiped down. The items known to be missing are her cell phone, iPod, keys, purse, briefcase, and the outfit she was wearing. Investigators could not ping her cellphone as it remained turned off and her banking <b>account</b> <b>card</b> was never used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Last {{year the}} number of users who used basic voice call over IP {{networks}} considerably increased. Voice over IP (VoIP) network must provide intelligent services such as Free Phone (FP), <b>Account</b> <b>Card</b> Calling (ACC) and others. It is needed to evaluate {{the influence of the}} new intelligent services on performance of SIP proxy server. Each intelligent service has own interaction between the intelligent network nodes and SIP proxy server. The analytical model of SIP proxy server which operates like soft SSP node was proposed in the paper. Development of analytical SIP proxy server model was based on Jackson's theorem. The calculation of the influence of services FP on SIP proxy server of the given network was carried out by using the proposed model...|$|E

40|$|Finance and Economics {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} elements in the development of nations. Dealing with finances and economies banking industry is the solely dominating industry especially during the 20 th century. Along with the development of banking industry, information technology was also emerged and started collaboration with this sector. Moreover, banks shifted all their operations over the network; furthermore, networks and telecommunications were enhanced more. They started offering banking services to its clients by using cloud computing (virtualization). After the introduction of Euro by the EU, a project came into existence called Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA). SEPA is an EU project which is an initiative towards the integration and uniform way of payments and bank transfers within the EU region. Our research project is a part of providing web services to clients in a Secure SEPA banking system. Our research focuses on developing SEPA banking web services for clients. We have developed infrastructure for SEPA banking services. Web clients are going to access the main portal by registering themselves. After registration, a client will create bank account. Bank account will have basic credentials of the client including account number and PIN number. Furthermore, account number and PIN number can be used to check account balance; client can perform transactions and convert the respective currency into Euros. All financial transactions should be dealt in Euros; this is one of the main purposes of our SEPA research project. In the second part of our research, some activities have been performed with Point of Interactin(POI) devices. POI device is communicating with the banking system through wireless or GPRS protocols; client will use SEPA smart card. Smart card will be swapped in the POI device; device will detect the smart card data and will interact with the SEPA system. Smart card data contain client’s credentials, such as amount in the bank account, 16 digit card number, and cash in, cash out in the <b>account,</b> <b>card</b> expiry date etc. The final portion, detecting the smart card data, is left for future work...|$|E
