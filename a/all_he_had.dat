5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) to win the title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was given an opportunity to earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to do was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed to win the match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, who attacked him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline him for a few weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E

5|$|He had {{restored}} American {{credit and}} assumed state debt; created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a customs service, and a diplomatic corps; introduced the first accounting, tax, and budgetary procedures; maintained peace {{at home and}} abroad; inaugurated a navy, bolstered the army, and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure; proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties; protected frontier settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to {{the letter of the}} Constitution... Most of <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> shown a disbelieving world that republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule.|$|E
5|$|In the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth, Davidson took 4/44 {{and then}} 5/38 {{in the second}} innings as he and Benaud took all ten wickets and South Africa were skittled for 144. Australia won by eight wickets and took the series 3–0. It was his best Test match haul to date. He scored 127runs at 21.17 and took 25 wickets at 17.0 in the Tests. He had success against Russell Endean and John Waite, dismissing both twice. Although {{he was unable to}} score heavily in the Tests, Davidson scored four of his nine first class centuries during the tour. In <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> taken 72 wickets at 15.13 and scored 813runs at 54.20 for the entire tour. From this tour onwards, in 32 Tests, he was to take 170 wickets at 19.26 and score 1011runs at 27.32 in the {{remainder}} of his career.|$|E
5|$|Maynard Solomon summarises the Italian {{journeys}} {{as a great}} triumph, but {{suggests that}} from Leopold's standpoint they also incorporated a great failure. The Mozarts had certainly profited financially, and Wolfgang had developed artistically, into a recognised composer. Although the Mozarts' reception had not been uniformly cordial—they had been cold-shouldered by the Neapolitan court and the Prince of Thurn and Taxis had snubbed them—the Italians had generally responded with enthusiasm. Wolfgang had been received and knighted by the Pope; he had been granted membership in leading philharmonic societies and had studied with Italy's greatest music scholar, Giovanni Martini. Above <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been accepted as a practitioner of Italian opera by a leading opera house, completing three commissions that resulted in acclaimed performances. Other compositions resulted from the Italian experience, including a full-scale oratorio, several symphonies, string quartets, and numerous minor works.|$|E

5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to say about the present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|In the 1901 census, Dummer was {{described}} as a Railway Signal Linerman living at Battersea, London, with Hannah and their two youngest children.

25|$|During the Genting project, Lim spent <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> without earning any income. He sold an 810-hectare rubber {{estate to}} raise RM2.5 million. In addition, he {{invested}} {{all the money}} he had made from iron mining, sub-contracting and hardware businesses. The project was a heavy drain on Lim's finances. When asked to invest in this project, Lim's friends turned him down and counselled him to drop the entire scheme instead.|$|E
25|$|Carlo Manché left no belongings, {{except his}} bed, his {{mattress}} and pillows, some books, {{one pair of}} torn shoes and a watch. “As <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> he distributed to the poor or {{for the needs of}} the parish.

25|$|Like most R {{artists of}} his time, Cooke focused on singles; in <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> 29 top 40 hits on the pop charts {{and more on}} the R charts. He was a {{prolific}} songwriter and wrote most of the songs he recorded. He also had a hand in overseeing some of the song arrangements. In spite of releasing mostly singles, he released a well-received blues-inflected LP in 1963, Night Beat, and his most critically acclaimed studio album, Ain't That Good News, which featured five singles, in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 2012, a DNA test {{conducted}} on Monmouth's descendant, the 10th Duke of Buccleuch, {{showed that he}} shared the same Y chromosome (inherited from father-to-son) as a distant Stuart cousin, providing strong evidence that Charles II was Monmouth's biological father after <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> a younger sister Mary Crofts, who {{may also have been}} a daughter of Charles although Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of Carlingford is considered another potential father. Mary married the Irishman William Sarsfield and was a sister-in-law of the Jacobite general Patrick Sarsfield.|$|E
25|$|Allison would mathematically {{clinch the}} {{championship}} if he finished sixth or better, {{regardless of the}} other five drivers' performances. If Allison were to lead a single lap during the race, <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to do was finish 7th or better; if he had led the most laps, he needed only to finish 8th or better. Numerous other championship scenarios generally favored Allison, provided he finished ahead of his competitors, and led a lap during the race. Allison led second-place Alan Kulwicki by 30 points and Bill Elliott by 40.|$|E

25|$|A few {{shows were}} {{cancelled}} initially as vocalist Gary Lightbody's voice had worn out. He had been advised by his doctor {{to take a}} week's rest before the tour as he had developed laryngitis (polyps on vocal cords), but he preferred not to because of the pre-booked tour. Tests later showed that Lightbody's voice had not healed at <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost his top range, and the band was forced to cancel all remaining shows. The initially cancelled shows were re-scheduled {{to the end of}} the tour. Lightbody credited the band's agent and managers for their quick work.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon {{remained}} in Paris till 1610. These ten years were the brightest period of his life. He had attained {{the reputation of}} being, after Scaliger, the most learned man of the age, in an age in which learning formed the sole standard of literary merit. He had money, the ability to worship as a Huguenot (though he had to travel to Hablon or Charenton to worship), and the society of men of letters, both domestic and foreign. Above <b>all,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ample facilities for using Greek books, both printed and in manuscript, the want {{of which he had}} felt painfully at Geneva and Montpellier, and which only Paris could supply at that time.|$|E
