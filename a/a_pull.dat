5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the leg side with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> for four from Charlie Barnett. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes cut Jim Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Ernest Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit {{the ball into the}} ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point {{on the other side of}} the field, before ruling the batsman out. Keith Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fourth Test, Bradman scored 62, before being bowled {{attempting}} <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> shot to a ball that kept low, as Australia compiled 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings. Bradman rested {{himself in the}} next match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. He then scored 31 and 13 not out, bowled by Eric Hollies as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets. Hollies's 8/107 was the best innings bowling figures against the Australians for the summer and earned him selection for the Fifth Test, where he famously dismissed Bradman in his final Test innings for a duck. Australia proceeded to face and draw with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Bradman made 28 after being dropped twice in Australia's 321, before taking two catches as the tourists took a 191-run lead. He then came in at 1/16 and put on 161 for the second wicket with Barnes, and was unbeaten on 133 when he declared at 3/265. The home side hung on for a draw at 7/199 when time ran out. Bradman then rested himself during the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that was washed out after the first day.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, {{struggling}} against the local spinners, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey {{played a key role}} in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire in Bradford, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6, stand-in captain Lindsay Hassett—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> shot and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary. Colin McCool was out at 6/31 before Harvey and wicket-keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of Frank Smailes and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a six over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 not out.|$|E

25|$|The most usual leg {{movement}} {{with the front}} crawl is called the flutter kick. The legs move alternately, with one leg kicking downward while the other leg moves upward.

25|$|Regarding {{production}} planning, {{there is}} a basic distinction between the push approach and the pull approach, with the later including the singular approach of just in time. Pull means that the production system authorizes production based on inventory level; push means that production occurs based on demand (forecasted or present, that is purchase orders). An individual production system can be both push and pull; for example activities before the CODP may work under <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> system, while activities after the CODP may work under a push system.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as open drain or push–pull. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|E
25|$|Day 4 saw a {{much more}} {{determined}} approach from the South Africans, aided by a very flat wicket offering little to the bowlers. Smith and McKenzie batted slowly and cautiously, particularly during the morning where the scoring rate was around 1 run per over. Slowly, but surely, they built a partnership and started to chip away at England's lead, whilst frustrating the bowlers in the process. Both men would record a century, and the only wicket to fall in the day was Smith who top edged <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> shot from the new ball off James Anderson's bowling shortly after reaching his 100.|$|E

25|$|Australia fielded an {{unchanged}} line-up {{from the}} first Test, while England brought in Stokes (on debut) and Panesar for Trott and Tremlett. Australia once again won the toss and batted first. They started well, reaching 1/155, but England removed Watson (51) and Rogers (72) in quick succession. Bailey scored an enterprising 53 before being caught off <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> shot. As in the first Test, Australia scored 273 runs on the first day, this time {{for the loss of}} five wickets, with Clarke on 48 and Haddin on 7– both having survived dropped catches in the day.|$|E
25|$|Kevin Pietersen {{then joined}} Ian Bell at the crease {{and the two}} batted for {{nearly all of the}} middle session, for a {{partnership}} of 108 including 70 from Bell. Shortly after tea, with England on 2/166, McGrath took Pietersen's wicket for 41 when he top-edged <b>a</b> <b>pull</b> for a Michael Hussey catch. After Paul Collingwood came to bat, Bell only lasted one more run before McGrath clean bowled him in his next over, leaving England at 4/167. Collingwood (25*) and Flintoff (42*) then steadied matters until bad light forced an early end to the day's affairs.|$|E
25|$|Signals are {{combinations}} of pulls and bells, <b>A</b> <b>pull</b> {{is a relatively}} long steady tension on the line. Bells are always given in pairs, or pairs followed by the remaining odd bell. They are short tugs, and a pair is separated by a short interval, with a longer interval to the next pair or the single bell. The technique and nomenclature derive from the customary sounding of the ships bell every half-hour during the watches, which is also performed in pairs, with the odd bell last. One bell is not used as a diving signal as {{it is difficult to}} distinguish it from a jerk caused by temporarily snagging the line.|$|E
