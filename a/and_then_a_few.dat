5|$|Deady {{originally}} was {{to travel with}} a government designated Indian agent and the agent's family. At Fort Leavenworth the agent remained, and Deady continued his journey {{in the company of}} a United States Army regiment bound for Fort Vancouver. Taking the Oregon Trail, he arrived where Portland, Oregon, now stands on November 14, 1849. The next day he went to neighboring Oregon City, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later west to Lafayette, Oregon. At that city, the county seat of Yamhill County at that time, the red-haired Deady began teaching as his occupation to make ends meet. He first worked for room and board, but for the second term of the school year he was paid $75 per month.|$|E

In September 2002, Layfield suffered a torn left biceps at a house show. He was out of action for six months until returning to Ohio Valley Wrestling <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later to the active WWE roster.|$|E
25|$|Lord Clifden's {{first race}} was on 4 June 1862 in the Woodcote Stakes over {{three-quarters of a}} mile at Epsom Downs. He was ridden by George Fordham and started as the 6/4 favourite. Despite getting a bad start, he took the lead as the field entered {{straight}} and won easily by a length {{and a half from}} The Orphan. After the Woodcote Stakes Lord Clifden was purchased by Captain Christie for £4,000 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later by Carnegie Robert John Jervis, 3rd Viscount St Vincent, for 5,000 guineas.|$|E

25|$|In the 1886 {{published}} Hobson-Jobson, Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell {{mention the}} practice of Suttee (sati) as an early custom of Russians near Volga, tribes of Thracians in southeast Europe, and some tribes of Tonga and Fiji islands. Yule and Burnell also compiled a few dozen excerpts of historical descriptions of sati, the first being of Ceteus (or Keteus) mentioned above in 317 BC, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> before the 9th century AD, where the widow of a king had the choice to burn with him or abstain. Most of the compiled list on sati, by Yule and Burnell, date from 1200 AD through the 1870s AD.|$|E
25|$|To {{gain some}} respect, {{in the fall}} of 1888, it was decided that the 1889 Cornell crew would switch from a four-oared varsity crew to an eight-oared varsity crew. Courtney was {{hindered}} by a lack of equipment. He had to coach from the bank of the lake since Cornell did not have a launch. The practice shell was weak and in poor condition, and the team did not receive their eight-man shells until they arrived in New London for the first race. Courtney's Cornell crew easily beat Pennsylvania and Columbia University at New London, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later broke the world record for an eight-oared 1½-mile race versus Pennsylvania at the Schuylkill in Philadelphia. These victories created great enthusiasm for the rowing program at Cornell.|$|E
500|$|On 31 October 2017 UKTV bosses {{announced}} {{they were no}} longer showing early episodes first claiming [...] "viewer demand" [...] was asking them to move to series 14 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later stating it was [...] "very low viewing figures". The decision to jump straight to 1998 caused an angry backlash from viewers and fans on Twitter and Digital Spy who were promised that every episode would be shown.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, in {{collaboration}} with dynamicist Harold Levison, Stern wrote, [...] "we define an überplanet as a planetary body in orbit around a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an unterplanet as one {{that has not been}} able to do so," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> paragraphs later, [...] "our Solar System clearly contains 8 überplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres." [...] While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: [...] "I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as you can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{group was}} reassigned to 13th Air Force at Clark Field in the Philippines in late December 1945.

Most of the group's {{aircraft}} were moved to Floridablanca Airfield in 1946, where {{they were used to}} equip the 18th Fighter Group. [...] The 414th was inactivated at the end of September.|$|E
2500|$|Almost {{before they}} knew what was happening, men began to fall victim to scurvy; {{and within a few}} days after the Coronet reached Portland on October 21, 1911, scurvy had claimed the lives of six crew members. [...] Sandford was first arrested on Florence Whittaker's warrant <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later, for being {{responsible}} for the deaths—"unlawfully, knowingly, and willingly" [...] allowing a ship to [...] "proceed on a voyage at sea without sufficient provisions." ...|$|E

2500|$|While secrecy was a {{key feature}} of the success in {{securing}} the route, historians feel {{it is likely that}} Rogers had planned to finance the new railroad with sale of bonds to the public once the route had been secured, the two roads combined, and the name changed. However, these plans had suffered some setbacks in the [...] "Financial Panic" [...] which began in March 1907. An initial offering of Virginian Railway bonds was poorly received by the financial community. Rogers was quite concerned about the situation, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months later that same year, he experienced a debilitating stroke. Work on the new railroad was at a virtual standstill throughout much of 1908. His published correspondence with his close friend Mark Twain alludes to the personal stress which resulted from the [...] "great railroad enterprise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Language {{conveys the}} {{importance}} of religion throughout the play. Henry's language often echoes the Bible. For example, hearing of the Cade rebellion, he comments [...] "Ο graceless men, they know not what they do" [...] (4.4.37), echoing the Gospel of Luke: [...] "Father, forgive them: for they know not what they do" [...] (23:34). Earlier in the play, he refers to heaven as [...] "the treasury of everlasting joy" [...] (2.1.18), recalling the Gospel of Matthew's [...] "lay up treasures for yourselves in heaven" [...] (6:20), <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> lines later he muses [...] "blessèd [...] are the peacemakers on earth" [...] (2.1.34), echoing Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. On both of these occasions however, Cardinal Winchester, ostensibly a pious man, distorts Henry's genuine piety. After Henry's assessment of heaven, Winchester says to Gloucester, [...] "Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts/Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart" [...] (2.1.19–20). Then, after Henry praises peacemakers, Winchester hypocritically says, [...] "Let me be blessèd [...] for the peace I make,/Against this proud Protector with my sword" [...] (2.1.35–36). The Cardinal mocks religion shortly before the murder of Gloucester. Speaking of the forthcoming murder, Suffolk says, [...] "And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,/Say but the word and I will be his priest" [...] (3.1.271–272), to which Winchester responds [...] "But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,/Ere you can take due orders for a priest" [...] (3.1.273–274), disdaining priesthood and trivialising murder. After Gloucester is dead, Winchester continues to blaspheme himself, proclaiming the death of Gloucester to be [...] "God's secret judgement" [...] (3.2.31), a callous and knowing distortion.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{exit from}} the US, Rajneesh {{returned}} to India, landing in Delhi on 17 November 1985. He was given a hero's welcome by his Indian disciples and denounced the United States, saying the world must [...] "put the monster America in its place" [...] and that [...] "Either America must be hushed up or America will {{be the end of}} the world." [...] He then stayed for six weeks in Himachal Pradesh. When non-Indians in his party had their visas revoked, he moved on to Kathmandu, Nepal, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later, to Crete. Arrested after a few days by the Greek National Intelligence Service (KYP), he flew to Geneva, then to Stockholm and to Heathrow, but was in each case refused entry. Next Canada refused landing permission, so his plane returned to Shannon airport, Ireland, to refuel. There he was allowed to stay for two weeks, at a hotel in Limerick, on condition that he did not go out or give talks. He had been granted a Uruguayan identity card, one-year provisional residency and a possibility of permanent residency, so the party set out, stopping at Madrid, where the plane was surrounded by the Guardia Civil. He was allowed to spend one night at Dakar, then continued to Recife and Montevideo. In Uruguay, the group moved to a house at Punta del Este where Rajneesh began speaking publicly until 19 June, after which he was [...] "invited to leave" [...] for no official reason. A two-week visa was arranged for Jamaica but on arrival in Kingston police gave the group 12 hours to leave. Refuelling in Gander and in Madrid, Rajneesh returned to Bombay, India, on 30 July 1986.|$|E
