Eagle Boys announced that trade would continue <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> at franchisee-operated outlets during the administration, and franchisees were told their fees were due <b>as</b> <b>normal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even in finite dimensions, the {{concepts}} of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> vectors to a hyperplane supporting a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty {{require the use of}} infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or stochastic processes.|$|E

5|$|Yūko later rebuilds Syaoran's and Sakura's bodies {{using the}} {{remnants}} left after their apparent deaths. As neither could properly die, Yūko grants their wishes to be reborn <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> humans, which Syaoran accepts because Sakura tells him {{she wants to}} stay with him. As both grow up <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> humans, they meet and live together. He and Sakura have a son, who is the original Syaoran, creating a time paradox. Because they realize that all the previous events would be repeated and their son {{would not be able}} to save the , they seal themselves inside a glass tube hidden in Yūko's shop. Being reborn as a descendant of the sorcerer , Syaoran and Sakura break free from the tube and use their new powers to help their friends defeat Fei-Wang. As their creator dies, Syaoran and Sakura vanish, leaving two feathers that merge within their original selves' bodies.|$|E
5|$|A thick-line {{version of}} the map, {{released}} as part of Metro's Rush Plus plan, showed the Silver Line spurring off the Orange Line between the Ballston and East Falls Church stations in a northwesterly direction, with five unlabeled stops (the Phase I stations). The final map released for the Silver Line's Phase I opening features the stations shared by the three lines <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> stations, with the dots signifying stations located on the colored line {{in the center and}} small white stubs extending from the center dots into the adjoining colored lines.|$|E

As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, Lundgren had {{relationships}} with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella {{so much that}} they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred in}} the Virginia Seismic Zone, located in the Piedmont region. The Virginia Piedmont area was formed originally {{as part of a}} zone of repeated continental collisions that created the ancestral Appalachian Mountains, a process that started during the Ordovician period with the Taconic orogeny and finished during the Carboniferous Period with the Alleghanian orogeny. The reverse faults formed during the various orogenies were partly reactivated <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> faults in extension during the Mesozoic Era as the supercontinent Pangaea broke apart. During the Cenozoic Era, compression from the opening and spreading of the Atlantic has caused some of these structures to be reactivated in a reverse sense.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen <b>as</b> <b>normal,</b> even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{moderately}} hard, paramagnetic, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it lies {{to the right}} of actinium, to the left of protactinium, and below cerium. Pure thorium is very ductile and, <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> for metals, can be cold-rolled, swaged, and drawn. At room temperature, thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure; it has two other forms at exotic conditions, one at high temperature (over 1360°C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100GPa; body-centred tetragonal).|$|E

5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued <b>as</b> <b>normal,</b> but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E
5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on <b>as</b> <b>normal.</b> When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains <b>as</b> <b>normal,</b> but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E
