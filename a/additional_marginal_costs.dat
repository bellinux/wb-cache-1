40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative analysis of launch and Earth departure strategies for human Mars missions. A variety of Earth departure architectures are analyzed {{with regard to}} their trans-Mars injection capabilities (performance surrogate metric) and equipment and operational requirements (cost surrogate metric); it is assumed that aerocapture and chemical propulsion are used for all maneuvers in Mars vicinity for all architectures. The architectures are based on chemical propulsion (custom stages or Ares V Earth Departure Stage) as well as nuclear thermal propulsion. Consideration is also given to the impact of different Earth departure options on Mars aerocapture and Mars entry, descent and landing. The comparative aspect of the analysis consists of an iso-TMI mass analysis for the different options. Results of the set of architectures indicate that while chemical Earth departure strategies results in a 30 – 50 % increase in the number if Ares V launches required per mission, the associated <b>additional</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> may be outweighed by the cost of developing and maintaining a nuclear thermal propulsion capability, as well as the increased <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> of nuclear thermal propulsion stages.

This is an early expression of the Henry George theorem that Joseph Stiglitz and others expanded upon. Hotelling pointed out that when local public goods like roads and trains become congested, users create an <b>additional</b> <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> of excluding others. Hotelling became an early advocate of Georgist congestion pricing and stated that the purpose of this unique type of toll fee was in no way to recoup investment costs but was instead a way of changing behavior and compensating those who are excluded. Hotelling describes how human attention is also in limited supply at any given time and place, which produces a rental value; he concludes that billboards could be regulated or taxed on similar grounds as other scarcity rents. Hotelling reasoned that rent and taxation were analogous, the public and private versions of a similar thing. Therefore, the social optimum would be to put taxes directly on rent. Kenneth Arrow described this as 'market socialism', but Mason Gaffney points out that it is actually 'Georgism'. Hotelling added the following comment about the ethics of Georgist value capture: [...] "The proposition that there is no ethical objection to the confiscation of the site value of land by taxation, if and when the nonlandowning classes can get the power to do so, has been ably defended by Georgist H.

The ensuing monopoly power of the input supplier leads in many cases to controversial outcomes, in which social inefficiencies can occur.

40|$|A fermionic {{operator}} circuit is {{a product}} of fermionic operators of usually different and partially overlapping support. Further elements of fermionic operator circuits (FOCs) are partial traces and partial projections. The presented framework allows for the introduction of fermionic versions of known qudit operator circuits (QUOC), important for the simulation of strongly correlated d-dimensional systems: The multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), tree tensor networks (TTN), projected entangled pair states (PEPS), or their infinite-size versions (iPEPS etc.). After the definition of a FOC, we present a method to contract it with the same computation and memory requirements as a corresponding QUOC, for which all fermionic operators are replaced by qudit operators of identical dimension. A given scheme for contracting the QUOC relates to an analogous scheme for the corresponding fermionic circuit, where <b>additional</b> <b>marginal</b> computational <b>costs</b> arise only from reordering of modes for operators occurring in intermediate stages of the contraction.

40|$|Information {{goods are}} {{characterized}} by high fixed (first-copy) costs, but very low costs {{for the production of}} <b>additional</b> copies. <b>Marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of electronically-delivered information goods have been further reduced by the remarkable recent decline in computing and digital communication costs. Most previous research focuses on how a monopolist would perform (and the proper regulation to impose) in such an environment. Achieving dynamic efficiency is difficult because pricing at <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> (which is statically efficient) eliminates the incentive to invest in the creation of new content. Recently, the strategy of bundling numerous goods together has been explored in greater detail. Bundling may achieve static efficiency since individuals will face a zero cost on the margin for each item consumed. Yet, dynamic efficiency can be maintained because the producer is able to recover investment costs through bundle sales. This paper analyzes the profitability and welfare properties of bundling in a multi-firm setting. This allows us to explore how incumbents and entrants interact when each firm is selling numerous competing products. Our fundamental conclusion is that even adding only a single firm to this industry with substantial fixed <b>costs</b> and negligible <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> will result in much lower prices for consumers, much higher social welfare, and only a moderate reduction in firms' profits regardless of the pricing schemes employed. This outcome is somewhat surprising given that in a standard static two-good Bertrand model, a duopoly would lead to a price war which eliminates the incentive to invest in new content (or to enter the industry in the first place). Although the firms are producing a priori identical items, consumers know that their valuations for the particular items will vary ex post. Thus, no price reduction by one firm can completely eliminate the demand faced by other firms. Although there remains an incentive to invest in new product creation, this incentive is lower than a monopolist would have. As a result, in a dynamic version of this model, the welfare superiority of the duopoly becomes dampened (but not eliminated). Finally, when firms are allowed to sell items both as a bundle and individually, we find that most revenue will be obtained from bundle sales. These results indicate that bundling will persist in a multi-firm setting and suggest that only firms of substantial size will be able to survive in such a market...|$|R

Fragmentation is a serious challenge for network operators since it creates "holes" in the transport pipe causing new demands to be rejected, in spite of sufficient bandwidth being available. Unlike the well-studied, general fragmentation problem, link defragmentation is "hard" and novel due to some unique constraints imposed by the SONET standard. Since a defragmentation operation typically occurs on a network carrying live traffic, {{in addition to the}} "quality" of the output, any link defragmentation algorithm has to avoid traffic hit and also optimize the "cost" of reorganizing circuits.

We designed a suitable OMC seismically attenuated optical table fitting to the existing vacuum chambers (horizontal access module, HAM chambers).

This pilot scheme was studied by the authors for a thirteen-month period between August 1985 and September 1986 to establish the main cost-benefit implications of providing such a service in this area. The study was designed in consultation with senior officers of the Calderdale Health Authority and involved the Hebden Bridge group practice {{as a means of}} comparing a similar practice with a similar population but without an open access facility (control group). Patients in six pre-selected condition groups were chosen as potential beneficiaries of this pilot service and in both practices the progress of these groups of patients were followed irrespective of whether they received physiotherapy via open-access or a consultant referral or not at all (in the case of some control group patients). The main aims of the study were: (i) {{to assess the impact of}} open-access on hospital and general practitioner workload and (ii) to quantify the costs and benefits of such a scheme affecting patients, the physiotherapy service and (to a limited extent) on general practitioners. The full conclusions of this study are to be found in Section 6. However, the following are the major findings of this report: 1) The <b>additional</b> (<b>marginal)</b> <b>cost</b> to the physiotherapy department of providing open access for selected patients from one practice was around £ 3, 298 per annum. 2) The service was used responsibly by referring GPs who, in their opinion, found it to be a very useful treatment option. 3) The availability of the open-access service reduced the number of consultant referrals (both urgent and non-urgent), especially those who would have ultimately been seen in the physiotherapy department. 4) The availability of the open-access service generated a demand for physiotherapy services which, under normal circumstances, would have gone unmet and been managed by the patients’ general practitioner. 5) Open-access physiotherapy produced improvements in the patients’ condition (as assessed by both patients and physiotherapists) although no great difference in benefit could be found when compared with physiotherapy obtained by consultant referral (except Group 2) or no physiotherapy at all. 6) Open-access patients used significantly less physiotherapy time and sessions than their consultant counterparts. This reduced the average treatment costs per case from £ 42 to £ 25 per case (revenue costs only). 7) The availability of open-access did not reduce the general practitioners’ workload as measured in terms of the number of patient consultations. 8) Open-access patients waited significantly less time to obtain physiotherapy than those patients referred to a consultant. This was reduced from 124 days to 22 days in the study group. This report is a summarised version of a fill report prepared for the Calderdale Health Authority in 1987.

The <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is shown in relation to marginal revenue (MR), the incremental amount of sales revenue that an additional unit of the product or service will bring to the firm.

40|$|We derive {{an optimal}} airport-pricing model, both {{with and without}} a {{constraint}} on the revenues, that includes all relevant external <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,.</b> Given {{the results of the}} model we discuss the implications on the profit of airports, and find that given that the proceeds of the environmental charges are seen as revenue for the airport, it is not obvious that a marginal cost-pricing scheme would result in financial deficits for the airports, this despite the reasonable assumption of increasing returns to scale in airport capacity. Using relatively crude estimates of the <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> we compare the current pricing scheme with a <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> pricing scheme. We find that the effect on revenues of moving towards a <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> pricing scheme may not be so dramatic; especially not if the <b>marginal</b> external <b>costs</b> include estimated <b>marginal</b> <b>costs</b> of CO 2 emissions. Airport pricing; <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> pricing; emission charge...|$|R
50|$|In {{economics}} and mechanism design, a cost-sharing mechanism {{is a process}} by which several agents decide on the scope of a public product or service, and how much each agent should pay for it. Cost-sharing is easy when the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is constant: in this case, each agent who wants the service just pays its <b>marginal</b> <b>cost.</b> Cost-sharing becomes more interesting when the <b>marginal</b> <b>cost</b> is not constant. With increasing <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> the agents impose a negative externality on each other; with decreasing <b>marginal</b> <b>costs,</b> the agents impose a positive externality on each other (see example below). The goal of a cost-sharing mechanism is to divide this externality among the agents.|$|R
