5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, and that such fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 1603 recorded that Upnor Castle had 20 guns of various calibres, plus another 11 guns split between two sconces or outworks, known as Bay and Warham Sconces. The castle's armament {{consisted of a}} demi-cannon, 7 culverin, 5 demi-culverin, a minion, a falconet, a saker, and four fowlers with two chambers each. Bay Sconce was armed with 4 demi-culverin, while Warham Sconce had 2 culverin and 5 demi-culverin. Eighteen guns were recorded as being mounted in the castle twenty years later. The garrison's armament included 34 longbows, an indication that archery was still of military value even <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> date. By this time, however, the castle {{was in a state}} of disrepair. The drawbridge and its raising mechanism were broken, the gun platforms needed repairs, and the courtyard wall had collapsed. A new curtain wall had to be built to protect the landward side of the castle. The foundations of Warham Sconce were reported to have been washed away by the tide, and it appears that both sconces were allowed to fall into ruin.|$|E

5|$|Harper {{noticed that}} Bartram's notes were {{considerably}} altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the {{detail of the}} white tail appeared in print {{for the first time}} in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> date, suggesting that the population was in the process of extinction and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.|$|E
5|$|In 1730, Vaccarini {{arrived in}} Catania as the {{appointed}} city architect and immediately impressed on the architecture the Roman Baroque style. The pilasters lose their rustication and support Roman type cornices and entablatures, or curved pediments, and free-standing columns support balconies. Vaccarini also exploited the local black lava stone as a decorative feature {{rather than a}} general building material, using it intermittently with other materials, and spectacularly for an obelisk supported {{on the back of}} the Catanian heraldic elephant, for a fountain in the style of Bernini in front of the new Town hall. Vaccarini's principal façade to Catania's cathedral, dedicated to Santa Agata, shows strong Spanish influences even <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> stage of Sicilian Baroque. Also in the city is Stefano Ittar's Church of the Collegiata, built around 1768. It is an example of Sicilian Baroque at its most stylistically simple.|$|E
5|$|In 849, Calakmul was {{mentioned}} at Seibal where a ruler named as Chan Pet attended the K'atun-ending ceremony; his name {{may also be}} recorded on a broken ceramic at Calakmul itself.

The recorded day may fall either in 899 or 909 with the latter date the most likely. A few monuments appear to be even later although their style is crude, representing the efforts of a remnant population to maintain the Classic Maya tradition.

Drummond called to ML276s commander—Lieutenant Rowley Bourke—that he believed there were still men in the water and Bourke immediately entered the harbour to search for them.

5|$|In early 1945, {{planning}} {{was underway}} for Operation Oboe Two, an amphibious assault to capture Balikpapan, a seaport on Borneo. The 9th Division was originally designated for the operation, but in April {{it was decided}} to utilise the 7th Division instead, and it duly embarked from Cairns to Morotai, the staging post for the assault. Operation Oboe Two would transpire to be the largest amphibious operation mounted by the Australian military. Despite opposition from the American naval commanders providing support for the operation, Milford decided to land his forces at Klandasan, a southern suburb of Balikpapan which although heavily defended, had suitable beaches for landing troops. By landing at Klandasan, Milford hoped to achieve tactical surprise and anticipated fire support from the United States Navy would help counter the coastal defences of the Japanese. The battle of Balikpapan began on 1 July with a naval barrage of the landing area, supported by bombers of the Royal Australian Air Force, with the division landing relatively unopposed by mid morning. By 1pm, the beachhead was secure and Milford, together with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Leslie Morshead made an inspection of the area. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> stage of the war {{it was clear that the}} war would soon end, and extensive use was made of divisional artillery (which Milford had raised during his earlier spell with the division in 1940) rather than needlessly risk soldiers' lives. By 21 July, Balikpapan was secure and the Japanese were retreating into Borneo. Milford ordered a halt to further offensive action and instructed his outlying forces to hold their position, thus concluding a successful operation.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes {{successfully}} {{shot down}} a Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter over Nova Gradiška. The following day, {{two or three}} of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to Bijeljina, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including {{all but one of the}} 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed Volksdeutsche. The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near Valjevo. Even <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near Banja Luka. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.|$|E

25|$|This {{bibliography}} of George Washington {{is a comprehensive}} list of written and published works about George Washington, first President of the United States, his life in general or in part and includes primary sources containing Washington's works, letters, records, diaries, etc. The literature on Washington is immense, his biographers and editors having lived in four separate centuries. Many of the publications listed here lend themselves to Washington in a biographical capacity, while many cover specific events and other topics where Washington is the central or an important figure. Publications covering subjects such as 'The Winter at Valley Forge', 'The Battle of Brooklyn' and Washington's farewell address are well placed {{and can be found}} in this bibliography. Washington was diligent about keeping records, maintained many dairies throughout his adult life, and corresponded with many prominent figures, family members and friends. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> date nearly all of Washington's writings have been studied, transcribed, organized, edited and published by a good number of historians over the years, providing the basis by which the many biographical accounts of Washington's life have been written.|$|E

25|$|Starting in May 1916, the 155 L {{guns were}} {{progressively}} replaced by newer {{models of the}} same or similar caliber. The 155 L tubes were generally retired after they had 10,000 rounds fired through them. Owing to production shortages of the more modern artillery pieces {{that were supposed to}} replace the 155 L, a number of replacement barrels for the 155 L were however manufactured starting in 1916. These were of somewhat simplified construction, with constant-step rifling. The most distinctive visual difference between the old and new 155 L barrels is their lifting handle, which is longitudinally aligned with the main axis of the old barrels but is transversely mounted on the new barrels. The introduction of quick-firing, replacement materiel for the 155 L, which was initiated by the First Stage of the Realization of the Heavy Field Artillery Program of May 30, 1916 was still not finished in November 1918. The field artillery of each French army corps still had a battalion of 155 L model 1877 guns <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> date in the war.|$|E
25|$|After a death {{sentence}} is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus {{is a type of}} collateral review, and {{it is the only way}} that state prisoners may attack a {{death sentence}} in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>late</b> stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling. According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.|$|E
