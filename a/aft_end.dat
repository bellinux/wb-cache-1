5|$|The {{completion}} of Illustrious was delayed {{two months to}} fit her with a Type 79Z early-warning radar; {{she was the first}} aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion. This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new mainmast {{to be added to the}} <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the island to mount the transmitter.|$|E
5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to a tripod after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on the aft funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from the aft battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of her aft superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Her {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{consisted of}} a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle MKII mount at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915. A 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60° was also mounted in November 1914 and used until August 1917. A 4-inch BL MK VII on a high-angle mount was added in April 1917. Five 18-inch (450mm) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the Invincibles, two on each side {{and one in the}} stern. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.|$|E
50|$|Sheer on exposed decks makes a ship more {{seaworthy}} {{by raising}} the deck at fore and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> further from the water and by reducing the volume of water coming on deck.|$|R
5000|$|Hilu tacks and jibes as {{a normal}} sailboat, it has {{permanent}} fore and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> rather than a permanent windward and leeward side, {{and it does not}} [...] "shunt" [...] to come about so is more akin to the Malibu Outrigger of the 1950s. Due to the asymmetric sailing behavior, Hilu is not quite as easy for the novice sailor to master as some of AMF's other beach boats.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the Trenton Transit Center is that inbound NJ Transit trains from New York release passengers on the same track reserved for SEPTA operations, deliberately allowing for an efficient transfer between the two rail lines for continued service to Philadelphia. As a result, the <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of both trains {{may not be able}} to open their doors, since they extend past the ends of the platforms with both trains stopped on the same track.|$|R
5|$|When World War II began, {{the ship}} was en route to Alexandria from Aden and arrived there on 6 September. Whilst escorting a convoy to Malta, some of her depth charges detonated prematurely on 17 September and badly damaged the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the ship. Garland had to be towed back to Alexandria where {{temporary}} repairs were made. She was towed to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted from 11 October to 8 May 1940. Shortly before {{the completion of the}} repairs, she was loaned to the Polish Navy on 3 May 1940, the anniversary of the 1791 Polish Constitution of 3 May.|$|E
5|$|During the ship's refit in January 1944, her {{electronics}} were modernized. The CXAM {{was replaced}} by an SK model and the SC-1 {{was replaced by}} an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar {{was moved to the}} rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted {{at the top of the}} foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{original}} 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the Iowa-class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt {{in such a way}} as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the Iowas and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38DP mounts. The mid and <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 Armored Box Launcher (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the Iowa-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bottom of}} the {{armoured}} box extended [...] below the waterline {{and up to the}} upperdeck. [...] The forward and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the box were similarly armoured, although the front end also extended upwards by a further [...] In addition, a waterline armoured belt extended for the whole length of the vessel. She and her two sisters were the only armoured gunboats ever built for the Royal Navy. Unlike her sisters, she was fitted with a bow rudder as well as the traditional stern rudder.|$|R
50|$|The {{seaplane}} had simple, {{rectangular cross-section}} floats. The flat undersides curved up towards the nose, reaching {{just beyond the}} propeller and the <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> were under the ailerons. There was no step. Each float was attached with four aluminium tube struts, two leaning inwards to the lower fuselage longeron and two outwards to the wing spars. They were constructed of wood, with ash frames and mahogany plywood covering. The tail was protected with a cylindrical float of the same construction, attached longitudinally under the fin.|$|R
5000|$|The airship had a {{tricycle}} undercarriage with a non-steerable nosewheel beneath the central hull and steerable (via {{a connection with}} the rudders) wheels at {{the tips of the}} ventral fins at the <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the outer hulls. The nosewheel functioned as an [...] "internal mooring mast," [...] with a telescopic strut that allowed the ship's angle of attack to be varied while moored (e.g. nose down to hug the ground or nose up in preparation for takeoff) and a tie-down fitting at its lower end.|$|R
5|$|Queen Mary, {{along with}} the other Jutland wrecks, has been {{declared}} a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,266 officers and men. Surveys of this site conducted by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2001–03 have shown the wreck is in three sections, with the two forward sections being heavily damaged and in pieces. Her <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> is upside down and relatively complete except for her propellers, which have been salvaged. Examination of the damage to the ship has suggested that the initial explosion was not in the magazine of 'A' or 'B' forward main turrets, but instead in the magazine of the forward 4-inch battery. An explosion of the quantity of cordite in the main magazine would have been sufficient to also ignite 'Q' magazine, destroying much more of the ship. The explosion in the smaller magazine would have been sufficient to break the ship in two, the blast then spreading to the forward magazine and ripping apart the forward section.|$|E
25|$|Enterprise went {{on public}} display on July 19, 2012, at the Intrepid Museum's new Space Shuttle Pavilion, a {{temporary}} shelter {{consisting of a}} pressurized, air-supported fabric bubble constructed on the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the carrier's flight deck.|$|E
25|$|The {{outrigger}} style empennage {{consisted of}} a single large vertical stabilizer and tailplane connected to the center main wing with two horizontal tubular spars. Two vertical struts were attached to the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of each tube spar and met at the extreme rear of the fuselage forming a very robust triangle structure.|$|E
50|$|On 16 April 1943, Sahib {{attacked}} and sank the merchant ship Galiolo, 2 mi off Capo di Milazzo. After firing, Sahib almost broke the surface, which was noticed by an aircraft, which dropped a bomb {{but to no}} effect. The torpedo boat Climene, assisted by the corvettes Gabbiano and Euterpe, began a heavy depth charge attack resulting in the submarine's pressure hull being holed at the <b>aft</b> <b>ends.</b> Unable to repair the damage, the ship was abandoned. She surfaced and was attacked by the aircraft. Sahib was scuttled to prevent her capture. One of the crew was wounded and died on 3 May 1943.|$|R
50|$|The current {{principal}} {{application for}} the Equalizer is the AV-8 Harrier IIs of the United States Marine Corps, Italian Navy and Spanish Navy. The Harrier II carries the Equalizer {{system in a}} pair of pods mounted on the fuselage sides, with the cannon in the port pod and 300 rounds of ammunition in the starboard pod, fed through a bridge at the <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the pods that also contains the drive system for the gun. The complete installation, which includes a double-ended feed system that returns empty cartridges to the magazine, weighs 900 lb (410 kg) empty and 1,230 lb (560 kg) loaded.|$|R
500|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{displacement}} down and the speed the same as in the earlier armored cruisers, armor in the Tsukuba class was about the same in thickness, although in an improved layout. The waterline armor belt of Krupp cemented armor was [...] thick between the 12-inch gun turrets although it was only [...] thick fore and aft of the turrets. Above it was a strake of [...] armor that extended between the barbettes and protected the 6-inch casemates. The <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the main armor belt were connected to the main gun barbettes by [...] transverse bulkheads. The lack of a forward bulkhead and the thinness of the aft bulkhead were serious weaknesses in the ships' protection.|$|R
25|$|The {{airframe}} {{was constructed}} largely of wood, with plywood covering the forward fuselage and a steel-tube v-strut chassis main undercarriage with two wheels and a tail-skid at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the fuselage. Two {{examples of the}} R.II had been completed {{by the time the}} Armistice bore the IdFlieg German military registration numbers R.55/17 and R.58/17.|$|E
25|$|The PIK-5 was a {{training}} glider produced in Finland in the 1940s and 1950s, equipping the country's gliding clubs with an aircraft greater in performance than primary gliders {{but less than}} competition sailplanes. The aircraft had a pod-and-boom configuration, with a high, strut-braced monoplane wing and a cruciform tail carried {{at the end of}} a tailboom that extended from a position high on the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the pod.|$|E
25|$|Moving aft {{into the}} saloon, {{there is a}} {{straight}} settee to port, the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of which provides seating for the aft facing nav station. A removable seat back slips in to give the navigator a comfortable back rest. The nav station has drawer storage beneath it and a large chart table with ample room to spread out on it. The electronics and electrical panels are arrayed in a convenient console style.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Navy {{initiated}} the SES model test program in 1960. By 1963, a 10-ton test craft called the XR-1 {{was designed and}} built to test the surface effect concept. The first version of the XR-1 used fixed plywood seals at the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the captured air bubble section. A jet engine providing 1700 pounds of thrust was used for main propulsion. A separate [...] gas engine was used to drive lift fans, and also to power out-drive units that were used for off-cushion slow-speed maneuvering. During {{the first year of}} testing, the XR-1 was fitted with more powerful main propulsion and flexible fore and aft seals were tested as well.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{waterline}} belt, [...] thick amidships and tapered to [...] at the ends, {{extended from}} the upper deck to [...] below the waterline. Transverse protective bulkheads of [...] armor {{extended from the}} gun deck to the armored deck across the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the belt armor. Similar bulkheads fitted on the gun deck in wake of the 10-inch barbettes form the fore and aft limits of the side armor between the main and gun decks. Above the gun deck, [...] nickel steel was fitted in wake of the 3-inch battery. The 6-inch guns on the gun deck were isolated by splinter bulkheads of [...] nickel steel. The bulkheads extended continuously across the ship, while [...] nickel steel extended fore and aft.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{displacement}} down and the speed the same as in the earlier armored cruisers, armor in the Tsukuba class was about the same in thickness, although in an improved layout. The waterline armor belt of Krupp cemented armor was 7 in thick between the 12-inch gun turrets although it was only 4 in thick fore and aft of the turrets. Above it was a strake of 5 in armor that extended between the barbettes and protected the 6-inch casemates. The <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the main armor belt were connected to the main gun barbettes by 1 in transverse bulkheads. The lack of a forward bulkhead and the thinness of the aft bulkhead were serious weaknesses in the ships' protection.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} engines were {{mounted on a}} platform supported by iron scaffolding at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the vessel. Cooling water was stored in tanks mounted above-deck. As completed, the Type AF had a speed of six knots, {{and a range of}} 60 nautical miles unless auxiliary fuel tanks were fitted. Disadvantages of this set-up included an inability to back the vessel astern, limited maneuverability and the deafening noise of the engines which would have made voice commands problematic.|$|E
25|$|At the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the {{fuselage}} {{access to the}} cabin is gained by large clamshell doors and drop down cargo ramp with inbuilt retractable support jacks. Doors in {{the fuselage}} also give access to the cargo hold: two on the starboard side and three on the port side. Above the rear fuselage {{is a very large}} fin and rudder, with a moderately sized tailplane with dihedral fitted with end-plate fins (not fitted for the first flight).|$|E
25|$|He {{forecast}} {{the replacement of}} the horse by the airplane in reconnaissance, and wireless air-to-ground communications that included the transmission of photographs. As a result, the CSO selected Foulois for the aeronautical board designated to conduct the 1908 airship and airplane acceptance trials. After having selected the Thomas Scott Baldwin airship as the winner of the trial, Foulois was selected as the first military crewman. He took his first flight on August 18 as engineer-pilot while Baldwin controlled the rudder at the <b>aft</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
50|$|Waterwitch was an {{armoured}} gunboat of the breastwork type, with a hull {{constructed of}} iron. Her 4+1/2 in armour plating {{was backed by}} 10 in of teak and extended for about 60 ft amidships. The bottom of the armoured box extended 3 to 4 ft below the waterline {{and up to the}} upperdeck. The forward and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the box were similarly armoured, although the front end also extended upwards by a further 5 ft. In addition, a waterline armoured belt extended for the whole length of the vessel. She and her two sisters were the only armoured gunboats ever built for the Royal Navy. Unlike her sisters, she was fitted with a bow rudder as well as the traditional stern rudder.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{fuselage}} aft of the wing, {{along with}} the complete tail, was removable as a single unit {{for access to the}} engine. Once the aft fuselage was removed, it was easy to replace or adjust the engine. The <b>aft</b> fuselage <b>ended</b> with a circular adjustable exhaust nozzle.|$|R
40|$|A {{gas turbine}} engine has a {{combustor}} module including an annular combustor having a liner assembly that defines an annular combustion chamber having a length, L. The liner assembly includes a radially inner liner, a radially outer liner that circumscribes the inner liner, and a bulkhead, having a height, H 1, which extends between the respective forward ends of the inner liner and the outer liner. The combustor has an exit height, H 3, at the respective <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the inner liner and the outer liner interior. The annular combustor has a ratio H 1 /H 3 having a value {{less than or equal}} to 1. 7. The annular combustor may also have a ration L/H 3 having a value {{less than or equal to}} 6. 0...|$|R
25|$|The S-IVB-500 {{model used}} on the Saturn V {{differed}} from the S-IVB-200 used as {{the second stage of}} the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) units mounted at the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.|$|E
25|$|All but two {{lifeboats}} were {{situated on}} the Boat Deck, the highest deck of Titanic. They were located on wooden chocks at the fore and aft parts of the Boat Deck, {{on both sides of}} the ship; two groups of three at the forward end, and two groups of four at the <b>aft</b> <b>end.</b> The two cutters were situated immediately aft of the bridge, one to port and the other to starboard. While Titanic was at sea they were positioned outboard so that they could be lowered instantly in the event of an emergency, such as needing to rescue a person who had fallen overboard. The lifeboats were assigned odd numbers on the starboard side and even numbers on the port side, running from forward to aft, while the collapsible lifeboats were lettered A to D.|$|E
25|$|Silversides {{became a}} part of the Combined Great Lakes Navy Association in Chicago, Illinois, behind Chicago's Naval Armory on 24 May 1973. For years, the {{submarine}} was tended by a small crew of dedicated volunteers, drawn to her illustrious history and technical marvels. They donated tens of thousands of man-hours to restore her, maintained her at their own expense, and served as docents and chaperones. When association volunteers first stepped on board, they faced a musty, mildewed sub with paint peeling off in sheets inside and out, and junk scattered everywhere. After many years, the refrigeration compartment had produced a growth so thick, they could be measured in multiple inches instead of millimeters. Evidence of water damage prevailed in the forward compartments but the <b>aft</b> <b>end</b> was in reasonably good condition. Topside, the decking was weathered and worn in spots and some areas of the superstructure were rusted and in need of replacement.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{requirements}} for the proposed cryogenic on-orbit liquid depot storage, acquisition, and transfer (COLD-SAT) satellite experiment, {{which is to be}} launched by Atlas I, are examined. The COLD-SAT experiments are categorized as class I and II; class I involves technology related to space transportation missions and class II represents alternative fluid management operations and data. The hardware for the COLD-SAT experiments consists of three hydrogen tanks contained in the experimental module; the experimental module is connected to a three-axis-controlled spacecraft bus, and thrusters are positioned on the forward and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the spacecraft and on the cylindrical portion of the experimental module. The components and systems of the experiment module and the types of experiments that can be conducted in each tank are described. Diagrams of the spacecraft configuration are provided...|$|R
5000|$|Armament: The last pair of torpedo tubes {{were removed}} and the 6 inch guns had their {{protection}} reduced; four guns {{were removed from}} the fore and <b>aft</b> <b>ends</b> of the batteries. Eight 4 inch high-angle guns in four twin mountings and two octuple 2 pdr pom-poms were added to her anti-aircraft defences, as well as additional [...]50 calibre machine guns on two of the main turrets. The original 15-inch turrets were upgraded to increase the elevation of the guns by ten degrees (from 20° to 30°), providing a further 9,000 yards of range to a maximum of 32300 yd with a 6crh shell. The fire control was also modernised to include the HACS MkIII* AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk VII for surface fire control of the main armament.|$|R
50|$|Sukhoi Su-30MKI has {{electronic}} counter-measure systems. The RWR {{system is}} of Indian design, developed by India's DRDO, called Tarang, (Wave in English). It has direction finding capability {{and is known}} to have a programmable threat library. The RWR is derived from work done on an earlier system for India's MiG-23BNs known as the Tranquil, which is now superseded by the more advanced Tarang series. Elta EL/M-8222 a self-protection jammer developed by Israel Aircraft Industries is the MKI's standard EW pod, which the Israeli Air Force uses on its F-15s.
