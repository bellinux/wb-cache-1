Along with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's The Great Chess Automaton (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's Chess: Man vs. Machine (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing <b>automatons.</b>|$|E

They traded in Canton and Macao, which technically was against the rules and regulations in the charter of the SOIC. Grill took advantage of the fact that his father was a director of the SOIC, and until his father's death shipped his own goods on board SOIC ships. From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical <b>automatons</b> known to the Chinese as sing-songs. Such goods were appreciated by the Emperor and the rich mandarins.|$|E
5|$|The game's 15 {{missions}} {{take place}} in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security <b>automatons</b> and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables {{that may be used}} to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground.|$|E
40|$|By extracting {{the basic}} {{properties}} {{common to the}} automata appeared in existing literatures, we develop a general formulation of automata with “weights”. We define a pseudoautomaton and derive from it the well-known deterministic <b>automaton,</b> nondeterministic <b>automaton,</b> probabilistic <b>automaton,</b> fuzzy <b>automaton,</b> and so on. Moreover, several interesting automata such as l-semigroup <b>automaton,</b> lattice <b>automaton,</b> dual lattice <b>automaton,</b> mixed boolean <b>automaton,</b> semiring <b>automaton,</b> ring <b>automaton</b> and field <b>automaton</b> which have never appeared in any other paper before are derived...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies on}} fuzzy automata are {{influenced}} by algebraic techniques to tackle issues like reduction, minimization and their languages. Fuzzy <b>automaton</b> homomorphism is one such majorally discussed technique. This paper {{is concerned with the}} group of (weak) fuzzy <b>automaton</b> automorphisms and constructions of all (weak) fuzzy <b>automaton</b> automorphisms over arbitrary fuzzy <b>automaton.</b> It is shown that (1) every arbitrary fuzzy <b>automaton</b> is decomposed into distinct primaries, (2) primaries are maximal singly generated fuzzy automata and (3) every weak fuzzy <b>automaton</b> homomorphism on an arbitrary fuzzy <b>automaton</b> is uniquely determined into weak fuzzy <b>automaton</b> homomorphisms on all its primaries. Therefore, the discussion begun over strongly connected fuzzy <b>automaton</b> and continue constructions as well as characterizations of (weak) fuzzy <b>automaton</b> homomorphisms, isomorphisms, endomorphisms and automorphisms sequentially over perfect fuzzy <b>automaton,</b> singly generated fuzzy <b>automaton</b> and primaries of fuzzy <b>automaton.</b> Finally, it is obtained that the group of weak fuzzy <b>automaton</b> automorphisms and its cardinality over arbitrary fuzzy <b>automaton.</b> Keywords: Fuzzy function, fuzzy <b>automaton</b> (strongly connected, perfect and singly generated),(Weak) fuzzy <b>automaton</b> automorphism (homomorphism, isomorphism), primaries and basis of a fuzzy <b>automaton.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient <b>automatons</b> left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere <b>automatons</b> due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as a prime example of a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the escapement mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving <b>automatons</b> driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E

25|$|Though {{hopeful that}} {{humanity}} will ultimately prosper {{by the use}} of <b>automatons,</b> he mentions a few ways this relationship with technology could be detrimental. <b>Automatons</b> must not be taken for granted, because with advances in technology that allow them to learn, the machines may be able to escape human control if humans do not continue proper supervision of them. We might become entirely dependent on them, or even controlled by them. There is danger in trusting decisions to something which cannot think abstractly, and may therefore be unlikely to identify with intellectual human values which are not purely utilitarian.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>automaton</b> runs when it {{is given}} some {{sequence}} of inputs in discrete (individual) time steps or steps. An <b>automaton</b> processes one input picked from a set of symbols or letters, which is called an alphabet. The symbols received by the <b>automaton</b> as input at any step are a finite sequence of symbols called words. An <b>automaton</b> has a finite set of states. At each moment during a run of the <b>automaton,</b> the <b>automaton</b> is {{in one of its}} states. When the <b>automaton</b> receives new input it moves to another state (or transitions) based on a function that takes the current state and symbol as parameters. This function is called the transition function. The <b>automaton</b> reads the symbols of the input word one after another and transitions from state to state according to the transition function until the word is read completely. Once the input word has been read, the <b>automaton</b> is said to have stopped. The state at which the <b>automaton</b> stops is called the final state. Depending on the final state, it's said that the <b>automaton</b> either accepts or rejects an input word. There is a subset of states of the <b>automaton,</b> which is defined as the set of accepting states. If the final state is an accepting state, then the <b>automaton</b> accepts the word. Otherwise, the word is rejected. The set of all the words accepted by an <b>automaton</b> is called the [...] "language of that automaton".
