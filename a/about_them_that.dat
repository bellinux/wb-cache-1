5|$|The present-day Mikea are not {{a remnant}} of an ancient Malagasy {{hunter-gatherer}} society, but are instead descendants of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their {{way of life is}} perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly believed to be the mythical Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. While some 1,500 individuals are known to identify as Mikea, many Malagasy disbelieve that the community continues to exist in the present day.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss <b>about</b> <b>them.</b> <b>That</b> celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E

500|$|David Cannadine of the Institute of Historical Research spoke {{positively}} of One Day in History, remarking: [...] "The {{wonderful thing}} about these records is we don't yet {{know what it}} is <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> will be interesting in the future." [...] In promotion of the project, Fiona Reynolds, the Director-General of the National Trust, stated: [...] "We want this day to have its own place in history and be a snapshot of everyday life {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century." [...] Journalist John Plunkett expressed scepticism of this aim, writing in The Guardian that, despite the intentions of the campaign, it was only going to be [...] "a historical record of people with computers". He was also critical of History Matters in general, saying that he had [...] "no idea how history [...] going to impact on [...] ". Dave Hill, also writing for The Guardian, described the campaign as a [...] "brilliant idea". Following the publication of the diary entries, Robert Booth, a journalist for The Sunday Times, remarked that the [...] "monotony of most of [...] lives was all too painfully obvious." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|Preproduction for Deus Ex began around August 1997 {{and lasted}} roughly six months. The six-person team came from Looking Glass's Austin studio. Spector, the team's {{director}} and producer, saw {{their work as}} improving upon the game design ideas of Origin, Looking Glass, and Valve Corporation by doing what those companies did not. The game's [...] "ironic" [...] working title was Shooter: Majestic Revelations, and it was scheduled for release on Christmas 1998. The team developed the setting before the game mechanics. Noticing his wife's fascination with The X-Files, Spector connected the [...] "real world, millennial weirdness, [...] conspiracy" [...] topics on his mind and {{decided to make a}} game <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> would appeal to a wide audience. Shooters fiction was based in part on conspiracy theories related to Area 51, CIA drug trafficking, the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Majestic 12, and a Masonic bunker beneath Denver International Airport. The team designed over 200 characters without associated in-game roles, which was both helpful when designing missions and unhelpful as they attempted to reduce their scope. Later in 1997, Spector wrote a [...] "manifesto" [...] on his ideal game and the structure of role-playing video games. His principles included [...] "problems, not puzzles", [...] "no forced failure", [...] "players do; NPCs watch", and [...] "areas with multiple entrance and exit points". In retrospect, Spector believed that Deus Ex accomplished the intent of his manifesto.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{and after}} their meeting in 2010, players from both schools {{attributed}} {{the importance of}} the game to the negative feelings the programs have for each other. Virginia center Anthony Mihota said [...] "I guess it's because we don't like them very much. Something <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> gets under our skin". [...] After Maryland's victory, Terp linebacker Adrian Moten commented, [...] "This was a big win in the rivalry. They hate us. We hate them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Corbyn {{signed an}} Early Day Motion {{calling for the}} {{decriminalisation}} of cannabis. Despite having never smoked cannabis himself, Corbyn said in the 2015 Labour leadership election [...] "we should be adult and grown up and decriminalise cannabis". Later, in the 2016 Labour leadership election, Corbyn called for the decriminalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, but said that he wouldn't support legalising recreational drugs. He said <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> he wanted people to be [...] "educated away from" [...] taking drugs, and further stated that he [...] "would also {{want to look at}} supporting people who {{want to get out of}} the drugs trade in other parts of the world because there is the horrors of the drugs war that's going on in Central America".|$|E
2500|$|On July 17, President Bill Clinton {{spoke with}} Kennedy's sister, Caroline, and later called his uncle, Ted. Clinton also spoke with Andrew Cuomo, {{who at the}} time was married to Kennedy's cousin, Kerry. [...] "He wanted to let them know he was {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>them,</b> <b>that</b> we'll do everything we can, and that our prayers are with them", Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Clinton ordered warships of the U.S. Navy to assist in the search for Kennedy's plane. Critics argued that the search was an abuse of taxpayer dollars, as no ordinary citizen would receive similar treatment. Clinton said that afternoon that the Kennedys had [...] "suffered much, and given more", and also called for them to feel [...] "the strength of God, the love of their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens".|$|E
2500|$|Peter Hook of New Order cited Giorgio Moroder's {{production}} on [...] "The Number One Song in Heaven" [...] {{as a major}} influence when his band changed of musical style to produce electro/dance rock songs like [...] "Temptation" [...] in 1982. New Order also delivered an extended live version of [...] "When I'm With You" [...] that same year in Milano. When they started playing music, singer Dave Gahan. and composer Martin Gore, of Depeche Mode cited them {{as one of their}} favorite bands. Gore also later covered [...] "Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth" [...] on his Counterfeit e.p. in 1989. Other early electronic acts like the Human League, and Erasure, also mentioned the group. Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran stated about [...] "This Town ain't...": [...] "There was something <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> was very different.

5000|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{gave the}} EP {{three and a}} half stars out of five, {{remarking}} that [...] "Riddance's tightly wound sound is well represented here; 'Judas and the Morning After Pill' and 'Grandstanding from the Cheap Seats' have an urgent punk traditionalism <b>about</b> <b>them</b> <b>that's</b> reminiscent of Bad Religion.
