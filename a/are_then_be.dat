5000|$|Another {{approach}} for capturing images at extremely high speeds is with an ISIS (In Situ storage CCD chip, {{such as in}} the Shimadzu HPV-1 and HPV-2 cameras. In a typical interline transfer CCD chip, each pixel has a single register. Charge from an individual pixel can be quickly transferred into its register in the microsecond time scale. These charges <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> read out of the chip and stored in a serial [...] "read" [...] process that takes more time than the transfer to the register. The Shimadzu camera is based on a chip where each pixel has 103 registers. Charge from the pixel can then be transferred into these registers such that the image sequence is stored [...] "on chip" [...] and then read out well after the event of interest is over. The advantage to this approach is that cameras based on this chip can capture 30 to 1 million frames per second at full CCD Resolution. The disadvantage is that you can only capture 103 frames of data. The main use of this type of imaging system is one where the event takes place between 50 Âµs and 2 ms, such as applications with Split-Hopkinson pressure bar, stress analysis, light-gas gun, target impact studies and DIC (Digital Image Correlation).|$|E

A Lean Assessment Tool (LAT) is used for assessing the overall performance of lean practices within a system, while a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) can be used for the optimization of such systems operations. Lean improvements are typically suggested after a LAT has been deployed, but validation of such improvements is rarely carried out.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a surge in {{interest}} in using video-microscopy techniques to infer the local mechanical properties of disordered solids.

We use source signals in the scene, also at unknown locations, to estimate time-of-arrival and direction-of-arrival between sources and sensors.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an Information Technology (IT) -based system called AMADEUS for real-time and adaptive geologic mapping, analysis, and design of underground space. Advances in IT, particularly in digital imaging, data management, visualization and computation can significantly improve analysis, design and construction of underground excavations. Using IT, real-time data on geology and excavation response is gathered during the construction using non-intrusive techniques which do not require expensive and time-consuming instrumentation. The real-time data <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> used to update the geological and computational models of the excavation, and to determine the optimal rate of excavation, excavation sequence and structural support.

40|$|Simulation of metasurfaces usually needs many {{computational}} {{resources and}} is time-consuming. This paper introduces susceptibilities into FDTD {{to accelerate the}} speed of metasurfaces analysis based on Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs). Susceptibilities are uniquely determined by {{the size and shape}} of scattering particles of metasurfaces, which are a homogenization of a unit cell. To simulate a metasurface, the physical scattering particles constructing the metasurface are first mapped into a distribution of susceptibilities. The distribution of susceptibilities <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> analyzed by our method named FDTD-GSTC. The results of our method agrees well with HFSS and conventional FDTD. The consumed time of our method is 10 times shorter than conventional FDTD and number of grids in problem space of our method is 3 times less than conventional FDTD.

A lightweight parameterization of our model enjoys a â 300 % reduction in parameter size compared to the ESIM and DIIN, while maintaining competitive performance. Visual analysis shows that our propagated features are highly interpretable, opening new avenues to explainability in neural NLI models...|$|E

40|$|When {{combining}} a set {{of learned}} models to form an improved estimator, the issue of redundancy in the set of models must be addressed. Existing methods for addressing this problem have failed to perform robustly, especially as the redundancy in the set of learned models increases. Recently, a variant of principal components regression, PCR*, demonstrated that these limitations could be overcome by mapping the original learned models to {{a set of}} principal components and then choosing which components to include in the final regression. Weights for the original learned models <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> derived from the weights of the principal components regression. The focus {{of this paper is to}} compare PCR*'s cross-validation-based stopping criteria for choosing the number of principal components to existing methods. Experimental results show that existing stopping criteria are often too conservative and discard useful components leading to poor performance.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{generative}} {{approach to the}} problem of labeling images containing configurations of objects from multiple classes. The main building blocks are dense statistical models for individual objects. The models assume conditional independence of binary oriented edge variables conditional on a hidden instantiation parameter, which also determines an object support. These models <b>are</b> <b>then</b> <b>be</b> composed to form models for object configurations with various interactions including occlusion. Choosing the optimal configuration is entirely likelihood based and no decision boundaries need to be pre-learned. Training involves estimation of model parameters for each class separately. Both training and classification involve estimation of hidden pose variables which can be computationally intensive. We describe two levels of approximation which facilitate these computations: the Patchwork of Parts (POP) model and the coarse part based models (CPM). A concrete implementation of the approach is illustrated on the problem of reading zip-codes. ...|$|E
