5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
5|$|The circuit {{passed its}} final {{inspection}} in May 2016 with FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting declaring his satisfaction that the circuit {{would be ready}} {{in time for the}} race. The circuit attracted some criticism from drivers who highlighted a lack of run-off in some corners and the tight pit entry positioned at one of the fastest points on the circuit. Following problems with loose kerbs in free practice, changes were made in turns 6 and 12, where the kerbs were replaced by painted markings on the track. Further revisions were made to the pit entry ahead of qualifying, extending the white line denoting the entry lane to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> more time to react to cars entering the pit.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
25|$|The parkway has no ramps {{that connect}} {{directly}} to I-35 {{to the east}} (only <b>allowing</b> <b>drivers</b> to use O'Connor Road {{that leads to the}} parkway) and no plans for Wurzbach Parkway to extend to I-10 to the west (only <b>allowing</b> <b>drivers</b> to use the Wurzbach Road exit to connect to the parkway).|$|R

5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)—from a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, {{to the extent that}} the 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing the morning of the race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E

25|$|Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo {{chose the}} number 3 as his {{permanent}} racing number when F1's rules changed to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> {{to choose their}} own numbers for 2014 and stated on Twitter that {{part of the reason for}} his choice was that he was a fan of Earnhardt's, while his helmet design features the number stylized in the same way.|$|E
25|$|As device {{management}} {{is a very}} OS-specific topic, these drivers are handled differently by each kind of kernel design, but in every case, the kernel has to provide the I/O to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to physically access their devices through some port or memory location. Very important decisions {{have to be made}} when designing the device management system, as in some designs accesses may involve context switches, making the operation very CPU-intensive and easily causing a significant performance overhead.|$|E

25|$|Also {{as part of}} the USDoT's Urban Partnerships Congestion Initiative, San Francisco {{will receive}} USD $27 million in federal funds, {{approved}} in October 2008, to implement in 2010 an innovative parking plan called SFpark that will use rush hour pricing based on advanced technology through variable pricing according to actual demand. This new system will <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to find available parking spots by checking variable message signs, phoning a 511 service, or via the internet. Users will also be able to pay with their credit, debit or Smart Trip cards, or using their cell phones.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{can work}} on any surface, from dry {{pavement}} to frozen lakes. It reacts to and corrects skidding much faster and more effectively than the typical human driver, often before the driver is even aware of any imminent loss of control. In fact, this led to some concern that ESC could <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to become overconfident in their vehicle's handling and/or their own driving skills. For this reason, ESC systems typically inform the driver when they intervene, so that the driver knows that the vehicle's handling limits have been approached. Most activate a dashboard indicator light and/or alert tone; some intentionally allow the vehicle's corrected course to deviate very slightly from the driver-commanded direction, {{even if it is}} possible to more precisely match it.|$|E
25|$|Fintona {{today is}} linked to Omagh though the B122 that connects to the A5 Omagh to Ballygawley road about 2 miles (3km) outside Omagh. Although major {{incidents}} are rare, the road is known for having several tight turns including a near 90-degree turn that gradually climbs up about 1.5 miles (2.5km) outside Fintona and at a bridge 4 miles (6km) from Fintona near the hamlet of Tattyreagh which snakes as an S-bend. The former is known for vehicles going off the road into a neighbouring field during very icy weather. The latter bridge had reinforcement work along with the instantiation of crash barriers installed in 2012 after concerns were raised locally about its safety after several accidents along {{with the fact that}} the river that flows under the bridge often breaks its banks after heavy rainfall. Work was also completed in 2013 at the Carnlea crossroads junction about 1 mile (1.5km) outside Fintona providing a turning bay to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> coming from Omagh to turn right over the bridge without disrupting traffic from behind looking to travel straight ahead.|$|E

500|$|The event {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of [...] "baguette" [...] kerbs, a series of low-set ridges positioned {{on the outside of}} corners designed to prevent drivers from abusing track limits by forcing them to run wide to avoid them or slow down to avoid damage. The baguette kerbs were positioned one car-width from the outside of corners to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> some margin for error. Max Verstappen was critical of the changes, calling the new kerbs [...] "dangerous" [...] after damaging his car twice in free practice after having run over them. Others joined into the criticism, with Mercedes urging the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's governing body, to make changes to the kerbs.|$|E
500|$|The main {{differences}} between the Volt and the Ampera are in their styling. The Ampera has a distinctive front and rear fascia, with a large cut-out in the rear bumper. The Opel Ampera features more stylized alloy wheels as standard, and the side skirts are body-colored rather than black. In the inside there are only minor differences and both versions share the same exact powertrain and battery pack. A key operational difference was that the Ampera has four drive modes, one more than the 2011/12 model year Volt. The additional option is [...] "City Mode", which adapts battery management {{to the needs of}} commuter travel. City mode or [...] "battery hold" [...] engages the range-extender immediately, allowing to save the energy currently stored in the battery, and when switched off, the range-extender stops and the Ampera is then able to use the energy saved in the battery for pure electric driving, for example for traveling urban areas or restricted zones, such as the European low emission zones or to allow the Ampera to qualify for an exemption of the London congestion charge The 2013 model year Volt included the [...] "Hold Drive" [...] button to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> to conserve battery-pack energy for use at a particular time of their choice.|$|E

2500|$|Jenkins went winless in 1971. NHRA {{changed the}} 1972 rules to <b>allow</b> <b>drivers</b> {{with a small}} block wedge engine to run a lighter car. Jenkins used a small block-based [...] in a Chevrolet Vega fitted in the division's first tube chassis, which debuted at the 1972 Winternationals. He had a subpar 9.90 second pass in the {{untested}} Vega, qualifying 17th of the 32 entries at the season-opening event. After tuning the chassis, the car clocked low-9.6 second passes on race day and Jenkins won the event. Jenkins used the car to win five of the first eight events of the season (some of them regionals) and six of eight Nationals. Jenkins earned a total of $250,000 that year, including event and manufacturer support. He matched Wilt Chamberlain as the professional athlete with the highest salary in the United States. That year he was featured in Time magazine, the first drag racer to experience mainstream national coverage. Jenkins built a Vega in 1974 (dubbed Grumpy's Toy XI) that had several firsts which impacted future drag racing cars, including the first dry sump oiling system and a MacPherson strut front suspension. This car would give him thirteen wins in Pro Stock that year.|$|E
