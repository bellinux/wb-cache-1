5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be <b>amendable</b> in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
25|$|The patriation process saw {{the provinces}} granted {{influence}} in constitutional matters {{and resulted in}} the constitution being <b>amendable</b> by Canada only {{and according to the}} Canadian amending formula, with no role for the United Kingdom. Hence, patriation is associated with the establishment of full sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|If the {{minority}} objects, those motions are debatable (and therefore {{subject to a}} filibuster) and divisible (meaning {{the minority}} can force them to be debated, and filibustered, separately). Additionally, after the first two motions pass, but before the third does, senators can offer an unlimited number of motions to give the special committee members non-binding instructions, which are themselves debatable, <b>amendable,</b> and divisible. As a result, a determined minority can cause {{a great deal of}} delay before a conference.|$|E
25|$|The new {{biometric}} Philippine passport costs 950 pesos (approximately $21) in the Philippines or $60 abroad. Overtime processing for new passports costs {{an additional}} 250 pesos. Persons who {{take advantage of}} overtime processing get their passports within seven days for applications for Metro Manila (DFA Consular Affairs office, ASEANA, Parañaque, Alabang Town Center, SM Megamall, and Robinsons Galleria), Pampanga (Marquee Mall, Angeles and DFA Pampanga regional office), DFA Lucena regional office, and Robinsons Lipa, and 15 to 20 days in other provinces. For Filipinos abroad it will take up to 120 days. Passports previously could be amended for 100 pesos (approx. $2.50) in the Philippines or $20 abroad, although machine-readable passports are no longer <b>amendable.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Justice Ajit Nath Ray dissented and gave reasons for rejecting the basic {{features}} doctrine. He stated {{that since the}} Constitution {{is the source of}} all legal validity and is itself always valid, a constitutional amendment, being part of the Constitution itself, will also always be valid. The power to amend the Constitution is wide and unlimited, and there is neither a distinction nor any possibility of a difference between essential and non-essential features of the Constitution that may impede amendment. In fact, if Parliament's power to amend is extinguished because of essential features that are not expressly defined in the Constitution, the courts would be creating a new constitution. Justice Ray presented other problems of the basic features doctrine, criticizing it as being uncertain in scope. Without an evident definition of what the basic features are, the task of trying to amend the Constitution becomes unpredictable. In his view, all the provisions of the Constitution are essential but this does not prohibit them from being <b>amendable.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{commission}} {{operated under}} rules first {{adopted by the}} 1856 commission, and then passed down, year to year, and <b>amendable</b> by any Assay Commission, although in practice little change was made. Under the rules, the Director of the Mint called the assay commissioners to order, then introduced the federal judge who was an ex officio member, {{who presided over the}} meetings; if the judge was absent, the members elected a chairman. [...] The chairman divided the members into the committees. If there had been a change of officers at a mint, commissioners examined coins from before and after. [...] After the committees completed their work, the members re-assembled to report their findings and to vote on their report.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Harmonix and MTV Games {{released}} a new music title through rival publisher Electronic Arts, called Rock Band. It expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the Guitar Hero series by adding drum and microphone instruments, allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands. Activision followed suit {{with the release}} of Guitar Hero World Tour in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its Guitar Hero offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with Guitar Hero 5 and expansions, they introduced the titles Band Hero, geared towards more family-friendly pop music, and DJ Hero, a game based on turntablism and featuring a number of mixes. With the release of Guitar Hero 5, Activision considered the series to have moved away from its heavy metal basis into a broader selection of music. Guitar Hero 5 is the first game in the series to use {{a new version of the}} series' logo; previous games used a logo in a font with sharper [...] "points" [...] on the letters, which was considered [...] "idiosyncratic with a vengeance" [...] to match the games' emphasis on heavy metal music. Activision used the services of the Pentagram design studio to refashion the game's logo. Pentagram developed a new font, removing some of the [...] "aggressive odd" [...] features to make the typeface more suitable and <b>amendable</b> to design feature incorporation to other games such as Band Hero and DJ Hero.|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court's initial {{position}} on constitutional amendments was that {{any part of}} the Constitution was <b>amendable</b> and that the Parliament might, by passing a Constitution Amendment Act in compliance with the requirements of article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and article 368. The [...] "basic features" [...] principle was first expounded in 1964, by Justice J.R. Mudholkar in his dissent, in the case of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan. He wrote, ...|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution (Amendment) Act 1965, {{which was}} enacted {{on the same}} day as the RSIA and also came into force on 9 August 1965, made the 1963 State Constitution <b>amendable</b> by a simple {{majority}} – that is, more than 50% – of all the Members of Parliament on the second and third readings of a constitutional amendment bill. The requirement of a two-thirds majority for amendment was only restored in 1979. The justification for the reversion given by the Minister for Law, E.W. Barker, was that [...] "ll consequential amendments that have been necessitated by our constitutional advancement have now been enacted".|$|E
2500|$|An inordinate {{amount of}} {{scrutiny}} {{has been placed on}} issue of board capacity and composition to improve board performance, but those factors may become irrelevant to boards acting {{in the best interests of}} investors if the voting shares are held by the manager. If a serious conflict arises with the manager the degree to which the board can effectively act in the best interests of the fund can be neutralized in these circumstances. The voting shares give the manager complete discretion over the appointment and removal of directors; therefore controlling board composition and the ability to veto any of its decisions. [...] If the investment manager is dissatisfied with any decision, he can simply exercise his right to remove the director(s) and replace them with someone more <b>amendable</b> to the manager’s wishes.|$|E
2500|$|The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms {{is a bill}} of rights. The Charter is {{intended}} to protect certain political and civil rights of people in Canada from the policies and actions of all levels of government. [...] It exists to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights. [...] The Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was introduced {{by the government of}} John Diefenbaker in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights was only a federal statute, rather than a constitutional document. Therefore, it was limited in scope and was easily <b>amendable.</b> [...] This motivated some within government to improve rights protections in Canada. [...] The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hence, the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau enacted the Charter in 1982.|$|E
2500|$|All {{this was}} a radical {{departure}} from the laws and the lawmaking of European monarchs and elites. Over twenty drafts, Penn laboured to create his [...] "Framework of Government". He borrowed liberally from John Locke who later had a similar influence on Thomas Jefferson, but added his own revolutionary idea—the use of amendments—to enable a written framework that could evolve with the changing times. He stated, [...] "Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them." [...] Penn hoped that an <b>amendable</b> constitution would accommodate dissent and new ideas and also allow meaningful societal change without resorting to violent uprisings or revolution. Remarkably, though the Crown reserved the right to override any law it wished, Penn's skillful stewardship did not provoke any government reaction while Penn remained in his province. Despite criticism by some Quaker friends that Penn was setting himself above them by taking on this powerful position, and by his enemies who thought he was a fraud and [...] "falsest villain upon earth", Penn was ready to begin the [...] "Holy Experiment". Bidding goodbye to his wife and children, he reminded them to [...] "avoid pride, avarice, and luxury".|$|E
2500|$|Lawyer Charles Roach, a {{permanent}} resident of Canada and executive {{board member of}} Citizens for a Canadian Republic (CCR) who refused to swear the Oath of Citizenship, attempted through the courts to have struck down the requirement to pledge allegiance to the monarch to obtain citizenship. With {{the support of his}} own law firm and CCR, Roach launched a number of suits against the Crown, beginning in 1994, when he argued to the federal court that being forced to take the oath was a violation of clauses 2(b), 2(d), and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This attempt was unsuccessful, with the majority of the court ruling that [...] "he fact that the oath 'personalizes' one particular constitutional provision has no constitutional relevance, since that personalization is derived from the Constitution itself... Even thus personalized, that part of the Constitution relating to the Queen is <b>amendable,</b> and so its amendment may be freely advocated, consistently with the oath of allegiance, either by expression, by peaceful assembly or by association." [...] Further appeal of this decision to the Supreme Court was denied.|$|E
2500|$|After Penn's death, Pennsylvania slowly {{drifted away}} from a colony founded by {{religion}} to a secular state dominated by commerce. Many of Penn's legal and political innovations took root, however, as did the Quaker school in Philadelphia for which Penn issued two charters (1689 and 1701). Sometime later, the institution was renamed the William Penn Charter School. [...] "Penn Charter", a well-known secondary day school, is now the oldest Quaker school in the world. Voltaire praised Pennsylvania as the only government in the world responsible {{to the people and}} respectful of minority rights. Penn's [...] "Frame of Government" [...] and his other ideas were later studied by Benjamin Franklin as well as the pamphleteer of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine, whose father was a Quaker. Among Penn's legacies was the unwillingness to force a Quaker majority upon Pennsylvania, allowing his state to develop into a successful [...] "melting pot". In addition, Thomas Jefferson and the founding Fathers adapted Penn's theory of an <b>amendable</b> constitution and his vision that [...] "all Persons are equal under God" [...] in forming the federal government following the American Revolution. In addition to Penn's extensive political and religious treatises, he wrote nearly 1,000 maxims, full of wise observations about human nature and morality.|$|E
