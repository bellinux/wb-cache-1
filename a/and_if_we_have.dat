500|$|William Bertram Turrill {{introduced}} the term [...] "alpha taxonomy" [...] {{in a series}} of papers published in 1935 and 1937 in which he discussed the philosophy and possible future directions of the discipline of taxonomy. … there is an increasing desire amongst taxonomists to consider their problems from wider viewpoints, to investigate the possibilities of closer co-operation with their cytological, ecological and genetical colleagues and to acknowledge that some revision or expansion, perhaps of a drastic nature, of their aims and methods, may be desirable … Turrill (1935) has suggested that while accepting the older invaluable taxonomy, based on structure, and conveniently designated [...] "alpha", it is possible to glimpse a far-distant taxonomy built upon as wide a basis of morphological and physiological facts as possible, and one in which [...] "place is found for all observational and experimental data relating, even if indirectly, to the constitution, subdivision, origin, and behaviour of species and other taxonomic groups". Ideals can, it may be said, never be completely realized. They have, however, a great value of acting as permanent stimulants, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some, even vague, ideal of an [...] "omega" [...] taxonomy we may progress a little way down the Greek alphabet. Some of us please ourselves by thinking we are now groping in a [...] "beta" [...] taxonomy.|$|E
500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
2500|$|Cosgrave said [...] "I am {{not going}} to {{hesitate}} if the country is to live, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to exterminate ten thousand Republicans, the three million of our people is greater than this ten thousand" [...] In April 1923 the pro-Treaty Sinn Féin members organised a new political party called Cumann na nGaedheal with Cosgrave as leader. The following month the civil war was brought to an end, when the remaining Anti-Treaty IRA guerrillas announced a ceasefire and dumped their arms.|$|E

6000|$|... "As well as <b>we</b> expected, <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our difficulties, {{you would}} hardly {{expect me to}} tell them to a {{director}} of the Industrial Enterprise Company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of this expedient, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a boat it might {{possibly}} be done, in this mild weather; without a boat, it is impossible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} meet your husband, Mrs. Festing, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any more {{difficult}} work, hope you will let me have him again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Juanita Haydock led the mutiny: [...] "Look here, Carol, don't be so bossy. After all, we're {{doing this}} play principally {{for the fun}} of it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> fun out of a lot of monkey-shines, why then----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I must {{search and}} consider,' said Anne; 'I will hunt him out when I go home, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a print of him, {{and if he}} is tolerably good-looking, I will see what I can do with him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} gone very hard with us, for they are splendid skirmishers <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not had guns with us to effectually prevent them from concentrating anywhere, and had had to depend upon rifle fire alone, I have some doubts whether our little force {{would have been able}} to make its way through the defiles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, George, we haven't got 'em. We couldn't hold such a quantity. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> them, <b>we</b> {{should be}} ruined {{to sell them}} at such prices as that. I did {{want to do a}} genuine trade in stockings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Badly, badly; but Holstein {{will be up}} in {{a quarter}} of an hour, and then <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> another try. <b>We</b> broke their line badly, last time; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had cavalry to launch at them, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> managed the business." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{answer to}} that depends upon ourselves. Have we pride enough to attempt still to lead mankind, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> have we the wisdom and the quality? Or are we just the {{children}} of Good Luck, who are being found out? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{are we to}} do?" [...] asked Mr. Clifford despairingly. [...] "We cannot {{live without}} light, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> light he will {{certainly}} creep to the entrance and shoot us. He is quite mad now; I am sure of it from his voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now a night's {{sleep and}} an early start in the morning," [...] said John Bellew. [...] "If we aren't storm-bound at the summit we'll make Dyea to-morrow night, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> luck in {{catching}} a steamer we'll be in San Francisco in a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had {{not been}} at Killaloe when Mr. Monk was here, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not,--had not,--oh dear, if I had not loved you so very much, you might have {{remained}} in London, and that lady would have been your wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{touch and}} go, Ben; {{but there was}} a rock just outside you, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not checked her a bit her head would have gone across it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> it had, I would not have given a red cent for your lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I speak; as I find, Mr Sweedlepipes,' said Mrs Gamp. 'Forbid {{it should}} be otherways! But we never knows wot's hidden in each other's hearts; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> glass winders there, we'd need keep the shetters up, some on us, I do assure you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We must fancy {{ourselves}} in Spain,' said Lady Annabel; 'it {{is not difficult}} in this wild green valley; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not rosemary, we have scents as sweet. Nature is our garden here, Venetia; and I do not envy even the statues and cypresses of our villa of the lake.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, señor; {{you will}} find her useful. You have already seen that she can cook well; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> José {{to look after the}} animals when we are searching among the hills, {{you will find}} it not unpleasant, when we return of an evening, to find a hot supper ready for us." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{much prefer}} our self-won information; [...] <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Marshal Soult at Landsberg here, [...] [Which {{seems to be}} truth, despite this man,] [...] And Dupont hard upon us at Albeck, [...] With Ney not far from Gunzburg; somewhere here, [...] Or further down the river, lurking Lannes, [...] Our game's to draw off southward--if we can! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were indeed; but not {{far behind}} us the tide of {{population}} pours across the plain, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stayed {{a year or two}} in the timber, it would have caught us up. That flood won't stop until it reaches the Polar Sea." ...|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{suggests}} {{that we should not}} lament the fact that so little ancient literature has survived. The [...] "most esteemed" [...] works of the time have come down to us, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> kept everything from antiquity, <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> no room for modern endeavours.|$|R
6000|$|Blake laughed. [...] "We were, but not {{far behind}} us the tide of {{population}} pours across the plain, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stayed {{a year or two}} in the timber, it would have caught us up. That flood won't stop until it reaches the Polar Sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{heard he}} was coming down," [...] replied Poke Stover. [...] "Well, he's a {{wonderful}} old fighter, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any trouble with the Mexicans ye can reckon on it as how he'll be to the front from the very start." [...] How true was the old frontiersman's prediction the future chapters of our tale will show.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can {{get near}} it before the moon sets, and will try to pass through by daylight. It would be useless {{attempting}} to make {{our way through the}} trees at night; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to fight, I would rather do so in the light. We will lie down now, for I own I am completely tired out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our vegetables, moreover, surpass all comment; Art (by {{the means}} of glass) has wrung fruit out of the bosom of Nature, such as she grants to no other clime. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no {{vineyards}} on our hills, we have gold to purchase their best produce. Nature, and enterprise that masters Nature, have done everything for our land.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say {{the same}} thing, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing more than the}} weather to contend with, we might {{preserve}} our health," [...] I said. [...] "I did not know you were at Bonaventure, or I should have ridden over to pay my respects to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{ended the}} story of the coming of the Englishmen, and of how Ralph lost his wealth and rank. We never heard or saw more of them, seeing that in those days before the great Trek we did not write letters, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>we</b> should not <b>have</b> known where to send them, nor did the post-cart pass the door twice a week as it does in this overcrowded land of Natal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, my man," [...] said Jock with London {{sharpness}} and impudence, [...] "if {{you want}} to bully us into tipping you, it's no go. We've only got one copper between us, and nothing else but our knives; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't do such a sneaking thing!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [The Irish] {{are taught}} from their cradles that English rule is the [...] {{cause of all}} their miseries. They were as ill off under their own [...] chiefs; but they would bear from their natural leaders what they will [...] not bear from us, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not made their lot more wretched we [...] have not made it any better.|$|E
6000|$|... "This section {{lay fallow}} a long time," [...] replied Dorn. [...] "Snow lasted {{here on this}} north slope quite a while. My father used a method of soil {{cultivation}} intended to conserve moisture. The seed wheat was especially selected. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> rain during the next ten days this section of Bluestem will yield fifty bushels to the acre." ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly: Conscience {{will direct}} us to love God, {{and to put}} our whole trust and {{confidence}} in him. Our love of God will inspire us with a detestation for sin, as what is of all things most contrary to his divine nature; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an entire confidence in him, that {{will enable us to}} subdue and despise all the allurements of the world.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh DEAR!' said Mrs Milvey, 'I am SO sorry! Mr Rokesmith took SUCH an {{interest}} in Lizzie Hexam, when we were there before. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ONLY known of his face, <b>we</b> COULD <b>have</b> given him something that would have kept it down long enough for so SHORT a purpose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} light two more lanterns, Karl. Leave {{the one on}} the wall burning. We will take the others. We shall want them, for one cannot see a horse's length away; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not the sound of firing to guide us, we should soon lose our way altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The franc tireurs of Dijon may thank their lucky {{stars that}} they sent down spies to Saverne today, Percy; and {{especially}} that we, {{of all the}} members of the corps, were selected. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not been where we were, just at that moment, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not understood English, it would have been all up with the corps, and no mistake." ...|$|R
