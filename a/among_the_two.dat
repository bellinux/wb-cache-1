5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) on the margins of the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War {{was officially}} {{concluded}} with the capitulation of the Empire of Japan, plans for trying the major German and Japanese war criminals were quickly implemented in 1946. While Japanese officials {{had to face}} the Tokyo Trials, major German war crimes were dealt with at the Nuremberg Trials. Here it was the goal of the Allied prosecutors to portray the limited cooperation between the Third Reich and Imperial Japan as a long-planned conspiracy to divide the world <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Axis-partners and thereby delivering just another demonstration of the common viciousness expressed by alleged joint long-term war plans. According to modern historic research, however, such a conspiracy did not exist and is considered Allied propaganda. Although there was a limited and cautious military cooperation between Japan and Germany during the Second World War, no documents corroborating any long-term planning or real coordination of military operations of both powers exist.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{political}} {{aspect of the}} first Louis-Schmeling bout would later be dwarfed by the crucible of the later 1938 rematch, brewing political sentiment would inevitably attach itself to the fight. Adolf Hitler had become chancellor of Germany three years previously and, although the United States and Germany were not yet political or military enemies, there was some tension building <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> countries as the Nazi Party began asserting its pro-Aryan, anti-Jewish ideology.

Eventually Il Palazzo and Kabapu become aware of each other's manipulations and escalate their plans. Excel finds herself being replaced by a impersonator who heads the ILL Corporation. Massive amounts of money is spent on elections and politics. Eventually the members of Across begin making appeals directly to the City's citizens before Il Palazzo publicly declares the existence of Across and its intentions to the public. Hyatt is captured and Excel and Elgala are later held in an immigrant detention center before being rescued by Il Palazzo, who begins the new phase of his plans.|$|E

Manuel supported his brothers, Ladislaus II and later Stephen IV, as his successors; both had spent time at the Byzantine court as exiles, and Stephen IV had even married Manuel's niece Maria Komnene (who was also the first cousin of the Kontostephanoi brothers). This was opposed by Géza's eldest son, Stephen III, who in 1162 expelled Stephen IV from the country. A prolonged conflict ensued, not only over the succession, but also over possession of Dalmatia and the region around Sirmium, disputed <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> realms. In 1164, Stephen IV invaded Hungary on his own account, but had to be rescued by an army under Andronikos. Soon after, he was poisoned by agents of his nephew.|$|E
