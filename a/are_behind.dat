It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands <b>are</b> <b>behind</b> his back touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E

She initially tells only Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) of the diagnosis, and is determined to continue to work. The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to be suffering from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction <b>are</b> <b>behind</b> her illness.|$|E
5|$|Two {{different}} kelly pool-based derivations for {{behind the}} eight ball {{are provided in}} diverse sources. As noted, in kelly pool each player is randomly assigned a specific ball of the fifteen ball rack, which must be made in numerical order. The game ends when any player makes his assigned ball. Based on these rules, one origin theory holds that when {{a large number of}} players are participating, players assigned balls numerically higher than 8that is, balls that <b>are</b> <b>behind</b> the 8 ball in orderhave little chance of winning. This {{is a result of the}} likelihood that random distribution will result in multiple players with assigned balls numbered lower than 8 having an opportunity to shoot first, and that with such large a number of players at least one will come to the table with the opportunity to shoot at his assigned ball.|$|E

5|$|Back in Detroit, Sarif {{admits to}} Adam that the Illuminati <b>are</b> <b>behind</b> the attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his {{involvement}} in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod {{in the wake of a}} staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they <b>are</b> <b>behind</b> the line of scrimmage. To qualify as a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
