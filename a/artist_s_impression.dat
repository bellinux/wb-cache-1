40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, Marsha Linehan, Ph. D., {{developed}} a manualized treatment for chronically parasuicidal borderline clients called Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 33 - 34) This experiment {{involved the}} recall of a complex event, with particular emphasis placed on the impressionistic, subjective aspects of that event. Following Bartlett (1932) {{it was assumed that}} impressions, as well as ???facts??? are part of what is stored in memory, and that remembering is a constructive process in which both stored and present information are utilized. To measure <b>impression,</b> <b>Ss</b> were given a series of statements on a Likert-like scale about a paper by Milgram (1967) from a popular magazine. This stimulus material was followed by additional ???treatment??? material at varying time intervals subsequent to the reading of this article. The treatment material was a critical evaluation of another study by Milgram, designed to alter <b>Ss</b> <b>impressions</b> of Milgram and his paper (the stimulus material). The three time intervals chosen were: immediately after the stimulus, one hour later, and two days following this initial presentation. See more in text...|$|R
