5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
25|$|In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings {{raided the}} largely defenceless Frisian and Frankish towns {{lying on the}} coast and along the rivers of the Low Countries. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up {{long-term}} bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. They set up bases in Saint-Florent-le-Vieil {{at the mouth of}} the Loire, in Taillebourg on the mid Charente, also around Bayonne on the banks of the Adour, in Noirmoutier <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> on the River Seine (Rouen) in what would become Normandy.|$|E

25|$|Augustus circa 27 B.C. {{restored}} Juba II to {{the throne}} as King of Mauretania (to {{the east of the}} Province of Africa). Educated at Rome <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> a client king, Juba also wrote books about the culture and history of Africa, and a best seller about Arabia, writings unfortunately lost. He married Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. After his reign, his kingdom and other lands of the Maghrib were annexed as the Roman Provinces of Mauritania Caesaria and Mauritania Tingitana (approximately the western coast of modern Algeria and northern Morocco).|$|E
25|$|The first ghost {{station to}} reopen to {{passenger}} traffic was Jannowitzbrücke (U8) on 11 November 1989, {{two days after}} the fall of the Wall. It was equipped with a checkpoint within the station akin to Friedrichstraße, where East German customs and border control were provisionally installed to facilitate passengers heading to or coming from East Berlin. Hand-drawn destination signs were hung up covering the old ones from pre-1961; these signs were both crumbling from age <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> missing the termini of post-1961 line extensions. On 22 December 1989, Rosenthaler Platz (U8) was reopened with a similar provisional checkpoint.|$|E
25|$|Mutants & Masterminds game {{mechanics}} {{are based}} on the OGL d20 System, designed by Wizards of the Coast, however it is a highly modified version of that basic system. The largest differences pertain to character creation, injury and damage, and hit points, as well as the addition of Hero Points <b>and,</b> <b>obviously,</b> super powers. There are also numerous other differences such as the elimination of character classes and attacks of opportunity, a modified Skill list, a very different Feat selection, and the fact that any equipment possessed is considered a part of the character and purchased {{in a manner similar to}} powers.|$|E

25|$|He bowls fast <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> scorns to {{conserve}} his strength. He is {{in a hurry}} to be at the batsman. He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. With it all, his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E
25|$|The rabbis of the Middle Ages {{discussed}} {{the issue of}} people eating milk and meat {{at the same table}}. Jacob ben Asher suggested that each individual should eat from different tablecloths, while Moses Isserles argued that a large <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> unusual item should be placed between the individuals, as a reminder to avoid sharing the foods. Later rabbinic writers pointed out exceptions to the rule. Chaim ibn Attar, an 18th-century kabbalist, ruled that sitting at the same table as a non-Jew eating non-kosher food was permissible; Yechiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-century rabbi, argued that the risk was sufficiently reduced if individuals sat far enough apart {{that the only way to}} share food was to leave the table.|$|E
25|$|The skeletons {{within the}} {{enclosure}} of the lion monument are generally accepted {{to be the}} remains of the Sacred Band, as the number given by Plutarch was probably an approximation. However, historians such as Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond, Karl Julius Beloch, and Vincenzo Costanzi {{do not believe that the}} lion monument marks the location of the Sacred Band dead. Hammond claims it was the place where Philip turned his army around during the Battle of Chaeronea and believes that it contains the members of the Macedonian right flank who perished. He argues that it is highly improbable that the Thebans would be able to commemorate their dead within Philip's lifetime with such a massive <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> expensive monument.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} Hanukkah is alluded {{to in the}} book of 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees. The eight-day rededication of the temple is {{described}} in 1 Maccabees 4:36 et seq, though the name of the festival and the miracle of the lights do not appear here. A story similar in character, <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees 1:18 et seq according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.|$|E
25|$|On {{arrival at}} the site of the {{accident}} the members of the (surgical) team made their way towards the front of the train, where they were confronted with scenes of utter devastation beyond their previous experience. The third carriage had been cleared of all but one live casualty trapped by her limbs. This passenger was successfully released about one hour later by the surgical member of the resuscitation team. The second carriage had been cleared of the living but there were several victims who were trapped <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> dead. The front carriage was an indescribable tangle of twisted metal and in it the living and the dead were heaped together, intertwined among themselves and the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{although}} {{players with}} suspect actions now {{tend to be}} reported for investigations rather than suffering a public trial in front of spectators by being no-balled, umpires still {{have the right to}} call bowlers on the field if necessary. Such a case might occur when a bowler decides to deliberately <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> throw the odd ball in a manner akin to a javelin throw as a surprise. Such cases have occurred throughout history of a bowler whose general action is not of concern but for whatever reason has appeared to deliberately throw a ball with a vastly different action. The Australian Test bowler Laurie Nash was once no-balled in such circumstances in the 1930s, with the journalists present opining that he had deliberately thrown the ball.|$|E

25|$|As to Escort Carriers, two “Escort Carriers” (AVG/CVE Types) {{following}} the general {{design of the}} USS Long Island (acquired March 1941) were built prior to December 1941 with one being siphoned-off by the UK. During {{the first half of}} 1942, four CVE’s were commissioned with two going to the UK with the other two being assigned to the US Navy with one each to the Pacific and Atlantic. In the last half of 1942, fifteen CVE’s were commissioned with six going to the UK, and {{all but one of the}} US Navy units initially assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. The US manned CVE’s carried a more robust air wing the previous UK-built/manned vessels <b>and,</b> <b>obviously,</b> the UK units were not assigned to the daunting tasks facing the US Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{per capita}} water use in Latin America varies greatly among countries, among {{cities in the}} same country, and between urban and rural areas, <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> among those with a house connection, a public tap or no {{improved}} water source at all. The average net urban water use (i.e. excluding distribution losses) was estimated at about 240 liter/capita/day, a level that is about as high as in the United States and almost {{twice as high as}} in Central Europe. The highest water use can be found in some utilities in Chile and Argentina, where water resources are abundant and water use is almost 500 liter/capita/day. The lowest water use is in Aguas de Illimani serving La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, with less than 50 liter/capita/day. In rural areas water use is sometimes even lower than this level.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus {{it was very hard to}} provision those of the highest rank <b>and</b> <b>obviously</b> impossible to find a substitute to do their work. Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E
