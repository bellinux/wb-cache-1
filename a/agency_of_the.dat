5|$|About {{twelve hours}} after {{reaching}} typhoon status, Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening. In a 24‑hour period, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity, from 85 to 160mph (140 to 260km/h 1-min winds), while the pressure dropped 69mbar {{to a minimum}} of 898mbar; based on the estimated intensity, the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon. The JMA, which is the official <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western Pacific, assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115mph (185km/h 10-min winds), with a pressure of 915mbar. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall mesovorticy, which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone. Additionally, concentric eyewalls developed {{in the center of}} Oliwa, which typically occur in strong typhoons.|$|E

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical support. It supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department of Defense.|$|E
