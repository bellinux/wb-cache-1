5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} means to reduce arcing time is to use an arc eliminator that will extinguish the arc within a few milliseconds. The arc eliminator operates in 1-4 ms and creates a 3-phase short-circuit on {{another part of the}} system, typically upstream at higher voltages. This device contains a fast contact pin that upon activation by an external relay, makes physical contact with the energized bus which then creates the short-circuit. The arc eliminator will protect a human if they are {{standing in front of the}} <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> <b>event</b> and the relays detect the arc flash by diverting the arc flash to another location, although the diversion may cause a system failure at the location the short-circuit was diverted to.

40|$|Although {{arc flash}} {{has been a}} concern amongst the {{electrical}} industry for many years, it is only relatively recently that standards by the IEEE have been established on calculating {{the amount of energy}} behind an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> <b>event.</b> However, these standards only apply to AC systems, where extensive testing and research have been performed. Although the NFPA has provided recommendations on how to calculate the incident energy for DC arc flash events, these have not become the defining standard like those seen for AC. One equation outlined in the NFPA 70 E, the Maximum Power Method, does provide engineers with a formula to calculate DC arc flash incident energy but as the NFPA states this can be quite conservative. However, the NFPA 70 E also mentions a Detailed Arcing Current and Energy Calculations Method which contains formulas proposed by various researchers who conducted their own DC arc flash testing but there is scarce info on how these methods compare to the Maximum Power Method. This paper will investigate the relative power of two of the formulas proposed in the alternate method, the results from Stokes/Oppenlander and the results from Paukert, over a variety of parameters that affect DC arcing power. These will then be compared to relative power of the Maximum Power Method, as well as the relative power of the AC equations formed from measurements. Although the results in this paper are not aiming to be a defining standard, the aim is to provide engineers with information on when one methodology is more suitable to use for a given set of certain parameters...|$|E

Additional benefits include reduced collateral damage, lower production downtime and potentially lower personal protective equipment (PPE) require-ments.

40|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>events</b> occur due to faults in {{electrical}} equipment {{combined with a}} significant release of energy across an electrical arc. Due to the large energy release, plasma is generated, pressures increase, and the plasma expands. Under these conditions the plasma becomes excited enough to liquefy metal causing physical damage to equipment and any humans in the vicinity. This thesis investigates the state of art for detection of <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> <b>events</b> and investigates a method of improving detection reliability, and speed by monitoring the high frequency voltage / current patterns utilizing methods similar to <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> circuit interrupters (AFCI). A second alternative detection approach is determined through analysis of the physics of plasma development. The current state of art is based upon light detection. However this thesis experimentally investigates what happens before the arc event emits visible light. The results show that current flows to ground during an arc event slightly prior {{to the production of}} light. Further it shows through analysis of the physics of plasma that a high speed plasma detector has the potential to identify an arc event before the presence of visible light.

40|$|International audienceArc flash is a {{constant}} hazard when discussing industrial safety, however, {{little is known about}} the <b>arc</b> <b>flash.</b> Current safety standards require the use of the NFPA 70 E equation to establish safety limits for <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazards. However, when compared to an empirically derived model, these safety limits are much too low to account for all working conditions. A comparison of these two methods will lead to the conclusion that <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> safety distances must be increased. 1. Introduction. In industrial electrical safety, <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazards can be some of the most disastrous and deadly accidents in the work place. An <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> can reach temperatures of over 35000 degC and cause an explosion with a blast force of 2000 psi and an audible report of over 140 decibels. At a current of just 0. 5 Amps, an electrical shock, such as the shock generated from an <b>arc</b> <b>flash,</b> will stop the heart of an adult. [1]. Current <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> safety codes require that the worker be at a distance that, if an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> were to occur, would only result in 2 nd degree burns. The current accepted standard for <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> energy calculations is given by the NFPA 70 E equation, which was derived experimentally. However, an empirical approach to determining arc energy will be derived in this paper and the results compared and examined...|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} {{safety risk}} to electrical personnel {{working on an}} energised switchboard is the hazard of exposure to <b>arc</b> <b>flash,</b> which has gained increasing attention over the past decade. Although reported <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> injuries are infrequent compared to other electrical injuries, especially electric shock, the very high costs associated with these <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> injuries make them {{one of the most}} important categories to avoid in an industrial workplace. The main objective of this project is to conduct <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> studies for switchboards installed at Fortescue’s Solomon Hub to quantify the existing <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard posed by this type of equipment. The aim of the study is to find feasible solutions to reduce <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> incident energy to less than 8 cal/cm 2 and to provide appropriate <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> PPE recommendations. Switchboards with voltage levels of 0. 4 kV, 0. 69 kV, 6. 6 kV, 11 kV and 33 kV were investigated. The <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> calculations were conducted using the IEEE 1584 - 2002 Standard, IEEE Guide for Performing Arc-Flash Hazard Calculations. The study found that many switchboards have dangerous incident energy levels that must be reduced, in order to allow energised work on the equipment. To mitigate the hazard, three simple solutions were proposed: optimise protection settings, install maintenance switches and remote operation. Firstly, optimising protection settings is the least expensive solution to reduce the operating time of protection devices, and hence limit <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> incident energy exposure. Secondly, where a permanent setting will violate the grading requirement of the system, then installing maintenance switches is proposed. Thirdly, where the first two strategies cannot be implemented because they will violate the grading requirement of the system, then remote operation is proposed. This will eliminate the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard because personnel will operate the equipment outside the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> boundary. If the recommendations of this study are implemented, the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> incident energy of the switchboards will significantly reduce to not greater than 8 cal/cm 2. The implications are improved safety for personnel, given that energy levels on many switchboards currently pose a significantly higher <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} methods of {{protecting}} personnel from <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazards. This can include personnel wearing <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> {{personal protective equipment}} (PPE) or modifying the design and configuration of electrical equipment. The best way to remove the hazards of an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> is to de-energize electrical equipment when interacting with it, however de-energizing electrical equipment is {{in and of itself}} an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. In this case, one of the newest solutions is to allow the operator to stand far back from the electrical equipment by operating equipment remotely, this is called remote racking.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> {{is a type}} of {{electrical}} explosion that results from a low impedance connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system.

50|$|Three {{key factors}} {{determine}} {{the intensity of}} an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> on personnel.

5000|$|The {{radiant energy}} {{released}} by an electric arc {{is capable of}} permanently injuring or killing a human being at distances of up to 20 ft. The distance from an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> source within which an unprotected person has a 50% chance of receiving a second degree burn {{is referred to as}} the [...] "flash protection boundary". The incident energy of 1.2 cal/cm^2 on a bare skin was selected in solving the equation for the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> boundary in IEEE 1584. The IEEE 1584 <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> boundary equations can also be used to calculate the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> boundaries with boundary energy other than 1.2 cal/cm^2 such as onset to 2nd degree burn energy. Those conducting flash hazard analyses must consider this boundary, and then must determine what PPE should be worn within the flash protection boundary. Remote operators or robots can be used to perform activities that have a high risk for <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> incidents, such as inserting draw-out circuit breakers on a live electrical bus. Remote racking systems are available which keep the operator outside the <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard zone.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Federal {{regulations}} {{have recognized that}} <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazards are a critical source of potential injury. As a consequence, {{in order to work}} on some electrical equipment, the energy source must be completely shut-down. However, power distribution systems in mission critical facilities such as hospitals and data centers must sometimes remain energized while being maintained. In recent years the <b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> Hazard Analysis has emerged as a power system tool that informs the qualified technician of the incident energy at the equipment to be maintained and recommends the proper protective equipment to wear. Due to codes, standards and historically acceptable design methods, the <b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> Hazard is often higher and more dangerous than necessary. This dissertation presents detailed methodology and proposes alternative strategies to be implemented at the design stage of 600 volt facility power distribution systems which will decrease the <b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> Hazard Exposure when compared to widely used code acceptable design strategies. Software models have been developed for different locations throughout a power system. These software model simulations will analyze the <b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> Hazard in a system designed with typical mainstream code acceptable methods. The model will be changed to show implementation of <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> mitigation techniques at the system design level. The computer simulations after the mitigation techniques will show significant lowering of the <b>Arc</b> <b>Flash</b> Hazard Exposure...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{examples}} of an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> occurs when an incandescent light bulb burns out.

[...] Most 480 V electrical services have sufficient capacity to cause an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. Medium-voltage equipment (above 600 V) is higher potential and therefore a higher risk for an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> hazard. Higher voltages can cause a spark to jump, initiating an <b>arc</b> <b>flash</b> without the need for physical contact, and can sustain an arc across longer gaps. Most powerlines use voltages exceeding 1000 volts, and can be an arc-flash hazard to birds, squirrels, people, or equipment such as vehicles or ladders. <b>Arc</b> <b>flashes</b> are often witnessed from lines or transformers just before a power outage, creating bright flashes like lightning that can be seen for long distances.|$|R
