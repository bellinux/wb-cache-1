Perfiuorinated surfactants are an important class of specialty chemicals {{that are used in}} AFFF agents and have physio-chemical properties that differentiate them from hydrocarbon surfactants. In the past, the environmental behavior of perfluorinated surfactants has received little attention, and how the unique properties affect the behavior of perfluorinatedsurfactants in the environment and their potential impact on co-contaminant transport and biodegradation are unknown. An analytical method was developed to determine perfluorocarboxylates in groundwater. Solid-phase extraction and in-vial derivatization techniques were used to form the methyl esters of perfluorocarboxylates that were then analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Perfluorocarboxylates containing 6 to 8 carbons were detected in groundwater samples collected from Naval Air Station Fallon, NV, Tyndall Air Force Base, FL, and Wurtsmith Air Force Base, MI, with total concentrations Redacted for privacy ranging from 3 to 7, 090 p. g/L. The homologous series of perfluorocarboxylates observed in groundwater from the three military sites as well as in commercial AFFF mixtures consisted of even and odd number perfluorinated carboxylates, which is indicative of the electrochemical fluorination synthesis process. At Wurtsmith Air Force Base, MI, perfluorocarboxylates detected 500 m from the source area were estimated to have a minimum residence time of 5 to 15 years. Additionally, the perfluorocarboxylate concentrations observed in groundwater are significantly lower than the corresponding methylene blue active substances concentrations, which indicates that there are additional anionic surfactant species present in the groundwater.

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) {{are used}} to impart oil- and water-repellant and {{surfactant}} properties to numerous products, and {{they are among the}} most persistent chemicals to ever enter commerce. PFAAs are detected in the blood of humans all over the world. The two 8 -carbon PFAAs, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), have been associated with a number of adverse health outcomes. Compounds capable of transforming to PFAAs, known as PFAA precursors, are a potentially important but poorly-understood source of indirect PFAA exposure. Unlike the PFAAs, there are many types of PFAA precursors, some of which are not publically known, and analytical standards for their measurement are often unavailable. Thus, a central challenge to characterizing PFAA precursor occurrence is a lack of available analytical tools to measure them. In this research, a new oxidation-based technique of PFAA precursor measurement was developed for aqueous and solid samples. Along with other analytical tools, this precursor assay was used to gain insight into the occurrence and fate of PFAA precursors in two sources: urban runoff and soil and groundwater impacted by firefighting materials known as <b>aqueous</b> <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>foams</b> (AFFF). The occurrence of PFAA precursors in urban runoff was investigated {{to determine the extent to}} which runoff could serve as a source of PFAAs to drinking water supplies during storage in aquifers or reservoirs. An indirect technique of measuring PFAA precursors was developed for urban runoff samples by exposing samples to a high concentration of hydroxyl radicals and converting precursors to measureable perfluorinated carboxylate products (Chapter 2). By comparing perfluorinated carboxylate concentrations before and after oxidation, the total concentration of PFAA precursors was inferred. Analysis of thirty-three urban runoff samples collected from locations around the San Francisco Bay, CA indicated that C 8 forms of PFAAs and C 6 forms of PFAA precursors were predominant in runoff. The assay demonstrated that commonly measured PFAA precursors represented only a small fraction (< 25 %) of the total concentration of precursors present in runoff, confirming the utility of the precursor assay. To assess the persistence of AFFF-derived PFAA precursors, groundwater, soil, and aquifer solids were obtained in 2011 from an unlined firefighter training area at a U. S. Air Force Base where AFFF was regularly used between 1970 and 1990 (Chapter 3). To measure the total concentration of PFAA precursors in archived AFFF formulations and AFFF-impacted environmental samples, the oxidation-based assay developed in Chapter 2 was adapted for these media. This precursor assay was employed along with direct measurement of twenty-two precursors found in AFFF and a suite of other poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). On a molar basis, precursors accounted for 41 % to 100 % of the total concentration of PFASs in archived AFFF formulations. In the training area, precursors measured by the precursor assay accounted for an average of 23 % and 28 % of total PFASs in groundwater and solids samples, respectively. Thus, much of the mass of precursors released at the site appeared to be converted to perfluorinated carboxylates and sulfonates over a residence time of twenty years or more. One precursor in AFFF, perfluorohexane sulfonamide amine, was detected at low concentrations on several highly contaminated soil and aquifer solids samples, but no other precursors also measured in AFFF formulations were detected in any samples at this field site. Suspected intermediate transformation products of precursors in AFFF that were directly measured accounted for approximately half of the total precursor concentration in samples from the training site. In order to elucidate the conditions most amenable to AFFF-derived PFAA precursor transformation, microcosms were constructed with soil and sediment inocula and were incubated under different redox conditions with two different types of AFFF (Chapter 4). Live microcosms amended with AFFF manufactured by 3 M demonstrated an ability to utilize the carbon in AFFF, but no changes in PFAS concentrations were observed over 60 - to 90 -day incubation periods. The main precursor in AFFF manufactured by Ansul, 6 : 2 fluorotelomer thioamido sulfonate (6 : 2 FtTAoS), was transformed in both aerobic and anaerobic live incubations. Under aerobic conditions, three amendments of 6 : 2 FtTAoS were completely transformed over a 90 -day incubation and 8 % of the 6 : 2 FtTAoS loss was accounted for as perfluorinated carboxylate and fluorotelomer sulfonate transformation products. Two additional aerobic transformation products containing one or two oxygen additions to 6 : 2 FtTAoS were also identified. Transformation was much slower under all anaerobic conditions, with complete transformation of 6 : 2 FtTAoS under live nitrate-reducing conditions after 200 days of incubation and 45 % to 71 % transformation of 6 : 2 FtTAoS after 320 days of incubation under sulfate-reducing, iron-reducing, and methanogenic conditions. A transformation product not observed under aerobic conditions, a carboxylate hydrolysis product of the 6 : 2 FtTAoS amide group, was identified under all anaerobic conditions. Application of the precursor assay to microcosm slurries suggested that all unquantifiable biological transformation products under aerobic conditions were partitioned to the microcosm slurry. In the anaerobic microcosms, the precursor assay indicated that unidentified biological transformation products were either sufficiently volatile to leave the slurry or unable to be oxidized to perfluorinated carboxylates. Transformation products reported in soil and groundwater beneath many U. S. military firefighter training areas (Chapter 3) are consistent with the aerobic transformation products observed in Ansul AFFF-amended microcosm...|$|R

40|$|Thin <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> on a solid surface play an {{important}} role in adhesion, spreading, and colloidal stability. These phenomena are all relevant for paint systems. Measuring surface forces in these films is an experimental challenge, and over the years several techniques have been developed to measure the interaction forces as a function of the thickness of the film, the so-called disjoining pressure isotherms. A thin film balance technique (TFB) in combination with an ellipsometer offers the possibility to study the surface forces in <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> at a silica surface. The aim of this project was twofold. Firstly, we wanted to set up the technique and test it by investigating interaction forces in thin <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> between an air interface and a solid interface (air/aqueous film/silica). Secondly, we intended to apply this technique for investigating interaction forces in <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> between an oil interface and a solid interface (oil/ aqueous film/ silica).   As happens so often in research, we were 'immersed' in the first system, and as a result of it, we did not reach the second aim. Hence, this thesis deals with the experimental investigations of the interaction forces in thin <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> between an air phase and a solid phase. A non-ionic polymeric surfactant is used as a stabilizer of these films. In addition, we have also used colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) in order to see if phenomena similar to those in wetting films might occur in the interactions between two silica surfaces, immersed in solutions of the surfactant. In chapter 1 an introduction is given to wetting films, to the surfactant used and to the technique used in the present study. A short overview of the interaction forces in wetting films and the drainage of these films is presented. As foam <b>films,</b> which are <b>aqueous</b> <b>films</b> between two air phases (air/ aqueous film/ air), have much more extensively been studied than wetting films, we also discussed drainage of foam films, as well as and an interesting finding in foam films stabilized by similar surfactants. In chapter 2 the solution behaviour of the surfactant and its adsorption on silica-water and air-water interfaces is studied using light scattering, surface tensiometry and ellipsometry. Interaction forces in wetting films stabilized by the surfactant are measured and are interpreted in terms of a disjoining pressure as a function of a thickness of the film.   Parameters of the systems are the concentration of the surfactant and the concentration of NaCl. The main findings are that addition of NaCl lowers the cmc, diminishes adsorption of the surfactant on silica, and increases the thickness of the wetting film stabilized by the surfactant. In chapter 3 we investigate the thinning of wetting <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> from <b>aqueous</b> solution of the surfactant on silica using a TFB and an ellipsometer. In addition, imaging ellipsometry is used to visualize the film structures at subsequent stages of their development. The main findings are that the thick films observed in chapter 2 are metastable. The time required for the formation of steady films strongly increases with the concentration of electrolyte. For sufficiently large amounts of salt, two characteristic relaxation regimes can be clearly identified: after initial quick thinning, further thinning slows down enormously. The interpretation we give of the observed features is that these typical kinetic regimes are the result of coupled dependencies of the bulk and interfacial properties of the surfactant on salt concentration. In chapter 4 the time-dependent thickness of wetting <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> from <b>aqueous</b> solutions of NaCl on a silica surface modified with the surfactant is revisited, because of a rather surprising finding: the thickness as a function of time could go through a maximum. It turned out that that the thickness of the films depends strongly on whether or not the surfactant was applied over the entire substrate or only at a spot coinciding with the investigated wetting film. In the former case, the thickness shows a transient thickness maximum, in the latter case, it equilibrates quickly. A possible interpretation of the transient thicknesses is given, and the equilibrium values of the thickness are discussed. In chapter 5 the effects of pH and different additives (NaCl, Na 2 SO 4, NaSCN and urea) on the adsorption of the surfactant at the interfaces of wetting films, on film drainage and on the interaction forces in these films are examined using an ellipsometer and a TFB. These additives reduce the adsorption of the surfactant on silica and all retard the drainage of the films stabilized by the surfactant. Moreover, the film destabilizes at high pH values if 0. 1 M NaCl is present. The reduction of the adsorbed amount is correlated to a dramatic slow down of film drainage. We show that these effects must be attributed to bridging attraction between a densely covered air-water interface and a very sparsely covered silica-water interface. In chapter 6 the interactions between two silica surfaces, immersed in solutions of the surfactant is studied by CP-AFM.   The main findings are that (i) there are long ranged attractive forces between bare hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces in aqueous solution; and that (ii) a weak adhesion occurs between a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic surface in the presence of the surfactant in 0. 1 M NaCl.   Results (i) can be attributed to capillary bridging and (ii) to observation bridging of the surfactant between a densely covered hydrophobic surface and a sparsely covered hydrophilic surface, thus confirming the effect found in chapter 5...|$|R

For this experiment the hypothesis is that the addition of PFHxS to a high fat and high fructose diet will exacerbate the effects of the diet alone on the development of NASH and NAFLD. For this study, we fed male mice with a standard diet or a diet rich in fructose and fat. Mice were further divided into subgroups that were controls or received PFHxS in diet.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic surface tension of <b>aqueous</b> <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> (AFFF) and fluorine-free (FF) foam {{solutions}} by pendant drop tensiometry. Additional experiments are conducted {{to measure the}} interfacial tension between the foam solutions and two hydrocarbon liquids, n-heptane and diesel oil. The pendant drop technique yields both surface and interfacial tension at time scales ranging from seconds to hours, being limited {{at the lower end}} by the time necessary to form a droplet, and at the upper end by the evaporation of the droplet’s material. The results indicate that the surface tension of AFFF formulations, diluted at the design concentration, rapidly reaches its equilibrium value. However, the approach to equilibrium is slowed down by additives, such as xanthan gum, present in the alcohol tolerant concentrates (ATC-AFFF). FF solutions show a slower approach to static values than AFFF formulations. At the design dilution, and at room temperature, these static values are in the order of 27 mN m- 1, as compared to 16 mN m- 1 for AFFF solutions. The measurements of the interfacial tension indicate rapid attainment of equilibrium for both AFFF and FF formulations, with the static values of around 2 and 0. 9 - 2. 5 mN m- 1, for AFFF and FF, respectively. With the surface tension of n-heptane and diesel oil of 20. 1 and 28. 3 mN m- 1, the spreading coefficient of FF formulations for the present systems varies between – 9. 4 and 0. 6 mN m- 1.

The results demonstrate that the col-lision dynamics depend on what type of water is mixed with AR-AFFF. o MOZ msevier seieme (USA) Key Words: droplet; impact; heated surface; boiling...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{compares the}} sealability performance of recently developed three synthetic foam formulations (that {{do not contain}} fluorosurfactants or fluoropolymers) with that of an <b>aqueous</b> <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>foam</b> (AFFF). We apply the sealability methodology outlined in the Australian Defence Force Specification, DEF(AUST) 5706. This methodology specifies a 0. 28 m 2 small-scale indoor fire pan. The pan is first filled with 10 L of water and then 5 L of AVGAS (aviation gasoline, flash point of - 50 °C) or heptane (flash point of - 4 °C) is placed {{on top of the}} water. Foams were generated from a pressurised extinguisher with a foam nozzle as described in the standard's specification, set to create foams with expansion of 4 : 1. The foam spread across the fuel until the entire fuel surface was covered with foam. At 5 min intervals, a lit taper was introduced into the space above the pan area by passing it twice around the surface of the foam in a circular motion at a height of approximately 15 mm {{from the surface of the}} foam. The results demonstrate differences in the sealability performance between AFFF and fluorine-free foams (FfreeF). Under laboratory conditions, with a foam blanket 1 - 2 cm deep, best-performing FfreeF formulation (RF 6) provides about 30 % of the durability of an AFFF for protection against evaporation of low-flashpoint flammable liquids. We also note in the results the significant differences among FfreeF with almost no sealability of AVGAS vapours offered by the two other formulations...|$|E
40|$|Exposure to <b>aqueous</b> <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> <b>foam</b> (AFFF) was {{evaluated}} in 149 firefighters working at AFFF training facilities in Australia by analysis of PFOS and related compounds in serum. A questionnaire {{was designed to}} capture information about basic demographic factors, lifestyle factors and potential occupational exposure (such as work history and self-reported skin contact with foam). The results showed {{that a number of}} factors were associated with PFAA serum concentrations. Blood donation was found to be linked to low PFAA levels, and the concentrations of PFOS and PFHxS were found to be positively associated with years of jobs with AFFF contact. The highest levels of PFOS and PFHxS were one order of magnitude higher compared to the general population in Australia and Canada. Study participants who had worked ten years or less had levels of PFOS that were similar to or only slightly above those of the general population. This coincides with the phase out of 3 M AFFF from all training facilities in 2003, and suggests that the exposures to PFOS and PFHxS in AFFF have declined in recent years. Self-reporting of skin contact and frequency of contact were used as an index of exposure. Using this index, there was no relationship between PFOS levels and skin exposure. This index of exposure is limited as it relies on self-report and it only considers skin exposure to AFFF, and does not capture other routes of potential exposure. Possible associations between serum PFAA concentrations and five biochemical outcomes were assessed. The outcomes were serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and uric acid. No statistical associations between any of these endpoints and serum PFAA concentrations were observed...|$|E

In {{this paper}} {{dolomite}} MgCa(CO₃) ₂ a naturally occurring mineral was demonstrated {{to be an}} effective foaming and stabilizing agent for aluminium with several notable advantages relative to the currently used titanium hydride foaming agent. Characteristic cell structures and microstructural features of foams produced with a dolomite foaming agent are examined and the properties of dolomite based foams produced in a one step process are compared with those produced using titanium hydride based process. The most notable structural feature of dolomite based foams is a smaller cell size and thinner cell faces. Foaming with MgCa(CO₃) ₂ also gives rise to a marked increase in the stability of molten foams with a large range of foaming temperatures possible, and an almost complete absence of melt drainage even with extended foaming times. Many of these properties are attributed to the cell surfaces being covered by a thin oxide <b>film</b> <b>formed</b> during the <b>foaming</b> process. Publicad...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Characteristics were {{described}} of the <b>foam</b> and <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> strains of Sac-charomyces cerevisiae. These strains show a thin proteic layer at the cell surface that is absent in common non-foam and non-film forming strains. In young cells the proteic layer is not visible under a Scanning Electronic Microscope. The proteic layer becomes visible in old cells of <b>foam</b> <b>forming</b> strains because their surface becomes rough after collapse and contraction of the wall. In <b>film</b> <b>forming</b> cells, the proteic layer is rigid and preserves the original {{shape of the}} cells {{in the form of}} a blister after contraction of the wall. The strict correlation between these cell wall traits and capacity of <b>forming</b> <b>foam</b> and <b>film</b> were con-firmed also by tetrad analysis of the hybrids obtained by crossing of segregants of these two types of strains...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} effects of ions on rupture and {{lifetime}} of <b>aqueous</b> <b>foam</b> <b>films</b> <b>formed</b> from sodium chloride (NaCl), lithium chloride (LiCl), sodium acetate (NaAc), and sodium chlorate (NaClO 3) using microinterferometry. In the case of NaCl and LiCl, the foam films prepared from the salt solutions below 0. 1 M were unstablethey thinned until rupturing. The film lifetime measured from the first interferogram (appearing at a film thickness {{on the order of}} 500 nm) until the film rupture was only a second or so. However, relatively long lasting and nondraining films prepared from salt solutions above 0. 1 M were observed. The film lifetime was significantly longer by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, i. e., from 10 to 100 s. Importantly, both the film lifetime and the (average) thickness of the nondraining films increased with increasing salt concentration. This effect has not been observed with foam films stabilized by surfactants. The film lifetime and thickness also increased with increasing film radius. The films exhibited significant surface corrugations. The films with large radii often contained standing dimples. There was a critical film radius below which the films thinned until rupturing. In the cases of NaAc and NaClO 3, the films were unstable at all radii and salt concentrationsthey thinned until rupturing, ruling out the effect of solution viscosity on stabilizing the films...|$|R
