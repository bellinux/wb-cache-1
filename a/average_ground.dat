The daily, monthly, seasonal and yearly <b>averaged</b> <b>ground</b> measurements of PM 10 {{mass concentration}} {{at the time when}} the satellite data is available (SATPM) were compared with the corresponding 24 hours <b>averaged</b> <b>ground</b> measurements (ALLPM). The data with the Aqua-MODIS time are more close to ALLPM than those with Terra-MODIS time, and most relative errors fall into the range of ± 20 %, indicating a high reliability of temporal representative on Aqua time. Data from both satellites were incorporated together through a linear fitting to get the validated daily and yearly SATPM. The results show a better correlation and own lower root mean square errors (RMSE) with ALLPM. Because PM 2. 5 is more correlated with optical observations, the results are also of significant implications for the reliability of PM 2. 5 retrieval from satellite. © 2013 Peking University...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{portion of}} Hughes' {{business}} interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one while filming Hell's Angels, one while setting the air speed {{record in the}} Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including Moye Stephens. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading Hughes Aircraft {{at the airport in}} Glendale, CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the Hughes H-1 Racer. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane airspeed record of [...] over his test course near Santa Ana, California (Giuseppe Motta reached 362mph in 1929 and George Stainforth reached 407.5mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new transcontinental airspeed record by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of 9 hours, 27 minutes).

40|$|A method, which {{estimates}} the lightning performance of high voltage transmission lines {{based on the}} Monte-Carlo simulation technique, is described in this paper.

The method is applied, on several operating Greek transmission lines, showing good correlation between predicted and field observation results.
