25|$|In 2002 the World Monuments Fund placed Stowe House on its List of Most Endangered Sites. The {{school had}} done {{its best to}} keep the house in good repair, {{including}} re-roofing the State Dining Room in 1990, repair of the north elevation of the West Pavilion in 1992 and the repair of the Marble Saloon's oculus skylight in 1994. On taking over ownership {{of the house in}} 1997, the Stowe House Preservation Trust commissioned a survey in order to scope the problem <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> restoration plan. The result was a six-phase plan, starting with the most urgent work. The estimated cost in 2002 for all six phases was nearly £40 million.|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. Kathryn Buxton {{found that it}} had [...] "excitement and thrills enough for audiences of all ages {{as well as a}} fun and {{sometimes}} slightly naughty sense of humor". Bruce Bailey admired the film's script, stating, [...] "Terry Jones has drawn on his dry wit and bizarre imagination <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> script that transforms these essentially familiar elements and plot structures into something that fairly throbs with new life."

500|$|Following the multi-platinum and award-winning {{success of}} her eponymous debut album in 2006, Corinne Bailey Rae {{began to work}} on songs for a {{follow-up}} album {{at the end of}} 2007. She took a hiatus from music, however, after the death of her husband, Scottish saxophonist Jason Rae, in March 2008 to an accidental overdose of methadone and alcohol. For a long period of time, Rae said, [...] "I didn't really hear any songs. Normally in my everyday life, I'd be in the car <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little line, or I'd look at something and try to describe it ... I didn't really think in that way anymore. Nothing was coming in." [...] After months of grief and isolation, Rae revisited her work the following year and composed additional material for The Sea.|$|E
500|$|German {{packaging}} company Gerresheimer {{was hired}} to produce the flacon of Elixir. It is made of clear moulded glass and has a slender gold-tinted neck. According to Jose Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, it is inspired by the bottles used in the historic medical practice of apothecary.

As the scent is inspired by the desert, she chose the tint of the bottle to be golden so that it can [...] "evoke the memories of sands and sunsets". The packaging of the fragrance was designed by Colombian artist Catalina Estrada and features colourful illustrations of various birds and leaves printed on a pale background.|$|E

500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeff Pinkner {{decided he}} wanted fellow executive producer David H. Goodman and supervising producer J. R. Orci to collaborate in writing the episode; Goodman wrote the first half, while Orci wrote {{the rest of the}} episode. The two later worked together on only one other episode, [...] "The Equation". Frederick E. O. Toye directed the episode, as he had worked previously with the writers on Alias. The writers had the idea {{for a couple of weeks}} of Olivia walking into an apartment and discovering walls covered with drawings of events that [...] "no man could possibly have known about". They wanted to take [...] "urban myths or legends of strange events" [...] <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fringe science equivalent; this led them to creating the story of Roy, a man with seemingly [...] "psychic" [...] abilities, which they then expanded by offering a real scientific explanation in the form of Walter's past research. In the show's early development, the producers were also unsure about how other aspects should be developed, such as Joshua Jackson's character Peter. For instance, in [...] "The Ghost Network", they debated whether or not Peter would break into his childhood home before finally [...] "stalling and just let him do it"; Orci came up with Peter's explanation to Olivia, that he used to live there so it wasn't really breaking in.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting to do whatever they wanted to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E

500|$|Warnings in {{the media}} led to street protests and demonstrations. Orthodox Jews marched on City Hall and to the {{construction}} site in 1986. Some even gathered at the Western Wall in a public prayer of mourning because of the center. They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point, carrying signs saying: [...] "Conversion is Murder!" [...] and [...] "Mormons, stop your mission now". Despite {{the intensity of the}} Haredi opposition, at no point did the protests become physically violent. In late 1985, the Haredim motioned for a no-confidence vote against the leading Labor Party. Prime Minister Shimon Peres organized a committee of eight, four for the center and four against, to debate the issue <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> solution either for or against the center's presence. Another committee was formed to look into the allegation that the money the church had put into Jerusalem was a bribe to gain Mayor Kolleck's support for the center (the committee found the church [...] "Not Guilty"). A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews. Some Israelis considered this discriminatory, as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem. Church leaders, however, agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after. Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church's intent, [...] believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law. One protestor stated that [...] "converting the sons of Judah, us, is a basic article of their faith[...] [...] [...] They regard themselves as sons of Joseph and believe there will be no Second Coming for as long as we and they do not fuse." ...|$|E
500|$|Yuji Horii, {{a fan of}} {{time travel}} fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the {{scenario}} of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, [...] "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of attractions to put in." [...] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing {{the majority of the}} game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as [...] "a long string of errands... 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'." [...] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an [...] "Active Time Event Logic" [...] system, [...] "where you can move your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you", and with players [...] "talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions", allowing each scene to [...] "have many permutations." [...] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.|$|E

2500|$|The steeple engine, {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "crosshead" [...] engine, was an early attempt to break away from the beam concept common to both the walking beam and side-lever types, <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smaller, lighter, more efficient design. In a steeple engine, the vertical oscillation of the piston is not converted to a horizontal rocking motion as in a beam engine, but is instead used to move an assembly, composed of a crosshead and two rods, through a vertical guide {{at the top of the}} engine which in turn rotates the crankshaft connecting rod below. In early examples of the type, the crosshead assembly was rectangular in shape, but over time it was refined into an elongated triangle. The triangular assembly above the engine cylinder gives the engine its characteristic [...] "steeple" [...] shape, hence the name.|$|E

2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew {{a lot of people who}} are really smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars.
