5|$|Following the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe {{started its}} attacks on Channel convoys <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of Britain. The primary task of JG 51 {{during this time}} was to provide fighter escort to these bomber missions. The {{commander}} of JG 51, Oberst Theo Osterkamp established a policy of unrestricted combat air patrol (freie Jagd) of fighter Staffeln providing loose protection rather than close escort to the bombers, actively seeking out Royal Air Force fighters. On 7 July 1940 Oesau claimed one Spitfire.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Wehrmacht had conquered most of Western Europe and Scandinavia. At that time, {{the only}} major power {{standing}} in the way of a German-dominated Europe was the British Empire and the Commonwealth. After having several peace offers rejected by the British, Adolf Hitler ordered the Luftwaffe to destroy the RAF in order to gain air superiority or air supremacy <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> launching Operation Sea Lion, an amphibious assault by the Wehrmacht (German armed forces) onto the British mainland.|$|E
5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> mating. One is {{a sequence of}} short squeaks; the other {{is made up of}} consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may also make the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds also make a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recitals}} {{also contain}} an express statement: [...] "the {{people of the}} territory of the Virgin Islands have over centuries evolved with a distinct cultural identity which is the essence of a Virgin Islander". This operates <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>preludes</b> <b>to</b> various provisions in the Constitution which reserve specific rights of privileges to Belongers.|$|R
50|$|In the {{confrontation}} of Beowulf and Unferð {{in the poem}} Beowulf, flytings were used <b>as</b> either <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> battle or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of combat in their own right.|$|R
50|$|Premiered on February 7, 2012 in Palm Springs, California <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> event <b>to</b> the 1st American Documentary Film Festival, the {{screening}} {{was followed by}} a choral performance by the USC Chamber Singers conducted by Jo-Michael Scheibe and accompanied by the composer on piano.|$|R
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage}} of the Uruguayan situation during late 1864 to establish his nation as a regional power. On 11 November of that year, he ordered a Brazilian civilian steamship seized, triggering the Paraguayan War. Then in December, the Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul). Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> an attack upon the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|With 1,300 deputies {{still in}} Cripple Creek, Sheriff Bowers {{was unable to}} control the army he had created. On June 5, the deputies moved into Altman, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> {{storming}} Bull Hill. The deputies cut the telegraph and telephone wires leading out of town, and imprisoned a number of reporters. Concerned that the paramilitary force might get out of hand, Waite again dispatched the state militia, this time {{under the command of}} General E.J. Brooks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{demand that}} Kosovo become the seventh {{republic}} of Yugoslavia was politically unacceptable to Serbia and the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. Some Serbs (and possibly some Albanian nationalists as well) saw the demands <b>as</b> being <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Greater Albania" [...] which could encompass parts of Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo itself.|$|R
50|$|The conference {{resulted}} in a five-point statement that included a plea for ETA to renounce any armed activities and to demand instead negotiations with the Spanish and French authorities to end the conflict. It was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the end of ETA's violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland.|$|R
50|$|A tie-in novel, Star Wars Battlefront II: Inferno Squad, was {{released}} on July 25, 2017. Written by Christie Golden, it serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> direct <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the game and follows the exploits of the Galactic Empire's titular squad as it seeks to eliminate {{what was left of}} Saw Gerrera's rebel cell after the events of the 2016 film Rogue One.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on {{campaign in}} the winter of 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set off until the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the copper shark is viviparous, in which the yolk sac of the {{developing}} embryo, once depleted, is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have one functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites the female <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> mating. In the Southern Hemisphere, mating takes place from October to December (spring and early summer), when both sexes have migrated into offshore waters at higher latitudes. Birthing seems to occur from June to January, peaking in October and November.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the night shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right) and two functional uteruses, which are divided into separate compartments for each embryo. Within the uterus the embryos lie lengthwise with their heads pointing {{the same direction as}} their mother. Most information known about the night shark's life history comes from the subpopulation off northeastern Brazil, and may not hold true {{in other parts of the}} species range. Northeastern Brazilian sharks mate throughout the summer, with the males biting at the female's body and fins <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> copulation.|$|E
5000|$|The Gully Dwarves (June 1996), by Dan Parkinson, (...) , Note: Continues {{the short}} story [...] "The Promised Place" [...] from The War of the Lance. The {{connected}} short stories [...] "Off Day" [...] and [...] "Ogre Unaware" [...] from The Reign of Istar and The Cataclysm respectively serve <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indirect <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the The Promised Place and The Gully Dwarves.|$|R
50|$|Eight of Brookmyre's novels (Quite Ugly One Morning, Country of the Blind, Boiling a Frog, Be My Enemy, Attack of the Unsinkable Rubber Ducks, Dead Girl Walking, Black Widow and Want You Gone) centre on {{the investigative}} {{journalist}} Jack Parlabane. Parlabane also {{stars in the}} short stories Bampot Central, Place B. and The Last Day of Christmas with the latter serving <b>as</b> <b>a</b> short <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> Dead Girl Walking.|$|R
50|$|As Transport and Communications {{minister}} in 1987-88, {{he was involved}} in some controversy with the Australian Broadcasting Commission over funding guarantees and charter reform, but primarily concerned with issues {{at the heart of the}} government's micro-economic strategy: major airline deregulation, and the reform of government business enterprises in the telecommunications and other sectors, designed to corporatize their commercial practices, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the privatisation that later followed.|$|R
5|$|Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British {{airborne}} troops during the Second World War near Syracuse, Sicily, that began on 9July1943 {{as part of}} Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft, the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks, with a force of 136 Waco Hadrians and eight Airspeed Horsas. The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground {{near the town of}} Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the full-scale invasion of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Panofsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's {{attempts}} at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5000|$|The conference {{resulted}} in a five-point statement that included a plea for ETA to renounce any armed activities and to demand instead negotiations with the Spanish and French authorities to end the conflict. It was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the end of ETA's violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland, and three days later — on October 20 — ETA announced [...] "definitive cessation of its armed activity".|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} {{typically}} {{picked up by}} stations that also had television rights to major league franchises like WTBS in Atlanta, KTTV in Los Angeles, and WGN in Chicago. TWIB would also air on owned-and-operated NBC stations <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> of sorts <b>to</b> NBC's Game of the Week telecasts.|$|R
5000|$|A grand pas de deux usually {{begins with}} an entrée (literally [...] "entrance"), which serves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> short <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> and also {{unequivocally}} denotes {{the beginning of the}} dance suite. During the entrée, the dancers first appear on the stage and, typically with great pageantry, acknowledge each other and position themselves near each other in preparation for the subsequent adagio. Depending on the choreography, the ballerina and danseur may enter the stage simultaneously or at different times.|$|R
5|$|The Third Perso-Turkic War was {{the third}} and final {{conflict}} between the Sassanian Empire and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Unlike the previous two wars, it was not fought in Central Asia, but in Transcaucasia. Hostilities were initiated in 627 AD by Khagan Tong Yabghu of the Western Göktürks and Emperor Heraclius of the Eastern Roman Empire. Opposing them were the Sassanid Persians, allied with the Pannonian Avars. The war was fought against the background of the last Byzantine-Sassanid War and served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the dramatic events that changed the balance of powers in the Middle East for centuries to come (Battle of Nineveh, Islamic conquest of Persia).|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark is {{viviparous}} {{like the}} rest of its family, with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. Compartments form inside the uteri during pregnancy, one for each embryo. In the waters around Mumbai, the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon. The males bite at the sides of the females <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> copulation. Females can reproduce every year; the litter size ranges from 6 to 25 pups, and increases with the size of the female. The gestation period lasts 8–9 months off western India, and 10–11 months off northern Australia. Pregnant females have been reported to quarrel with each other.|$|E
5|$|The1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} inCardiff,Wales.The sixth {{edition of the}} games marked the largest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales {{and it was the}} smallest country ever to host a British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Cardiff had to wait 12 years longer than originally scheduled to become host of the Games, as the 1946 event was cancelled because of World War II. The Cardiff Games introduced theQueen's Baton Relay, which has been conducted <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> every British Empire and Commonwealth Games ever since. Thirty-five nations sent a total of 1,122 athletes and 228 officials to the Cardiff Games and 23 countries and dependencies won medals, including for the first time, Singapore, Ghana, Kenya and the Isle of Man.|$|E
5000|$|A. M. Esmonde {{was also}} a {{producer}} on the film Terminus (2010), which was directed by Sean P. Parsons, and acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> story <b>to</b> the Blood Hunger novel. He also produced the related short Revamped (2009). [...] In 2013, he became an associate producer of 'Call Girl' the first film in David P. Baker's 'City of Sin' and the 'Crime Lord' [...] TV series. Also, 2013 saw him direct a revenge themed music video, 'Say My Name', for the rock band V0iD.|$|R
30|$|Microtubules are {{filamentous}} {{proteins that}} act <b>as</b> <b>a</b> substrate for the translocation of motor proteins. As such, {{they may be}} envisioned <b>as</b> <b>a</b> scaffold for the self-assembly of functional materials and devices. Physisorption, self-assembly and combing are here investigated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> microtubule-templated self-assembly. Dense films of self-assembled microtubules were successfully produced, as well as patterns of both dendritic and non-dendritic bundles of microtubules. They are presented in the present paper and the mechanism of their formation is discussed.|$|R
5000|$|His {{concern about}} the {{destruction}} of the Australian natural environment and his political interest in promoting [...] "liberal democratic values" [...] are reflected in his writings. [...] "He saw literature <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means by which people might be helped to know themselves and their society <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> reform". Smith suggests that while much of his writing focuses on nature and the land, several stories and his last book explore the emotional and sexual relationships between men and women.|$|R
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> {{a search for the}} ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|As {{war with}} the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its {{attention}} to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in Uruguay as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led {{to the murder of}} Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief Uruguayan War, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (the area known after 1977 as the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> an attack on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a gestation period of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a gestation period of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
50|$|Following several line-up changes, Drive-Thru Records {{signed the}} band in June 2003 and {{released}} their four-song sampler EP Hidden in Plain View on November 11, 2003. In spite of being criticized for {{its lack of}} variety, the EP was a perfect showcase of the band's continuous development of both musicianship and songwriting. With more sophisticated lyrics, a heavier undertone in the instrumentation and a discreet nod to contemporary screamo in the vocals, it served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> promising <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> their following full-length album.|$|R
40|$|Any {{reflection}} on the category "race" {{in the contemporary world}} is inevitably framed by the cumulative layers of meanings and practices attached to bodies and cultures over the previous centuries. If the idea of race resembles anything, it is a palimpsest, 1 with past interpretations leaking through to make the ink of the present run. Accordingly, I present some historical notes not <b>as</b> <b>a</b> distinct <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> the "real" story, positing a rupture of past and present, but as the beginning of the story proper...|$|R
40|$|Histories of the Great Barrier Reef have characterised {{the period}} between 1900 and 1939 <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{creative}} <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> modern Reef conservationism. These histories, however, have not given sufficient consideration to how perceptions of the Reef were entangled with evaluations of its economic potential. By examining the writings of Edmund Banfield, the intensification of tourism and science, {{and a collection of}} popular texts about the Reef, this paper argues that early twentieth-century perceptions of the Reef were entangled with an utilitarian ethos which leaned toward exploitation...|$|R
