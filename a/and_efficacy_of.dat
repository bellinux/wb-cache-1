5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to <b>and</b> <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

40|$|It {{is unknown}} why the potencies <b>and</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> {{long-chained}} guanidine-type histamine H 2 -receptor (H 2 R) agonists are lower at the H 2 R of human neutrophils {{than at the}} H 2 R of the guinea pig atrium. To elucidate these differences, we analyzed fusion proteins of the human H 2 R (hH 2 R) and guinea pig H 2 R (gpH 2 R), respectively, and the short splice variant of Gs (GsS) ex-pressed in Sf 9 cells. The potencies <b>and</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> small H 2 R agonists in the GTPase assay and the potencies of antagonists at inhibiting histamine-stimulated GTP hydrolysis by hH 2 R-GsS and gpH 2 R-GsS were similar. In contrast, the potencies <b>and</b> <b>efficacies</b> <b>of</b> guanidines were lower at hH 2 R-GsS than at gpH 2 R-GsS. Guanidines bound to hH 2 R-GsS with lower affin-ity than to gpH 2 R-GsS, and high-affinity binding of guanidines at gpH 2 R-GsS was more resistant to disruption by GTPS tha...|$|R

40|$|Influenza virus mutants that encode C-terminally {{truncated}} NS 1 proteins (NS 1 -truncated mutants) {{are attractive}} candidates for avian live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) development {{because they are}} both attenuated and immunogenic in chickens. We previously showed that a high protective <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> NS 1 -truncated LAIV in chickens corresponds with induction of high levels of type I interferon (IFN) responses in chicken embryonic fibroblast cells. In this study, we investigated the relationship between induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated gene responses in vivo and the immunogenicity <b>and</b> protective <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> NS 1 -truncated LAIV. Our data demonstrates that accelerated antibody induction <b>and</b> protective <b>efficacy</b> <b>of</b> NS 1 -truncated LAIV correlates well with upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes.
