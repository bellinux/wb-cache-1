40|$|Abstract. Since Swanson’s {{introduction}} of literature-based discovery in 1986, new hypotheses have been generated by <b>connecting</b> <b>disconnected</b> scientific literatures. In this paper, we present the general discovery model and show {{how it can}} be used for drug discovery research. We describe our discovery support tool by discussing a recent discovery for which we used this tool. We conclude by discussing criticisms to and the current status and future of literature-based discovery support tools. ...|$|R

30|$|Starting in the 1980 s, {{advances}} in drilling technology have made horizontal and multilateral wells a primary design type to economically develop reservoirs particularly with unconventional resources. Horizontal wells {{have been widely}} used to increase wellbore contact with the reservoir, increase flowing area, and thus, increase the well productivity by reducing coning tendencies, mitigating the risk of sand production, <b>connecting</b> <b>disconnected</b> drainage areas, and generally lowering drawdown-related production problems (Babu and Odeh 1989; Joshi 2003; Dikken 1990; Ihara et al. 2013; Novy 1995).|$|R

30|$|Future MGs will be {{localized}} distribution systems {{composed of}} distributed generators, flexible loads, and energy storage {{elements that are}} networked together using advanced communication technologies. Energy management in MGs is usually formulated as an offline optimization problem for day-ahead scheduling. The future challenge is to provide reliable and secure electricity service despite large variation in available generation by rapidly <b>connecting,</b> <b>disconnecting</b> and controlling non-critical loads in a dynamic manner. Under such conditions {{the management of the}} embedded stored energy in the MG over timescales of milliseconds (e.g. converter DC link capacitors) to hours (e.g. Li-ion UPS batteries) is of critical importance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{functions}} of the network layer are to enable the correct use of the MAC sublayer and provide a suitable interface {{for use by the}} next upper layer, namely the application layer. Its capabilities and structure are those typically associated to such network layers, including routing. The Network Layer 's function is exactly as it sounds. It deals with network functions such as <b>connecting,</b> <b>disconnecting,</b> and setting up networks. It will add a network, allocate addresses, and add/remove certain devices. This layer makes use of star, mesh and tree topologies. It adds an interface to the application layer.|$|R
50|$|Coupling and {{uncoupling}} of trains was simplified by new automatic couplers. The new WABCO couplers automatically {{made and}} broke electric and air connections as trains were coupled or uncoupled. This reduced {{the amount of}} work for train crews during the process. For example, IRT crews had to physically <b>connect</b> or <b>disconnect</b> high voltage jumper cables when coupling or uncoupling their trains. BRT/BMT crews on Standards did not. The only jumper a Standard crew would ever have to <b>connect</b> or <b>disconnect</b> was the 9 point low voltage jumper introduced with the 1919-1920 modifications. Coupling and uncoupling therefore were much simpler on Standards than on equipment that came before them.|$|R
