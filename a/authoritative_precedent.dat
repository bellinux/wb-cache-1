60|$|Mistakes {{were made}} from ignorance and lack of <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedent,</b> before ecclesiology had become a study; but {{whatever}} could be done by toil, intelligence, and self-devotion was done by Mr. Yonge in those two years; and the sixty years that have since elapsed have seen many rectifications of the various errors. Even as the church stood when completed, it was regarded as an effort in the right direction, and a good example to church builders. The first stone was laid in Whitsun-week 1837 by Julian Bargus, Mr. Yonge's five-year-old son. A school for the boys was built on {{a corner of the}} ground intended as churchyard, and a larger room added to the girls', the expense being partly defrayed by a bazaar held at Winchester, and in part by Charlotte Yonge's first book, The Chateau de Melville, which people were good enough to buy, though it only consisted of French exercises and translations. The consecration took place on the 30th of July 1838, and immediately after daily matins were commenced. So that the Church of St. Matthew has never in sixty years been devoid of the voice of praise, except during casual absences. Most of the trees in the churchyard were planted by Mr. Bigg Wither, especially the great Sequoia, and the holly hedge around was grown by him from the berries of the first Christmas decoration, which he sowed in a row under the wall of the boys' school, and transplanted when large enough.|$|E
50|$|The trial {{took place}} under English common law in British Virgin Islands. However, {{there was no}} appeal (Hodge was {{executed}} a mere eight days after the jury handed down their verdict). The jury (composed largely of slave owners) actually recommended mercy, but the court nonetheless sentenced Hodge to death, and so the directions of the trial judge are not treated by commentators as an <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedent.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} in Lynch was cited as persuasive or <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedent</b> in numerous subsequent cases, and reinforced the interpretation that [...] "natural born citizen" [...] meant born [...] "within the dominions and allegiance of the United States" [...] regardless of parental citizenship. For example, in an 1884 case, In re Look Tin Singg, {{the federal court}} held, that despite laws preventing naturalization of Chinese visitors, Chinese persons born in the United States were citizens by birth, and remained such despite any long stay in China. Citing Lynch, Justice Stephen J. Field wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the American Revolution, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state to {{establish}} an official Reporter of Decisions. As newer states needed law, they often looked first to the Massachusetts Reports for <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedents</b> as a basis for their own common law. The United States federal courts relied on private publishers until after the Civil War, and only began publishing as a government function in 1874. West Publishing in Minnesota is the largest private-sector publisher of law reports in the United States. Government publishers typically issue only decisions [...] "in the raw," [...] while private sector publishers often add indexing, editorial analysis, and similar finding aids.|$|R
50|$|These “researches” {{have been}} {{considered}} anthropological since at least {{as early as the}} late 19th century. The title, “Father of History,” (pater historiae) had been conferred on him probably by Cicero. Pointing out that John Myres in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, James M. Redfield asserts: “Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology.” Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes “theorizing.” Redfield translates it as “tourism” with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: diaitia, material goods such as houses and consumables; ethea, the mores or customs; and nomoi, the <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedents</b> or laws.|$|R

5000|$|Judicial {{precedent}} (aka: case law, or judge-made law) {{is based}} on the doctrine of stare decisis, and mostly associated with jurisdictions based on the English common law, but the concept has been adopted in part by Civil Law systems. Precedent is the accumulated principles of law derived from centuries of decisions. Judgements passed by judges in important cases are recorded and become significant source of law. When there is no legislature on a particular point which arises in changing conditions, the judges depend on their own {{sense of right and wrong}} and decide the disputes from first principles. <b>Authoritative</b> <b>precedent</b> decisions become a guide in subsequent cases of a similar nature. The dictionary of English law defines a judicial precedent as a judgement or decision of a court of law cited as an authority for deciding a similar state of fact in the same manner or on the same principle or by analogy. Another definition [...] declares precedent to be," [...] a decision in a court of justice cited in support of a proposition for which it is desired to contend".|$|E
40|$|Federal {{judges are}} {{constrained}} by {{their need to}} maintain legitimacy. To this end, numerous formal and informal institutions structure how they perform their duties. Obeying these generally applicable rules allows judges to demonstrate fealty to a higher principle operating above the concerns of partisan politics. This dissertation examines how judges work within this system to pursue their preferences, sometimes using judicial tools to circumvent the constraints and sometimes using the constraints themselves to advance their goals. The first two essays examine the use of dissents from denial of rehearing en banc (DDRs) in the federal courts of appeals. DDRs are voluntary, published, non-precedential opinions criticizing the circuit court for choosing not to rehear a case. The first chapter uses an original dataset of every DDR from the courts of appeals from 1969 to 2012 (nearly 1000 cases) to test {{the impact of a}} DDR author's ideology on the signal of cert-worthiness it provides to litigants and the Supreme Court. I find that litigants treat a DDR as a strong signal they should seek certiorari regardless of its author's ideology, but the Supreme Court has been much more inclined to grant certiorari when the DDR author is ideologically conservative. The second chapter assesses political polarization in the courts of appeals by looking at DDR coalition data from 1943 to 2012 (nearly 1300 DDRs). I find that many circuits use DDRs in a polarized fashion, the polarization increased markedly in the 1980 s, and the polarization is largely attributable to appointing presidents. The third chapter examines how Supreme Court justices use the institutional requirement that they support their decisions through the citation of relevant precedent to enhance the Court's legitimacy. Using Fowler et al. 's (2007) measure of precedent centrality I test the hypothesis that the Court cites more <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedent</b> in cases that might cause the public to question its legitimacy. The data indicate that in these situations [...] departures from governing case law, actions particularly salient to the public, and direct challenges to the actions of the coordinate branches [...] the Court's decisions cite more authoritative case law to support its holding...|$|E
40|$|When {{a federal}} appellate court decided {{last year that}} two reporters must either reveal their {{confidential}} sources {{to a grand jury}} or face jail time, the court did not hesitate in relying on the majority opinion in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s sole comment on the reporter 2 ̆ 7 s privilege [...] Branzburg v. Hayes. 2 ̆ 2 The Highest Court has spoken and never revisited the question. Without doubt, that {{is the end of the}} matter, 2 ̆ 2 Judge Sentelle wrote for the three-judge panel on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. By this declaration, the court dismissed with a wave of its judicial hand the arguments made by the reporters and media amici that the court should follow the more lenient concurring opinion of the fifth justice in Branzburg, Justice Powell, rather than the restrictive opinion of the Court authored by Justice White. The reporters had contended that while Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion rejected any constitutional privilege in this situation, Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence advocated a case-by-case balancing approach and thus left an opening for a constitutionally based privilege. Because it provided the crucial fifth vote in the case and was the 2 ̆ 2 least common denominator 2 ̆ 2 between the views of the majority and the dissenters, Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s opinion should control, the reporters had submitted. The reporter 2 ̆ 7 s argument was certainly not a new one; numerous courts and commentators had interpreted Branzburg in the same manner. The Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals all have pronounced Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion to be a mere 2 ̆ 2 plurality. 2 ̆ 2 And Justice Stewart, the chief dissenter in Branzburg, later declared that the case was decided by 2 ̆ 2 a vote of four a half to four and a half. 2 ̆ 2 Some courts and commentators, moreover, have concluded that Branzburg was a five to four victory for the press, with Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence plus the four dissenters actually creating a qualified reporter 2 ̆ 7 s privilege [...] the exact holding Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion rejected. As Professor Rodney Smolla surmissed, 2 ̆ 2 [t]he important point of the story [was] that a short concurring opinion by a Justice who actually joined the opinion of the Court in Branzburg in effect superseded the majority opinion and became the prevailing law of the land. 2 ̆ 2 The D. C. Circuit, however, would have none of it. Writing with an air of perplexity in response to the reporters 2 ̆ 7 argument, the panel easily dismissed Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence as mere surplusage: 2 ̆ 2 Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion is not a plurality opinion of four justices joined by a separate Justice Powell to create a majority, it is an opinion of the majority of the Court. As such it is <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedent.</b> It says what it says. It rejects the privilege asserted by appellants [...] In any event, whatever Justice Powell specifically intended, he joined the majority. 2 ̆ 2 Scanning the D. C. Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision on my way to teach Branzburg to my Media Law Seminar, I was surprised by the panel 2 ̆ 7 s surety that White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion should be treated as a true majority. What exactly made the D. C. Circuit so confident of Justice Powell 2 ̆ 7 s acquiescence in Justice White 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning, particularly when Powell 2 ̆ 7 s separate writing seemed to contradict it? If White 2 ̆ 7 s opinion were treated as a plurality, when Powell 2 ̆ 7 s concurrence would be the law. So why such faith that the White opinion governs...|$|E
40|$|Women’s Conventions, {{endorsing}} {{and approach}} {{based on the}} recognition of structural discriminatory social patterns and cultural practices, have been adopted in the Universal System, with limited national impact, and in the Regional ones. Such systems present different structures, conditions and resources, which contribute to determine the conditions for plausibility of the rights enshrined. The Inter-­ American System adopted the Belém do Pará Convention (BdPC) back in 1994, nevertheless, it largely failed to attract attention in legal scholarship, particularly in Western countries. We argue that, given its high degree of comparability with the European System, analysis of such experience provides valuable informative material to shape a European response. Our first objective is, hence, to analyse the process of internalisation of the BdPC in the Inter-­‐American System. Analysing Inter-­‐American Institution’s case law on VAW since 1994 {{and the evolution of}} relevant national legislation in the region, we find evidence of the role of a coalition of civil society organisations and scholars’ in compensating Inter-­‐American Institutions’ lack of previous experience wit gendered analyses, enabling an incremental learning process and triggering BdPC full justiciability, initially unclear due to BdPC ambiguous wording. At the same time, the availability of <b>authoritative</b> <b>precedents</b> to hold before national governments in a relatively culturally homogeneous context enhanced national implementation of regionally constructed principles and standards, harmonised with those of the Universal System. The IACrtHR plays a crucial interpretive function, clarifying the implications of an inherently incomplete instrument in concrete cases. On the basis of the identification of early setbacks, we suggest a reform of the IACommHR filtering function, which should be limited to the evaluation of petitions’ admissibility and to coordinate the availability of crucial contextual information. This function should be performed with the support of Inter-­‐ American Commission of Women’s expertise. Such procedural reform would improve analyses of complex cases emerging from intersectionality and cultural diversity, still unsatisfactorily developed. Our second, and consequent, objective is to use our findings to identify a generalizable method to ensure women’s rights plausibility. We argue that both ECrtHR’s case law and CoE Member States’ legislations on VAW are still at an early stage. However, the Istanbul Convention does not grant the ECrtHR competence on the protection mechanism established. On the basis of our findings, we argue the need to reconsider ECrtHR role with respect to the Istanbul Convention and present a concrete proposal to guarantee the feasibility of its contentious jurisdiction, avoiding further clogging-­‐up, valorising the recently introduced Pilot Judgment Procedure and the specific expertise provided by GREVIO...|$|R
