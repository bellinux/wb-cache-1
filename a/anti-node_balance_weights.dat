40|$|A {{stationary}} and non-transient Markov chain may {{be defined}} by a <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> function or by its transition probabilities, and these are mathematically equivalent. But starting with <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> functions {{gives rise to a}} different and somewhat liberating attitude. Because these functions are additive, complexmodels can be built rather easily, and such functions arise naturally from weighted circuits. The idea of a <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> function extends to a multi-particle system called an induced field, in which each particle is influenced by the other particles as a function of their locations, and yet the invariant distribution of the system is still immediately available. This simplicity encourages the formulation of relatively complex models with the expectation that their invariant behavior will be available for interpretation and application. Three different and somewhat novel processes are created this way and for each the invariant distribution is given explicitly. These results may be of some independent interest as well as illustrating the method...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} intriguing {{archaeological evidence}} that the practical properties of additive progression were recognized in the eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1200 b. c.). The evidence {{is in the form}} of a set of stone <b>balance</b> <b>weights</b> excavated in the 1960 s from a small cargo ship that sank off the coast of southern Turkey. It is argued that a Fibonacci-like series of integers is represented in the masses of these prehistoric items, and it is demonstrated that the manner in which the <b>balance</b> <b>weights</b> were manufactured was simple, precise, and logical...|$|R

40|$|Summary. An {{extremely}} simple {{proof of}} the K-K-M-S Theorem is given involving only Brouwer’s fixed point theorem and some elementary calculus. A function is explicitly given such that a fixed point of it yields an intersection point of a balanced collection of sets together with <b>balancing</b> <b>weights.</b> Moreover, any intersection point of a balanced collection of sets together with <b>balancing</b> <b>weights</b> corresponds to a fixed point of the function. Furthermore, {{the proof can be}} used to show -balanced versions of the K-K-M-S Theorem, with -balancedness as introduced in Billera (1970). The proof makes clear that the conditions made with respect to by Billera can be even weakened. JEL Classification Number: C 71. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} a {{recently}} proposed Rudin-Shapiro-like sequence, with <b>balanced</b> <b>weights,</b> has purely singular continuous diffraction spectrum, {{in contrast to the}} well-known Rudin-Shapiro sequence whose diffraction is absolutely continuous. This answers a question that had been raised about this new sequence. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
50|$|The crankpin-and-rods {{weight on}} the wheels is in a plane outside the wheel plane {{location}} for the static <b>balance</b> <b>weight.</b> 2-plane, or dynamic, balancing is necessary if the out-of-balance couple at speed needs to be balanced. The second plane used is in the opposite wheel.|$|R

40|$|Thurston {{introduced}} shear deformations (cataclysms) on geodesic laminations - deformations including {{left and}} right displacements along geodesics. For hyperbolic surfaces with cusps, we consider shear deformations on disjoint unions of ideal geodesics. The length of a balanced weighted sum of ideal geodesics is defined and the Weil-Petersson (WP) duality of shears and the defined length is established. The Poisson bracket {{of a pair of}} <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> systems on a set of disjoint ideal geodesics is given in terms of an elementary 2 -form. The symplectic geometry of <b>balanced</b> <b>weight</b> systems on ideal geodesics is developed. Equality of the Fock shear coordinate algebra and the WP Poisson algebra is established. The formula for the WP Riemannian pairing of shears is also presented...|$|R
5000|$|The first Merchant Navy, 21C1 Channel Packet, {{was built}} in 1941 and 29 followed, the last being 35030 Elder Dempster Lines. The West Country and Battle of Britain {{slightly}} smaller light Pacifics followed in 1945. 110 were built, of which 21C101 Exeter was the first. His other major steam locomotive design, the Q1 [...] "Austerity" [...] 0-6-0 freight engine, appeared in 1942. All steam locomotives designed by Bulleid for the SR had his BFB disc wheels, which gave more even tyre support. This did not {{eliminate the need for}} <b>balance</b> <b>weights,</b> but the set-up of the Bulleid valve gear enabled a locomotive with no hammer blow. When the locomotives were rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear, <b>balance</b> <b>weights</b> were installed in the wheels to reduce hammer blow.|$|R
5000|$|Two of {{the cars}} built used an early form of {{automatic}} transmission developed in Australia.

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a rotating bending fatique test machine for applying a rotating bending torque to a test object. The bending torque is produced by a rotating unbalanced weight in a rotating mounting and arranged {{at the end of}} a shaft part opposite to the test object. The test object is fixed to the shaft part on the one hand and to the machine frame on the other hand. There is a <b>balancing</b> <b>weight</b> which rotates about the same axis of rotation and at the same speed as the unbalance weight. The drive shaft drives the two <b>weights</b> simultaneously. The <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> (6) is offset in the planar rotation of the unbalance weight (5) by 180, arranged on an overhead mounted hollow shaft and mounted directly on the machine frame (7) ...|$|R
50|$|The bike {{was popular}} {{at first but}} soon {{reliability}} problems began to emerge and the problems lay with the Omni-Phase balancer: At high rpm the <b>balance</b> <b>weights</b> would whip oil in the sump into a froth, aerating the oil and starving the crank for lubrication which resulted in bearing failure.|$|R
30|$|We {{estimate}} the fixed effects model in a weighted least squares regression applying entropy <b>balancing</b> <b>weights.</b> These weights {{are used to}} make the control group look comparable to the treated households in terms of household characteristics at baseline, in 2013.

50|$|The primary {{difference}} between Type 073I and Type 073II {{is in the}} engine. Additional <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> {{was added to the}} diesel engine which solved the vibration problem, but the reliability issue of the engine remain unsolved, and as a result, Type 073II did not enter mass production, just like its predecessor Type 073I.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{commercial}} {{success for the}} Bavarian carmaker, with over 3.5 million produced in almost three decades across many BMW models. It has a forged crankshaft, counter <b>balance</b> <b>weights,</b> five main bearings and a chain-driven camshaft. The block is made from cast iron and the head is made from aluminium.|$|R

50|$|The {{crankpins}} for {{the coupling}} rods {{were placed in}} line with the corresponding inside crankpins for the connecting rods. This arrangement was also developed by Stroudley, who claimed that the motion of the inside cranks was smoothly transferred to the coupling rods, as happens in an outside-cylindered engine, where the connecting rod acts directly on a crankpin shared with the coupling rod. According to Stroudley, the axleboxes, bearing surfaces, hornblocks and coupling rods of locomotives with outside cylinders had a service life twice as long as those on inside-cylindered examples. However, by aligning the two cranks together, heavy <b>balancing</b> <b>weights</b> were required on the driving wheels, at 180° to the outside crank, to counteract the combined mass of the cranks and rods. The Badmintons had massive crescent-shaped <b>balancing</b> <b>weights,</b> which made the unmounted pairs of wheels difficult to handle in the workshop.|$|R
25|$|The {{drive was}} on the {{trailing}} wheels and the slide bars were attached to a motion bracket just behind the leading wheels. The wheels themselves had twelve spokes and very large <b>balance</b> <b>weights.</b> The front pair of wheels of the engine were partially enclosed in splashers which did not come above the running plate.|$|R
50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside the frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by Stephenson Link motion, were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed rocker shafts. The <b>balance</b> <b>weight</b> for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|R
