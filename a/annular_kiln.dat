40|$|The {{urbanization}} process in Nepal {{is to be}} distinguished from urban developments in neighbouring South Asian countries and remains a specific case linked to the political frame conditions in time. The paper offers a historical reconstruction of urban development in Nepal and discusses urban planning efforts and recent developments which seem to be detached from these. The case study emphasizes the quantitative and qualitative changes in brick production in Nepal while studying one <b>annular</b> <b>kiln</b> and its production system in detail. The kiln and the work performance {{of the people involved}} correlate to a system of production which has undergone tremendous changes since traditional craftsmanship was replaced by semi-professional migrant labourers. Brick production in the Kathmandu Valley is linked to contributing commodities and people from the East and West of Nepal and from India. All participants profit from brick production in rather varied ways. The ever-growing demand for construction material reflects the rapid growth of urban settlements in vertical and horizontal dimensions as well as the competition between brick production and agriculture when it comes to spatial utilization in the vicinity of towns and cities...|$|E
50|$|The {{theoretical}} heat (the standard enthalpy) {{of reaction}} {{required to make}} high-calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple shaft kilns, similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current shaft kilns. Modern variants include regenerative and <b>annular</b> <b>kilns.</b> Output is usually in the range 100-500 tonnes per day.|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} experimental {{measurements of}} the vertical temperature profile and kiln gas composition in an <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kiln</b> for lime burning. The results obtained confirm that calcination of the limestone in the kiln begins at temperatures between 820 °C and 830 °C. The average heat transfer coefficient from kiln gases to the stones is determined, {{as well as the}} calcination distribution within the kiln. Modeling the calcination process in an <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kiln</b> was performed {{on the basis of the}} measured temperature profile. The results of this model are in good agreement with those for samples of partially calcinated stones taken from the area of the lower and upper burners...|$|R
40|$|During the {{operation}} of certain older types of <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kilns</b> used for lime burning, one may encounter the dilemma of how to operate the kiln at an optimal air excess ratio. Due to excessively high temperatures in the combustion chambers at optimal air excess ratio, the flame must be cooled witha greater amount of relatively cold secondary air. This results in greaterheat loss with the exhaust kiln gas (stack losses), greater fuel consumption and lower kiln efficiency. The effects of increasing air excess ratio {{during the process of}} lime burning in an <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kiln</b> are specifically analysed. The paper presents a case of a remodelled annular shaftkiln, in which the air excess ratio can be reduced to its optimal level by recirculation of recuperator waste gas and its injection into the combustion chambers. This also reduces stack losses, while the temperatures inthe combustion chambers remain within the permissible range, which means that the specific energy consumption for lime burning is reduced...|$|R
40|$|<b>Annular</b> shaft <b>kilns</b> with {{opposite}} burners (OBASK) {{has been}} widely adopted due to the advantages of cost saving and easy controlling. Nonetheless, compared with the traditional <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kiln,</b> the OBASK is not favorable in terms of thermal performance and energy efficiency. Aiming to improve the thermal performance, a comprehensive energy and exergy analysis of an OBASK has been conducted based on the actual operational data obtained from on-site measurements. For making a thorough thermal analysis of the OBASK, special attentions have been focused in considering magnesium decomposition reaction and moisture in limestone in the methodology. The energy and exergy efficiencies are determined to be 63. 6 % and 35. 7 %, respectively. The exergy destruction is 44. 0 % of total exergy input of which fuel combustion causes 56. 6 % of the exergy destruction. Furthermore, the effects of CaO and moisture contents in limestone on energy and exergy efficiencies are analyzed. The results have demonstrated the potential energy saving of the OBASK and identified three proposed energy conservation measures. Improvement and effect of the three proposed measures on the thermal performance are verified via further analysis...|$|R
40|$|In article certain {{specific}} {{problems associated with}} heat transfer, which occurs {{during the process of}} lime burning are discussed. An increase in the thickness of the calcinated layer affect the conditions of heat inflow into the sphere. The equilibrium calcination radius is defined, which delimits the calcination process into two zonesČ one in which the supply of heat to the reaction front limits the heat transfer from kiln gases to the stones, and another, which is limited by heat conduction through the already calcinated layer. The phenomenon of the critical sphere radius is also discussed. From the viewpoint of increasing the capacity of existing <b>annular</b> shaft <b>kilns,</b> it turns out that it is a advantageous to increase the heat transfer coefficient from kiln gases to the stones up to the value of 60 W/(m 2 K) in the incipient part of the calcination...|$|R
40|$|In {{magnesia}} plant, <b>annular</b> {{vertical shaft}} <b>kilns</b> - high temperature processing units, {{are used for}} the production of dead burned Magnesia. Vertical Shaft kilns such as those operating at the reference magnesia plant are known to be efficient. However, the knowledge of thermal processes and physical behaviours inside the operating kiln has not yet been studied in detailed. This is mainly due to the high working temperature inside the kiln which makes temperature and pressure measurements very difficult and expensive or almost impossible. The inability to obtain such information has limited the optimisation of the kiln's process variables. With increasing knowledge and computing power, computational modelling is becoming a readily used resource for improving processes that occurs in a vertical shaft kiln. This study represents the review of the thermodynamic processes of dead burned magnesia production with an integrated view to improving energy efficiency of magnesia production and to achieve environmental sustainability...|$|R
