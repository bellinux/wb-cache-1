I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2012 interview, Hawke {{said that}} he prefers great art over politics, {{explaining}} that his preference shows [...] "how little" [...] he cares about the latter; [...] "I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> that really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Donnell {{has used}} an Apple Macintosh {{computer}} for composition. In an interview O'Donnell wished that his software would easily upgrade to newer revisions; [...] "for {{the last twenty}} years of technology, every time a 'new' version of something comes out, the old version gets trashed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> myself unable to do something that I used to depend on," [...] he said. O'Donnell was involved in the implementation of his music as well as the composition, and was Bungie's Audio lead. He composed at Bungie from a sound-proofed room in the corner of Bungie's office, dubbed the [...] "Ivory Tower".|$|E

I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E
500|$|In January, Davis wrote home, expressing {{frustration}} at the slow logistics of replacement aircraft parts, claiming this was slowing down missions. He {{also began to}} express contempt for the F-86, feeling at times it was being outperformed by the MiG and that [...] "something {{will have to be}} done" [...] to give the UN pilots more of an advantage in combat. He also said that he had begun to grow tired of the constant publicity about him. [...] "They're trying to make a hero of me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it rather embarrassing", he wrote in a letter. At other times, Davis indicated he preferred to stay in combat.|$|E

I have traced the {{family history of}} the man who calls himself Freddy Mike, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> beyond question, and I may say even on his own admission, {{that there is not a}} shred or shadow of foundation for his story from beginning to end. He said that he had a twin brother. He had no twin brother. He said that the twin brother or a friend of the twin brother was in Eastbourne that night. There were no such people, and the whole story is an invention because, having known John Williams in the past, he did not like to think of his being hanged." ...|$|E

The following day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held {{a lot of people in}} this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that I held up on pedestals." ...|$|E
500|$|Aden {{forms an}} {{unlikely}} friendship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances). In the storyline, Morag {{wants to know}} why he has problems because she had [...] "taken a bit of a shine to him". Aden initially doesn't want her help. Whilst interviewed by Digital Spy Frances stated: [...] "There's lots of lovely dialogue that goes on between him and I - I take him under my wing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> out what's wrong with him." [...] He eventually looks up to her and moves in with her. Frances said: [...] "So I sort of adopt him in a way." [...] Morag is known for her feisty persona, Lasance said Frances was one of his favourite colleagues to work with because she is the complete opposite of Morag. As a pairing they have [...] "collision chemistry" [...] because [...] "they don't really get along, but they do have respect for each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{weapons were}} very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon {{encourages}} strategic {{play with their}} secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost impossible not to notice how [...] "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, [...] "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> myself being embarrassed for the voice actors." [...] Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score [...] "easily drown this out." ...|$|E

500|$|Wheeler {{arrived in}} Bombay {{in the spring}} of 1944. There, he was welcomed by the city's governor, John Colville, before heading by train to Delhi and then Simla, where the {{headquarters}} of the Archaeological Survey of India were located. Wheeler had been suggested for the job by Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British-controlled subcontinent. Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that [...] "We're back in 1850". He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward Indians: he stated that [...] "they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly... I already find myself regarding them as ill-made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> myself bullying them most brutally." [...] He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them.|$|E
500|$|The Oregon Law Review {{described}} Bare-faced Messiah as [...] "a revealing, enthralling {{biography of}} a controversial public figure." [...] Charles Platt, writing in the Washington Post, called the book [...] "impressively thorough" [...] though he chided Miller for [...] "miss no opportunity to poke fun at Hubbard. Indeed, he belittles the man so thoroughly, the exercise almost begins to seem pointless." [...] He noted that {{in advance of the}} publication of his review, the Church of Scientology had sent his newspaper [...] "a large package of documents intending to refute many of Miller's statements." [...] His review was subsequently disputed by the Church of Scientology International's Vice President, Brian Anderson, who denounced the book {{in a letter to the}} newspaper, claiming that it had been [...] "obviously calculated to make a quick buck capitalizing on L. Ron Hubbard's name" [...] and was a [...] "fast and shoddy" [...] work. In response, Platt pointed out that [...] " [...] does not dispute the success of L. Ron Hubbard's work; he merely presents evidence that suggests fraud. This is the point of Russell Miller's book, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it significant that Brian Anderson makes no attempt to answer it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the announcement, USC Interactive Media Division withdrew its {{sponsorship}} of the festival. Seven of the fourteen finalist games {{were removed from the}} contest by their developers in protest: Braid, flOw, Once Upon A Time, Toblo, Everyday Shooter, Book and Volume and Castle Crashers (Toblo was later reinstated by the DigiPen Institute of Technology, who owns the rights to the game). Developer Jonathan Blow of Braid stated: [...] " [...] lacks compassion, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> the Artist's Statement disingenuous. But despite this, the game does have redeeming value. It does provoke important thoughts, and it does push the boundaries of what games are about. It is composed with more of an eye toward art than most games. Clearly, it belongs at the festival." [...] Blow and the other developers sent an open letter to the festival, encouraging the reinstatement of the game as keeping with the festival's [...] "trailblazing" [...] efforts. Despite protests, Baxter refused to change his mind, citing consideration for the shooting's victims and their families. Ledonne told the other finalists that he planned to go to the festival anyway and distribute copies of the game. Acknowledging that the withdrawal of six finalists compromised the competition, Roberts let the attendees vote on whether any prizes would be awarded; they decided not to.|$|E

500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
500|$|Malouma began singing as a child, first {{performed}} on the stage when she was twelve and began appearing in solo concerts with a traditional repertoire by age fifteen. In addition to her father's guidance, she was inspired by other traditional artists including Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Fairouz, Dimi and Sabah. As she matured, she increasingly became interested in blues music, which appealed to her as it bore a resemblance to the traditional music she knew. Malouma wrote her first song, [...] "Habibi Habeytou" [...] (My beloved, I loved him) when she was sixteen. It was a song protesting the tradition of men turning their wives {{out of their homes}} to marry younger women. It brought her instant recognition, but created a backlash, causing physical attacks from the established Muslim community. Soon after she wrote it, her family moved to Nouakchott, the capital, to help her launch her music career, but in the strongly traditional society, Malouma was forced to marry, abandoning singing until the late 1980s. She was later accused by her father of ruining his reputation. In addition to the criticisms stemming from her songs, she had disgraced her family by divorcing twice: her first husband had been forced upon her, while the second came from a noble family, who would not allow her to sing. Yet after hearing one of her songs, her father commented: [...] "You have created something new <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> it touching. Unfortunately, I will not live long {{enough to be able to}} protect you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gershwin was {{influenced}} by French composers of the early twentieth century. In turn Maurice Ravel was impressed with Gershwin's abilities, commenting, [...] "Personally I find jazz most interesting: the rhythms, the way the melodies are handled, the melodies themselves. I have heard of George Gershwin's works <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> them intriguing." [...] The orchestrations in Gershwin's symphonic works often seem {{similar to those of}} Ravel; likewise, Ravel's two piano concertos evince an influence of Gershwin.|$|E

2500|$|Grace won {{appreciation}} from {{a host of}} revered {{musicians and}} artists, including members of Buckley's biggest influence, Led Zeppelin. Jimmy Page considered Grace close to being his [...] "favorite album of the decade". Robert Plant was also complimentary, as was Brad Pitt, saying of Buckley's work, [...] "There's an undercurrent to his music, there's something you can't pinpoint. Like the best of films, or the best of art, there's something going on underneath, and there's a truth there. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> his stuff absolutely haunting.

2500|$|The UK National Audit Office (NAO) {{investigated}} the contracts and {{has so far}} not released its conclusions – the only NAO report ever to be withheld.

2500|$|Dembski has not {{explained}} {{the origin of}} the intelligent designer that created the universe, which he argues is unnecessary, since such an intelligent designer is likely outside the dimensions of space and time, or to have any of his pro-intelligent design articles published in the peer-reviewed mainstream scientific journals. While intelligent design proponents often claim that such failure to get articles published is due to an alleged pro-evolution bias or conspiracy, Dembski himself has said that he prefers to disseminate his ideas in non-peer-reviewed media: [...] "I've just gotten kind of blasé about submitting things to journals where you often wait two years to get things into print. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> I can actually get the turnaround faster by writing a book and getting the ideas expressed there.
