500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] {{was written}} by Minogue, Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, {{and was one of}} the first songs {{composed}} for the album. Minogue wrote the song prior to being in a relationship with French photographer Stephane Sednaoui with different lyrical context, but it was completed while she was dating. Of the song, Minogue said [...] "the way you start a new relationship with someone, they can bring out so many emotions within you and makes you question yourself a bit more." [...] The title [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] comes from when she first met Sednaoui in person, where she recalled him looking [...] "unusual" [...] <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was [...] "the new cowboy coming into town".|$|E
500|$|The visual {{style of}} VVVVVV is heavily {{inspired}} by games released for the Commodore 64 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially Jet Set Willy which is referenced by {{the element of}} collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game [...] "that looked <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the C64 games I grew up with." [...] He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The graphical style of VVVVVV is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus Pålsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled PPPPPP.|$|E
500|$|Jim Morrison, a self-professed [...] "acid-evangelist of rock", {{had been}} {{fascinated with the}} public media outlets and {{frequently}} coined buzzwords and phrases to generate attention for the Doors. The band's rise to stardom and publications drawing Morrison as a sex symbol, however, drastically modified his outlook on pop culture. Throughout 1968, Morrison's behavior became increasingly erratic: he began drinking heavily and distanced himself from studio work to focus on his more immediate passions, poetry and film making. At the time, Morrison was also struggling with anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{he was on the}} brink of a nervous breakdown. He considered quitting the Doors, but was persuaded by Ray Manzarek to finish recording The Soft Parade before making such a decision.|$|E

500|$|After the 1947 season ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on {{a strict}} diet and {{exercise}} regimen for the offseason, stating {{that he had to}} lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team. By the start of spring training, he had reached his goal of 195 pounds, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he had an easier time swinging the baseball bat as a result. After a good month of spring training, Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying that [...] "he'll be in there until he stops hitting." [...] Shortly afterwards, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster.|$|E
500|$|In January 2009, Reubens {{hinted that}} {{negotiations}} were {{under way for}} his stage show to come back, and in August the return of The Pee-wee Herman Show was announced. Reubens said he felt Pee-wee calling, [...] "I just got up one day <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I'm gonna come back, that was it." [...] The show is also a way to [...] "introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn't know about it", preparing the way for Reubens' main project, the Playhouse movie. Before this comeback, Reubens' present age and shape had been pointed out as a possible issue, since Pee-wee's slim figure and clean skin {{have been one of}} his trademarks. But after appearing {{for the first time since}} 1992 as Pee-wee at Spike TV's 2007 Guys' Choice Awards, Reubens had remained optimistic and had jokingly said he's no longer nervous about being young Pee-wee again thanks to digital retouching.|$|E
500|$|On May 4, 1970, Fonda {{appeared}} before an assembly at the University of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, {{to speak on}} GI rights and issues. The end of her presentation was met with a discomforting silence. The quiet was broken when Beat poet Gregory Corso staggered onto the stage. Drunk, Corso challenged Fonda, using a four-letter expletive: Why hadn't she addressed the shooting of four students at Kent State by the Ohio National Guard, which had just taken place? Fonda in her autobiography revisited the incident: [...] "I {{was shocked by the}} news <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a fool." [...] On the same day, she joined a protest march on the home of university president, Ferrel Heady. The protestors called themselves [...] "They Shoot Students, Don't They?" [...] – a reference to Fonda's recently released film, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, which had just been screened in Albuquerque.|$|E

500|$|According to {{designer}} Harry Teasley, id's 1993 FPS Doom {{was a major}} influence, and {{the team}} wanted Half-Life to [...] "scare you like Doom did". Newell said that [...] "Half-Life in many ways was a reactionary response to the trivialization {{of the experience of}} the first-person genre. Many of us {{had fallen in love with}} video games because of the phenomenological possibilities of the field <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the industry was reducing the experiences to least common denominators rather than exploring those possibilities. Our hope was that building worlds and characters would be more compelling than building shooting galleries." [...] The project had the working title Quiver, after the Arrowhead military base from Stephen King's 1980 novella The Mist, an early inspiration for the game. The name Half-Life was chosen because it was evocative of the theme, not clichéd, and had a corresponding visual symbol: the Greek letter λ (lower-case lambda), which represents the decay constant in the half-life equation.|$|E
500|$|Much of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} its substitution of mostly unrelated quests over a main storyline. GamePro, while praising the Land Make system, {{found that the}} [...] "focus of Legend of Mana is obscured by the over-abundance of subplots". Similarly, Game Revolution's Johnny Liu commented that the game lacked depth <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{a collection of short}} quests rather than a single game, while Vestal of GameSpot noted that the game's use of miniquests will likely disappoint those seeking an action-RPG classic, and said that, although fun, the gameplay had a [...] "schizophrenic and disjointed nature". Next Generation agreed, saying that the Land Make system was an [...] "innovative feature" [...] but that it left the game disjointed without a solid plot to keep everything together. The Japanese Weekly Famitsu reviewers felt that the system was ambitious, but left the game feeling disconnected, and that the divided plotlines kept the beginning of the game from having the charm of the end.|$|E
500|$|Taking Back Sunday debuted {{at number}} 17 on the Billboard 200 chart, with 27,000 copies {{sold in the}} first week.

The album also charted at number 49 on the Australian Albums Chart, number 57 on the Canadian Albums Chart and number 87 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2013, Nolan said {{he was proud of}} the self-titled album <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the group [...] "came out with {{something}} that was not completely like any other Taking Back Sunday record". In a retrospective piece for Fuse.tv, writer Jason Lipshutz ranked the album as his fifth favorite Taking Back Sunday album. He said the album sounded like [...] "an acceptance of identity and intrinsic strengths" [...] and that group created [...] "a rollicking return to form".|$|E

500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time {{to get out of it}} and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{was used}} on the Estée Lauder [...] "Beyond Paradise" [...] {{fragrance}} television advertisement.

The Estée Lauder advertisement featured supermodel Carolyn Murphy wandering through a world full of water, and surrounded by flowers and fairies while [...] "Love Profusion" [...] played in the background. The 30second commercial debuted in more than 10,000cinemas in September, while the television version of the advertisement aired on MTV, VH1, E! and Style Network. Estée Lauder group president Patrick Bousquet-Chauvanne explained that they [...] "wanted the advertising to be groundbreaking for Estée Lauder... The association of Luc Besson, Madonna and Carolyn Murphy will make for an exceptional visual and acoustic experience for movie and television audiences around the world." [...] The Olympians Ross Raihala wrote that it made sense that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] {{was used as the}} soundtrack for the commercial, <b>and</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was another attempt by Madonna to [...] "salvage her career" [...] following the commercial disappointment of American Life.|$|E

Mader helped develop Charlotte's outfit and was pleased to be wearing comfortable jeans and boots for the role.
