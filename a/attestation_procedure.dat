40|$|The {{proliferation}} of mobile computing devices has enabled {{the utilization of}} infrastructure-less networking as commercial solutions. However, the distributed and cooperative nature of routing in such networks makes them vulnerable {{to a variety of}} attacks. This paper proposes a host-based monitoring mechanism, called SIDE that safeguards the operation of the AODV routing protocol. SIDE encompasses two complementary functionalities: (i) a specification-based detection engine for the AODV routing protocol, and (ii) a remote <b>attestation</b> <b>procedure</b> that ensures the integrity of a running SIDE instance. The proposed mechanism operates on a trusted computing platform that provides hardware-based root of trust and cryptographic acceleration, used by the remote <b>attestation</b> <b>procedure,</b> as well as protection against runtime attacks. A key advantage of the proposed mechanism is its ability to effectively detect both known and unknown attacks, in real time. Performance analysis shows that attacks are resolved with high detection accuracy, even under conditions of high network volatility. Moreover, SIDE induces the least amount of control packet overhead in comparison with a number of other proposed IDS schemes...|$|E

40|$|Embedded {{devices have}} come to play an {{important}} role in our daily lives. Increasingly, diverse fields like healthcare systems, banks and more are using these devices to automate underlying complex tasks. This reliance has led to a significant development – exposure of devices to malicious attacks, including control and subversion of software onboard. Software attestation has been herald as a solution to minimize the effects of malicious attacks on the devices. With low power, relatively small memory size and less processor frequency, standard software attestation techniques cannot be directly applied to embedded devices. To solve this problem, we propose a novel design of simulated hardware-based tool. Our tool can be used to evaluate competing attestation techniques. Furthermore, We present a reference implementation and evaluate the runtime cost of a home-grown <b>attestation</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wireless sensor {{networks}} are envisioned {{to be deployed}} in mission-critical applications. Detecting a compromised sensor, whose memory contents have been tampered, is crucial in these settings, as the attacker can reprogram the sensor to act on his behalf. In the case of sensors, the task of verifying the integrity of memory contents is difficult as physical access to the sensors is often infeasible. In this paper, we propose a software-based approach to verify {{the integrity of the}} memory contents of the sensors over the network without requiring physical contact with the sensor. We describe the building blocks {{that can be used to}} build a program for attestation purposes, and build our attestation program based on these primitives. The success of our approach is not dependent on accurate measurements of the execution time of the attestation program. Further, we do not require any additional hardware support for performing remote attestation. Our <b>attestation</b> <b>procedure</b> is designed to detect even small memory changes and is designed to be resistant against modifications by the attacker. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, we have {{witnessed}} an exploding growth of the Internet. The massive adoption of distributed systems on the Internet allows users to offload their computing intensive work to remote servers, e. g. cloud. In this context, distributed systems are pervasively used {{in a number of}} difference scenarios, such as web-based services that receive and process data, cloud nodes where company data and processes are executed, and softwarised networks that process packets. In these systems, all the computing entities need to trust each other and co-operate in order to work properly. While the communication channels can be well protected by protocols like TLS or IPsec, the problem lies in the expected behaviour of the remote computing platforms, because they are not under the direct control of end users and do not offer any guarantee that they will behave as agreed. For example, the remote party may use non-legitimate services for its own convenience (e. g. illegally storing received data and routed packets), or the remote system may misbehave due to an attack (e. g. changing deployed services). This is especially important because most of these computing entities need to expose interfaces towards the Internet, which makes them easier to be attacked. Hence, software-based security solutions alone are insufficient to deal with the current scenario of distributed systems. They must be coupled with stronger means such as hardware-assisted protection. In order to allow the nodes in distributed system to trust each other, their integrity must be presented and assessed to predict their behaviour. The remote attestation technique of trusted computing was proposed to specifically deal with the integrity issue of remote entities, e. g. whether the platform is compromised with bootkit attacks or cracked kernel and services. This technique relies on a hardware chip called Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is available in most business class laptops, desktops and servers. The TPM plays as the hardware root of trust, which provides a special set of capabilities that allows a physical platform to present its integrity state. With a TPM equipped in the motherboard, the remote attestation is the procedure that a physical node provides hardware-based proof of the software components loaded in this platform, which can be evaluated by other entities to conclude its integrity state. Thanks to the hardware TPM, the remote <b>attestation</b> <b>procedure</b> is resistant to software attacks. However, even though the availability of this chip is high, its actual usage is low. The major reason is that trusted computing has very little flexibility, since its goal is to provide strong integrity guarantees. For instance, remote attestation result is positive if and only if the software components loaded in the platform are expected and loaded in a specific order, which limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. For such reasons, this technique is especially hard to be applied on software services running in application layer, that are loaded in random order and constantly updated. Because of this, current remote attestation techniques provide incomplete solution. They only focus on the boot phase of physical platforms but not on the services, not to mention the services running in virtual instances. This work first proposes a new remote attestation framework with the capability of presenting and evaluating the integrity state not only of the boot phase of physical platforms but also of software services at load time, e. g. whether the software is legitimate or not. The framework allows users to know and understand the integrity state of the whole life cycle of the services they are interacting with, thus the users can make informed decision whether to send their data or trust the received results. Second, based on the remote attestation framework this thesis proposes a method to bind the identity of secure channel endpoint to a specific physical platform and its integrity state. Secure channels are extensively adopted in distributed systems to protect data transmitted from one platform to another. However, they do not convey any information about the integrity state of the platform or the service that generates and receives this data, which leaves ample space for various attacks. With the binding of the secure channel endpoint and the hardware TPM, users are protected from relay attacks (with hardware-based identity) and malicious or cracked platform and software (with remote attestation). Third, {{with the help of the}} remote attestation framework, this thesis introduces a new method to include the integrity state of software services running in virtual containers in the evidence generated by the hardware TPM. This solution is especially important for softwarised network environments. Softwarised network was proposed to provide dynamic and flexible network deployment which is an ever complex task nowadays. Its main idea is to switch hardware appliances to softwarised network functions running inside virtual instances, that are full-fledged computational systems and accessible from the Internet, thus their integrity is at stake. Unfortunately, currently remote attestation work is not able to provide hardware-based integrity evidence for software services running inside virtual instances, because the direct link between the internal of virtual instances and hardware root of trust is missing. With the solution proposed in this thesis, the integrity state of the softwarised network functions running in virtual containers can be presented and evaluated with hardware-based evidence, implying the integrity of the whole softwarised network. The proposed remote attestation framework, trusted channel and trusted softwarised network are implemented in separate working prototypes. Their performance was evaluated and proved to be excellent, allowing them to be applied in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the implementation also exposes various APIs to simplify future integration with different management platforms, such as OpenStack and OpenMANO...|$|E
40|$|Prior to 1999, higher {{education}} in Libya was monopolized by the public sector and there was considerable public resistance {{to the establishment of}} private universities. The impetus for the private {{higher education}} policy was created by a number of pressures on public policy for higher education, which had been adopted by Gaddafi’s government for two decades. This study explores the efforts of Gaddafi’s regime to cope with this issue. It reviews the financing policy for higher education and the phenomenon of the growth of private {{higher education in}} Libya and describes the strategy of the Gaddafi government for reforming the higher education system with a view to encouraging privatization. The thesis also analyses the case of a particular private university with the aim of providing insights into the managing and financing of a private higher education institution from which to make informed appraisals and assessments of the practice of private higher education in the country. In addition, it analyses the effects of the new financing policy for higher education in the Gaddafi period for the main stakeholders, namely students, academics and institutions themselves. The research contends that the policy shift had had a significant effect on quality just as it has introduced universities to risks through engagement with academic capitalism with its emphasis on marketization of university programmes and services. The thesis concludes with suggestions for some policy options that could help to mitigate the negative consequences of Gaddafi’s policy, taking in to account some developments since the February 2011 revolution which overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The 1999 Private Higher Educational Institutions Act opened the possibility of private universities being founded to increase the supply of quality graduates to increase the advantage of competitiveness. As with many countries, Libya is a very recent arrival to the world scene of rapidly growing private higher education. Reform in higher education financing in Libya has been occasioned by both endogenous and exogenous variables. Internal pressures of a declining economy, rapid demographic growth and increased interand intra-sectoral competition for scare financial resources, coupled with external neoliberal doctrines championed by global donors like the World Bank, resulted in a new market-competitive policy of financing higher education. In Libya the policy was to facilitate educational reform to produce quality graduates that could help transform Libya from a development economy to an industrialized and knowledge based economy for the primary purpose of enhancing the competitiveness of the Libyan economy. However, the policy of Gaddafi’s government to privatize higher education was ad hoc; it was carried out in a deteriorating environment and in response to the political desires of dictatorship rule. The thesis demonstrates how important the particular circumstances of any single country like Libya are in helping us to understand the development of private higher education. It shows how the previous government policy to reform financing higher education cannot relieve fiscal stress. Attention is drawn to the expansion in the number of private higher education institutions, the dramatic increase of enrolments in social science fields, and the many difficulties institutions had in coping with the circumstances in Libya during the phase of Gaddafi’s rule. Comprehensive reform {{of the role of the}} state in the financing and governance of higher education was proposed. The government's reform strategy involved accreditation bodies that were established later. These centres were questionable in terms of skills of staff members, administrative structure and their <b>attestation</b> and accreditation <b>procedures.</b> The implementation of the new policy was poor. Private universities offer a limited number of courses and the fees from students continue to be their major source of income. They are profit makers in a country that had been wedded to a culture of socialism for more than forty years. A number of college and university students in Libya attend private institutions, for several reasons, one of which is that private universities are seen as easier than public universities. The number of students in private universities does not account for a significant proportion of university enrolments for there are more students in public than in private universities. Even so, private higher education plays an important role in the higher education sector. Private institutions do not provide professional training in fields relevant to employment opportunities but instead offer an education with its emphasis on the human sciences, qualification in which are unlikely to enable a graduate to obtain employment. Private higher education is expensive and costly to attend. Many private institutions are caught in a dilemma. They cannot achieve significant efficiency by reducing instructional costs without damage to the quality of their programmes, and they are reluctant to raise tuition fees and other charges because of the damaging effects on student recruitment. As long as public higher education is provided at low or no cost to the student and private higher education continues to be entirely self-supporting, the private sector will have a peripheral role to play in higher education in Libya. This research was undertaken during the period when the Gaddafi regime was overthrown in a bloody revolution in 2011. The thesis concentrates on the policy developments and problems during the Gaddafi years, but brief reference is made to relevant subsequent developments...|$|R
