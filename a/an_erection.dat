5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes <b>an</b> <b>erection.</b> Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to insert a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not be}} as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|The Cerne Abbas Giant is a hill figure {{near the}} village of Cerne Abbas in Dorset, England. Made by a turf-cut outline filled with chalk, it depicts a large naked man with <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> and is {{typically}} described as a giant wielding a club. The figure is listed as a scheduled monument in the United Kingdom and the site where he stands is owned by the National Trust.|$|E

5000|$|... "So celebrated was Holmes' penis size it {{was used}} as a {{marketing}} tool for films he wasn't even in. The movie Anybody but My Husband had the promotional tag line [...] "Tony The Hook Perez has a dick so big that he gives even John Holmes a run for his money". Another controversy regarding whether Holmes ever achieved <b>a</b> full <b>erection,</b> although much of his early work clearly revealed he was able to achieve <b>a</b> substantial <b>erection.</b> <b>A</b> popular joke in the 1970s porn industry held that Holmes was incapable of achieving <b>a</b> full <b>erection</b> because the blood flow from his head into his penis would cause him to pass out. Fellow film actress Annette Haven stated that his penis was never particularly hard during intercourse, likening it to [...] "doing it with a big, soft kind-of loofah".|$|R
5|$|Penis pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image is small and is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

5|$|After the show's {{transition}} from NBC to DirecTV, Eve's storylines emphasize her romance with Julian and difficult relationship with Vincent. Believed dead, Vincent reveals himself, his gender identity and his pregnancy to Eve after seducing Julian (his father) and threatens {{to kill her}} if she tells anyone. In late 2007, he begins tormenting Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born. Julian checks Eve into rehab after she relapses, abusing drugs and alcohol to cope with Vincent's frequent appearances. Vincent arranges for Eve's release from rehab to help him prepare for the impending birth. Vincent's psychopathic accomplice, Viki Chatsworth, later repeatedly stabs Julian in the groin and severs his penis. Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> might kill him. In May 2008, Eve and Julian assist Vincent {{with the birth of}} his son on the Russells' kitchen table, when Eve explains everything about Vincent and Valerie to Julian. Eve plans to form a relationship again with Vincent (believing that motherhood has mellowed him), and convinces Julian not to turn him in to the police. During the rehearsal for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Eve assures Julian that they love each other emotionally and intellectually; Julian vows that the Crane family will take more responsibility for their actions now that Alistair is dead. At the rehearsal dinner, Eve and the other dinner guests eat Vincent and Viki's poisoned mushroom sauce. She dies, but is resurrected when witch Tabitha Lenox renounces magic and becomes a born-again Christian. In the series finale, Kay uses her magic to heal Julian's penis. Since T. C., Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two Russells in the final episode.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Vincent runs a {{blood test}} on himself after {{experiencing}} {{what appears to be}} symptoms of morning sickness and discovers he is pregnant. Eve inspects Vincent (who is dressed as Valerie) on November 22, 2007 and discovers his pregnancy and his true gender identity as intersex. Vincent torments Eve out of revenge for her failure to prevent his abduction when he was born and to prevent her from telling anyone that he was still alive and pregnant with Julian's child. After his psychopathic accomplice Viki Chatsworth severs Julian's penis, Vincent plies Eve with drugs and alcohol so she botches her attempt to surgically reattach Julian's penis; she reattaches it upside-down, and <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> might kill him.

During the rehearsal dinner for the joint weddings of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Fancy Crane, Noah Bennett and Paloma Lopez-Fitzgerald, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Kay Bennett, and Edna Wallace and Norma Bates, Vincent and Viki kill all the guests with a poison mushroom sauce, but Tabitha gives up her powers and becomes a born again Christian in order to resurrect everyone. Vincent is last seen being arrested by Chief of Police Sam Bennett. Since T. C. Russell, Whitney, and Simone moved to New Orleans in 2007, Eve and Vincent are the only two members of the Russell family to appear in the series finale.|$|E
25|$|For {{both men}} and women, these {{conditions}} can manifest themselves as an aversion to, and avoidance of, sexual contact with a partner.

25|$|Another type of {{medication}} that {{is effective in}} roughly 85% of men is called intracavernous pharmacotherapy and involves injecting a vasodilator drug directly into the penis in order to stimulate <b>an</b> <b>erection.</b> This method has {{an increased risk of}} priapism if used in conjunction with other treatments, and localized pain.|$|E
25|$|While {{stationed}} at Aldershot, Nilsen's latent homosexual feelings began to stir, although {{he kept his}} sexual orientation well hidden from his colleagues.

25|$|Phimosis is a {{condition}} in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled back past the glans. A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination. In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during <b>an</b> <b>erection,</b> but is otherwise not painful. Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications.|$|E
25|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} or impotence is {{a sexual}} dysfunction {{characterized by the}} inability to develop or maintain <b>an</b> <b>erection</b> of the penis. There are various underlying causes, such as damage to the nervi erigentes which prevents or delays erection, or diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease, which simply decreases {{blood flow to the}} tissue in the penis, many of which are medically reversible.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), {{which is responsible for}} degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. The molecular structure of sildenafil {{is similar to that of}} cGMP and acts as a competitive binding agent of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in more cGMP and better erections. Without sexual stimulation, and therefore lack of activation of the NO/cGMP system, sildenafil should not cause <b>an</b> <b>erection.</b> Other drugs that operate by the same mechanism include tadalafil (Cialis) and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E

30|$|A U-shaped skin {{incision}} {{was made}} surrounding the meatus, and two paramedian incisions were {{extended to the}} tip of the glans. We removed the unhealthy urethral tissue on the anterior wall and kept the urethral plate. If there was still chordee greater than 15 degrees, a dorsal tunica albuginea plication was conducted based on the methods of Baskin and Duckett (1994), in which <b>an</b> artificial <b>erection</b> was initiated. After that, <b>an</b> artificial <b>erection</b> was repeated until no chordee was identified. The incised urethral plate was tubularized without tension over a 6 – 8 -Fr catheter (determined by the patients’ ages or the urethra) using non-interrupted 7 – 0 polyglactin sutures.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{indication}} of sildenafil is treatment of erectile dysfunction (inability to sustain <b>a</b> satisfactory <b>erection</b> to complete intercourse). Its use {{is now one}} of the standard treatments for erectile dysfunction, including for men with diabetes mellitus.|$|R
25|$|Historically, the {{practice}} of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used {{as a treatment for}} erectile dysfunction. The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by hanging. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed <b>an</b> <b>erection,</b> sometimes remaining after death (a death erection), and occasionally ejaculated when being hanged. However, post-mortem ejaculation occurs in hanging victims after death because of disseminated muscle relaxation; this is a different mechanism from that sought by autoerotic asphyxiation practitioners.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil protects cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing <b>an</b> <b>erection.</b> Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{popularity}} was not universal. Sir Sam Fay, {{a railway}} official {{who worked at}} the War Office 1917–19, enjoyed cordial face-to-face relations with Wilson but wrote that he could argue with total conviction that a horse chestnut was the same thing as a chestnut horse, and that an unnamed senior general said he suffered a “sexual disturbance” whenever he came within a mile of a politician (Fay recorded that the general had in fact used “vulgar and obscene” language – Walter Reid simply writes that exposure to politicians gave Wilson <b>an</b> <b>erection).</b> Edward Spears – also a senior Anglo-French liaison officer, but junior to Wilson – loathed him and compared him to Quint, the sinister and evil valet in Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
