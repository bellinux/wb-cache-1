2500|$|On 27 September 2011 {{at around}} 2 a.m. in McAllen, Texas, fatal gunshots were {{exchanged}} from one vehicle to another along an expressway. A man named Jorge Zavala and a 22-year-old man {{were victims of}} an attack perpetrated by unknown shooters traveling in a dark-colored SUV from a Chevrolet Tahoe, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and crash along the expressway. The local police did not find a motive for the attack, but sources told The Monitor that Zavala had ties with a faction of the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican border cities of Matamoros and Reynosa, showing signs that his assassination was due to an [...] "internal power struggle" [...] in the organization. Zavala died instantly at the scene, while the other man {{was taken to the}} hospital in critical condition. The McAllen Police Department refused to comment on how many gunshots were fired, but the preliminary autopsy revealed that Zavala died of multiple gunshots, not from the crash. Public records prove that Zavala's criminal history dates back to 1995, while sources familiar with the victim stated that he was a close associate of the drug lord Gregorio Sauceda-Gamboa.
