5|$|The draught section {{drivability}} test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists of}} four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the way in which they dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to one side is used as a method to steer the motorcycle <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so it was able to roll down the road out of sight <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner.</b> White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E
500|$|Physical {{effects were}} {{not an issue}} for the series regulars. Allison Mack {{performed}} her own stunts for the scene in [...] "Hothead" [...] where her character's office is set on fire, and again in [...] "Kinetic", when she was cabled off and dangled [...] above the ground. For [...] "Nicodemus", the stunt coordinator received twice the help. Kristin Kreuk was expected {{to go to the}} tenth rung of a water tower, in a scene which involved her character climbing to the top and falling off. As filming progressed, Kreuk climbed to the top, so the crew cabled her off and dropped her [...] to the bottom. John Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard led to him performing the stunt driving for his character. The scene required Schneider to slide his truck <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner,</b> while yelling at some pedestrians on the sidewalk.

40|$|AbstractA {{numerical}} method using a path-independent H-integral {{based on}} the conservation integral was developed to analyze the singular stress field of <b>a</b> three-dimensional interfacial <b>corner</b> between anisotropic bimaterials under thermal stress. In the present method, {{the shape of the}} corner front is smooth. According to the theory of linear elasticity, asymptotic stress near the tip of <b>a</b> sharp interfacial <b>corner</b> is generally singular {{as a result of a}} mismatch of the materials’ elastic constants. The eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions are obtained using the Williams eigenfunction method, which depends on the anisotropic materials’ properties and the geometry of <b>an</b> interfacial <b>corner.</b> The order of the singularity related to the eigenvalue is real, complex or power-logarithmic. The amplitudes of the singular stress terms can be calculated using the H-integral. The stress and displacement <b>around</b> <b>an</b> interfacial <b>corner</b> for the H-integral are obtained using finite element analysis. In this study, a proposed definition of the stress intensity factors of <b>an</b> interfacial <b>corner,</b> which includes those of an interfacial crack and a homogeneous crack, is used to evaluate the singular stress fields. Asymptotic solutions of stress and displacement <b>around</b> <b>an</b> interfacial <b>corner</b> front are uniquely obtained using these stress intensity factors. To prove the accuracy of the present method, several different kinds of examples are shown such as interfacial corners or cracks in three-dimensional structures...|$|R

2500|$|In early January 1911, Churchill {{arrived at}} the [...] "Siege of Sidney Street" [...] in London. He gave his own account of the {{incident}} in his book Thoughts and Adventures. There is some uncertainty as to whether Churchill attempted to give operational commands. Biographer Roy Jenkins comments that the reason he went was because [...] "he could not resist {{going to see the}} fun himself" [...] and that he did not issue commands. A famous photograph from the time shows Churchill at the scene, peering <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> to view the gun battle between cornered anarchists and Scots Guards. His role and presence attracted much criticism. The building under siege caught fire, and Churchill supported the decision to deny the fire brigade access, forcing the criminals to choose surrender or death. After an inquest, Arthur Balfour remarked, [...] "He [...] and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing but what was the Right Honourable gentleman doing?" [...] The significance was that the whole highly publicised affair increased Churchill's already incipient reputation for being a frenetic and far-from-calm Home Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|Despite all the preparation, {{a typical}} {{shooting}} day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted {{most of the}} morning, after which photography followed. The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were canceled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, {{in an interview with}} Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> too quickly. Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to Iñárritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing. As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving Iñárritu more options during post-production. Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually twenty for the shorter scenes, the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth. Chris Haarhoff described it as [...] "a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment." [...] The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since {{they did not want to}} attract the attention of tourists.|$|E
