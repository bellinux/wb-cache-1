2500|$|... "For {{the reasons}} set forth below, I am {{of the opinion}} that federal courts do have the power to award damages for {{violation}} of 'constitutionally protected interests' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Court that a traditional judicial remedy such as damages is appropriate to the vindication of the personal interests protected by the Fourth Amendment." ...|$|E
2500|$|British prime {{minister}} Theresa May {{said that the}} foreign minister's comments did not represent the government's view. Other Conservatives however defended Johnson. Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson said: [...] "I think Boris Johnson was absolutely right about {{what he said about}} proxy wars and about Iran. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> his analysis. Now, that might not be the position of the UK Government but guess what - I am not in the UK Government and I think he was right." [...] Later that month, Johnson visited Bahrain, met Saudi leaders and praised Saudi Arabia, saying it was [...] "securing itself from bombardment by the Hootis" [...] in Yemen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} perfectly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] Holder replied. [...] "I have come, quite recently, to {{the same}} conclusion myself." ...|$|E
60|$|Rectus {{thought this}} was {{the worst kind of}} injustice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him, {{although}} <b>I</b> didn't see {{what we were going to}} do about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I scream, William Adolphus?" [...] I {{demanded of}} that {{intelligent}} animal. William Adolphus shook his head. This is a fact. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{thought the}} world of Ross Perot. I put him up there with our {{founding}} fathers. I liked the way he talked. He’d say 'We’ve got {{to clean out the}} barn!' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> everything he said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{glass of}} sugar-and-water. You know, I am not easily tired. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, {{it is better}} to come to {{business}} at once: so prepare them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Harold said, [...] "the plan is {{a hopeful}} one, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{you that it is}} a {{thousand}} times better to try it than it is to stop here with the certainty of being shot down before morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Besides {{love and}} sympathy, animals exhibit other qualities {{connected}} with the social instincts, which in us would be called moral; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Agassiz (16. 'De l'Espece et de la Classe,' 1869, p. 97.) that dogs possess something very like a conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{was talking}} about it," [...] {{corrected}} Mr. Wilks, in a hoarse voice. [...] "You brought up the subject <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> you--not that it matters to me 'ow people get married. That's their affair. Banns or license, it's all one to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better, Harry," [...] Polly said, eagerly; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> her, for <b>I</b> really dreaded being by our two selves in that {{rambling}} old house, where every room, {{every piece of}} furniture, every act of our daily life would bring back some association of him who was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{he told me}} that {{he would}} have given one of his eyes to kill me, only Colepepper wouldn't let him go on. He half quarrelled with his second, but the man told him that I had not fired at him, and the thing must drop. 'It's better as it is, you know,' he said. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} precisely," [...] said Raybold, nodding {{his head}} sagaciously; [...] "of her own sex. Yes, I see your drift, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you absolutely. There {{is a little too}} much of that thing over there, and I don't wonder you are annoyed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “She is, as Johnson says, sir, a square-rigged ship, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him {{as to the}} cut of her sails. She is {{certainly}} a Frenchman, and evidently a large frigate. She is running down the coast as we are, and I expect hopes {{to get through the}} Straits at night.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Frank nodded. [...] "I quite {{understand}} that, old fellow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you thoroughly. A question might be asked any {{day that you}} could not reply to without saying how you came to be here; {{and for the sake of}} the count as well as yourself, that should be avoided if possible." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sakari {{suggested}} that himself, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him {{he proceeded to}} demolish it. He has treated me dreadfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What the--' I {{started to}} yell, and 'Holy hell,' Seth says, as {{both of us}} looked at {{what was on the}} track. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> Seth entirely in his remark. It was an Indian girl--and take it from me, Indians ain't Spiggoties by any manner of means. Seth had managed to fetch a stop within twenty feet of her, and us bowling down hill at that! But the girl. She--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Last {{night was}} worse than before. Instead of flying I {{actually}} sat for some time with my hand in hers talking over the most intimate subjects with her. We spoke of Agatha, among other things. What could I have been dreaming of? Miss Penclosa {{said that she was}} conventional, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> her. She spoke once or twice in a disparaging way of her, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> did not protest. What a creature I have been! ...|$|R
60|$|Secondly, Marinetti {{is wrong}} when {{he claims that}} matter is the only mystery and the only reality. I say and as you, my reader, realize, I speak with authority--I say that matter is the only illusion. Comte called the world, which is {{tantamount}} to matter, the great fetich, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Comte.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} right to deceive Mamma," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I know him well enough to be quite sure {{that he will not}} take the title, as he has no {{property}} to support it. He has talked it over with me again and again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid that}} admonition hasn't had much effect, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Grant that the Sachem is a {{gathering}} place for doubtful characters," [...] Hardie went on. [...] "What's worse, I've reasons for supposing that Beamish gets {{some of them}} to help him in supplying the Indians on the reservation with liquor." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{then started}} {{addressing}} Muhammad, [...] O [...] Messenger of Allah! I am Juwayriyah bint al-Harith {{the leader of}} his people. You are not oblivious {{of what had happened}} to me. So I fell in the share of Thabit ibn Qays <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him to ransom myself with nine Ooqiyah. So help me to free myself.Muhammad replied, Do you want what is better than that?She said, What is it?Muhammad said, I will pay on your behalf and then marry you.She said, Yes, O [...] Messenger of Allah.Muhammad then said, I have done that.", ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, Mr. Renshaw. My idea {{is there}} is nothing like being prepared, <b>and</b> though <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that there is little chance of trouble in this remote settlement, it is just as well to take {{precautions}} against the worst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Life's cares {{they are}} comforts"--a maxim laid down [...] By the Bard, what d'ye call him, that wore the black gown; [...] <b>And</b> faith <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> th' old prig to a hair, [...] For a big-belly'd bottle's a heav'n of a care.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Luker {{believed}} {{the story to}} be, as to all main essentials, true--on this ground, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was too great a fool to have invented it. Mr. Bruff <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Luker, in considering this test of {{the truth of the}} story to be a perfectly reliable one.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Withers {{came into}} the room early in the morning. [...] "My husband says you are not to think of getting up unless you feel quite equal to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him; so if you like I will bring breakfast up to you, and then you can go off to sleep again for a bit." ...|$|E
60|$|Whether Auld Maitland {{be a good}} or a bad ballad is {{not part}} of the question. It was a {{favourite}} of mine in childhood, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Scott in thinking that it has strong dramatic situations. If it is a bad ballad, such as many people could compose, then it is not by Sir Walter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{he knows}} certainly, {{since it was}} he who {{discovered}} that you were the daughter of a Margaret Affleck. I have been acting on his instructions, and told him to-day when I saw him that there was no doubt that you were Colonel Eden's child. It was better, he thought, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him, that you should hear this from me. He is anxious to see you himself, and until you see him you must not allow such fancies to disturb you. He had no sooner made the discovery I have mentioned the day before yesterday--Wednesday--than he hastened to us to instruct us what to do in the case." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{tried the}} {{stranger}} men out last evening. It {{was after a}} council with Margaret. She was sure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> her, that the men for'ard are not blindly yielding to our bringing them in to be prisoners in Valparaiso. As we tried to forecast it, their plan is to desert the Elsinore in the boats {{as soon as we}} fetch up with the land. Also, considering some of the bitter lunatic spirits for'ard, there would be a large chance of their drilling the Elsinore's steel sides and scuttling her ere they took to the boats. For scuttling a ship is surely as ancient a practice as mutiny on the high seas.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose you}} say {{those things in}} order that I may {{contradict}} you. Why should I? They're perfectly untrue, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> a single word you say. But if it amuses you to talk nonsense, I don't see why you shouldn't.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see why we}} shouldn't march away, if we could," [...] Edwards said. [...] "Now {{that the}} game is quite lost here, I don't think anyone could blame you for saving the company, if possible, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Nat that Montcalm will find it difficult, if not impossible, to keep his Indians in hand. The French have never troubled much on that score." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} I {{may have the}} {{pleasure}} of introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you that {{he is at the}} head of his profession. It is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the second." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{agree with}} {{everything}} Mr. Choate has said in his letter regarding Mr. Jerome; I {{agree with everything}} Mr. Shepard has said; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> everything Mr. Jerome has said in his own commendation. And I thought Mr. Jerome was modest in that. If he {{had been talking about}} another officer of this county, he could have painted the joys and sorrows of office and his victories in even stronger language than he did.|$|E
60|$|We halted a few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him as <b>I</b> glanced about me. A great {{slope of}} snow ran upward above us, {{and as far}} as eye could see there was a white {{confusion}} of glittering ranges. The footprints of our comrades wound in zig-zags among deep drifts and outcrops of ice-touched rock across the foreground, and perhaps twenty feet below the ledge on which we stood a smooth slide of frozen snow dropped steeply toward the edge of a precipice, through a gully in which we could see the tops of the climbing pines far beneath. A few small clumps of bushes and spruce rose out of this snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will go on}} for a bit <b>and</b> see. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, that a {{thing is}} not worth doing unless it is done well, but I won't come to any final {{decision}} for another year or two. Now it is past ten o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must be going." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{managed to}} finish my breakfast, feeling thankful that--because (so their {{appearance}} suggested) those who sat at meat had driven in from the prairie to enjoy the spectacle--none of them recognized me. The odds, in their opinion, were more than five to one against me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> them. Slipping out <b>I</b> found Dixon, <b>and</b> reported my presence to the police; and, after what seemed an endless waiting at the court, it was early afternoon when Dixon said to me: [...] "They'll be ready in five minutes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want you to keep a tight rein on your temper, Ormesby. I can do all the fancy talking that is necessary. You can keep your heart up, too. There {{are going to be}} surprises for everyone to-day." ...|$|R
