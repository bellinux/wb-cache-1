Leadership is an applier from management function which become the major priority in making plan for certain purpose. That’s why a leader figure which has clear vision and mission is needed in organization. A leader should read and understand the needs of his employee’s needs in order to create working morale and responsibility for organization he worked at. This research aimed to find out the leadership style used in Relation Department Office Jombang Residence, the second finding out the working morale at Relation Department Office Jombang Residence, the third, finding out whether the leadership style in Relation Department Office Jombang Residence influenced the employee’s working morale. Analytical tool used was vulnerable scale and simple linear regression to find out the significant influence between leadership style to working morale, through t-test. To test the questionnaire, there used validity and reliability test.

30|$|Evidence from {{previous}} studies, particularly those focused on older workers, indicates {{an even stronger}} association between poor health and labour market exit from paid employment at <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age. Older workers {{are more likely to}} report poor health than younger workers, and poor health is strongly associated with being unemployed, retired or a homemaker at <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age (Alavinia and Burdorf 2008); additionally, health predicts exit from and entry into the labour market (Schuring et al. 2007; Elstad and Krokstad 2003). Regarding early retirement, “health shocks” were found to predict individual retirement behaviour (Disney et al. 2006). From a longitudinal perspective, poor health (van den Berg et al. 2010 b; Maurer et al. 2011) and declines in health (Bound et al. 1999) have been found to influence exit from paid employment among older workers. Moreover, Avendano and Mackenbach (2010) revealed that long-term illness was associated with early exit from the labour market.|$|R

30|$|The {{survey was}} {{designed}} to follow the ageing German baby boom generation and monitor their working conditions, attitudes towards work and individual health trajectories {{from the time they}} reach <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age until retirement. Compared with older cohorts, the baby boom cohorts not only are the most numerous but also have higher levels of education. However, their employment trajectories started later in their life span and are more heterogeneous, and the baby boomers experience more employment interruptions than the preceding cohorts (Tisch and Tophoven 2012). At the first interview, the respondents were at the threshold of <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age (i.e., 52 and 46 years old, respectively). Recent studies indicate that in Germany, deterioration of health, particularly due to chronic diseases and musculoskeletal limitations, begins after age 45 (Robert Koch-Institut 2012) and that both job changes and the ability to find employment decrease after age 50 (Dietz and Walwei 2011). Moreover, the likelihood of disability retirement increases rapidly after age 50 for men and age 46 for women (Hagen et al. 2010). At the same time, it can be assumed that the lidA birth cohorts were unable to make sufficient provisions for their retirement {{by the time of the}} interview. Hence, employment withdrawal is not likely driven by pull-factors of early retirement.|$|R
30|$|In sum, {{health is}} closely related to work {{motivation}} and self-perceived work ability. Impaired health and low work motivation or low self-perceived work ability might mutually influence the probability of labour market participation at <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> age. Even when opportunities for compensation exist, impaired health can alter expectations of one’s own ability to perform work and lead to a shift of preferences in life. Therefore, disentangling “the bundle of health capacities that influence the ability to perform market work […] from the bundle that affect the preference for market work” (Chirikos 1993, p.  306) is necessary.|$|R

30|$|While self-perceived work ability already {{includes}} a judgement of one’s own {{physical and mental}} capability, individual preferences for paid work are a more general measurement of the motivation to work.

40|$|Heat {{pipes and}} other phase change devices have vast {{application}} to thermal management systems {{due to their}} efficient heat transfer capabilities. Current trends for improving the thermal performance of heat pipes have been focused on optimization of different wick geometries, to give the most efficient liquid transport while lowering the overall thermal resistance of the device. Advances in manufacturing have opened research to high capillarity micro- and nano-structured wicks. The choice of working fluid has been limited in the past. However, recently discovered <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> fluids can offer several advantages. A novel working fluid for phase change heat transfer devices was investigated at UCLA. The Inorganic Aqueous Solution (IAS) has shown significant thermal performance enhancement due to surface augmentation but the deposition mechanisms of the IAS surface coating haven’t been fully observed or understood. The goal of this work was to observe the deposition and wetting dynamics of the fluid during operation in a heat pipe and use information from those experiments to develop a predictive thermal and hydrodynamic model of flow in a heat pipe. In this work, a background in phase change heat transfer and <b>advanced</b> <b>working</b> fluids is first presented. Three tasks, coating characterization, heat pipe experiment, and heat pipe modeling are outlined. Deposition mechanisms of a new working fluid were examined through accurate flat heat pipe experiments. Surprising observations of the deposition patterns in a grooved wick yielded valuable insight into the fundamental heat transfer concepts in which the fluid enhances heat pipe thermal performance. The role of interesting dynamics of the fluid, including the role of advective flow in a heat pipe, or the creeping nature of salt deposits, in enhancing heat transfer were identified. These observations were then utilized to develop a heat pipe model to {{study the effects of}} the deposition on heat pipe thermal resistance and dry-out limit theoretically. Strategic application of experimental closure to the model lead to even more interesting findings. Important information regarding the dry-out dynamics of flows with and without coatings was learned that will help develop the fluids...|$|R
