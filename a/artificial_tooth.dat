This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using <b>artificial</b> primary <b>teeth</b> for conducting laboratory research through an experiment related to canal length determination, comparing <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> with natural teeth. Methods Thirty anterior and 21 posterior <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth,</b> and the same number of natural primary teeth were selected. After preparing the access cavity, the root canal length was determined by two examiners twice using three different methods: radiography and two electronic apex locators. Then, the actual root canal length was measured by inserting a K-file up to the apical foramen (reference standard). Accuracy was calculated using Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The inter- and intra-examiner reproducibility was also calculated using the ICC. Results The methods using the electronic apex locators showed better accuracy in both <b>artificial</b> and natural <b>teeth.</b> Trends observed with <b>artificial</b> primary <b>teeth</b> were similar to those observed with natural teeth, except for the results in <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Conclusions The model of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> might be a good alternative for educational purposes; however, improvements are necessary to employ these teeth for research purposes when considering experiments for canal length determination.

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this paper}} was to present methods of {{placement}} of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> in edentulous individuals. The following review takes account of the majority of papers published during the last 100 years. The review has been divided into sections regarding the method used to determine the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Geometric aspect Gysi (1895 - 1920) produced the first scientific theory about the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Physiognomic theory The {{aim of this}} theory is to find the most natural position for <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> for each individual. Camper's "face angle" as a physiognomic criterion, has been introduced in papers of Wehrli (1961), Marxhors (1966), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973). Esthetic aspect Important names in the field of dental esthetics are: Schön and Singer (1961), Arnheim (1965), Krajiček (1969), Tanzer (1968), Lombardi (1973), Goldstein (1976). They have introduced principles of visual aspects for selection of contours, dimension and position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Constitution aspect Flagg (1880), Williams (1913) and Hrauf (1957, 1958), have considered body constitution and individual characteristics regarding position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Physiological theory In 1971, Marxhors pointed {{to the fact that the}} position of <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> corresponds with the function of the surrounding soft tissue and from the aspect of physiognomy as well. Phonetic aspect According to Silverman (1962) <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth</b> are nearest when we pronounce the sound "S". Cephalometrical research Rayson (1970), Watson (1989), Strajnić Lj. (1999), Bassi F. (2001) have presented cephalometric radiographic analyses of natural anterior teeth compared with cephalometric radiographic analyses of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> A review of dental literature shows several factors suggesting modalities which should determine the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> Numerous methods have been designed for evaluation of the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth.</b> However, there is no universally reliable method regarding determination of the position of <b>artificial</b> anterior <b>teeth...</b>|$|R

Each of the strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis tested was aggregated by Fn to various degrees, depending on the concentration of Fn added to the test mixtures. Binding assays performed with radiolabeled Fn and various strains of streptococci demonstrated various capabilities to bind Fn, and the amount of Fn bound by each strain was paralleled by its Fn-induced aggregation, with S. mutans 6715 giving the highest values in both assays. Because of the avid binding of Fn by certain strains of potentially cariogenic streptococci, we investigated the possibility that Fn may be present in human saliva and may be adsorbed from saliva onto <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles. Immunoreactive Fn was detected in paraffin-stimulated whole saliva by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of saliva adsorbed onto gelatin-coated cuvettes and by immunoelectroblots (Western blots) of salivary components separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gels. Furthermore, immunoreactive Fn was found to be present in <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles formed by incubating hydroxyapatite beads with whole human saliva. These results demonstrate that certain strains of oral streptococci bind to and are aggregated by Fn. The presence of Fn in <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> pellicles suggests that this macromolecule {{may play a role in}} the attachment of potentially cariogenic and other oral streptococci to dental tissues...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims: Failure of bonding between {{artificial}} teeth and denture base material {{is a considerable}} problem for patients who wear dentures.

Therefore, 8 groups of 10 specimens each were evaluated. All specimens were thermocycled for 5000 cycles, in water baths between 5 and 55 ◦ C. Half the specimens in each group were treated with cyclic loading at 50 N for 14, 400 cycles at 1. 2 Hz. The shear bond strengths were measured using a Universal Testing Machine. Data were analyzed using Two-way ANOVA test.   Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated no significant effect of cyclic loading on the shear bond strength, but the type of <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> affected the shear bond strength (P= 0. 006). Also, the interaction between Cyclic loading and the type of <b>artificial</b> <b>tooth</b> showed no significant difference (P= 0. 98).

After, the teeth were separated into eight groups according to the surface treatments prior to the repair: control group (c), adhesive application (a), sandblasting (S) and sandblasting followed by adhesive application (Sa). Next, a composite resin cylinder (Ø[*]=[*] 0.95  mm e h[*]=[*] 2  mm) simulating a repair was built onto each surface. The specimens were submitted to a microshear bond test after 24  h, using a universal testing machine (1  mm/min, 50 kgf) until fracture. The data was subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test, with a significance level of 5 %. ANOVA showed statistical difference for the interaction <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> material* surface treatment (p[*]=[*] 0.001). CR teeth (29.79 [*]±[*] 11.54  MPa) showed higher bond strength mean values than AR (18.48 [*]±[*] 9.73  MPa). Regardless the <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> material, Sa (36.92 [*]±[*] 6.16  MPa) treatment showed the higher bond strength values. The highest bond strength value was found in CRSa (45.93 [*]±[*] 7.13  MPa) and the lowest was found in ARc (5.38 [*]±[*] 0.90  MPa). Based on the results, tooth material should be taken in account in order to choose the best surface treatment and achieve suitable bond strength values when a repair is necessary. For <b>artificial</b> <b>teeth</b> in acrylic resin, applying an adhesive system is the best procedure, with or without sandblasting the alumina particles.
