White's rules {{dictated}} that after lunch, the cheese was reviewed {{to ensure that a}} sufficient serving was left to present for the dinner seatings. One incident recounted in White's autobiography, was that upon being unsatisfied with the remaining portions of cheese as the Maître'd was attempting to take the trolley into the dining room for the evening service, the chef threw each cheese in turn <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitchen while berating him for not replacing them. Due to the ripeness of the cheese, they remained glued to the wall {{for the rest of the}} service.|$|E

25|$|The major {{monument}} at {{the south}} is that erected <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south chancel chapel by Montague Cholmeley in February 1641. The monument, free standing, is dedicated to Cholmeley’s parents, Henry Cholmeley (died 1632), son to Sir Henry Cholmeley (died 1620) and Alice, the daughter of William Lacey of Stamford; and Elizabeth (died 1631), daughter to Sir Richard Sondes of Sheldwich, Kent. Sir Henry Cholmeley {{was the first of}} the family to take the manor of Easton, and was descended from the Cholmeley’s of Cheshire. Montague Cholmeley’s wife was Elizabeth, daughter to Sir Edward Hartop of Buckminster in Leicestershire.|$|E

25|$|By 4:00p.m., {{the sheriff}} made an initial {{estimate}} of 25 dead students and teachers. The estimate was ten over the true count, but {{close to the}} total count of wounded students. He said that police officers were searching the bodies of Harris and Klebold. At 4:30p.m. the school was declared safe. At 5:30p.m., additional officers were called in, as more explosives {{were found in the}} parking lot and on the roof. By 6:15p.m., officials had found a bomb in Klebold's car in the parking lot. The sheriff decided to mark the entire school as a crime scene; thirteen of the dead, including the shooters, were still inside the school at the time. At 10:40p.m., a member of the bomb squad, who was attempting to dispose of an un-detonated pipe bomb, accidentally lit a striking match attached to the bomb by brushing it <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordnance disposal trailer. The bomb detonated inside the trailer but no one was injured.|$|E
25|$|In Mound A {{the tomb}} is {{associated}} with a pit burial. All that remains in the pit burial of its original fill are worn igneous rocks, quantities of coarse sherds and human skull parts that had been cut through by the digging of the tomb. The tomb contains the remains of eight people. One corpse received special treatment, as evinced by the considerable amount of jewelry and the offerings left with it. The bodies were borne into the tomb on fabric mats or animal hides of which only traces remain. Among the objects found as offerings in the tomb were jade beads around the necks of two of the corpses, wafer-like disc shells forming a choker on one skeleton, jade earplug flares, an unusually large number of shells, a fine obsidian blade, a tortoise shell, metates, and various fine pottery pieces including a whistling jar and a carved tripod vessel. Several coarse brownware vessels heaped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb probably originally contained food prepared for the after-life journey of the dead.|$|E

500|$|In Italy, sarcophagi {{were mostly}} {{intended}} to be set <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb, and only decorated on three sides, {{in contrast to the}} free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century Portonaccio sarcophagus, and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an [...] "architectural background of columns and niches for its figures". [...] A well-known Early Christian example is the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire. [...] The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from Greek mythology, treated allegorically; they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using [...] biblical scenes.|$|E
500|$|In 1742 a Sugar House {{was built}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> College. This {{structure}} {{was a fire}} risk {{and the cause of}} great anxiety among the heralds. In 1775 the College Surveyor drew attention to this problem, but to no avail. In February 1800, the College was asked by a Select Committee of the House of Commons to report to them the state of public records; again the heralds drew attention to the proximity of the Sugar House. Members of the committee inspected the College premises and reported to the House that the College must either be moved to a new building or secured against the risk of fire. Again nothing was done; in 1812 water seeped through the walls of the College damaging records. The Surveyor traced the leak back to a shed recently erected by Mr. Alderman Smith, owner of the Sugar House, who declared his readiness to do everything he could, but who actually did very little to rectify the situation. After years of negotiation the College, in 1820, bought the Sugar House from Smith for the sum of £1,500.|$|E

2500|$|Frightened by the events, on August 2 the {{authorities}} sent a negotiating team from Bucharest. Ilie Verdeț (first vice-president of the Council of Ministers) and Gheorghe Pană (president of the Central Council of the General Trade Union Confederation of Romania and Minister of Labour) were both Politburo members, Verdeț a former miner himself. Dobre, a pit brigade chief from the Paroșeni mine, later recalled Verdeț's speech (attended by some 20,000 miners), {{in which he}} stated he could not decide what measures to take but was merely there {{to find out about}} the miners' problems, which only Ceaușescu could decide to alleviate. At this point the crowd shouted, demanding Ceaușescu's personal presence, whereupon Verdeț claimed the President was occupied with [...] "urgent party and state problems" [...] and that if work resumed Verdeț would [...] "guarantee" [...] his return to the Valley within a month with a favourable reply from Ceaușescu. These promises were regarded with great suspicion by the crowd, which, emboldened, began booing again and warned that they would not go back to work until Ceaușescu personally came and publicly promised to resolve their grievances. Booed, insulted and pelted with food scraps, Verdeț and Pană hid behind Dobre and, backed up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gatekeeper's booth, nervously begged him to assure their safety. Literally backed into a corner, Verdeț promised the miners that he would convince Ceaușescu to come.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{training}} {{institute for}} promulgating the religion in Italy {{was conducted by}} Mildred Mottahehdeh in February 1967. In 1968 a Catholic monk, Padre Marian, mentioned the religion on his television program and read the prayer by 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Also Maud Basio who aside from all her services (see below) was also mother of Mrs. Firuz Kazemzadeh, died. In 1969 the Italian Bahá'í Publishing Trust was established and the national assembly established cooperative relations with the Italian Esperanto Federation. By September 1970 Alfredo Speranza, a noted pianist who moved to Italy, joined the religion {{as well as the}} first citizen of San Marino. In May 1976 a 1,000-word article reviewing the religion was printed in La Stampa in Turin after interviewing the secretary of the national assembly A. Parsa, {{a member of the national}} assembly, was invited to start a weekly one-hour broadcast called [...] "Programme Baha'i" [...] on a station in Pisa. Other regular radio broadcasts began inBologna, Bolzano and Trofarello. Along with informational talks from Bahá'í teachings music was interspersed from various Baha'i musicians like Seals and Crofts, Dizzy Gillespie, England Dan and John Ford Coley as well as Italian artists. In February 1977 coordinated efforts focused the national community on Brescia, Cosenza and Salerno for one week and in Lipari, Messina and Trofarello the second week. At the end of the effort Salerno elected an assembly. The assembly of Trieste rented display case for Bahá'í literature at a bus terminal in Muggia and also awarded trophies for service to humanity. Cosenza was the focus of some effort in August 1977 when traveling teachers visiting the pioneer there. It was decided to show some filmstrips but the living room would not hold the more than 12 people who attended they set up to show the film outside, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house. The neighbors were glad to cooperate. The woman downstairs handed chairs from her apartment out the window. Filmstrips like The Bahá'ís and the Holy Land and part of the Green Light Expedition about Rúhíyyih Khanum's travels in Bolivia and Peru. A month later the first assembly of Cosenza was elected.|$|E
