5|$|In September 1954, Monroe began filming Billy Wilder's comedy The Seven Year Itch, {{in which}} she starred {{opposite}} Tom Ewell {{as a woman who}} becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. Although the film was shot in Hollywood, the studio decided to generate advance publicity by staging the filming of a scene on Lexington Avenue in New York. In the shoot, Monroe is standing on a subway grate with the <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career. The shoot lasted for several hours and attracted a crowd of nearly 2,000 spectators, including professional photographers.|$|E
5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault introduced diffuser designs similar to the Red Bull RB6. Ferrari's design largely changed the shape of their exhaust system, and introduced a new gearbox case for Massa's car to raise the pick-up points of its rear suspension to help him adjust to the changes. They constructed a larger radiator to deal with the additional heat. Mercedes elected not to bring a new gearbox casing, but introduced a new rear diffuser to fully utilise the <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> from the car's exhaust. Renault's design had the exit of their car's exhaust which had thermal protection against high temperatures and the team introduced a new design of their gearbox casing to allow for the pick-up points for its rear suspension to be accommodated. After running the F-duct device (which increases a car's top speed) in Friday practice, Red Bull decided to use it {{for the remainder of the}} weekend.|$|E

25|$|Beside the Clearwater River at {{the base}} of White Horse Bluff, there is a natural refrigerator. The McDiarmid family {{operated}} four fishing camps along the river from 1944 to 1970. One summer, they noticed a cold draft of <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> outward from some cracks here. They enlarged it, built some walls and were able to keep ice solid and perishable foods cold even in the summer heat, truly a luxury in the wilderness. The refrigerator is still there today (although partly fallen in) and, when measured by this writer in June 2003, was 2 degrees Celsius inside.|$|E
25|$|The Tropical {{continental}} airmass (CT) finally retreats {{from most}} part of Nigeria, and the West African atmosphere around April to May, leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria. The sun's rays enters {{into the atmosphere}} of Nigeria more intense than it does during {{the presence of the}} Tropical continental airmass, which contained dust (in form of haze) that reduced the intensity of the sun. The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria. This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure.|$|E

500|$|Her major {{breakthrough}} came in 1953, when she starred in three pictures: the film noir Niagara, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire. Sarah Churchwell, Monroe's biographer, notes that [...] "unconscious, rather than conscious, sexuality {{would become the}} Marilyn hallmark after 1953", and the actress {{became one of the}} most popular and recognizable people in America. In 1955 Monroe appeared in the Billy Wilder–directed comedy The Seven Year Itch, in which she becomes the object of her married neighbor's sexual fantasies. In it, Monroe stands on a subway grate with the <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> up the skirt of her white dress, which {{became one of the most}} famous scenes of her career.|$|E
2500|$|... (2002) Protection {{factors of}} half mask {{respirators}} {{that are not}} always used (because of high air temperature) have been very low. Half of the PF values were less than 2.

2500|$|Although {{strong winds}} often mix {{the air and}} can disperse, fragment, or prevent many kinds of fog, {{markedly}} warmer and humid <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to 50 mph/80 km/h or more -- this fog {{will be in a}} turbulent, rapidly moving, and comparatively shallow layer, observed as inches/a few cm in depth over flat farm fields, flat urban terrain and the like, and/or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{discovery}} {{was that the}} total amount of air needed to lift the craft was a function of the roughness of the surface it traveled over. On flat surfaces, like pavement, the needed air pressure was so low that hovercraft were able to compete in energy terms with conventional systems like steel wheels. However, as the hovercraft lift system acted as both a lift and very effective suspension, it naturally lent itself to high-speed use where conventional suspension systems were considered too complex. This led to a variety of [...] "hovertrain" [...] proposals during the 1960s, including England's Tracked Hovercraft and France's Aérotrain. In the U.S., Rohr Inc. and Garrett both took out licenses to develop local versions of the Aérotrain. These designs competed with maglev systems in the high-speed arena, where their primary advantage was the very [...] "low tech" [...] tracks they needed. On the downside, the <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> dirt and trash out from under the trains presented a unique problem in stations, and interest in them waned in the 1970s.|$|E
