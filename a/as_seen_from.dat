5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (<b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the planet Earth) {{is a type}} of eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|From −125,000 till +125,000 {{there are}} only about ten 243-year series at both nodes {{regarding}} all the transits of Venus in this very long time-span, because both nodes of the orbit of Venus move back and forward in time <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth. The planet is, thus, almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet {{has been observed}} to transit its host star.|$|E

5|$|If {{the planet}} transits the star <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> our direction, the radius should be measurable, albeit with some uncertainty. Unfortunately, {{measurements}} {{made with the}} Canadian-built MOST space telescope indicate that transits do not occur.|$|E
5|$|It can be {{seen with}} the unaided eye as a third-magnitude star. <b>As</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Tau Ceti, the Sun would be a third-magnitude star in the {{northern}} hemisphere constellation Boötes..|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.9; in other words, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth, Kepler-8 {{is an extremely}} dim star. It cannot be seen with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|Structure 6 (or Structure VI) is on {{the west}} side of the Central Plaza and, {{together}} with Structures 4a, 4b and 4c, forms an E-Group astronomical complex.

5|$|The star, <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth, has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 13.8. It is not visible {{with the naked}} eye. In comparison, Pluto's apparent magnitude at its brightest is slightly brighter, at 13.65.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of {{the conquest}} <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> {{the point of}} view of the {{defeated}} highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation down through the Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619. A letter from the defeated Tz'utujil Maya nobility of Santiago Atitlán to the Spanish king written in 1571 details the exploitation of the subjugated peoples.|$|E

5|$|In {{many animals}} {{of the deep}} sea, {{including}} several squid species, bacterial bioluminescence is used for camouflage by counterillumination, in which the animal matches the overhead environmental light <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> below. In these animals, photoreceptors control the illumination to match {{the brightness of the}} background. These light organs are usually separate from the tissue containing the bioluminescent bacteria. However, in one species, Euprymna scolopes, the bacteria are an integral component of the animal's light organ.|$|E

Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation and abuse of women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing in front of, their host stars <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly and slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E
