5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a rural road, <b>and,</b> <b>sometime</b> between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. The exact location of the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.|$|E
5|$|Exxon Valdez {{departed}} {{the port}} of Valdez, Alaska at 9:12 p.m. March 23, 1989 with 53 million gallons of crude oil bound for California. A harbor pilot guided the ship through the Valdez Narrows before departing the ship and returning control to Hazelwood, the ship's master. The ship maneuvered out of the outbound traffic lane in the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) to avoid icebergs. Following the maneuver <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> after 11 p.m., Hazelwood departed the navigation bridge and was in his stateroom {{at the time of}} the accident.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating has {{established}} {{the dates of}} three of Mount Tambora's eruptions before the 1815 eruption, although their magnitudes are unknown. The estimated dates are sometime between 4110 and 3700 BC, around 3050 BC, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> between 590 and 890 AD. Each of them were explosive, central vent eruptions with similar characteristics, but the 590-890 AD eruption caused no pyroclastic flows.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{moved quickly}} to take {{advantage}} of their victory: a Byzantine army invaded Arab-held Armenia, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> in October or November, defeated and killed the emir Ali ibn Yahya. Thus, within a single campaigning season, the Byzantines had eliminated the three most dangerous opponents on their eastern border. In retrospect, these successes proved decisive, as the battle permanently destroyed the power of Melitene. The Byzantine victory at Lalakaon altered the strategic balance in the region, and heralded the beginning of Byzantium's century-long offensive in the East.|$|E
5|$|The discography of Isobel Campbell, a Scottish {{musician}} and vocalist, {{consists of four}} solo studio albums, seven singles, a studio album in collaboration with Bill Wells and three with Mark Lanegan {{as well as several}} cameos on other artists' records.

5|$|Beckford's Tower in Lansdown {{overlooking}} {{the city of}} Bath, was completed in 1827 for wealthy local resident William Beckford, to a design by Bath architect Henry Goodridge. Beckford was an English novelist, an art collector and patron of works of decorative art, a critic, travel writer <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> politician, reputed at one stage in his life to be the richest commoner in England. In 1822 he sold Fonthill Abbey, and {{a large part of}} his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000, and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, joining them with a one-storey arch thrown across a driveway. In 1836 he also bought Nos. 18 and 19 Lansdown Crescent.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, {{the group}} E Clampus Vitus {{commissioned}} and dedicated a plaque commemorating Emperor Norton's {{call for the}} construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group's intention was that the plaque be placed on the newly opened San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge itself. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however; <b>and,</b> <b>sometime</b> shortly after World War II, the plaque was installed at the Cliff House. In the 1990s, the plaque was moved to the Transbay Terminal. When the Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010, as part of the project to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, the plaque was placed in storage, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} {{from the back}} of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in from the back and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn down by the abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> later in life for females after reaching the base of the premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{creation}} of the central 610 Office, parallel 610 Offices were established at each administrative level wherever populations of Falun Gong practitioners were present, including the provincial, district, municipal, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> neighborhood levels. In some instances, 610 Offices have been established within large corporations and universities. Each office takes orders from the 610 Office one administrative level above, or from the Communist Party authorities at the same organizational level. In turn, the local 610 Offices influence the officers of other state and party bodies, such as media organizations, local public security bureaus, and courts.|$|E

5|$|Through a {{completely}} random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's word processor, for example). Another collector, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, {{is a retired}} cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips.|$|E
5|$|Throughout their {{recording}} career Powderfinger {{consisted of}} five members: Bernard Fanning was a vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist and harmonicist and contributed lyrics; John Collins was their bass guitarist; Ian Haug {{was their first}} lead vocalist but mostly provided backing vocals and guitar; Darren Middleton was their co-lead guitarist, keyboardist, backing vocalist <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> lead vocalist; Jon Coghill was their drummer and percussionist. The lineup remained stable from 1992 to their disbandment in November 2010. Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies. The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy.|$|E
5|$|Somairle first {{appears on}} record in 1153, when he rose in {{rebellion}} with his nephews, {{the sons of}} the royal pretender Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair (fl. 1134), against the recently enthroned Máel Coluim IV, King of Scots (died 1165). In the same year, Somairle's father-in-law was murdered after ruling the Kingdom of the Isles about forty years. Óláfr was succeeded by his son, Guðrøðr; <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> afterwards, Somairle participated in a coup within the kingdom by presenting Dubgall as a potential king. In consequence, Somairle and his brother-in-law fought a naval battle in 1156, after which much of the Hebrides appear to have fallen under Somairle's control. Two years later, he defeated Guðrøðar outright and took control of the entire island-kingdom. In 1164, Somairle again rose against the King of Scots, and is recorded in various early sources to have commanded a massive invasion force of men from throughout the Isles, Argyll, Kintyre, and Scandinavian Dublin. Somairle's host sailed up the Clyde, and made landfall near what is today Renfrew, where they were crushed by the Scots, and he himself was slain. Following Somairle's demise, Guðrøðr returned to the Isles and seated himself on Mann, although the Hebridean-territories won by Somairle in 1156 were retained by his descendants, the meic Somairle.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{games of}} the Commander Keen series were developed by id Software, but after {{the success of their}} 3D first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993), they cancelled the planned future episodes in the series. In 1999, founder John Carmack remarked that he was considering making a Game Boy Color game for the series, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> afterwards id approached Activision with the idea. Activision recommended David A. Palmer Productions to develop the game, as they had been proposing to make Game Boy Color versions of id's other games, and Palmer proceeded to make the game with oversight from id. The game was announced in April 2001 and released soon after. It received mixed reviews from critics, who gave varied opinions {{on the quality of the}} game's graphics and the suitability of the ten-year-old computer-based gameplay on a modern handheld game console, and generally found the game best suited for fans of the original series or younger players.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, {{thick-walled}} and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, <b>and</b> <b>sometime</b> joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
