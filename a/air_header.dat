40|$|Case StudyAir Compressor Site Performance Testing: Apparent Simplicity and Practical Complexity: The {{performance}} of a steam turbine driven air compressor deteriorated by 35 % over a span of four months. This Case Study elaborates on the identification, analysis and restoration of performance. Compressor Rating: Casings: 2 with intercooler. Capacity: 19, 497 Inlet m 3 /hr [11, 476 ICFM]. Speed: 8400 rpm. Rated mass flow: 21, 585 Kg/hr [793 lb/min]. Power: 2. 3 MW. Discharge pressure: 10. 6 bara. [152. 3 Psia]. The subject air compressor forms part of the utility and instrumentation air supply system to an oil refinery. Constant pressure at header that supplies air to instrumentation system is very important. Any reduction in mass flow of dry air to the air supply system will result in reduction of the header pressure. Drop in <b>air</b> <b>header</b> pressure was experienced that prompted potential deterioration in air compressor performance. Performance testing at site indicated operating points almost on the design surge curve. The difference between the design polytrophic efficiency and the polytrophic efficiency calculated from data collected during operation at comparable operating points {{for the first and}} second casings were marginal, 0. 3 to 0. 7 percent. The calibration of the instrumentation used during testing was verified and the air inlet filter elements were replaced. After examining other possible causes the compressor was opened and it was found to be clean. The root-cause was found to be an unexpected obstruction. The Case Study shows {{how important it is to}} measure the inlet conditions as close to the compressor inlet nozzle as possible besides emphasizing on thorough compressor system analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} the pressure drop in headers and development of correlation for pressure loss coefficient for single phase flow through round cylindrical headers of parallel MCHXs. The working fluid was compressed <b>air</b> flowing through <b>header</b> with 1 - 20 m/s based on smallest cross section while the velocity through micro-channels was in the range 6 - 30 m/s. The experimental results indicate that the pressure loss coefficient of inlet header is a linear function of the ratio of velocities through micro-channel tube and header, except for the first two micro-channel tubes; the pressure loss coefficient of outlet header is a quadratic function of the ratio of velocities through micro-channel tube and header, and decreases as the velocities through upstream micro-channel tubes increase. Correlations for predicting pressure drop of inlet header and outlet header are developed and agreement for 98 % of experimental data is within a Â± 15 Pa...|$|R
5000|$|Inspired by the COPO Camaros of {{the late}} 1960s, the Camaro LS7 Concept was built from the 2010 Camaro SS with LS3 engine that gets {{replaced}} with a GM Performance Parts LS7 crate engine producing around [...] With {{the inclusion of a}} high performance exhaust, <b>headers,</b> <b>air</b> intake system and replacement camshaft all developed by GM Performance Parts reflects the heritage that the COPO's of past brought to the tracks. Other modifications include a Tremec six-speed manual transmission, Brembo brakes, Hurst short-throw shifter, 20-inch custom wheels, and a lowered ride height. The exterior of the car is presented in a Victory Red color with accents of matte black on the [...] "LS7" [...] badges, front grille slot, rear headlight panel, and hood with the LS7 logo on top of the hood cowl in Victory Red. The interior accentuates the exterior by matching the color scheme with the Victory Red interior panel trim that flows on the doors and dash panel {{as well as on the}} gauges of the odometers and four gauge cluster pack. Gloss black replaces every trim that came in silver in the final production Camaros such as on the steering wheel, Hurst shifter knob, vent trimings, and center console clusters.|$|R
40|$|With {{wireless}} devices becoming ubiquitous, {{the problem}} of designing high performance and reliable wireless networks is of great importance today. Wireless links are characterized by a rapidly varying channel, requiring transmitters to dynamically adapt their transmit bit rate. The broadcast nature of radio also necessitates the use of medium access protocols to arbitrate access among competing transmitters and reduce losses due to interference, while enabling successful concurrent transmissions. We observe that the problems with existing bit rate adaptation and medium access protocols stem from insufficient information about the wireless channel at the link layer. This dissertation makes two contributions: (i) a redesign of the interface between the physical and link layers in wireless networks to expose {{more information about the}} wireless channel to the link layer, and (ii) the design and evaluation of new link-layer protocols that improve throughput by using information about the channel delivered via the new interface. In today's network architecture, the physical layer (PHY) delivers received frames and per-frame signal strength measurements to the link layer. This dissertation proposes two enhancements to this interface: the PHY streams bits to the link layer as soon as they are decoded and before the entire frame reception completes, and it computes and exports SoftPHY hints with each decoded bit. The SoftPHY hint of a bit indicates the PHY's confidence that the decoded bit is correct. We show that the SoftPHY hints of a received frame can be used to estimate the bit error rate (BER) of the wireless channel faster and with more accuracy than with existing methods. We develop the SoftRate bit rate adaptation protocol that uses this BER computed from SoftPHY hints to pick transmit bit rates and improves throughput by 2 x over existing protocols. The streaming PHY interface enables the link layer to learn about the current transmission on the <b>air</b> by decoding <b>headers</b> before frame reception completes. The SoftCMAP and CMAP protocols make smart medium access decisions using this knowledge of ongoing transmissions along with a distributed map of conflicting transmissions, and improve aggregate network throughput by up to 50 % by increasing the number of successful concurrent transmissions. by Mythili Ranganath Vutukuru.
