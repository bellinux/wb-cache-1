5|$|Breaking Benjamin is an American {{rock band}} from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup {{of the band}} also {{included}} guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) and We Are Not Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E
5000|$|As with Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest,</b> much of {{the comedy}} stemmed from Baker's malapropisms and {{partially}} improvised Northern humour, and Not On Your Nellie was essentially a new version (and equivalent) of Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest</b> in a different location. Unfortunately this issue was not helped {{by the fact that}} Bottomley and Brennand recycled many of their old gags - and even their entire scripts - from Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest</b> (this can be seen most prominently in the 1975 episode [...] "Feeling The Draught" [...] which was a remake of their 1969 Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest</b> episode [...] "Two Pennies To Rub Together").|$|R
50|$|Not On Your Nellie first premiered in 1974, a {{year after}} Baker's {{previous}} series, Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest,</b> ended. In a 1973 television interview with Baker (available on the Series 7 DVD of Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest),</b> she stated that Not On Your Nellie was planned as a spin-off from Nearest <b>and</b> <b>Dearest</b> <b>and</b> would focus on the character Nellie Pledge after her brother Eli (Jimmy Jewel) deserts her {{following the end of}} their family business, Pledge's Purer Pickles.|$|R

5|$|Stevens, Bilson and De Meo {{began to}} {{consider}} making The Rocketeer as a low-budget film, shot in black-and-white {{and funded by}} independent investors. Their plan {{was to make the}} film a complete homage to the Commando Cody serial films, and use a cast largely associated with character actors. However, that same year, the trio approached William Dear to direct/co-write The Rocketeer, and they eventually dropped the low-budget idea. Bilson, De Meo, <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> kept the comic book's basic plot intact, but fleshed it out to include a Hollywood setting and a climactic battle against a Nazi Zeppelin. They also tweaked Cliff's girlfriend to avoid comparisons to Bettie Page (Stevens' original inspiration), changing her name from Betty to Jenny and her profession from nude model to Hollywood extra (a change also made to make the film more family friendly). Dear proceeded to transform the climax from a submarine into a Zeppelin setpiece.|$|E

25|$|Barrie had a {{long string}} of successes on the stage after Peter Pan, many of which discuss social concerns, as Barrie {{continued}} to integrate his work and his beliefs. The Twelve Pound Look (1921) concerns a wife divorcing a peer and gaining an independent income. Other plays, such as Mary Rose (1920) <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> Brutus (1917), revisit the idea of the ageless child and parallel worlds.|$|E

By the 1950s, both Ellen Rimbauer and Sukeena had disappeared in Rose Red.|$|E

When Pickett needed a mounted force for his operations he selected Major Dearing to command it, <b>and</b> <b>Dearing</b> gathered some 200 men for a provisional battalion. On January 12, 1864 a new cavalry regiment was proposed for service with Pickett, <b>and</b> he recommended <b>Dearing</b> as the commanding officer. Secretary of war James A.

25|$|Despite {{his best}} {{intentions}} {{of producing a}} publication that did not dwell {{in the realm of}} heavy political exposé, Simons found a paucity of publishable material written on vaguely socialist themes in a light-hearted vein. With little humor or light fiction from which to choose, The Coming Nation inevitably moved into the usual heavier political fare, with the farmer's son Simons once again revisiting a theme near <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> to him in a series of articles: the role of the farmer in the American socialist movement.|$|E

25|$|As an actress, she {{was given}} the role of Rei Hino in the live action {{television}} series of Sailor Moon, which began her acting career. Her first significant film role was in Mamiya Kyōdai, and as result {{of the influence of}} the director, Yoshimitsu Morita, she decided to concentrate on acting rather than modeling. She initially concentrated on films, including the leading roles in Cherry Pie <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> Friends. In late 2007, she had her first leading role in a TV drama, in the late-night drama Mop Girl. In 2008, {{she was given}} the role of the heroine in Homeroom on the Beachside, Fuji Television's Monday 9pm drama for the summer season. As this is the headline drama slot for a major network, it represented a major step forward for her career.|$|E
25|$|Having {{played his}} last romantic lead in Bell, Book and Candle (1958), with Kim Novak, and silver-haired (although not all was his—he wore a partial {{hairpiece}} starting with It's a Wonderful Life {{and in every}} film thereafter), Stewart transitioned into more family-related films in the 1960s when he signed a multi-movie deal with 20th Century Fox. These included the successful Henry Koster outing Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation (1962), and the less memorable films Take Her, She's Mine (1963) <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> Brigitte (1965), which featured French model Brigitte Bardot {{as the object of}} Stewart's son's mash notes. The Civil War period film Shenandoah (1965) and the western family film The Rare Breed fared better at the box office; the Civil War movie, with strong antiwar and humanitarian themes, was a hit in the South.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the long}} period of {{tensions}} between his father and step-brother, Khurram began to drift closer to his father and over time started to be considered the de facto heir-apparent by court chroniclers. This status was given official sanction when Jahangir granted the sarkar of Hissar-Feroza, which had traditionally been the fief of the heir-apparent, to Khurram in 1608. Nur Jahan was an intelligent and beautiful lady with an excellent educational background. She was {{an active participant in}} the decisions made by Jahangir. Slowly and gradually, she became the actual power behind the throne, as Jahangir became more indulgent in wine and opium. Coins began to be struck containing her name along with Jahangir's name. Her near <b>and</b> <b>dear</b> relatives acquired important positions in the Mughal court, termed as the Nur Jahan junta by historians. After the death of Jahangir in 1627, Nur Jahan stepped down from politics and led a quiet life.|$|E

500|$|Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> {{began to}} pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 {{to the major}} film studios but were turned down. [...] "This was 1986, long before Batman or Dick Tracy or {{anything}} similar", Stevens explained. [...] "In those days, no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie. We got there about three years too early for our own good!" [...] Walt Disney Studios eventually accepted The Rocketeer because they believed the film had toyetic potential and appeal for merchandising. The Rocketeer was set to be released through the studio's Touchstone Pictures label; Stevens, Bilson, De Meo, <b>and</b> <b>Dear</b> all signed a contract which would permit {{them to make a}} trilogy of Rocketeer films. However, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg switched the film to a Walt Disney Pictures release. According to Stevens, [...] "immediately, Betty and anything else 'adult' went right out with the bathwater. They really tried to shoehorn it into a kiddie property so they could sell toys. All they really wanted {{at the end of the}} day, was the name".|$|E
