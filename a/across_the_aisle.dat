5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a tripwire <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E

The older men sat immediately between the youths and boys, talking in hoarse whispers <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> about <b>the</b> state of the crops and the county ticket, while the women {{in much the same}} way conversed about children and raising onions and strawberries.

500|$|Considerable {{arrangements}} {{had been}} made for the President's security. [...] Exposition police were stationed at the doors; detectives from the Buffalo police guarded the aisle. In addition to McKinley's usual Secret Service agent, George Foster, two other agents {{had been assigned to}} the Buffalo trip because of Cortelyou's security concerns. Babcock was made nervous by a joke at lunch in an Exposition restaurant that the President might be shot during the reception. He had arranged for a dozen artillerymen to attend the reception in full-dress uniform, intending to use them as decoration. Instead, he had them stand in the aisle with instructions to close on any suspicious-looking person who might approach the President. These men were not trained in police work, and served to crowd the area in front of the President and obstruct the views of the detectives and Secret Service. [...] At such events, Foster usually stood just to the left and behind McKinley. Milburn wished to stand to McKinley's left to be able to introduce anyone he knew in the line to the President, and Foster and another agent instead stood <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> from McKinley.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} the {{original}} wording of the Constitution has not been modified to reflect contemporary practice, is a testimony to the widespread conservative sentiments shared <b>across</b> <b>the</b> political <b>aisle</b> that extensive constitutional revision should be avoided. In practice, {{this means that the}} function, authority and mandate of the Council of State is heavily influenced by long-standing conventions.|$|R

500|$|Disraeli's {{enthusiastic}} {{propagation of}} the British Empire {{has also been}} seen as appealing to working class voters. Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was {{the province of the}} Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy. This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire. Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism [...] "decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during {{the last quarter of the}} century than anything else". Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, [...] "To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire." [...] Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies. Gladstone's biographer Philip Magnus contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who [...] "never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest." [...] In Parry's view, Disraeli's foreign policy [...] "can be seen as a gigantic castle in the air (as it was by Gladstone), or as an overdue attempt to force the British commercial classes to awaken to the realities of European politics." ...|$|E

5000|$|The chancel arch was {{replaced}} in the 14th century, {{and a new}} roof {{was added to the}} nave a century later.

He followed his future brother-in-law to a pew on the bridegroom's side, for, with intuitive perception of the sexes' endless warfare, each of the opposing parties to this contract had its serried battalion, the arrows of whose suspicion kept glancing <b>across</b> and <b>across</b> <b>the</b> central <b>aisle.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Nave, {{the body}} of the church, {{accommodates}} nine hundred sixty-six people for daily Masses and other ceremonies.

It may also be noted that during the renovations by Conrad-Schmitt, the entire building was cracked down the middle and deeply in danger of collapse. To resolve this, steel strand beams were mounted from wall to wall in the nave to provide a counter push and pull action, keeping the building from falling in or out.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} topics of {{creativity}} and imagination {{in relation to the}} design and construction of the lierne vaults in <b>the</b> presbytery <b>aisles</b> of Wells Cathedral, erected around 1330. It explores the potential of digital scanning and analysis for forensic investigation of the structure in order to identify the processes involved. Four different processes were employed and we compare those used in the three eastern bays of the north and south aisles. These are shown to share characteristics with the retrochoir but to involve different approaches to 3 -D projection and stone-cutting. We conclude that the basic geometry of the vaults was defined in advance of construction, using full-scale drawings worked out on a tracing floor. In both sets of vaults the 3 -D geometry continued as a sequence of steps and was derived from measurements ascertained from existing elements (including the drawings) but was not consistent <b>across</b> <b>the</b> two <b>aisles.</b> <b>The</b> processes reveal different priorities, whether for level ridges (north aisle), different choices in terms of rib radii or apex heights, and different sequences of design steps. This demonstrates the potential for experimentation at every stage of construction...|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{new church}} in the {{immediate}} neighbourhood of his house {{in a state of}} growth and development congenial to the St. Ambrose trained mind, and here Mr. Dutton, after old Micklethwayte custom, was attending the early matins, when, in the alternate verses of the psalm, he heard a fresh young voice that seemed to renew those days gone by, and looking <b>across</b> <b>the</b> central <b>aisle</b> his eyes met a pair of dark ones which gave a sudden glitter of gladness at the encounter. That was all he saw or cared to see.

50|$|The church {{building}} {{dates from the}} 12th century. The easternmost bay of the arcade for <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> was built in about 1180 and the bell tower was added early in the 13th century. Between 1296 and 1316 a chantry chapel {{was added to the}} north side of the nave. Slightly later <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> was extended <b>the</b> full length of the nave, a south chapel was included and a south porch was added. The arch to the south chapel is 14th century and all the windows of <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> are Decorated Gothic. In the 15th century a clerestory was added to the nave and a rood screen and rood loft were built <b>across</b> <b>the</b> nave and <b>aisle.</b> <b>The</b> chantry chapel was in disrepair by 1520 and demolished shortly after 1530. Later in the 16th century a large window was inserted in the north wall of the nave towards its western end. It and all the other windows in the north wall are Perpendicular Gothic. In 1867-68 the {{church building}} was restored, the chancel and south porch were rebuilt and the height of the chancel was increased.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} of Richeza's projects was the re-building of the Abbey of Brauweiler. Her parents had founded Brauweiler, but the original church was modestly furnished, which was incompatible with the dynasty's territorial objectives. After Otto's death, Richeza decided to make Brauweiler the center of Ezzonen memory. Since the original building didn't suit this purpose, Richeza built a new Abbey, which remains in good condition. When the construction began a three-aisled pillared basilica was planned with projecting transept to <b>the</b> east apse <b>across</b> a crypt. <b>The</b> <b>aisles</b> were groined vaults with flat ceilings in the central nave. Inside, the nave had five , each of which was half {{as large as the}} square crossing. Throughout the Abbey the cross-vaulted ceiling could be seen (for example in <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> pillars or <b>the</b> crypt), which can be found in many Ezzonen buildings.
