5|$|Conversely, every {{directed}} acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, {{this property}} {{can be used as}} an alternative definition of the {{directed acyclic graph}}s: they <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> graphs that have topological orderings.|$|E
5|$|The meet-irreducible {{elements}} of this lattice <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> multiplicative graphs. These are the graphs K such that a product G × H has a homomorphism to K only when one of G or H also does. Identifying multiplicative graphs {{lies at the heart}} of Hedetniemi's conjecture.|$|E
5|$|A 1-forest, {{sometimes}} called a maximal pseudoforest, is a pseudoforest to which no more edges {{can be added}} without causing some component of the graph to contain multiple cycles. If a pseudoforest contains a tree {{as one of its}} components, it cannot be a 1-forest, for one can add either an edge connecting two vertices within that tree, forming a single cycle, or an edge connecting that tree to some other component. Thus, the 1-forests <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> pseudoforests in which every component is a 1-tree.|$|E

Because of the elliptical orbit, {{and as a consequence}} of Kepler's second law, θ does not progress uniformly with time. Nevertheless, θ = 0° <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> time of the vernal equinox, θ = 90° <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> time of the summer solstice, θ = 180° <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> time of the autumnal equinox and θ = 270° <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> time of the winter solstice.|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} six periods of the {{periodic}} table, the noble gases <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> members of group18 of the periodic table. Noble gases are typically highly unreactive except when under particular extreme conditions. The inertness of noble gases makes them very suitable in applications where reactions are not wanted. For example, argon is used in light bulbs to prevent the hot tungsten filament from oxidizing; also, helium is used in breathing gas by deep-sea divers to prevent oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal {{notation}} (equivalently, endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E
5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. When this happens, correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E

5|$|Moving from {{individual}} graphs to graph families, if {{a family of}} graphs has the property that every subgraph of a graph in the family {{is also in the}} family, and every graph in the family has at most as many edges as vertices, then the family contains only pseudoforests. For instance, every subgraph of a thrackle (a graph drawn so that every pair of edges has one point of intersection) is also a thrackle, so Conway's conjecture that every thrackle has at most as many edges as vertices can be restated as saying that every thrackle is a pseudoforest. A more precise characterization is that, if the conjecture is true, then the thrackles <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> pseudoforests with no four-vertex cycle and at most one odd cycle.|$|E
5|$|As Boykett argues, any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} {{is equivalent to}} an automaton in rectangular form, in which the cells are offset a half unit at each time step, and in which both the forward and reverse evolution of the automaton have neighborhoods with just two cells, the cells a half unit away in each direction. If a reversible automaton has neighborhoods larger than two cells, it can be simulated by a reversible automaton with smaller neighborhoods and more states per cell, in which each cell of the simulating automaton simulates a contiguous block of cells in the simulated automaton. The two axioms of a semicentral bigroupoid <b>are</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> conditions required on the forward and reverse transition functions of these two-cell neighborhoods to be the reverses of each other. That is, every semicentral bigroupoid defines a reversible cellular automaton in rectangular form, in which the transition function of the automaton uses the operation to combine the two cells of its neighborhood, and in which the operation similarly defines the reverse dynamics of the automaton. Every one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton is equivalent to one in this form.|$|E
