40|$|AbstractTrimming {{operation}} as {{an important}} stage of many sheet and bulk metal processes is geometrically and physically complex and computationally challenging. This {{is especially true for}} metal forming processes where net-shape specification is critical. In this paper, we present an efficient approach for fast trimming simulation of 3 D forged components so that the effect of such trimming operations on post-forming material spingback, thermal distortion and final dimensional and shape accuracy of formed parts can be quantified. This approach comprises steps including definition of trim line, elimination of discarded elements, adjustment of nodal positions close to the trim line and mapping of the state variables from the original mesh to the new mesh. To evaluate the effect of residual stresses in trimming operation, a new algorithm involving a scaling interpolation and coordinate transformation procedure is proposed so that limited 2 D trimming simulations can be used to quantify and to map trimming induced residual stresses onto the whole 3 D model for further process simulation. This developed trimming simulation approach was verified using an industry case study in hot forging of a 3 D <b>aerofoil</b> <b>blade</b> by three post-forging cooling simulation cases including an untrimmed blade, a trimmed blade and a trimmed blade with the inclusion of trimming induced residual stresses. The simulation results were compared with actual measurement data of the forged <b>aerofoil</b> <b>blade</b> with excellent results obtained. The results show that the trimming operation has a significant effect on post-forging springback and thermal distortion but much less so on thickness of the aerofoil sections of the forged blade. The results also demonstrate that the proposed trimming simulation approach is computationally efficient and robust for other bulk and sheet metal forming processes of complex shapes...|$|E

40|$|Axial flow {{fans are}} often the largest {{contributor}} to the noise emitted from commercial refrigerator systems. This has driven the demand for quieter, yet higher performance axial flow fans. Turbulent fluid motion and aerodynamic forces interacting with the fan blades generate noise as the fan rotates. The aerodynamic noise emitted from a fan can be modelled {{with varying degrees of}} accuracy which are typically proportional to the computational cost. Application of a fan performance model to an optimisation algorithm can be used to develop new and higher performing fan blades. However, there is currently no rapid method to generate an optimal fan design of specified performance. The method developed in this project was experimentally validated and shown to be able to predict the flow rate accurately; however, the fan noise prediction was unsuccessful. Noise source identification showed that the dominant fan noise source was incident turbulence noise which was neglected in the aeroacoustic modelling and explains the poor noise prediction. Knowing the dominant noise source allows for future modelling to include all relevant physics which will allow for more accurate modelling that will increase the performance of axial flow fans and reduce refrigeration noise.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development and}} implementation of an efficient, compact high-order finite-volume scheme in the HMB CFD solver. This formulation is based on the variable extrapolation MUSCL-scheme, where high-order spatial accuracy (up to 4 th-order) is achieved using high-order correction terms through a successive differentiation. The scheme has also been modified to cope with physical and multiblock mesh interfaces, so stability, conservativeness, and high-order accuracy are guaranteed. A wide variety of results for the underlying method are presented, including two-and three-dimensional test cases. The convection of an isentropic vortex, and the aerodynamic interaction between a vortex and a NACA- 0012 <b>aerofoil</b> (<b>blade</b> vortex interaction problem BVI) are first studied, demonstrating the high level of accuracy of the new formulation.

40|$|The {{dimensional}} tolerances {{are among}} the most important manufacturing criteria in the forging of aerofoil blades for aero-engine applications. These are usually classified in relation to aerofoil shape, thickness and twist along cross-sections and are. affected by many factors such as preform shape, temperature, die elasticity and component springback. The interaction of all these factors makes design for net-shape forging extremely difficult. The focus was on the final shape of the forged aerofoil blades, which was affected by temperature, die elasticity and springback. A thermaIly coupled 3 D thermo-elasto-visco-plastic analysis was employed to. investigate the entire forging cycle including forging, removal of dies and cooling of the aerofoil section, so that the e{fect of forging and post forging conditions such as temperature can be taken into account. A die-shape compensation strategy is presented in thisÃ‚Â· thesis. A di~ cleaning technology has been dev. eloped to represent the dies as a series of sampled points. These points were subsequently utilized as spline control points in the definition of a 3 D spline surface.

40|$|Abstract [...] A cascade {{is defined}} as an {{infinite}} row of equidis-tant similarly aerofoil bodies. The cascade is used to divert a flow stream with a minimal loss. The flow over an axial cascade pre-sents a complicated intra blade fluid dynamic interaction that causes the flow to behave differently than the flow over a single <b>aerofoil</b> <b>blade.</b> A cascade tunnel in which different shapes of cas-cades could be tested for performance evaluation has been build. An axial flat plate cascade of 70 mm chord, 215 mm span and 0. 55 pitch chord ratio has been tested in this tunnel for evaluat-ing its aerodynamic performance. The distortion in the flow ahead of the cascade row was artificially created by using dis-torters of the outer size same as the {{cross section of the}} cascade tunnel and were fixed with the help of air tight flanged connec-tions at a location which was four chords ahead of the cascade. The distorters were made from honey comb sheets and were formed into cutouts of four shapes. The present study aims to investigate the effect of inlet flow distortion on the performance of an axial two dimensional cascade. The results depict that the Reynolds number, incidence and blade angle of the cascade con-trol the aerodynamic performance of the axial cascade. Further the experimental values of lift coefficient are less than that ob-tained using theory and the drag coefficients are more than the theoretical values. The aerodynamic parameters of the cascade, deflection, deviation, loss coefficients etc, have been found to depend on both the Reynolds number and the type of distortion.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the interfacing of a minicomputer with linear and rotary electrohydraulic control systems, {{to form a}} machine tool configuration for the generation of complex surfaces such as marine screw propeller or gas turbine blade profiles. The study is primarily concerned with {{the ability of the}} system to generate a given profile, specified in numerical form by the computer. The effect of cutting forces {{is beyond the scope of}} this present work. To minimise the data storage area within the minicomputer memory, component shapes have been described in terms of their curvature. An off-line method of developing a linear curvature profile from a known mathematical curve is presented and applied to a Joukowski aerofoil section. The results show that for a loss in accuracy of around 0. 1 %, a saving in memory storage area of 947 can be achieved when the profile Cartesian position co-ordinates are replaced by a representative set of curvature/arc length linear elements. A knowledge of the system model was necessary so that off-line digital computer simulation techniques could be employed to calculate controller parameters. Employing analytical methods, a system model was postulated and experimental testing in the frequency and time domains confirmed the dominant dynamic characteristics. Three different types of control strategy were implemented, the first being direct computer control where the axes of the machine tool were driven from the analogue output of an on-line cutter co-ordinate calculation program. The second type included the minicomputer within the control loop and employed a software PID control algorithm. Finally, the control parameters for an optimal controller designed to minimise a quadratic performance criterion were evaluated and employed on-line. After proving the capability of the system to manufacture an <b>aerofoil</b> <b>blade</b> section, a series of comparative accuracy tests were performed with the purpose of determining which control method would permit the machine tool to operate at the highest possible production rate, compatible with the required geometrical accuracy and surface finish.

40|$|A {{practical}} Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWTs) {{based on}} a Darrieus rotor has been designed and tested and found {{to be capable of}} self-starting at wind speeds above 4 m/s. The self-start feature has been achieved by replacing the usual symmetrical <b>aerofoil</b> <b>blade</b> in the VAWT rotor and by using a concentric Savonius rotor or semi-cylinder turbine. A computer program was produced to compute the power coefficient versus tip speed ratio characteristics of a selected aerofoil profile employed in a VAWT. The program accounts for chord length, pitch angle, number of blades, and rotor radius at any wind speed. The published data from 40 aerofoil sections were assessed, taking into account the two main criteria — self-starting and efficiency. Computational fluid dynamics software (ANSYS, Flotran) has been used to investigate the lift and drag performance of a NACA 66 - 212 and NACA 4421 aerofoils in order to check the computer program predictions. Excellent agreement was obtained for the static aerofoil assessment, but only after special ICEM Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) meshing interface routines were utilised. However, agreement between the theoretical and published results was not good for the rotating aerofoils in a VAWT. Thus, further CFD work was not pursued and in preference, an experimental route was initiated. In the first series of wind tunnel tests involving three candidate profiles, good agreement was found between the experimental results and the mathematical models. The aerofoils chosen were the NACA 661 - 212, the 51223 and the Clark-Y standard aerofoils. A number of prototype VAWTs were fabricated and tested for the influence of the blade pitch angle, the chord length ratio, with 2 or 3 blades. The aerofoil surfaces were made from aluminium sheet with a standard surface finish. The prototype designs were tested in the Northumbria University low speed wind tunnel facility - the models were 0. 4 m. high with a 0. 4 m diameter. The torque versus wind speed characteristics were recorded and analysed. The S 1223 profile was found to be self-starting with high efficiency. This model generated a high power coefficient of about 0. 3 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. The second series of tests were carried out in field sites in the UK with a 2 m diameter straight—bladed Darrieus rotor prototype with 3 blades using the S 1223 blade section. Three field trials were undertaken in the UK to produce realistic performance characteristics for wind conditions of 4 - 10 m/s. The maximum power coefficient of this machine was found to be 0. 18 at a tip speed ratio of 1. 2. In addition, an alternative semi-cylinder turbine combined with a Darrieus rotor was fabricated and tested in the UK. It demonstrated the advantage that it could self-start at lower wind speeds, that is 3 m/s but delivers approximately 50 % less power than that obtained from the first proposed design. A final phase of testing was carried out with an enlarged and modified 3 m diameter prototype installed at a shrimp farm in Thailand to demonstrate how the unit could be used to replace an equivalent 2 HP 2 -stroke diesel engine and hence eliminate its inherent emission pollution problems. A Savonius rotor was fitted to the prototype to improve self-start capabilities at a wind speed of 4 m/s for a practical application which by its nature required a high starting torque. The designs are easy to fabricate, low cost, pollution free and have been demonstrated to be ideal for applications in developing countries where there are sufficient wind resources.

Computer modelling can contribute to improved control of the coating process, important to support a continuous drive for increased efficiency. This paper considers two aspects associated with the EB-PVD coating of TBCs for commercial application: firstly, that clusters of blades are coated simultaneously in commercial coaters and, secondly, that these parts possess a complex geometry, such that shadow masks need to be taken into account. In this context, a computer model that calculates coating thickness distribution along the surface of different engine components, based on the analysis of the {{vapour deposition}} flux around complex geometries, is presented. To validate the predictive capability of the computer model two deposition trials were performed. Firstly, a cluster of components was simulated using three rotating cylinders, as a simple representation of coating multiple blades. Secondly, the effect of shadow masks was studied with an arrangement in which flat plates were welded, {{in the form of a}} U-shaped component, but with one side shorter than the other. The predicted results generated by the computer model compare favourably with those measured in the experimental runs presented. For the cluster of three cylinders, an error of 4 % was obtained whilst the divergence was around 20 % for the simulated shadow mask due to the fact that overall coating thickness was significantly reduced. In spite of this, the results obtained from the model were promising with respect to the degree of fit of the inverse square law. It is thought that a virtual source may be responsible for measurements being generally higher than those predicted by the model...|$|R

The computational procedure takes the initially given complex surface or points cloud (2 D or 3 D), adaptively splits the domain into 2 D or 3 D patches and iteratively tries to reduce the necessary number of control points while satisfying the requested modeling accuracy.

However, the spatial structure of the least damped global eigenmode is strongly reminiscent of its well-documented analogue in Howarth´s closed recirculation bubble flow 9. This points to the existence of another, little explored, route to instability and laminar-turbulent transition that needs to be understood, if effective control of flow over <b>aerofoils</b> and turbine <b>blades</b> is to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|This project aims {{to study}} the {{performance}} of the Rutland 504 micro wind turbine by means of a numerical simulation, and by implementing an experimental analysis. The numerical approach allows the computation of the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor, understood as the power that can be extracted from the wind and converted into mechanical energy. This study is based on the Blade Element Momentum Theory using the two dimensional features of the wind turbine <b>blade’s</b> <b>aerofoil.</b> On the other hand, the experimental study is accomplished in order to measure the electrical power provided to a battery. Measures of the wind speed, the rotational speed of the rotor, and the current and voltage provided to a 12 V battery allows the evaluation of the total efficiency of the Rutland 504, understood as the electrical power generated from the total power available in the wind...|$|R
40|$|Tubercles are {{essentially}} sinusoidal serrations that {{are present in}} the fins of humpback whales. They have been widely postulated as a form of passive flow control device for aerodynamic surfaces. Studies pertaining the implementation of tubercles into <b>aerofoils</b> and turbine <b>blades</b> are widely present, while efforts in incorporating these tubercles onto marine propeller blades and how their presence alters the original propeller blade flow behaviour are comparatively less well understood. In this study, tubercle modifications are investigated in marine propellers through the use of high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The results indicate that while there is a substantial increase in thrust generation of up to 10 %, there is also a 5 % decrease in propeller efficiency. The results indicate that the particular design and implementation of leading-edge tubercles here confer selected favourable flow effects upon propeller performance by varying the pressure and velocity distributions of the propeller blades...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Energy is {{the primary}} and most {{universal}} measure {{of all kinds of}} work by human beings and nature. Everything that happens in the world is an expression of energy in one of its forms. “Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. It can only be converted from one form into another”. So can wind energy be converted from one form to another. Wind energy is readily converted into mechanical energy through the turbine blades and is further converted into electrical energy by connecting the turbine to an electrical generator. In this paper we analyze the <b>aerofoil</b> cross section <b>blade</b> using ANSYS 10. 0 and show the velocity profile for a blade which is positioned parallel to the flow of wind and another blade which is tilted at a certain angle to the flow of the wind. This paper also visualizes the use of a variable geometry blade to minimize the drag when the wind flows over the blade...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Future {{technologies}} in microsensing, microactuation, active changes in shapes of <b>aerofoils</b> and turbine <b>blades</b> justify and necessitate a {{comprehensive study of}} piezo actuators for shape control of structures. Piezo materials have the property to develop strain on applying voltage and voltage on applying strain, hence, these materials are useful both as sensors and actuators. If a piezo actuator is bonded to a substrate plate, on applying voltages, the resulting strain in the actuator induces a deflection in the plate. This deflection {{is a function of}} geometry, material properties of ac-tuator and substrate, layout of piezo actuators, and voltage inputs to the actuators. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to develop a mathematical model for deflection of a thin plate embedded with piezo actuators using elastic plate theory, (b) to compute plate deflection by solving the mathematical model using finite difference technique, and (c) to estimate optimal actuation voltages to match the deflection of the plate to a desired deflection...|$|R
40|$|Common blade design {{techniques}} {{are based on}} the assumption of the airflow laying on cylindrical surfaces. This behav- iour is proper only for free-vortex flow, whereas radial fluid migration along the span is always present in case of controlled vortex design blades. The paper presents a design procedure to increase aeraulic efficiency of fan rotors originally designed using a controlled vortex criterion, {{based on the assumption that}} a blade section positioning taking into account the actual airflow direction could be beneficial for rotor aeraulic performance. The proposed procedure employs a three-dimensional <b>aerofoil</b> positioning and <b>blade</b> forward sweep. The procedure is applied to a rotor-only tube-axial fan featuring a 0. 44 hub-to-tip ratio, an almost constant swirl velocity distribution at the rotor outlet and a quite low blade Reynolds number. Rotor prototypes deriving from step-by-step blade modifications are experimentally tested on an ISO 5801 standard test rig. Results show the importance of considering radial fluid migration for highly loaded rotors...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of effects of mistuning on the forced response of gas-turbine bladed discs vibrating in the frequency ranges corresponding to higher modes. For high modes the <b>blade</b> <b>aerofoils</b> are deformed during vibrations and the blade mode shapes differ significantly from beam mode shapes. A model reduction technique is developed for the computationally efficient and accurate analysis of forced response for bladed discs vibrating in high frequency ranges. High-fidelity finite element models of a tuned bladed disc sector are used to provide primary information about dynamic properties of a bladed disc and the blade mistuning is modelled by specially defined mistuning matrices. The forced response displacement and stress amplitude levels are studied for high frequency ranges. The effects of different types of mistuning are examined and the existence of high amplifications of mistuned forced response levels is shown for high-mode vibrations: in some cases, the resonance peak response of a tuned structure can be lower than out-of-resonance amplitudes of its mistuned counterpart...|$|R
