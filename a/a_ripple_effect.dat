5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect,</b> as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} {{what seems to be}} a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> which went far {{beyond the boundaries of}} mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth in the way that mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E

In 2004, United Airlines and American Airlines agreed to modify their flight schedules to help reduce congestion caused by clustered arrivals and departures. Because of the air traffic departing, arriving, and near the airport, air traffic controllers at O'Hare and its nearby facilities are among the leaders in {{the world in terms of}} number of controlled flights handled per hour.|$|E
25|$|The Penn Central's {{bankruptcy}} had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> on the Northeast economy. The PC bankruptcy absolved {{them from}} paying their debts, which included payments owed to other railroads. The PC's {{failure to pay}} was a major contribution to other Northeast lines that also entered bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was the final blow to long-haul private-sector passenger train service in the United States. The troubled company filed proposals with the ICC to abandon most of its remaining passenger rail service, causing a chain reaction among its fellow railroads, who also decided to drop their money losing passenger trains. In 1971 Congress created Amtrak, a government corporation, which began to operate a skeleton passenger service on the tracks of Penn Central and other U.S. railroads.|$|E

25|$|Historical {{records show}} that this beetle once lived in 35 states of the United States, the District of Columbia, and three Canadian provinces: Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Now, natural populations are known to occur in only five states {{and at least one}} province: on Block Island in Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Arkansas, South Dakota, Nebraska and Ontario. They have also been reintroduced to Ohio. In Oklahoma, {{petitions}} were made in 2015 and 2016 to delist the species from endangered status as it came {{in the way of the}} oil and gas industry in the region. N. americanus was listed as an endangered species in 1989; the IUCN lists the species as critically endangered. Biologists have determined conclusively why N. americanus has disappeared from so many areas. Widespread use of pesticides may have caused local populations to disappear. The dramatic disappearance of this insect from many areas, however, took place before widespread use of DDT. Lack of small carcasses to bury would prevent the species from reproducing, and changes in land use has reduced the quantity of small- to medium-sized birds and mammals preferred by N. americanus. Even the extinction of the once ubiquitous passenger pigeon may have had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> on carrion feeders like this beetle.|$|E

The proposal was changed again two weeks later, with official plans showing a 63-story building for the plot. A {{little more than a}} week afterward, the plan was changed for the third time, with two additional stories added. By this time, 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue were both hubs for construction activity due to the removal of the Third Avenue Elevated's 42nd Street spur, which was seen as a blight on the area. The 52-story Chanin Building, diagonally across the intersection from Reynolds's proposed building, was also under construction.

The series was scrapped, and the completed pilot aired as a special, Christmas in Tattertown, in December 1988. It was the first original animated special created for Nickelodeon. Bakshi moved into a warehouse loft in downtown Los Angeles to clear his head, and was offered $50,000 to direct a half-hour live-action film for PBS's Imagining America anthology series. Mark Bakshi produced the film, This Ain't Bebop, his first professional collaboration with his father. Bakshi wrote a poem influenced by Jack Kerouac, jazz, the Beat Generation and Brooklyn {{that served as the}} narration, which was spoken by Harvey Keitel. After a car crash, Bakshi completed the post-production in stitches and casts.

500|$|This {{development}} had <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> throughout both {{regions and}} in the Paris markets. Both Champagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the [...] "healthiness" [...] reputation of their wines, even {{to the extent of}} paying medical students to write theses touting the health benefit of their wines. These theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers. The Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon's claim that Burgundy wine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-Baptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, to speak to a packed auditorium at the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine's deep color and robust nature and compared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the [...] "instability" [...] of the wine to travel long distances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text of his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging effect on Champagne sales.|$|E
500|$|When {{the studio}} hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct Thor and , respectively, it made sure both {{directors}} {{were open to}} the idea of a shared universe and including Avengers set-up scenes in their films.

You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The great thing about the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters."

Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect,</b> touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E

50|$|Humans develop {{meanings}} and associate them with objects and events in their environment, provoking certain emotions within an individual.

2500|$|Academics on {{this subject}} believe that {{although}} psychopathy is manifested in {{only a small percentage}} of workplace staff, it is more common at higher levels of corporate organizations, and its negative effects (for example, increased bullying, conflict, stress, staff turnover, absenteeism, reduction in productivity) often causes <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> <b>effect</b> throughout an organization, setting the tone for an entire corporate culture. Employees with the disorder are self-serving opportunists, and may disadvantage their own organizations to further their own interests. [...] They may be charming to staff above his/her level in the workplace hierarchy, aiding their ascent through the organization, but abusive to staff below his/her level, and can do enormous damage when they are positioned in senior management roles. [...] Psychopathy as measured by the PCL-R is associated with lower performance appraisals among corporate professionals. The psychologist Oliver James identifies psychopathy as one of the dark triadic traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and Machiavellianism, which, like psychopathy, can have negative consequences.|$|E
