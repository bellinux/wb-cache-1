40|$|The post-polymerization functionalization, {{characterization}} {{and application}} of block copolymers, hydrogels and cross-linked polymeric micro-beads to particular pharmaceutical and environmental applications {{are the focus of}} this thesis. The synthesis of a new amphiphilic and cationic block copolymer, polystyrene- b-poly(N,N,N-trimethylammoniumethylene acrylamide chloride) (PS- b-PTMEACl), from polystyrene-b-poly(tert-butylacrylate) (PS-b-P(tBuA)) is presented. The morphology of the self-assembled copolymers in water is assessed, and finally, we evaluate the potential of this nanoscale system as a bile acid sequestrant. Bile salts represent the major elimination route for cholesterol from the body and bile salt sequestrants have an established reputation as highly effective agents in the facilitation of this elimination. We also present the functionalization of a series of carbomers and their favorable bile salt binding properties. The synthetic methods were adapted from the post-polymerization functionalization of PS-b-PtBuA. The peculiar insolubility of ammonium tetraphenylborate in water was the fundamental property exploited in the research described in the final Chapter, where rather than <b>ammonium-ion</b> bearing polymers, <b>ammonium-ion</b> binding polymers are presented. Cross-linked PS resins were functionalized to contain pendent tetraphenylborate moieties and the <b>ammonium-ion</b> sequestering properties of this novel material were investigated. (Organo) ammonium ions from chemical and agro-industrial sources represent a major environmental hazard and our efforts contribute to the elimination of these toxins from effluent...|$|E
40|$|Crown ether {{amino acids}} (CEAAs) with a {{luminescent}} phthalic ester or phthalimide moiety have been prepared. Simple peptide chemistry covalently tethers the macrocycles to give ditopic <b>ammonium-ion</b> binders. The binding events of both crown ether groups are monitored independently by changes of their specific emission properties. The affinity of the bis-CEAA to bis-ammonium ions is distance dependent, which allows distinguishing between isomeric small peptides containing a lysine residue in different positions. ...|$|E

The sludge treatment includes aerobic stabilizer and facility of mechanical dewatering. The developed technology ensures deep purification of household waste waters from nitrogen and phosphorus. The degree of purification in the <b>ammonium-ion</b> reaches of 99. 5 %. Efficiency of total nitrogen removal (the sum of ammonium, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen) is 85 %.

2500|$|Mycorrhizal {{activity}} {{increases the}} phosphorus concentration {{available in the}} rhizosphere. Mycorrhizae lower the root zone pH by selective uptake of NH4+ (<b>ammonium-ions)</b> and by releasing [...] H+ ions. Decreased soil pH increases the solubility of phosphorus precipitates. The hyphal NH4+ uptake also increases the nitrogen flow to the plant as the soil's inner surfaces absorb ammonium and distribute it by diffusion.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{study was}} conducted to assess removal and filtration capacity of waste and natural indigenous materials as treatment mediums e. g., shell, limestone, waste paper mixed with refuse concrete, refuse cement, also processed nitrolite, charcoal-bio and charcoal. Under room temperature condition removal of phosphoric, nitric and <b>ammonium-ions,</b> filtration of suspended substance (SS) together with removal of COD in waste water was investigated. Influence of particle size effect for all treatment mediums except for waste paper was pursued. Significant improvement of waste water quality with respect to SS, phosphoric ions and decrease in COD is possible by treating with these filtration mediums. With specific reference to some treatment mediums NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N showed reasonable improvement in quality, although generally removal effect was not very significant. Efficacy of treatment was dependent on the particle size of treatment mediums in general, however, nitrolite for NH 4 -N, charcoal-A for SS and COD, refuse cement mixed with waste paper for PO 4 ion removal showed insignificant variability on the particle size effect. Results of this fundamental study demonstrate effectiveness and feasibility for applied application of these proposed waste and naturally available treatment ingredients at lower cost...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>ammonium-ion</b> sensitive membrane {{based on a}} photocurable aliphatic urethane diacrylate oligomer has been optimized. Membranes were prepared with exposure to TJV and studied in a traditional ion-selective electrode configuration with liquid inner contact. The optimum composition is found to be: urethane diacrylate (45 to 50 %), hexandiol diacrylate (10 %), photoinitiator (0. 8 to 1. 2 %), plasticizer (bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sebacate or di- 5 -nonyladi-pate (35 to 40 %), nonactin (2 %), and KTpC 1 PB (0. 5 %). The resulting ion-sensors show a sensitivity of 55. 5 mV/decade, a range of linear response from 1 to 4. 5 iO mol/liter of NH 4 C 1, a limit of detection around 10 'mol/liter, and good selec-tivity {{in the presence of}} potassium ions. Introduction of 7 % PVC into the membrane formulation gives a possibility to enhance the sensitivity up to 58 mV/decade but prevents application of photolithography for membrane patterning in case of ion sensitive field effect transistor-based sensors. The developed polymer composition was used to prepare ISFET-based ammonium sensors with the membrane deposited and structured on a wafer level. Ammonium ion-selective sensors based on a poly(viny...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is <b>ammonium-ion</b> uptake from {{synthetic}} aqueous solutions onto raw and pretreated forms of the natural zeolite Transcarpathian clinoptilolite under dynamic conditions. Hydrogen ions displaced exchangeable cations on the clinoptilolite in distilled water (sodium ions) and hydrochloric acid (sodium, potassium, and calcium ions) and destroyed the zeolite framework structure in the last case. Ammonium uptake onto the zeolite occurs by exchange with Na+, Ca 2 +, and K+ ions. Although Na+ ions were observed to be more easily exchanged for both hydrogen and ammonium ions, the role of Ca 2 + ions increased with zeolite saturation by NH+ 4 ions. The maximum sorption capacity of the clinoptilolite toward NH+ 4 ions, estimated under dynamic conditions, is significantly higher than that measured under static conditions; proximity of the values of a distribution coefficient and a retardation factor for different conditions (215 - 265 dm 3 /kg and 979 ¿ 1107, respectively) allows us to use these parameters to model ammonium uptake onto the clinoptilolite. Slowing down or interruption in filtration resulted in the improvement of ammonium sorption properties of the zeolite. The ammonium removal improves with use of the finer fractions of the clinoptilolite up to 0. 35 mm. A recycling study results confirmed the importance of external diffusion for ammonium sorption by the clinoptilolite. Preliminary treatment of the sorbent confirmed the predominant importance of the ion-exchange mechanism. The advantage of prior NaCl treatment of the clinoptilolite in improvement of ammonium removal over the other techniques was shown...|$|E
40|$|The general {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is the development}} of synthetic receptors for organic ammonium ions in near physiological conditions using disulfide dynamic combinatorial chemistry (DCC). Chapter 1 explains the importance of this development and the associated difficulties when using the conventional, iterative approach: design, synthesis and testing. Then it introduces the external template effects in disulfide DCC that can be used as an alternative, superior approach to conventional chemistry for obtaining synthetic receptors able to work in near physiological medium. Chapter 2 presents a successful use of this approach to develop a synthetic receptor for nicotine. The receptor features an affinity comparable to those of synthetic receptors reported thus far, and is obtained with relatively better yield. Chapter 3 describes the design of a DCL of which nearly all of its macrocyclic, oligomeric members can be amplified, with size selectivity, after being exposed to 30 organic <b>ammonium-ion</b> templates. Chapter 4 shows that the macrocylic oligomers can be amplified, with length-size selectivity, after being exposed to aliphatic α-ω diamines. In chapter 5, a fitting program (DCLFit) was used to reliably estimated the binding affinities of the amplified DCL members to four chosen templates. The binding constants were in close agreement with the ones obtained by ITC, and found to be the highest reported so far for synthetic receptors. Chapter 6 describes the derivatization of the DCL building blocks with natural amino acids to allow the DCL to acquire additional diversity, chiral centers, recognition property, flexibility or rigidity. Valine side chains {{played a crucial role in}} the types of the formed products, resulting DCL distributions and DCL responses to templates. Undesirable side reactions were also observed upon introducing the valine residues...|$|E
40|$|Reversible coordinative binding of Lewis basic {{donors to}} iminodiacetato (IDA) and nitrilotriacetato (NTA) metal {{complexes}} {{is widely used}} {{for the design of}} synthetic receptors binding to peptides, proteins or enzymes at physiological conditions. However, no data on the affinity of M(II) -NTA (M = Cu, Ni, Zn) to a single histidine or imidazole moiety are available. We herein report (chapter 1) the investigation of the binding affinity and thermodynamics of copper(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II) NTA complexes to histidine, imidazole and hen egg white lysozyme, bearing a single surface exposed histidine unit, by isothermal titration calorimetry at physiological conditions. Further, we describe a peptide-metal complex hybrid approach to enhance the binding affinity of Cu(II) -NTA to lysozyme. In the second part of this work (chapter 2) the rationally design of a selective peptide receptor is described. The combination of copper(II) nitrilotriacetato (NTA) complex with an <b>ammonium-ion</b> sensitive and luminescent benzocrown ether revealed a peptide receptor with a micromolar affinity and selectivity for glycine and histidine containing peptide sequences. This affinity closely resembles that of copper(II) ion peptide binding: The two free coordination sites of the copper(II) NTA complex bind to imidazole and amido nitrogen atoms, retracing the initial coordination steps of non-complexed copper(II) ions. The benzocrown ether recognizes intramolecularly the N-terminal amino moiety and the significantly increased emission intensity signals the binding event, as only if prior coordination of the peptide has taken place, the intramolecular ammonium ion � benzocrown ether interaction is of sufficient strength in water to trigger an emission signal. Intermolecular ammonium ion � benzocrown ether binding is not observed. Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the binding constants derived from emission titrations. Thus, as deduced from peptide coordination studies, the combination of a truncated copper(II) coordination sphere and a luminescent benzocrown ether allows for the more rational design of sequence selective peptide receptor. Suitable combinations of an affinity tag and an artificial probe are useful for non-covalent protein labelling. Several of such peptide tag � probe pairs have been developed and reported in the literature. The most prominent example is the His-tag � Ni(II) -NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) pair. Recently, the Hamachi group reported a genetically encodable oligo-aspartate sequence (D 4 -tag) and a corresponding oligonuclear Zn(II) dipicolyl¬amine (Zn(II) -Dpa) complex as new peptide tag � probe pair, which is orthogonal to the His-tag � Ni(II) -NTA pair. We describe in the third part of this work (chapter 3) the preparation of fluorescent 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) Zn(II) complexes and their application as an alternative artificial probe for the D 4 -tag system. The binding affinities of the new complexes to the affinity tags were investigated by emission and UV-vis titration. Tetranuclear Zn(II) -cyclen complexes respond to the presence of oligo-aspartate, oligo-glutamate and oligo-aspartate dimers in aqueous solution at micromolar concentrations by a strong spectroscopic change. Based on the high binding affinities due to strong electrostatic interactions and Job´s plot analysis, we propose the formation of receptor�peptide tag aggregates. The results clearly show the potential of Zn(II) -cyclen complexes for applications as non-covalent protein markers, although their optical properties require further optimization for practical use. The fourth part of this work (chapter 4) deals with the syntheses of new amphiphilic 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane Zn(II) complexes for a template guided cooperative self-assembly of nucleotides at interfaces fabricated by combination of self-assembly monolayer technique (SAM) and Langmuir Blodgett technique (LB). Three amphiphilic Zn(II) -cyclen complexes were synthesized as binding sites at interfaces prepared by a combination of SAM and LB film approaches or in vesicles. Detailed investigations of the binding properties of surfaces incorporating the new amphiphilic complexes are in progress. The fifth part of this work (chapter 5) deals with the preparation of self assembled vesicular polydiacetylene (PDA) particles with embedded metal complex receptor sites. The particles respond to the presence of ATP and PPi (pyrophosphate) in buffered aqueous solution by visible changes of their color and emission properties. Blue PDA vesicles of uniform size were obtained upon UV irradiation from mono- and dinuclear zinc(II) -cyclen and iminodiacetato copper [Cu(II) -IDA] modified diacetylenes, embedded in amphiphilic diacetylene monomers. Addition of ATP and PPi to the PDA vesicle solution induces a color change from blue to red observable by the naked eye. The binding of ATP and PPi changes the emission intensity. Other anions like ADP, AMP, H 2 PO 4 ¯, CH 3 COO¯, F¯, Cl¯, Br¯ and I¯ failed to induce any spectral changes. The zinc(II) -cyclen nanoparticles are useful for the facile detection of PPi and ATP in millimolar concentrations in neutral aqueous solutions, while Cu(II) -IDA modified vesicular PDA receptors are able to selectively discriminate between ATP and PPi. In the sixth chapter (chapter 6) we report a new methodology for the preparation of a artificial phosphate receptors. Phosphate anion probes typically consist of a binding site and a luminescent reporter group. The luminescent moiety is either part of the chemosensor in close proximity of the analyte binding site or in indicator displacement assays non-covalently bound to the binding site and displaced by the analyte. We report here the preparation and binding properties of 80 nm vesicular synthetic receptors, which contain amphiphilic 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) Zn(II) complexes as phosphate anion binding sites and amphiphilic coumarin derivatives as fluorescent reporter groups. By colocalization of binding sites and reporter groups in the vesicle they respond to the presence of phosphate anions in aqueous solution at micromolar concentrations by a strong emission decrease. The technique avoids the covalent synthesis of labelled analyte binding sites and allows the rapid and versatile preparation of luminescent nanometer size synthetic receptors. In the last part of this work (chapter 7) the syntheses of new non-fluorescent and fluorescent amphiphilic Lewis acidic metal complexes (metal chelating artificial lipids) based on 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazacyclododecane Zn(II) complexes, dipicolylamine (Dpa) complexes and a nitrilotriacetato acid (NTA) complex are described. The prepared metal chelating artificial lipids will be used for fabrication of complex self-assembled supramolecular surfaces by one or more different chemosensors for molecular recognition at interfaces. ...|$|E
