40|$|The Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC) is {{responsible}} for the annual development and adoption of specific policies and formulas for the equitable distribution of monies in the area of educational instruction and <b>academic</b> <b>support,</b> including <b>libraries.</b> Two formulas are applied to determine funding: Full-Time Equated (FTE) enrollment determines the funding needs of the organization based on number of full-time students, and Performance-Based Funding is based on the institution's ability to demonstrate improved standards of performance, measured through outcomes assessment such as student test scores and placement of graduates. Each of the formulas pose financial dilemmas for the Tennessee State University (TSU) library. While FTE may be equitable for funding classroom instruction, "half-time " students may require as many library resources as full-time students. Performance funding has little direct reference to the library's main mission, to provide the resources necessary for improving instructional quality.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom is that legal writing and <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> go hand-in-hand. Most law schools assume that struggling students can be reliably identified for <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> through their first-year legal writing course, and that first-year legal writing instructors can fairly easily and effectively provide this support. Indeed, this is the prevailing view in current <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> and legal writing scholarship. Professor Koller 2 ̆ 7 s article challenges the {{conventional wisdom}} and instead points out several issues {{that should be considered}} if a law school relies on the first-year legal writing course as a component of, or in lieu of, an <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> program. First, Professor Koller argues that identifying students who may need <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> through a first-year legal writing course can give many 2 ̆ 2 false positives 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 false negatives 2 ̆ 2 due to the unique nature of the course. Second, Professor Koller points out that first-year legal writing courses do not provide 2 ̆ 2 built-in 2 ̆ 2 <b>academic</b> <b>support,</b> as is frequently assumed. Because the goals and challenges of the first-year course are so significant, there is often little opportunity for a professor to provide meaningful <b>academic</b> <b>support.</b> Finally, Professor Koller argues that the structure of the typical first-year legal writing course can encourage student dependence on faculty support, something that is counter-productive to a law school 2 ̆ 7 s <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> efforts. In light of these issues that are presented in the first-year, Professor Koller argues that the best use of a legal writing course in conjunction with <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> is as a vehicle for more advanced <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> in the upper-level curriculum. Professor Koller supports this argument with an illustration of the <b>academic</b> <b>support</b> model in place at the University of Maryland School of Law...|$|R

In terms of population, Costa Rica boasts of one of the smallest populations served by ODL, whereas China’s ODL system undoubtedly serves the largest. Owing to the diverse nature of demographic variables in terms of placement, job, socio-economic conditions, open university students often find it inconvenient to be physically present in a classroom setting for face-to-face instruction at stipulated times and places.
