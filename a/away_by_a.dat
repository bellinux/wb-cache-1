5|$|The goal {{shifted the}} balance of the game in Barcelona's favour, as United had been on top in terms of shots and {{possession}} up to that point.

In a rehearsed corner move, Xavi played the ball back {{to the edge of the}} penalty area towards Messi, but the tournament's top scorer was unable to make a proper connection. Nevertheless, Barça retained possession through some sharp inter-passing involving Xavi and Iniesta. When United did manage to regain the ball, however, it was quickly given <b>away</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> poor pass from Carrick, while Anderson mis-timed a kick and completely missed the ball. It was now Barcelona's turn to pressurise the United players, forcing them into backward passes or long, hopeful balls forward.|$|E

5|$|The storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} to southwestern Mexico, peaking at 6.35inches (161mm) in La Villita, Michoacán. Flooding from {{four days of}} rainfall caused officials to close schools in and around Acapulco. The rainfall resulted in downed trees and mudslides. About 150homes became flooded, resulting in military personnel to assist in evacuating the flooded houses. In total, 20homes were destroyed, and 20villages were left without power.

5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut <b>away</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E
