5|$|The {{park and}} the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild {{herbivore}} populations. The plains {{to the south of}} the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration <b>as</b> <b>great</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal's migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park's migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.|$|E

In the various hoards located around the island, there are more of these silver coins than at any other site in Western Eurasia. The total sum is almost <b>as</b> <b>great</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> number that has been unearthed in the entire Muslim world. These coins moved north through trade between Rus merchants and the Abbasid Caliphate, along the Silver-Fur Road, and the money made by Scandinavian merchants would help northern Europe, especially Viking Scandinavia and the Carolingian Empire, as major commercial centers for the next several centuries.|$|E
25|$|Recruitment is {{the number}} of new young fish that enter a {{population}} in a given year. The size of fish populations can fluctuate by orders of magnitude over time, and five to 10-fold variations in abundance are usual. This variability applies across time spans ranging from a year to hundreds of years. Year to year fluctuations in the abundance of short lived forage fish can be nearly <b>as</b> <b>great</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fluctuations that occur over decades or centuries. This suggests that fluctuations in reproductive and recruitment success are prime factors behind fluctuations in abundance. Annual fluctuations often seem random, and recruitment success often has a poor relationship to adult stock levels and fishing effort. This makes prediction difficult.|$|E

500|$|The first {{message to}} reach Bonaparte {{regarding}} the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his {{camp on the}} road between Salahieh and Cairo. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General Jean Baptiste Kléber, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports {{that when he was}} handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced [...] "Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens" [...] ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it <b>as</b> <b>great</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, Bourienne, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed [...] "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" [...] Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering Franklin while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were [...] "marvellous," [...] Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued [...] "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." [...] To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.|$|E
