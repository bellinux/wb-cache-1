5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played {{into the hands of}} those who had been pushing for change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry</b> at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry,</b> the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry,</b> and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.|$|E
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial <b>armaments</b> <b>industry</b> and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing {{synthetic oil}} and gasoline {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The <b>armaments</b> <b>industry</b> began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible. Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and forced it to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.|$|E

50|$|During the war, {{prisoner}} {{forced labor}} became increasingly important in German arms production. As a result, the Flossenbürg camp system {{expanded to include}} approximately 100 subcamps concentrated mainly around <b>armaments</b> <b>industries</b> in southern Germany and western Czechoslovakia.|$|R
5|$|Various other German {{industrial}} enterprises, such as Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert, built factories {{with their}} own subcamps. There were 45 such satellite camps, 28 of which served corporations involved in the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> Prisoner populations ranged from several dozen to several thousand. Subcamps were built at Blechhammer, Jawiszowice, Jaworzno, Lagisze, Mysłowice, Trzebinia, and other centers as far afield as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Satellite camps were designated as Aussenlager (external camp), Nebenlager (extension or subcamp), or Arbeitslager (labor camp). Industries with satellite camps included coal mines, foundries and other metal works, chemical plants, and other industries. Prisoners were also made to work in forestry and farming.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, all the {{objective}} conditions were present {{for a successful}} defence: a dense population, wealthy, young, disciplined and well-educated; a geography favouring the defender; and a strong technological and industrial base including an <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> However, these had not been exploited: while the Wehrmacht at the time still had many shortcomings in equipment and training, the Dutch army, by comparison, was far less prepared for war. The myth of the general German equipment advantage over the opposing armies in the Battle of France {{was in fact a}} reality {{in the case of the}} Battle of the Netherlands. Germany had a modern army with tanks and dive bombers (such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka), while the Netherlands had an army whose armoured forces comprised only 39 armoured cars and five tankettes, and an air force in large part consisting of biplanes. The Dutch government's attitude towards war was reflected in the state of the country's armed forces, which had not significantly expanded their equipment since before the First World War, and were inadequately armed even by the standards of 1918. During the 1920s, an economic recession lasting from 1920 until 1927 and the general détente in international relations caused a limitation of the defence budget. In that decade, only 1.5 million guilders per annum was spent on equipment. Both in 1931 and 1933, commissions appointed to economise even further failed, because they concluded that the acceptable minimum had been reached and advised that a spending increase was urgently needed. Only in February 1936 was a bill passed creating a special 53.4 million guilder defence fund.|$|E
25|$|The first iron cannon {{manufactured}} in England {{was cast in}} Buxted in 1543 by Ralf Hogge, an employee of Parson Levett, a Sussex rector with broad interests, paradoxically enough, in the emerging English <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> Henry VIII's reign was good for Parson Levett's business. While charged by the church with praying for peace, the Sussex parson's business thrived on the prospects of war.|$|E

Moreover, he carried out various other functions, becoming in April 1938 a Wehrwirtschaftsführer - a title given industrialists who were important to Germany's <b>armament</b> <b>industry</b> - and as of January 1939 a SS-Brigadeführer.|$|R
25|$|The German Socialist Franz Mehring wrote a {{biography}} of Gustavus Adolphus with a Marxist perspective on {{the actions of the}} Swedish king during the Thirty Years' War. In it, he makes a case that the war was fought over economics and trade rather than religion. The Swedes discovered huge deposits of copper, which were used to build brass cannon. The cottage-industrial growth stimulated an <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 27 July, the Swiss Federal Council held {{a special}} {{meeting to discuss}} the crisis. The Council {{announced}} that it deplored the human tragedy of the conflict {{and that it would}} reinforce its humanitarian aid measures; it also allocated CHF 5 million in emergency aid for the ICRC. The government's failure to reiterate the foreign department's criticism of Israel and its decision not to cancel the Swiss cooperation with the Israeli <b>armaments</b> <b>industry</b> were considered by the press to be a rebuke to outspoken Socialist foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey by the Council's center-right majority.|$|E
25|$|His power {{rested on}} the Fengtian Army, which was {{composed}} of about 100,000 men in 1922 and almost triple that number {{by the end of}} the decade. It had obtained large stocks of weapons left over from World War I and included naval units, an air force and an <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> Zhang integrated a large number of local militias into his army, and thus prevented Manchuria from falling into the chaos which reigned in China proper at the time. Jilin province was ruled by a military governor, who was said to be a cousin of Zhang; Heilongjiang had its own regional warlord, who never displayed any ambitions outside the province.|$|E
50|$|When Queen Ranavalona I {{took power}} in 1828, {{relationships}} with foreign powers gradually soured. By the mid-1830s, nearly all foreigners {{had chosen to}} leave or were expelled, and British influence was largely suppressed. An exception, the Frenchman Jean Laborde, was able {{to remain in the}} island to build foundries and an <b>armament</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{there was}} {{the matter of the}} Ruhr. Although the Ruhr area still {{contained}} a significant number of Axis troops and enough industry to retain its importance as a major objective, Allied intelligence reported that much of the region's <b>armament</b> <b>industry</b> was moving southeast, deeper into Germany. This increased the importance of the southern offensives across the Rhine.|$|R
50|$|The city, a major {{industrial}} centre with an extensive <b>armament</b> <b>industry,</b> was systematically bombed by the Allies {{in the closing}} years of World War II.

25|$|Under the 1985 reforms, all {{graduates}} {{were assigned}} jobs by the state; a central government placement agency told the schools where to send graduates. By 1985 Tsinghua University {{and a few}} other universities were experimenting with a system that allowed graduates to accept job offers or to look for their own positions. For example, of 1,900 Tsinghua University graduates in 1985, 1,200 went on to graduate school, 48 looked for their own jobs, and the remainder were assigned jobs by the school after consultation with the students. The college students and postgraduates scheduled to graduate in 1986 were assigned primarily to work in forestry, education, textiles, and the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> Graduates still were needed in civil engineering, computer science, and finance.|$|E
25|$|This {{model was}} the first to chamber the 9×25mm Mauser Export cartridge. It was {{designed}} to capitalize on the arms market in South America and China. Mauser C96 pistols in this caliber usually have an indentation milled into the upper surface of the magazine's follower to facilitate feeding of the straight-cased 9×25mm cartridge cases. The rifling in the barrel has a unique 13:8 twist. In addition, the flat surfaces extending around the chamber are longer to accommodate the higher pressures of the 9×25mm cartridge. Examples of Mauser C96s in this caliber are rare, but are still occasionally found on the private collector's market. The 9×25mm Mauser Export caliber receded from the market as the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry</b> reoriented itself towards military manufacture during World War I, but the round enjoyed a resurgence in popularity as a submachine gun caliber in the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Strategic bombing {{could have}} been carried out during the first {{surprise}} operations in June 1941, especially on those Soviet armament works that lay within range of the He 111; near Moscow and Voronezh. However, the need for counter air and ground support operations predominated in German air thinking. Hitler demanded close air support for the army, implying at least one Air Corps should be attached to each of the three Army Groups. There were four Air Corps (or Fliegerkorps) in the Soviet Union, giving one possible reserve Corps. Had production been brought up to a level commensurate with total war in 1940 and early 1941, a reserve of one Air Corps {{could have been}} set aside for strategic operations to commence with air-land operations. The splitting of tactical and strategic air units, the later being formed into one unified air command, would have done much to clarify the problem of organisation. The Strategic air units could have been freed from ground support duties which they were not trained or equipped for, while being able to carry out strategic bombing as advocated by the late General Wever. The concept of concentrating all available forces for the army, in the decisive battle became invalid, since it was the ability of the Soviets to re-arm and rebuild, through the failure of the Axis to bomb industrial regions beyond the front, that contributed to ultimate failure of Barbarossa to win a decisive victory. It was not until the winter, 1941-42 that Jeschonnek and Hitler revisited the idea of producing a heavy bomber to hit far ranging targets. Fliegerkorps IV was finally ready for operations after the publication of the Luftwaffe study Battle against Russian <b>Armaments</b> <b>Industry</b> in November 1943. However, the project was abandoned as there was no capable aircraft.|$|E

Pound wrote over a thousand letters a year during the 1930s and presented his ideas in hundreds of articles, {{as well as in}} The Cantos. His greatest fear was an economic structure dependent on the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry,</b> where the profit motive would govern war and peace. He read George Santayana and The Law of Civilization and Decay by Brooks Adams, finding confirmation of the danger of the capitalist and usurer becoming dominant.

500|$|While Goebbels {{had been}} {{pressing}} for expulsion of the Berlin Jews since 1935, {{there were still}} 62,000 {{living in the city}} in 1940. Part of the delay in their deportation was that they were needed as workers in the <b>armaments</b> <b>industry.</b> Deportations of German Jews began in October 1941, with the first transport from Berlin leaving on 18 October. Some Jews were shot immediately on arrival in destinations such as Riga and Kaunas. In preparation for the deportations, Goebbels ordered that all German Jews were required by law to wear an identifying yellow badge as of 5 September 1941. On 6 March 1942, Goebbels received a copy of the minutes of the Wannsee Conference. The document made the Nazi policy clear: the Jewish population of Europe was to be sent to extermination camps in occupied areas of Poland and killed. His diary entries of the period show that he was well aware of the fate of the Jews. [...] "In general, it can probably be established that 60 percent of them will have to be liquidated, while only 40 percent can be put to work.... A judgment is being carried out on the Jews which is barbaric but thoroughly deserved," [...] he wrote on 27 March 1942.|$|E
