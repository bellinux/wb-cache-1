Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.|$|E
5|$|The {{brooding}} anemone (Epiactis prolifera) is gynodioecious, starting life as {{a female}} and later becoming hermaphroditic, so that populations consist of females and hermaphrodites. As a female, the eggs can develop parthenogenetically into female offspring without fertilisation, and as a hermaphrodite, the eggs are routinely self-fertilised. The larvae emerge from the anemone's mouth and tumble down the column, lodging in a fold near the pedal disc. Here they develop and grow, remaining for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> before crawling off to start independent lives.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{only served}} as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> because, in November, Democrat Shibell ran for {{re-election}} against Republican challenger Bob Paul.

Given how fast eastern Pima County was growing, everyone expected {{that it would be}} split off into its own county soon with Tombstone as its seat. Wyatt hoped to win the job as the new county sheriff and continue receiving the plum 10% of all tax moneys collected. Southern Pacific was the major landholder, so tax collection was a relatively easy process.|$|E

5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in total, holding discussions in the afternoons {{either side of a}} half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E
5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|Hiyō was torpedoed in June 1943 and Junyō in November; both ships spent <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> under repair. They {{spent most}} of the time after their repairs {{training}} and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat. Hiyō was sunk by a gasoline vapor explosion caused by an American aerial torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in mid-1944 while Junyō was damaged by several bombs. Lacking aircraft, she was used as a transport in late 1944 and was torpedoed in December. The ship was under repair until March 1945 when the repairs were deemed uneconomical. Junyō was then effectively hulked {{for the rest of the}} war. After the surrender of Japan in September, the Americans deemed the ship not worth her repair costs; she was broken up in 1946–47.|$|E
30|$|Recent studies provide {{empirical}} evidence on persistence of horizontal inequality of {{field of study}} depending on eligible individuals' social origin. In this article we explore the question why there is a correlation between social origin and choice of field of study. Using data from the Saxon survey of high school graduate candidates, we model the decision process {{of high school students}} regarding post-secondary education <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> prior to graduation. Our empirical results prove that the effect of social origin on the choice of field of study is the result of an individual decision structured by status maintenance motive, by expected costs for the different types of higher education and training, by individual ability level, by expected success probabilities {{as well as by the}} socio-cultural distance to tertiary education. These determinants of the choice of field of study explains the effect of social origin and, therefore for the aggregate, the persistent social inequality of opportunities in the access to field of study.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the castle began in 1301. It was built by the Teutonic Order as a summer residence {{of one of the}} four bishops of Prussia, the Bishop of Pomesania. A Latin inscription above the main gate (Hec Porta Constructa Est Anno Domini MCCCLXXXVI Tempore Fratris Henrici De Skarlin Prepoziti) dates back to 1386 and mentions brother Henry of Skarlin as constructor. Sometimes he is described as the founder of the castle. The castle became property of the last Catholic and first Lutheran Bishop of Pomesania, Georg von Polentz, after the secularization of the Order. In 1699 it was bought by Ernst Graf Finck von Finckenstein and remained property of the Finckenstein family until 1945. In April 1945, <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> after the conquest by the Soviet Union, and again in 1947 the castle was set on fire and completely destroyed. The ruins were used for the 1996 movie The Ogre by Volker Schlöndorff with John Malkovich in the title role.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} incarceration of the Thapas, a new {{government}} with joint mukhtiyars was formed with Rangnath Paudel {{as the head of}} civil administration, and Dalbarjan Pande and Ranjang Pande as joint heads of military administration. This appointment established the Pandes as the dominant faction in the court, and they started to make preparations for war with the British in order to win back the lost territories of Kumaon and Garhwal. While such war posturing was nothing new, the din the Pandes created alarmed not just the Resident Hodgson but the opposing court factions as well, who saw their aggressive policy as detrimental to the survival of the country. After <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in power, under pressure from the opposing factions, the King removed Ranjang as mukhtiyar and Ranganath Paudel, who was favorably inclined towards the Thapas, was chosen as the sole mukhtiyar.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E

Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club.

5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother carries her young <b>about</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known to live up to 20years.|$|E

5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously.

He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E
