40|$|Abstract: The picking {{robot arm}} is {{scheduled}} to complete picking tasks in the working space, to overcome the shaking vibration to improve the picking stability, its movement should follow specific consistence trajectory points. Usually we should give definite multiple feature picking points, map their inverse kinematics to the joint space, establish motion equation for the corresponding point in the joint space, then follow these equations motion for the interpolation on the joint {{so that we can}} meet the movement requirements. Trajectory planning is decisive significance for accuracy and stability of controlling robot arm. The key issue that picking <b>arm</b> <b>complete</b> picking task will be come true by trajectory planning, namely, robot arm track the desired trajectory. which based on kinematics and statics picking analysis in a joint space according to the requirements of picking tasks, and obtain the position and orientation for picking robot arm, study and calculate the theory of trajectory parameters timely.

40|$|Background—COURAGE {{compared}} {{outcomes in}} stable coronary patients randomized to optimal medical therapy plus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus optimal medical therapy alone. Methods and Results—Angiographic {{data were analyzed}} by treatment arm, health care system (Veterans Administration, US non–Veterans Administration, Canada), and gender. Veterans Administration patients had higher prevalence of {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery and left ventricular ejection fraction 50 %. Men had worse diameter stenosis of the most severe lesion, higher prevalence of prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and more 3 -vessel disease that included a proximal left anterior descending lesion (P 0. 0001 for all comparisons versus women). Failure to cross rate (3 %) and visual angiographic success of stent procedures (97 %) were similar to contemporary practice in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry. Quantitative angiographic PCI success was 93 % (residual lesion 50 % in-segment) and 82 % (20 % in-stent), with only minor nonsignificant differences among health care systems and genders. Event rates were higher in patients with higher jeopardy scores and more severe vessel disease, but rates were similar irrespective of treatment strategy. Within the PCI plus optimal medical therapy <b>arm,</b> <b>complete</b> revascularization was associated with a trend toward lower rate of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Complete revascularization was similar between genders and among health care systems. Conclusions—PCI success and completeness of revascularization did not differ significantly by health care system o...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1997, the Intergruppo Italiano Linfomi {{started a}} {{randomized}} trial to evaluate, in unfavorable stage IA and IIA Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients, the efficacy and toxicity {{of the low}} toxic epirubicin, vinblastine and etoposide (EVE) regimen followed by involved field radiotherapy {{in comparison to the}} gold standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) regimen followed by the same radiotherapy program. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients should be younger than 65 years with unfavorable stage IA and IIA HL (i. e. stage IA or IIA with bulky disease and/or subdiaphragmatic disease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate higher than 40, extranodal (E) involvement, hilar involvement and more than three involved lymph node areas). RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were allocated to the ABVD arm and 89 to the EVE <b>arm.</b> <b>Complete</b> remission (CR) rates at the end of treatment program [chemotherapy (CT) + RT] were 93 % and 92 % for ABVD and EVE arms, respectively (P = NS). The 5 -year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 95 % for ABVD and 78 % for EVE (P < 0. 05). As a consequence of the different relapse rate, the 5 -year failure-free survival (FFS) rate was significantly better for ABVD (90 %) than for EVE (73 %) arm (P < 0. 05). No differences in terms of overall survival (OS) were observed for the two study arms. CONCLUSIONS: In unfavorable stage IA and IIA HL patients, no differences were observed between ABVD and EVE arms in terms of CR rate and OS. EVE CT, however, was significantly worse than ABVD in terms of RFS and FFS and cannot be recommended as initial treatment for HL...|$|E

Background: Compared to females, males experience higher rates of chronic disease and mortality, yet few health promotion initiatives are specifically aimed at men. Therefore, the aim of the ManUp Study is to examine the effectiveness of an IT-based intervention to increase the physical activity and nutrition behaviour and literacy in middle-aged males (aged 35 – 54 [*]years). Method/Design: The study design was a two-arm randomised controlled trial, having an IT-based (applying website and mobile phones) and a print-based intervention arm, to deliver intervention materials and to promote self-monitoring of physical activity and nutrition behaviours. Participants (n[*]=[*] 317) were randomised on a 2 : 1 ratio in favour of the IT-based intervention arm. Both intervention <b>arms</b> <b>completed</b> assessments at baseline, 3, and 9 [*]months. All participants completed self-report assessments of physical activity, sitting time, nutrition behaviours, physical activity and nutrition literacy, perceived health status and socio-demographic characteristics. A randomly selected sub-sample in the IT-based (n[*]=[*] 61) and print-based (n[*]=[*] 30) intervention <b>arms</b> <b>completed</b> objective measures of height, weight, waist circumference, and physical activity as measured by accelerometer (Actigraph GT 3 X).
