It was the first landmark console first-person shooter and was highly acclaimed for its atmospheric single-player levels and well designed multiplayer maps. It featured a sniper rifle, the ability to perform head-shots, and the incorporation of stealth elements; (<b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> aspects were also used in the game's spiritual sequel Perfect Dark) as well as Virtua Cop-inspired features such as reloading, position-dependent hit reaction animations, penalties for killing innocents, and an aiming system allowing players to aim at a precise spot on the screen.|$|E

25|$|Bifrenaria has {{traditionally}} been classified in subtribe Bifrenariinae of tribe Maxillarieae (Epidendroideae), however, the relationships among the several genera within this tribe are not well defined and changes are expected in the upcoming years. The genus closest to Bifrenaria is Rudolfiella. Other related genera are Teuscheria, Guanchezia, Hylaeorchis and Horvatia, {{in addition to the}} more distant Scuticaria and Xylobium. The unification of subtribes Lycastinae, Maxillariinae and Bifrenariinae has recently been suggested. However, there is no consensus on the path to be followed. Contrary to what was previously thought, the relationship among Bifrenaria <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> genera from Central America seems to indicate a primitive origin of Bifrenaria in Central America and its posterior dissemination towards the Southeast of Brazil, where it found fertile grounds to its more recent evolution.|$|E
25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

25|$|This temple is {{one among}} the 51 Shakti peethas {{located on the}} Indian subcontinent and is a {{location}} where one of Sati's limbs, her right arm is considered to have fallen when grief-stricken and agitated Shiva was carrying her dead body round the world on his shoulders, and Vishnu had cut her body into pieces with his Sudarshana Chakra. The story behind this event is that King Prajapati Daksha, father of Sati (the first wife of Lord Shiva), was performing a yagna (yagna {{is defined as a}} Hindu fire ritual sacrifice when deities of the Vedic times like Agni, the fire god, and others were invoked by offering oblations such as ghee (clarified butter), milk, grains and so forth) called as Brihaspatirao. Sati (also called Shakti) who was Lord Shiva's wife, attended the function without invitation. Daksha who was not fond of his son-in-law, as he considered him a mendicant, purposely did not invite him for the yagna, while he invited all other gods. Sati felt deeply insulted by the slight shown by her father towards her husband whom she had married out of deep love. Even then she decided to attend the yagna uninvited by her own father. When she went there, her father compounded the insult by totally ignoring her presence and vilifying Shiva. Sati felt deeply humiliated and hurt, and then in frustration she jumped into the yagna fire and committed suicide. When this news was conveyed to Shiva, first he sent his assistant to the site to enquire and take revenge. Shiva also came to the yagna site and created a furor. In a state of grief and anger he put Sati's dead body on his shoulders and started wandering round the universe. Looking at this grave situation, Brahma and Vishnu decided to intervene and bring back Shiva to his normal self. It was then decided that Vishnu will follow behind Shiva, and with his Sudarsha Chakra cut Sati's dead body into pieces. Thus Vishnu cut her into 51 pieces (108 pieces are also mentioned in many Puranic texts) as Shiva traveled around the world and these fifty one body parts of Sati fell at different locations in the subcontinent, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> places {{came to be known as}} Shakthi Peethas (abode of goddess Shakthi or Durga). Her right arm fell on the Saptashrungi hills and the place became holy, and a Shakthi Peeth came to be established here.|$|E

In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned.

Martin told Rolling Stone magazine that lyrics from the song about [...] "a carnival of idiots on show" [...] and how a [...] "fox became God" [...] were a commentary on Fox News. [...] "One day I was watching Bill O'Reilly, and I was like, 'I know how to finish that song.

So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone said {{a number}} of Cartman's {{characteristics}} which have endured throughout the South Park series started in [...] "Damien". Specifically, his voice took on a higher-pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes; Stone {{described it as a}} [...] "self-indulgent accent". Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound [...] "Nyah" [...] while saying the word [...] "Here", and the way he says [...] "Hey you guuuuuuys" [...] while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: [...] "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, maybe I just lost interest, but I was trying all these messed up things with him <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things sort of stuck." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Back to the Shack" [...] {{was written}} by Rivers Cuomo and Jacob Kasher Hindlin. The song was {{produced}} by Ric Ocasek. Cuomo wrote {{a majority of the}} song, with Karl Koch describing Jacob Kasher Hindlin's contribution to the song as [...] "randomly singing out the title while hanging out on the couch listening to [...] strumming the song. It doesn't take much to get half a songwriting credit." [...] At one point, the song was performed with the bridge containing the lyric [...] "we belong in the rock zone", before Cuomo, based on fan suggestions changed it from [...] "rock zone" [...] to [...] "rock world". Regarding the composition of the song, Cuomo stated that he [...] "tried to find different melodies and different beats <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> different things." [...] Further, he stated that as he [...] "couldn't crack the code" [...] they had to go ahead and record it anyway. Ocasek introduced a synth melody line to the song during this period.|$|E
500|$|Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique also {{discussed}} using a limited palette of colors, {{an approach that}} started with Aronofsky's Pi and continued with Requiem for a Dream. In The Fountain, the primary colors are gold and white. Gold represents [...] "the Mayans, a sort of fool's gold, a false truth"; Aronofsky explained the choice, [...] "When you see gold, it represents materialism and wealth <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things that distract us from the true journey that we're on." [...] White was chosen to represent mortality and truth. Weisz's characters are white, and wear white or are enveloped in white light to accentuate this presentation. Secondary colors are green, representing the color of life, and red, representing death. The director also used similar geometric constructs in the film to distinguish the three storylines. The 16th century conquistador's tale reflected triangles through pyramids and constellations, the 21st century researcher's period reflected rectangles through doors, windows, and computer screens, and the 26th century contemplative's journey reflected circles and spheres through the spacecraft and stellar bodies.|$|E
500|$|Although Ensemble had {{to re-create}} all of Bungie's assets from scratch, Bungie had {{produced}} {{a large amount}} of reference material for the Halo film adaptation that the Halo Wars team used for inspiration. Another reference point was art from the Halo first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and Halo Wars takes place from a bird's-eye view, the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer Graeme Devine noted that the Warthog Jeep is [...] "actually jumping three times as high as it does in Halo, and it goes four times faster than it does in Halo, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things—but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy." [...] To ensure artistic continuity between Halo Wars and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E
500|$|Jabara {{joined the}} Boy Scouts, {{eventually}} becoming an Eagle Scout. At an early age, {{he was set}} on becoming a pilot, [...] "I used to read articles about [...] Rickenbacker <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> novels you read about air combat, and I guess from the sixth grade it was my ambition to be a fighter pilot." [...] He worked at his parents' grocery store and graduated from Wichita North High School in Wichita, Kansas in May 1942. Standing five feet, five inches (165cm) tall, Jabara was short for a potential fighter pilot (and was reportedly required to wear corrective eyewear), but this did not prevent him from immediately enlisting as an aviation cadet of the United States Army Air Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas. In an attempt to improve his eyesight for flying, he ate 20 carrots {{a day in the}} mistaken belief that this would improve his vision. After attending four flying schools in Texas, he received his pilot's wings and a commission as second lieutenant at Moore Field, Texas in October 1943. Jabara with his wife, Nina, had four children: James William (b. 1949), Carol Ann (b. 1950), Cathy (b. 1952), and Jeanne (b. 1957).|$|E
500|$|On September 19, 1975, the Ramones {{recorded}} a demo at 914 Sound Studios, which {{was produced by}} Marty Thau. Featuring the songs [...] "Judy Is a Punk" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels. Producer Craig Leon, who had seen the Ramones perform {{in the summer of}} 1975, brought the demo to the attention of Sire Records' president Seymour Stein. After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife Linda Stein, the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European progressive rock bands. Drummer Tommy Ramone recalled: [...] "Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label." [...] The label offered to release [...] "You're Gonna Kill That Girl" [...] as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album.
