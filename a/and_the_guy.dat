500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a terrible thing {{to have to deal}} with."

500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> said, 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, you know. If you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E

500|$|Castroneves {{was upset}} about the penalty and leapt from his car and yelled in anger at the flagman (looking for an explanation) and grabbed the Head of Security Charles Burns as he sought an answer.

When you go side by side like that with your teammate <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> [...] has just swept ... literally, literally just takes it away from you ... it's just absurd." [...] Castroneves was fined $60,000 by the IRL for unsportsmanlike conduct and was placed on probation {{for the rest of the}} season. It was later revealed by IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard that the series considered suspending Castroneves but chose not to because of his popularity with its fanbase. Castroneves later apologized for his actions but still did not agree with the penalty. Comparisons were made between Castroneves' block and the Brazilian's manoeuvre against Wilson in the 2008 Detroit Indy Grand Prix. Gordon Kirby of Motor Sport Magazine opined that Castroneves' move was fair and sportmanslike and noted that several fans saw it as [...] "good, hard racing".|$|E
500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What You Say. The song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A.

500|$|Long-time {{collaborators}} {{and veteran}} Disney writers, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle {{had already been}} writing for Disney Channel for several years, contributing to the network's male-led animated series Aladdin, Hercules and Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, each one spin-offs of their respective feature-length animated films. Although they had enjoyed working on those projects, Schooley and McCorkle were becoming interested in contributing to [...] "something original". At the same time, the writers learned that Disney Channel had become interested in developing a show featuring ordinary children in extraordinary circumstances. Thus, the network commissioned Schooley and McCorkle to create an animated series geared towards the nine to 14 year-old demographic that was also capable of entertaining older audiences at the same time. While traveling in an elevator {{on their way back}} to their office from their lunch break, McCorkle said to Schooley, [...] "Kim Possible. She can do anything", to which Schooley responded, [...] "Ron Stoppable, he can’t", and nearly the entire premise of Kim Possible naturally unfolded thereafter. According to Schooley and McCorkle, both lead characters' names indicate that Kim Possible [...] "is going to be an arched show that is a little bit over the top, but also that the girl {{is going to be the}} action lead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> is going to be funny." [...] Conceiving all main characters themselves, Rufus and Wade were eventually created and added to the roster, but the series essentially remains about Kim [...] "who is incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world" [...] while [...] "Ron would be challenged everywhere." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>guy</b> driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that we all go party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E
