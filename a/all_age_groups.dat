The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of relative age in male and female marathon running. Marathon finishing times for the top ten male (aged 20 - 69 years) and female athletes (aged 20 - 64 years) were obtained from the 2013 New York and Chicago marathons. Intra-class and inter-class validity were evaluated by comparing performances within (intra-class) and between (inter-class) the 5 -year <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> Results showed intra-class effects in <b>all</b> male <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 50 years, in <b>all</b> female <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> over 40 years, and in male and female 20 - 24 <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> (p < 0. 05).
