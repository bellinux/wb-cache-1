5|$|Myers and {{his wife}} did the first balloon {{ascension}} on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the <b>aeronaut</b> Tracy A. Tisdell to draw crowds. A second ascension was done by Myers on August 27. He had a balloon race with professor G. E. Tomlinson to the Washington Monument. Both were unsuccessful. Myers landed 21 miles from his starting location and Tomlinson ended up hundreds of miles off course before he landed.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{resigned}} from the bank in 1867 and moved to Hornellsville, New York. There he bought a photography gallery and ran the business for several years. Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8, 1871. She was 7 years younger, being born in 1849. In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and ballooning. The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying. Mary became his lab assistant and later a balloon pilot known as Carlotta, the Lady <b>Aeronaut.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sophie {{conducted}} {{experiments with}} parachutes {{as her husband}} had, parachuting dogs from her balloon, {{and as part of}} her entertainments she launched fireworks and dropped baskets of pyrotechnics attached to small parachutes. Other aeronauts were making names for themselves by demonstrating parachute jumps from the baskets of balloons, in particular the family of André-Jacques Garnerin, whose wife, daughter and niece all performed regularly. His niece, Élisa Garnerin, was Blanchard's chief rival as a female <b>aeronaut,</b> and it was rare for a suitable event to lack a performance by one or the other. Blanchard may have given some demonstrations of parachuting herself, but her primary interest was in ballooning.|$|E

25|$|Lowe {{considered}} the incident an argument against free flight. LaMountain {{insisted that the}} flight was highly successful despite the unfortunate incident. The showdown did nothing to settle the argument, but Lowe's position as Chief <b>Aeronaut</b> allowed him to prevail.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 Lowe {{built and}} piloted his first balloon in {{tethered}} flight {{at a small}} farm in Hoboken, New Jersey.

25|$|Lowe's {{scientific}} endeavors {{were cut}} short by {{the onset of the}} American Civil War. He recognized his patriotic duty in offering his services as an <b>aeronaut</b> for the purposes of performing aerial reconnaissance on the Confederate troops on behalf of the Union Army. In July 1861 Lowe was appointed Chief <b>Aeronaut</b> of the Union Army Balloon Corps by President Abraham Lincoln. Though his work was generally successful, it was not fully appreciated by all members of the military, and disputes over his operations and pay scale forced him to resign in 1863. Lowe returned to the private sector and continued his scientific exploration of hydrogen gas manufacturing. He invented the water gas process by which large amounts of hydrogen gas could be produced from steam and charcoal. His inventions and patents on this process and ice making machines made him a millionaire.|$|E

25|$|During his Civil War days, Lowe had met Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, {{who was at}} {{the time}} acting as a {{military}} observer of the war. General McClellan had put all balloon ride-alongs off limits, so Lowe sent von Zeppelin to Poolesville to visit his German assistant <b>aeronaut</b> John Steiner, who could entertain him in his own language. Von Zeppelin returned in the 1870s to interview Lowe on all of his aeronautic techniques. Count von Zeppelin later designed the dirigible aircraft that bore his name.|$|E
25|$|This short novel {{serves as}} a prequel to His Dark Materials and focuses on the Texan <b>aeronaut</b> Lee Scoresby as a young man.

25|$|As {{the armies}} dug in, Union Army Balloon Corps <b>aeronaut</b> Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe used two balloons, the Constitution and the Intrepid, to perform aerial observation. On April 11, Intrepid carried Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter, a {{division}} {{commander of the}} V Corps, aloft, but unexpected winds sent the balloon over enemy lines, causing great consternation in the Union command before other winds returned him to safety. Confederate Captain John Bryan suffered a similar wind mishap in a hot air balloon over the Yorktown lines.|$|E
25|$|In 1854 {{events at}} the annual balls in {{the grounds of the}} Barn {{included}} the <b>aeronaut</b> Charles Green's balloon ascent. By 1865 there was a huge dancing platform, a rebuilt theatre, high-wire acts, pantomime, music hall and the original Siamese twins. The Barn became the victim of its own success. After a riot led by students from Bart’s Hospital in 1869, locals complained about the Barn’s increasingly riotous and bawdy clientele. This led to a court case and in 1871 authorities revoked the Barn’s dancing licence.|$|E
25|$|Wise and LaMountain {{had been}} {{longtime}} detractors of Prof. Lowe, but LaMountain maintained a vitriolic campaign against Lowe to discredit him and usurp {{his position as}} Chief <b>Aeronaut.</b> He used the arena of public opinion to revile Lowe.

LaMountain continued his public derogation of Lowe as well as creating ill-will among the other men in the Corps. Lowe lodged a formal complaint to Gen. George B. McClellan, and by February 1862 LaMountain was discharged from military service.|$|E
