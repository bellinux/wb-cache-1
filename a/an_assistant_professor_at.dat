Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College, where he also taught physics. Ross became <b>an</b> <b>assistant</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years. In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics. This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity. During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy. He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended. He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946. He set out to change the school's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erdős, whom Ross made a full professor.|$|E
