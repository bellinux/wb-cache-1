It can be {{prepared}} only under the anhydrous conditions by solid-state reactions at temperatures above ~ 1300  °C, e.g., by heating homogenized equimolar quantities of DCPA and CaCO 3 in dry air, or in a flow of dry nitrogen (Elliott 1994, 1998; Kai et al. 2009). These reactions should be carried out in a dry atmosphere, in vacuum or with rapid cooling (to prevent uptake of water and formation of HA).

Monthly water samples were monitored for enzymatic activity (fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, alkaline phosphatase, and substrate utilization), chemical and physical analysis (suspended solids, dissolved organic carbon, pH, nitrate, <b>ammonium,</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> and electrical conductivity), phytoplankton and bacterioplankton populations. All of these parameters were influenced by the intrinsic nature of the watersheds, with some parameters shifting as management changes were imposed on the surrounding agricultural fields. Thighman lake water typically maintained the highest suspended solid levels, dissolved organic carbon, algal and bacterial populations, enzyme activities, and heterotrophic metabolic indexes. Introduction of reduced tillage practices and glyphosate-resistant crops in Beasley watershed resulted in lower levels of suspended sediments, but had minimal impact on overall ranking of biochemical or microbiological properties. Likewise, conversion of Deep Hollow watershed from reduced tillage to conventional tillage {{had little effect on}} suspended sediment, and most microbial activity parameters remained intermediate. However, canonical analysis indicated dynamic changes in the microbial community, suggesting that biological parameters of lake water quality were affected by changes in crop and soil management practices. © 2010...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 2001 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 26 and 27, 2001, Athens, Georgia. A need {{exists to}} develop {{relationships}} between hydrologic characteristics {{and water quality}} for Coastal Plains streams and the fundamental hydrographic/water chemistry responses to storms in karst regions. Nine storms and resultant runoff were sampled in Ichawaynochaway Creek in southwest Georgia to quantify these relationships. Stream hydrologic response varied with seasonal antecedent conditions, precipitation amount, and duration. Both the intensity of a storm and the quantity of water generated resulted in variable non-point source runoff and/or dilution of baseflow conditions. Increases in dissolved concentrations were typically seen for <b>ammonium,</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> sulfate, potassium, and dissolved organic carbon. Alterations were generally consistent with floodplain inundation rather than erosive surface runoff from agricultural land. Changes in chemistry were affected by the base flow water quantity and quality, timing of source waters, and biological activity. Decreases in concentration were typically seen for alkalinity, pH, conductivity, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

Today, “starter” fertilizers (e.g., di-ammonium phosphate for maize), are commonly applied close to plant roots to ensure optimal N and P supply during critical early growth stages especially in cold climate regions [24]. “Complete” fertilizer placement is also performed, in which the fertilizer need for the vegetative season is supplied as a single rich subsurface fertilizer-depot. Nevertheless, poor root growth in the fertilizer-depot zone often limits crop nutrient acquisition from the depot. Inclusion of root-attracting nutrients like <b>ammonium</b> and <b>orthophosphate</b> ions, or inoculation of root growth-stimulating PGPMs in the fertilizer depot zone, is a possible solution. There is evidence that fertilizer depots comprising ammonium and phosphates lead to higher N and P uptake and yield than fertilizer depots comprising either ammonium or phosphate and not both (meta-analysis, Nkebiwe et al. 2016, submitted unpublished observation).

The dried algae contained approximately 1. 5 – 2 % phosphorus and 5 – 7 % nitrogen. Algal nitrogen and phosphorus accounted for 42 – 100 % o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Ca-HA is {{synthesized}} by reacting {{calcium carbonate}} (CaCO 3) and <b>ammonium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> (NH 4 H 2 PO 4) in stoichiometric proportions. In this precipitation process, {{the ratio of}} Ca/P by moles is 1. 67. The experiments were performed in a batch reactor at 25 degrees C. From control parameters, the pH and the temperature were measured in line for all experiments. The tests were performed with two liquid-solid mass ratios (H 2 O/CaCO 3) of 3 and 5. For each mass ratio, three stirring rates of 260, 400, and 600 rpm were tested. Samples of the synthesis were collected at different intervals and analysed by laser granulometry and by environmental scanning electron microscopy. For the synthesis conducted at 260 rpm, synthesis monitoring was made using a contact probe in solution coupled to a Raman spectrometer in order to follow the formation of solid phase. This technique is valuable to follow the synthesis of Ca-HA in a concentrated solids suspension (around 20 - 30 wt%). The results {{make it possible to}} propose a mechanism of the precipitation process of Ca-HA. It can be divided into four main stages: (i) dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), (ii) precipitation of brushite (CaHPO 4. 2 H(2) O), (iii) transformation of brushite into Ca-HA (Ca- 10 (PO 4) (6) (OH 2)) and (iv) nucleation, growth and agglomeration of Ca-HA...|$|R
40|$|Organic acids are {{important}} constituents of fruit juices. They render tartness, flavour and specific taste to fruit juices. Shelf life {{and stability of}} fruit juices {{are important}} factors, which determine their nutritional quality and freshness. In this view, the effect of storage on the concentration of organic acids in commercially packed fruit juices is studied by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Ten packed fruit juices from two different brands are stored at 30 C for 24, 48 and 72 hours. A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic method is {{used to determine the}} concentration of oxalic, tartaric, malic, ascorbic and citric acid in the fruit juices during storage. The chromatographic analysis of organic acids is carried out using mobile phase 0. 5 % (w/v) <b>ammonium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> buffer (pH 2. 8) on C 18 column with UV-Vis detector. The results show that the concentration of organic acids generally decreases in juices under study with the increase in storage time. All the fruit juices belonging to tropicana brand underwent less organic acid degradation in comparison to juices of real brand. Orange fruit juice is found to be least stable among the juices under study, after the span of 72 hours. Amongst all the organic acids under investigation minimum stability is shown by ascorbic acid followed by malic and citric acid...|$|R
40|$|Concentrating {{nutrients}} on biochar and clinoptilolite {{and subsequently}} using the nutrient-enriched sorbents as a fertiliser {{could be an}} alternative way to manage nutrients in digestate. In this study, we investigated the use of biochar and clinoptilolite columns in removing <b>ammonium,</b> potassium, <b>orthophosphate</b> and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the liquid fraction of digestate. Our objectives were to investigate {{the effect of the}} initial loading ratio between liquid and biochar on nutrient removal, and to investigate the effect of combining biochar with clinoptilolite on nutrient and DOC removal efficiency. Increasing the initial loading ratios increased nutrient concentrations on biochar to 8. 61  mg NH 4 -N g − 1, 1. 95  mg PO 4 -P g − 1 and 13. 01  mg DOC g − 1, but resulted in decreasing removal efficiencies. The combination of biochar and clinoptilolite resulted in improved ammonium, potassium and DOC removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, but did not significantly change PO 4 -P removal efficiencies. Removal efficiencies with combined sorbents were up to 67 % for ammonium, 58 % for DOC and 58 % for potassium. Clinoptilolite showed higher removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, and combining clinoptilolite with biochar improved only total P removal efficiency. Concentrating nutrients with clinoptilolite and biochar may be an option when both sorbents are available at low cost. </p...|$|R
40|$|Magnesia-phosphate cement (MPC) mortars {{based on}} {{magnesia}} and <b>ammonium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> (ADP) were prepared with additions of sodium triphosphate (STP), boric acid, and borax as set-retarders. The resulting materials were characterised {{in terms of}} their setting characteristics, mechanical properties, and microstructures. The retarders were found to increase the setting time and to reduce the intensity of the exothermic reactions during the initial setting and hardening stages. The effectiveness of STP as a retarder was limited by its solubility in the saturated ammonium phosphate solution, determined as 340 g dm(- 3), which meant that the maximum setting time obtained was approximately 15 min. In contrast, successive additions of boric acid and borax led to a cumulative increase in setting time to a maximum of 1 h for the compositions investigated. The use of retarders also led to an extension of the initial hardening period, as indicated by reductions in the early values of Young's modulus and flexural strength. The microstructural characteristics of the materials produced were very dependent on the type and level of additive employed; for STP, the binding phase was relatively fine grained (10 mum) structures were observed {{as a result of a}} reduction in the supersaturation of the aqueous solution. Well-aged mortar specimens exhibited a high incidence of microcracks on the fracture surfaces, which were related to the occurrence of a fracture process zone ahead of the main crack tip during fracture.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 119 - 126. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) {{was used}} for the {{determination}} of cadmium and beryllium in coal and fly ash slurries. Sample preparation involved grinding the sample to a fine powder and slurrying it in a suitable solvent. Stable slurries were maintained by magnetic stirring during sampling. Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes were used for cadmium determinations, while beryllium was determined with platform atomisation. <b>Ammonium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> and magnesium nitrate matrix modifiers were used for cadmium and beryllium determinations respectively. Calibration graphs constructed with aqueous standards containing the appropriate matrix modifier were rectilinear to at least 100 pg cadmium and 45 pg beryllium. Results were calculated with integrated peak area measurements. The detection limits were 2. 9 pg for cadmium and 0. 7 pg for beryllium. Beryllium determinations were performed with semi-automatic sample introduction. The novel semi-automatic sampling unit utilised magnetic stirring for· the maintenance of stable slurries and operated with the standard Perkin-Elmer AS- 40 autosampler. The principles of this unit were extended {{to the development of a}} fully automatic auto-sampling unit. The design and operation of both units are described. The accuracy of the methods was evaluated by analysing standard reference materials and in some cases, comparisons with acid digestion procedures. Data are presented for the analysis of South African coal and fly ash samples. The slurry methods had acceptable accuracy and precision. In comparison with the conventional acid digestion procedures using high pressure bombs, a time-saving advantage was realised...|$|R
