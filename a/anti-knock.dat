25|$|In {{order to}} cope with the extreme altitudes flown at, the pilot was {{provided}} with a specially-developed two-piece suit. This suit, which was principally composed of rubberised fabric, was joined at the waist using a form of pipe-clip. It was provided with a helmet, which featured a large forward window to provide view. It is complete with closed-circuit breathing apparatus, the oxygen jet being delivered via a small injector for circulation purposes. Once exhaled, the gas would travel via an external tube to a canister containing carbon dioxide-absorbing chemicals to restore it to a pure oxygen state prior to being re-circulated. The 138 had an internal capacity of 82 gallons, spread across 70 gallons in the lower tank and 12 gallons in the upper tank. A specially-developed fuel, known as S.A.F.4, was used for the altitude record flight, derived from standard grade Shell Ethyl aviation gasoline. Of note, this fuel has a high <b>anti-knock</b> value; the high degree of supercharge involved results in the fuel mixture reaching high temperatures, which generally increases the potential for detonation, thus a high <b>anti-knock</b> value was viewed to be of critical importance.|$|E
25|$|Lead is a {{soft metal}} (MH 1.5, but hardens close to melting) which, in many cases, {{is unable to}} support its own weight. It has a {{close-packed}} structure (BCN 12) but an abnormally large inter-atomic distance that {{has been attributed to}} partial ionisation of the lead atoms. It forms a semi-covalent dioxide PbO2; a covalently bonded sulfide PbS; covalently bonded halides; and a range of covalently bonded organolead compounds such as the lead(II) mercaptan Pb(SC2H5)2, lead tetra-acetate Pb(CH3CO2)4, and the once common, <b>anti-knock</b> additive, tetra-ethyl lead (CH3CH2)4Pb. The oxide of lead in its preferred oxidation state (PbO; +2) is amphoteric; it forms anionic plumbates in strongly basic solutions. Lead forms Zintl phases such as CsPb, Sr31Pb20, La5Pb3N and Yb3Pb20. It has reasonable to good corrosion resistance; in moist air it forms a mixed gray coating of oxide, carbonate and sulfate that hinders further oxidation.|$|E

2500|$|The Wasp Major engines had {{a prodigious}} {{appetite}} for lubricating oil: each engine required a dedicated 100gal (380l) tank. Normal maintenance consisted of tedious measures, like changing the 56 spark plugs {{on each of}} the six engines; the plugs were often fouled by the lead in the 145 octane <b>anti-knock</b> fuel required by the R-4360 engines. Thus, each service required changing 336 spark plugs. [...] Another frequent maintenance job was replacing the dozens of bomb bay light bulbs, which routinely shattered during test firing of the turret guns.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, {{iron pentacarbonyl}} was once {{used as an}} <b>anti-knock</b> agent in petrol in place of tetraethyllead.

50|$|The C-Pb bond is {{weak and}} for this reason homolytic {{cleavage}} of organolead compounds to free radicals is easy. In its <b>anti-knocking</b> capacity, its purpose is that of a radical initiator. General reaction types of aryl and vinyl organoleads are transmetalation for instance with boronic acids and acid-catalyzed heterocyclic cleavage. Organoleads find use in coupling reactions between arene compounds. They are more reactive than the likewise organotins and can therefore be used to synthesise sterically crowded biaryls.|$|R
5000|$|Working at the GM Research Laboratory at Dayton, Ohio, Charles Kettering and his {{assistant}} Thomas Midgley, Jr. studied <b>anti-knocking</b> agents. In 1921, the team directed by Midgley discovered TEL's <b>anti-knocking</b> property, which would eliminate the knock in internal combustion engines, allowing them to be built with higher compression ratios. GM proceeded to file a patent {{for the use of}} TEL as an additive in gasoline. In August 1924, after Standard Oil of New Jersey discovered a lower-cost method to synthesize TEL, it teamed up with GM to establish the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce TEL as a gasoline additive with the help of DuPont. Soon, workers at Ethyl plants fell ill and a number of them died from lead poisoning. Kettering hired Kehoe to develop protocols for the workers handling TEL. Kehoe soon became the main medical advocate for the position that the use of TEL in gasoline is safe and gained prominence as the industry's expert at government and public health hearings. As almost all research support concerning leaded gasoline came from industry, and most was channeled to him, he held [...] "an almost complete monopoly" [...] on data for half a century. Kehoe claimed that presence of lead in humans and other organisms was normal and that exposure to low lead levels was not harmful.|$|R
2500|$|The R-2800 powered {{several types}} of fighters and medium bombers during the war, {{including}} the U.S. Navy's Vought F4U Corsair, with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940, and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed 400mph (640km/h) in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair's naval rival, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the U.S. Army Air Forces' Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (which uniquely, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric turbocharger), the twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder and Douglas A-26 Invader, {{as well as the}} first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher octane rating (<b>anti-knock</b> value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of [...] on 115-grade fuel with water injection.|$|E

The third strategy was to improve <b>anti-knocking</b> performance by more efficient cooling of the cylinder head/combustion chambers.

40|$|Knock {{is due to}} an {{unexpected}} combustion in Spark Ignition (SI) engines. It {{is a result of}} spontaneous ignition of a portion of end gas in the engine chamber, ahead of the propagating flame. The very rapid heat release implied by this abnormal combustion generates shock waves that can lead to the decrease in output, the increase in some pollutants and the destruction of the engine. Although knock has been more or less overcome in gasoline engines by controlling the fuel quality, gas engines are not safe from knock. Natural gas contains different gases (CH 4, C 2 H 6, etc.) with variable knock-resistance. Its composition varies widely with time and place. Consequently, an engine can start to knock if the gas reaches too low <b>anti-knocking</b> properties. A reliable method for the detection of knock in gas SI engine is then of high interest...|$|R

Inside, the 1GR uses a [...] "taper-squish" [...] combustion chamber design with matching pistons to improve <b>anti-knocking</b> and engine performance, while also improving intake and fuel efficiency. Toyota adopted a siamese-type intake port, which reduces the surface area of the port walls and prevents fuel from adhering to such walls. This engine has special cast-iron cylinder liners cast into the block, which are a spiny type to improve adhesion between the liner and cylinder block. With these special thin liners {{it is impossible to}} bore the block. In the event of cylinder wall damage (scoring, deep protrusions, etc.), the entire cylinder block must be replaced. For increased block rigidity, the 1GR also receives a high temperature plastic insulator/protector, which fills the empty space between the outer portion of the cylinders and block material common to open deck engines. For increased cooling efficiency, the 1GR employs water passages between the bores of the engine. There are two such passages for each bank for a total of four. This reduces cylinder hot-spotting and keeps combustion chamber temperatures more uniform.|$|R
