40|$|Remediation {{goals for}} the source areas of a {{chlorinated}} ethene-contaminated ground-water plume in Kings Bay, GA were identified by assessing the natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> of the aquifer system. The redox chemistry of the site indicates that sulfate-reducing (H 2 ~ 2 nanomoles per liter, (nM)) conditions near the contaminant source grades to Fe(III) -reducing conditions (H 2 ~ 0. 5 nM) downgradient of the source. Sulfate-reducing conditions facilitate the initial reduction of perchloroethene (PCE) to trichloroethene (TCE), cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC). Subsequently, the Fe(III) -reducing conditions drive the oxidation of cis-DCE and VC to carbon dioxide and chloride. This sequence of redox conditions gives the aquifer a substantial capacity for biodegrading chlorinated ethenes. Natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity,</b> defined as {{the slope of the}} steady-state contaminant concentration profile along a ground-water flowpath, is a function of biodegradation rates, aquifer dispersive characteristics, and ground-water flow velocity. Natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> at the Kings Bay site was assessed by estimating ground-water flow rates (~ 0. 23 ± 0. 12 m/d) and aquifer dispersivity (~ 1 m) from hydrologic and scale considerations. Apparent biodegradation rate constants (PCE and TCE ~ 0. 01 d- 1; cis-DCE and VC ~ 0. 025 d- 1) were estimated from observed contaminant concentration changes along aquifer flowpaths. Given estimates for these parameters, a boundary-value problem approach was used to estimate levels to which contaminant concentrations in the source-areas must be lowered (by engineered removal), or ground-water flow velocities lowered (by pumping) in order for the natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> to achieve maximum concentration limits (MCLs) prior to reaching a predetermined regulatory point of compliance...|$|E

Irrigation provides for a novel approach to the utilisation and disposal of mine water, under the correct conditions. The significance of these findings lies in the versatility of this irrigation. Communities which often have very few other resources can utilise mine water to generate livelihoods. When one considers social aspects like job creation, especially after mine closure, {{it is clear that}} irrigation with certain mine waters, on carefully selected and managed sites, could form a sustainable, economically feasible and socially uplifting strategy in the developing world. Research over a period of more than 10 years has shown that this water can be used successfully for the irrigation of a range of crops (Annandale et al., 2004). The potential environmental impact of this excess water is of great concern in a water-scarce country like South Africa. There is however continuing concern from the local regulators regarding the long-term impact that large scale mine water irrigation may have on groundwater quality and quantity.

40|$|Worldwide {{urbanization}} {{and climate}} change are influential in changing precipitation patterns and hydrological flow resulting in event driven urban flooding. The approach to flood protection has recently shifted from engineered and technical solutions to more sustainable and integrated solutions, by considering social, ecological and physical implications and exploring sustainable urban drainage options. Attenuation of peak stormwater flow using natural wetlands {{is one of many}} sustainable urban drainage methods used to reduce flooding and is an approach of interest for this research. The study site is located within the small, urbanized river system of the Liesbeek River in Cape Town, South Africa, which is prone to localized flooding during annual winter rainfall events. The study measures the <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> of a small-scale wetland adjacent to an urban river using a 2 D PCSWMM hydrodynamic model. Research is focused on illustrating the <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> of this wetland. The model ran historic flow data to determine the <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> and to measure peak flow reduction. While the reduction is not sufficient to reduce damaging floods, the findings provide new knowledge and understanding of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacity</b> of this wetland and motivation for expanding sustainable urban drainage within the catchment. The study aims to build a baseline dataset for the research site with the data available at present. Peak flow of the Liesbeek River was reduced in scenarios with the Valkenberg Wetland present to accept on a portion of this flow. Attenuation was most effective for rainfall events with sudden spikes in peak flow, where a 42 per cent reduction of peak flow was observed. For a scenario with lower flow rates yet a prolonged peak flow rate, the wetland was less effective, with a 20 per cent reduction observed. This wetland was found to have the potential to provide valuable ecosystem services to the area by attenuating peak flow and thus reducing the occurrence of property damaging flooding downstream...|$|E

Here, we present the original observations on high-temperature electromagnetic properties and attenuation behavior of Bi 0. 8 La 0. 2 FeO 3 at 323 – 673 K. Bi 0. 8 La 0. 2 FeO 3 exhibits high-efficiency and stable attenuation at dynamic temperature and frequency conditions.

The plume emanating from this source area was characterized by vinyl chloride (VC) concentrations exceeding 800 lg/L. In situ oxidation using Fenton’s reagent lowered PCE concentrations in the source area below 100 lg/L, and PCE concentrations have not rebounded above this level since treatment.

40|$|International audienceColoring {{a surface}} {{to form an}} image is a very ancient activity, {{which is based on}} a simple principle: the {{deposition}} of coloring layers on a reflecting support. In painting or analog photography, these coloring layers are continuous. They cover the entire surface and more or less absorb light depending on their thickness and dye concentration. The obtained colors are called “continuous tone” or “contone. ” In printing, the coloring layers are discontinuous. The inks have fixed thickness and colorant concentration; the different tones are obtained by varying their surface coverage ratio, yielding the “halftones” colors. Historically, the color rendering of images was controlled by the painter, the photographer, or the printer, that is, by a specialist who somehow acquired his expertise in the selection of the materials and the control of the coloration process. The new printing technologies have increased the image reproduction quality and the ubiquity of color images in everyday’s life. They have also provided he possibility for nonexpert consumers to print themselves at home, thanks to fully automated printing processes. In the absence of a color expert, the printer needs to be calibrated by the constructor. This requires to relate color rendering to technical parameters (dye concentration, ink thickness, etc.) according to a scientific approach relying on the physical measurements. The task for the scientists in this domain is double: understanding the physical phenomena being at the origin of the color rendering and predicting the color rendering for given printing specifications. Before entering into the physical characterization of the printed colors, it should be recalled that color is not a physical quantity but a physiological sensation. This sensation is the response of our visual system to a light signal striking the retina. During the twentieth century, scientists managed to elaborate a mathematical description of the color sensation and to connect it with the spectrum of the light received by the retin. However, the study of color and the study of light are two scientific domains based on very different concepts called colorimetry and optics, respectively. Light can be characterized by its energy, speed, wavelength, direction, and polarization, but it would be erroneous to say that it “has a color. ” Similarly, it is simplistic to say that a surface has a color. We should rather say that it has the aptitude to reflect a fraction of the ambient light depending on its spectrum <b>attenuation</b> <b>capacities,</b> which creates a luminous signal that human brain perceives as a color. A complete description of the print color rendering should, therefore, rely on physical and perceptual analyses. However, we generally assume that these two analyses can be treated separately, that is, the luminous signal issued from the surface is fully characterized by the physics and the interpretation of this luminous signal in terms of color is described by colorimetry. In this chapter, we focus on the physical analysis. Optics is the sci ntific study of light and its interaction with matter. It covers a wide range of phenomena and applications. We focus here on the basic notions necessary to understand surface color prediction models. We, first, recall briefly what is light and what kind of light is considered in color reproduction. Then, we introduce radiometry, the branch of optics that deals with light measurement, and models for absorption, reflection, and refraction by a surface, scattering, and special effects such as fluorescence...|$|R
40|$|A {{consolidated}} composite sorbent {{made from}} manganese chloride and expanded graphite was produced for sorption deep-freezing processes {{and used for}} cold production at a temperature as low as - 35 Â Â°C. Experimental {{results showed that the}} addition of a porous graphite matrix can prevent the agglomeration and the <b>attenuation</b> of sorption <b>capacity</b> of reactive salt. The composite sorbent could incorporate 0. 537 Â kg of ammonia per kg of reactive salt and the average specific cooling power (SCP) obtained varied between 200 Â WÂ kg- 1 and 700 Â WÂ kg- 1 when the evaporation temperature ranged from - 35 Â Â°C to 0 Â Â°C. The analysis of the data suggested that the heat transfer characteristic in the composite sorbent was strongly influenced by chemical reaction and the conversion rate was very sensitive to the constraint temperatures. The SCP and coefficient of performance (COP) of a simple sorption deep-freezing system were 350 Â WÂ kg- 1 and 0. 34, respectively, at the generation temperature of 180 Â Â°C, the heat sink temperature of 25 Â Â°C and the evaporation temperature of - 30 Â Â°C.

40|$|Abstract – Living organisms provide undisputable {{evidence}} of biomolecular sensing, information processing and communication. Although {{the mechanisms of}} data and information processing and relevant tasks (coding, data storage, data retrieval, etc.) have not been fully comprehended, {{it is evident that}} extremely high data rate communication is maintained to support the exhibited functionalities and capabilities. Understanding the benchmarks of communication and processing in living organisms promise one to enable farreaching foundations, transformative developments and breakthroughs. In this paper, we consider the spike-centric signaling, electromagnetic radiation, biophotonic and other communication schemes. We examine different mechanisms and apply well-established engineering concepts in analysis of communication channels. The channels ability to support the required data rates is assessed and evaluated. The channel <b>capacity,</b> <b>attenuation</b> rate and other descriptive measures are derived. We investigate microtubules as waveguides for propagating electromagnetic waves. It is shown through a set of representative examples that spike-centric signaling may not enable the required channel capacity, while microtubules may support extraordinary communication rates, superior speed and low attenuation at very high frequencies.
