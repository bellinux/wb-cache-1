40|$|Data on <b>acute</b> lethal <b>inhalation</b> {{toxicity}} {{from animal}} studies are commonly required {{for assessing the}} hazards to human health of volatile, gaseous and dusty chemicals or their mixtures. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) made the provision of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity data a mandatory requirement for the carriage of bulk liquid chemicals transported by sea in tank ships, thereby creating the need for inhalation data on many hundreds of chemicals in bulk maritime transport. Taking note of previously published proposals for estimating <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity <b>hazards</b> for chemicals, and the paucity of measured experimental data, an extrapolation method has been developed by the Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) to partly fulfil this need. This method {{should be seen as}} a pragmatic approach to the challenge of missing measured experimental test data, with the added benefit of reducing tests in experimental animals. The method is based on a route-to-route (i. e. between-route) extrapolation of information on acute oral and/or dermal toxicity, in combination with data on the potential for irritation and/or corrosion to skin and eyes. The validation of this method was based on the individual evaluation of inhalation toxicity studies for 330 chemicals, including mixtures and many important chemical groups, for which the IMO holds public and industryconfidential data. The authors contend that this extrapolation method offers a reliable basis for hazard evaluation in the context of bulk maritime transport, and the 'GESAMP inhalation toxicity extrapolation method' {{has become part of the}} IMO regulatory system for the carriage of bulk liquids (i. e. noxious liquid substances) on board tank ships...|$|R

In order to refine {{and reduce the}} number of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> tests performed, we propose a screening test that uses isolated lungs. The test consists of the exposure of isolated, ventilated and perfused rat lungs, to aerosolised formulations of waterproofing agents (mass median aerodynamic diameter = 1 mu m), and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters and gross pathology analysis. A pilot evaluation of the isolated perfused rat lung model for use in a screening test was carried out by blind testing 12 surface-active substances. The results obtained compared well with data available from in vivo <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> studies. Substances that triggered harmful effects, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis of the isolated perfused lung, were also found to cause changes in respiratory parameters, some of which would be severe enough to lead to death in in vivo tests with rats. The changes in respiratory parameters suggest that the mode-of-action is associated with impairment of the surfactant layer. Therefore, pre-testing in the isolated perfused rat lung allows the identification of surface-active substances with the potential for causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity...|$|R

Significant research efforts have been directed at the development of mechanistically based, non-animal testing approaches that hold promise to provide human-relevant data and an enhanced understanding of toxicity mechanisms. A September 2016 workshop, “Alternative Approaches for <b>Acute</b> <b>Inhalation</b> Toxicity Testing to Address Global Regulatory and Non-Regulatory Data Requirements”, explored current testing requirements and ongoing efforts to achieve global regulatory acceptance for non-animal testing approaches. The importance of using integrated approaches that combine existing data with in vitro and/or computational approaches to generate new data was discussed.

40|$|New {{surface-active}} {{agents in}} waterproofing sprays are often tested for <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity in vivo {{on the basis}} of OECD Test Guideline 403. A screening test using the isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) is proposed {{in order to reduce the}} number of <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> tests and to refine these. The test comprises exposure of IPRLs to aerosolised formulations of the water proofing agents and on-line monitoring of respiratory parameters. Substances revealing harmful effects on the IPRL, such as impaired lung compliance and atelectasis formation, did also show changes in respiratory parameters up to mortality in in vivo tests with rats. Thus, pre-testing in the IPRL allows the identification of surface-active substances causing <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity. To assess the potential lung toxicity of seven formulations, each tested in two male and two female IPRLs, we evaluated changes in the respiratory parameters tidal volume, compliance, and resistance, edema and atelectasis formation, taking into account the inhaled doses. These IPRL results were compared with available in vivo results and a good or excellent correlation in six out of seven cases was revealed. In conclusion, the use of the IPRL is well suited for screening substances showing <b>acute</b> "physical" <b>inhalation</b> toxicity. Therefore, for future assessment of surface active substances, it is suggested to use this test prior to in vivo inhalation tests. Formulations with no acute harmful effects on the IPRL need to be further investigated in vivo for complete risk assessment. However, substances showing strong reactions in the IPRL will most likely cause lung damage in vivo. This is why testing in live animals is not recommended in order to avoid possible pain, suffering or distress...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{based in}} vitro methods to assess the {{biological}} effects of inhalable compounds are based on "air-lifted interface" (ALI) cell culture protocols where cultures from cell lines, primary cells or ex vivo sources such as PCLS (precision cut lung slices) are exposed efficiently to airborne material. They have been applied in approaches to test toxicity and biological action of environmental, workplace or chemical compounds. The basic ALI procedure has been successfully prevalidated as a short-exposure test (1 hour exposures) for chemical gases. However, although a good predictability for highly toxic gaseous compounds or non-toxic inert gases could be demonstrated, {{it was not clear}} until now, if highly hydrophobic or low-toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can also be assessed by cell based methods in vitro under these conditions with regard to a relevant estimate of their <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> toxicity characteristics in vivo. Therefore, a four compound test substance matrix was set up from the data base of the European chemicals agency (ECHA) including VOCs differing in hydrophobicity and <b>acute</b> in vivo <b>inhalation</b> toxicity. A cell based testing including vaporized compounds, an improved air-liquid interface in vitro procedure (PRIT ExpoCube) with human lung cells (A 549) and read-out of cytotoxicity (WST- 1) was carried out.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] <b>Acute</b> <b>inhalation</b> of {{clinical}} doses of salbutamol in normal volunteers increases {{resting metabolic rate}} by up to 20 % above control values. This {{study was designed to}} see if chronic treatment with salbutamol causes a sustained increase in metabolic rate and whether it modifies the acute thermogenic response to the drug. METHODS [...] The effects of chronic inhaled salbutamol on resting oxygen consumption (VO 2) and carbon dioxide output (VCO 2) were studied in seven normal subjects (age 20 - 47 years, weight 52 - 105 kg, five men). An open canopy method of indirect calorimetry was used to measure VO 2, VCO 2, and respiratory quotient (RQ). Subjects inhaled two puffs of salbutamol or placebo four times a day in a double blind manner. Measurements of resting VO 2 and VCO 2 after 10 days of salbutamol were compared with the values after 10 days of placebo and with those taken {{at the start of the}} study. At the end of each treatment period subjects inhaled eight puffs (800 micrograms) of salbutamol and the acute effects on VO 2, VCO 2 and RQ were monitored for one hour. RESULTS [...] Resting VO 2, VCO 2, and RQ were not significantly different at the end of the salbutamol and placebo periods but the acute response to eight puffs of salbutamol was abolished by regular inhalation. The mean VO 2 integrated over one hour after 800 micrograms salbutamol given acutely was different (241. 3 and 210. 7 ml/kg/h in the placebo and salbutamol groups respectively). Differences were not significant between placebo and salbutamol groups for changes in VCO 2, heart rate, blood pressure, and RQ after <b>acute</b> <b>inhalation.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Regular treatment with inhaled salbutamol (800 micrograms/day) does not cause a sustained increase in resting metabolic rate but prevents the increase in VO 2 that occurs after <b>acute</b> <b>inhalations</b> in normal subjects...|$|R
