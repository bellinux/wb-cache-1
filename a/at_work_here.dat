The waterwheel was used to work ancillary machinery until 1968, when the cast iron pit wheel was broken in the floods of that year.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{considered}} {{that a great}} part of the episode's merits were due to George R. R. Martin's script. Sepinwall felt that [...] "Martin didn't get the easiest draw when he wound up having to dramatize the events depicted in 'The Pointy End,'" [...] but still loved the results. Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here.</b> Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E

In spite of its lost world location, the Crown has been a beacon of gastronomic adventure for at least 30 years – those with long memories will recall Stephen Bull carving out his reputation here." [...] He said of the food, [...] "There is clearly a distinctive palate <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here.</b> In lesser hands, such a meal could be not so much a car crash as a multiple pile-up, but it is not, because the ingredients are handled with originality, assurance and, more importantly, a keen sense of pleasure." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Mincher of The A.V. Club was {{disappointed}} with the album, finding it stripped of its songwriting and control in lead singer Nathan Willett's voice from their debut album. Blake Solomon of AbsolutePunk found the album lacking in terms of instrumentals and songwriting saying, [...] "It's easy to see the great ideas from previous songs <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here,</b> {{but there seems to}} be an intentional restraint placed on the band's likeable pop inclinations." [...] The Guardian criticized the album for its lackluster blues rock production and Willett's performance, saying [...] "his voice is too drearily clean-cut to deliver a true emotional punch." [...] Ian Cohen of Pitchfork felt that the album was hampered by the band's uninspired musicianship and songwriting and the hype surrounding them, saying that [...] "Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To Loyalty is proof that their detractors can say the same thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times said, [...] " [...] overstuffed with plot lines, set {{pieces and}} villains, {{although}} stars Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone {{do their best}} to give the movie heart." [...] Tim Robey of The Telegraph said, [...] "Marc Webb's Spider-Man sequel is overstuffed with high-voltage villains, but the sparks between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone save the day". Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy said, [...] "Peter's past, present and future all intertwine in a sequel that offers bang for your buck. That said you can't help [...] feel the franchise bean counters <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here</b> thanks to all the ominous foreshadowing and unresolved character arcs. Too many cooks and all that...". Kim Newman of Empire scored the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "A few too-broad gags aside — and even these are in the funky spirit of '60s Marvel — this is a satisfying second issue with thrills, heartbreak, gasps, and a perfectly judged slingshot ending." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "The eponymous hero hits his super-heroic stride here, as does Andrew Garfield in the role, especially when Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker learns there's always some fine print in a contract with this many benefits. The plot gets itself tangled up in multiple villain strands, but in the main, this installment is emotionally weightier and more satisfying than its predecessor." [...] Guy Lodge of Variety said, [...] "Redundancy remains a problem, but this overlong superhero sequel gets by on sound, fury and star chemistry." [...] Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, stating that [...] "It's about 20 minutes too long and it's overstuffed with too many characters and too many subplots, but there's enough good stuff in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to warrant optimism about the next chapter of the franchise." [...] A negative review came from Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, giving the film two stars out of four, he said: [...] "Things go wrong quickly with Amazing 2. Am I the only one who hates the word Amazing to describe a movie that isn't? Just asking." [...] IGN reviewer Daniel Krupa gave 6.9/10 and wrote, [...] "Amazing Spider-Man 2 gets a lot right, yet there’s a constant awkwardness to the machinery of its plot; you can almost hear the cogs turning. However, what’s worse is that at times it becomes overtly patronising: there are flashing screens and computer voice-overs constantly telling you what something is or what something is doing, just in case the people in the back rows aren’t paying attention, which feels at odds with the film’s emotional intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|Ann Snitow’s {{reaction}} to Beloved neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation. In her 1987 review of Beloved, Snitow argues that Beloved, the ghost {{at the center}} of the narrative, is [...] "too light" [...] and [...] "hollow", rendering the entire novel [...] "airless". Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted Beloved in a different way, seeing something more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost, something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation. The conflicts <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here</b> are ideological as well as critical: they concern the definition and evaluation of American and African-American literature, the relationship between art and politics, and the tension between recognition and appropriation.|$|E

2500|$|Morgan's {{intellectual}} {{experience in}} the federal WPA programs had both advantages and disadvantages {{for him as a}} historian. The independent nature of these programs encouraged his critical judgment and work ethic, forced him to work with a variety of people, and exposed him to a wide training ground on source development and research. However, it did not lead him to consider the larger meaning of the facts he gathered or to understand the philosophy and theory of history, as taught in an academic setting. In fact, during the trials of his career, he became quite antagonistic to academic requirements. In response to a negative academic review of a work by his friend DeVoto, he wrote: [...] "...the term ‘history’ had better be redefined to mean, ’a species of writing produced by or enroute to a Ph.D.’ I have had enough troubles trying to break a path alongside this main-traveled road to know something of the snobberies <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here,</b> {{and the ways in which}} the academic world and even the world of learning are geared to these attitudes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{remains of}} a {{crossing}} tower on the French Church of Saint-Jean de Montierneuf from about 1140 suggest an origin for some Spanish domes in a Romanesque and transitional Gothic style. The architectural influences <b>at</b> <b>work</b> <b>here</b> have been much debated, with proposed origins ranging from Jerusalem, Islamic Spain, or the Limousin region in western France to a mixture of sources. During the Reconquista, the Kingdom of León in northern Spain built three churches famous for their domed crossing towers, called [...] "cimborios", as it acquired new territories. The Cathedral of Zamora, the Cathedral of Salamanca, and the collegiate church of Toro were built around {{the middle of the}} 12th century. All three buildings have stone umbrella domes with sixteen ribs over windowed drums of either one or two stories, springing from pendentives. All three also have four small round towers engaged externally to the drums of the domes on their diagonal sides. Perhaps the masterpiece of the series, the Salamanca crossing tower has two stories of windows in its drum. Its outer stone fish-scale roof lined with gothic crockets is a separate corbelled layer with only eight lobes, which applies weight to the haunches of the sixteen-sided inner dome.|$|E

Something in his own experience caused Mirah's search after her mother to lay hold with peculiar force on his imagination. The first prompting of sympathy was to aid her in her search: if given persons were extant in London there were ways of finding them, as subtle as scientific experiment, the right machinery being set <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> But <b>here</b> the mixed feelings which belonged to Deronda's kindred experience naturally transfused themselves into his anxiety on behalf of Mirah.|$|R
