25|$|The total {{extent of}} China's natural gas {{reserves}} is unknown, as relatively little exploration {{for natural gas}} has been done. Sichuan accounts for {{almost half of the}} known natural gas reserves and production. Most of the rest of China's natural gas is <b>associated</b> <b>gas</b> produced in the Northeast's major oil fields, especially Daqing oilfield. Other gas deposits have been found in the Qaidam Basin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang, and offshore to the southwest of Hainan Island. According to an article published in Energy Economics in 2011 by economists Mete Feridun (University of Greenwich) and Abdul Jalil (Wuhan University in China), financial development in China has not taken place at the expense of environmental pollution and financial development has led to a decrease in environmental pollution. Authors conclude that carbon emissions are mainly determined by income, energy consumption and trade openness and their findings confirm the existence of an Environmental Kuznets Curve in the case of China.|$|E

In July 2010, it sold its natural gas activities in Alberta and British Columbia, Canada, to Apache Corporation. It sold its stake in the Petroperijá and Boquerón fields in Venezuela and in the Lan Tay and Lan Do fields, the Nam Con Son pipeline and terminal, and the Phu My 3 power plant in Vietnam to TNK-BP, forecourts and supply businesses in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi to Puma Energy, the Wytch Farm onshore oilfield in Dorset and a package of North Sea gas assets to Perenco, natural-gas liquids business in Canada to Plains All American Pipeline LP, natural gas assets in Kansas to Linn Energy, Carson Refinery in Southern California and its ARCO retail network to Tesoro, Sunray and Hemphill gas processing plants in Texas, together with their <b>associated</b> <b>gas</b> gathering system, to Eagle Rock Energy Partners, the Texas City Refinery and associated assets to Marathon Petroleum, the Gulf of Mexico located Marlin, Dorado, King, Horn Mountain, and Holstein fields as also its stake in non-operated Diana Hoover and Ram Powell fields to Plains Exploration & Production, non-operating stake in the Draugen oil field to Norske Shell, and the UK's liquefied petroleum gas distribution business to DCC.|$|E
25|$|These {{are used}} for {{high-temperature}} Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (nearly 340nbsp&°C) to produce low-molecular-weight unsaturated hydrocarbons on alkalized fused iron catalysts. The fluid-bed technology (as adapted from the catalytic cracking of heavy petroleum distillates) was introduced by Hydrocarbon Research in 1946–50 and named the ‘Hydrocol’ process. A large scale Fischer–Tropsch Hydrocol plant (350,000 tons per annum) operated during 1951–57 in Brownsville, Texas. Due to technical problems, and lacking economy due to increasing petroleum availability, this development was discontinued. Fluid-bed Fischer–Tropsch synthesis has recently been very successfully reinvestigated by Sasol. One reactor with a capacity of 500,000 tons per annum is now in operation and even larger ones are being built (nearly 850,000 tons per annum). The process is now used mainly for C2 and C7 alkene production. This new development {{can be regarded as}} an important progress in Fischer–Tropsch technology. A high-temperature process with a circulating iron catalyst (‘circulating fluid bed’, ‘riser reactor’, ‘entrained catalyst process’) was introduced by the Kellogg Company and a respective plant built at Sasol in 1956. It was improved by Sasol for successful operation. At Secunda, South Africa, Sasol operated 16 advanced reactors of this type with a capacity of approximately 330,000 tons per annum each. Now the circulating catalyst process is being replaced by the superior Sasol-advanced fluid-bed technology. Early experiments with cobalt catalyst particles suspended in oil have been performed by Fischer. The bubble column reactor with a powdered iron slurry catalyst and a CO-rich syngas was particularly developed to pilot plant scale by Kölbel at the Rheinpreuben Company in 1953. Recently (since 1990) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch slurry processes are under investigation for the use of iron and cobalt catalysts, particularly for the production of a hydrocarbon wax, or to be hydrocracked and isomerised to produce diesel fuel, by Exxon and Sasol. Today slurry-phase (bubble column) low-temperature Fischer–Tropsch synthesis is regarded by many authors as the most efficient process for Fischer–Tropsch clean diesel production. This Fischer–Tropsch technology is also under development by the Statoil Company (Norway) for use on a vessel to convert <b>associated</b> <b>gas</b> at offshore oil fields into a hydrocarbon liquid.|$|E

2500|$|An {{oil well}} {{produces}} predominantly crude oil, with some natural gas dissolved in it. Because {{the pressure is}} lower at the surface than underground, some of the gas {{will come out of}} solution and be recovered (or burned) as <b>associated</b> <b>gas</b> or solution gas. A gas well produces predominantly natural gas. However, because the underground temperature and pressure are higher than at the surface, the gas may contain heavier hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, and heptane in the gaseous state. At surface conditions these will condense out of the gas to form [...] "natural gas condensate", often shortened to condensate. Condensate resembles gasoline in appearance and is similar in composition to some volatile light crude oils.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the various}} {{carbon dioxide capture}} and storage (CCS) stages, an {{accurate}} knowledge of thermodynamic properties of CO 2 streams {{is required for the}} correct sizing of plant units. The injected CO 2 streams are not pure and often contain small amounts of associated gaseous components such as O 2,N 2, SOx,NOx, noble gases, etc. In this work, the thermodynamic behavior and transport properties of some CO 2 -rich mixtures have been investigated using both experimental approaches and molecular simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. Using force fields available in the literature,we have validated the capability of molecular simulation techniques in predicting properties for pure compounds, binary mixtures, as well as multicomponent mixtures. These validations were performed on the basis of experimental data taken from the literature and the acquisition of new experimental data. As experimental data and simulation results were in good agreement, we proposed the use of simulation techniques to generate new pseudoexperimental data and to study the impact of <b>associated</b> <b>gases</b> on the properties of CO 2 streams. For instance, for a mixture containing 92. 0 mol% of CO 2, 4. 0 mol% of O 2, 3. 7 mol% of Ar, and 0. 3 mol% of N 2, we have shown that the presence of <b>associated</b> <b>gases</b> leads to a decrease of 14 % and 21 % of the dense phase density and viscosity, respectively, as compared to pure CO 2 properties...|$|R
