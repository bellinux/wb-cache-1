40|$|Groundwater with {{underground}} residence {{times between}} days {{and a few}} years have been investigated over more than 20 years from 487 remote sites located in different <b>aquifer</b> <b>types</b> in the Alpine belt. Analysis of the data reveals that groundwaters evolved in crystalline, evaporite, carbonate, molasse, and flysch aquifers can be clearly distinguished based on their major and trace element composition and degree of mineralisation. A further subdivision can be made even within one <b>aquifer</b> <b>type</b> based on the trace element compositions, which are characteristic for the lithologic environment. Major and trace element concentrations can be quantitatively described by interaction of the groundwater with the aquifer- specific mineralogy along the flow path. Because all investigated sites show minimal anthropogenic influences, the observed concentration ranges represent the natural background concentrations and can thus serve as a “geo-reference” for recent groundwaters from these five <b>aquifer</b> <b>types.</b> This “geo-reference” is particularly useful for the identification of groundwater contamination.

Petrographic properties of the rocks in the vadose and in the groundwater saturated zones as well as the regional hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions are regarded as its major natural influencing factors together with groundwater's initial composition. For an assessment of major groundwater composition on a continental scale, the complexity of individual aquifers needs to be organized into simplified patterns. For this purpose, European scientists, among them representatives from several European national geological surveys, jointly defined a harmonized European aquifer typology, which includes the major classes of aquifers showing comparable petrographic properties.

Similar groundwater compositions are expected for the various classes in comparable hydrodynamic and hydrologic conditions.

Chachadi andLlobo-ferreira initially in 2001 had developed the GALDIT method. Later in 2005, they had modified the method which is specific for coastal aquifers.

The parameters of GALDIT index are: Ground water Occurrence (<b>aquifer</b> <b>type),</b> <b>aquifer</b> hydraulic conductivity, depth of ground water level above the sea level, distance from the shore, impact of existing status of sea water intrusion in the area, and thickness of the aquifer.

The groundwater in our model is mostly derived from meteoric sources, which is supported by stable isotope and rare gases studies (Truesdell and Hulston [1979]; Pang [2011]). Such water gradually infiltrates {{into the ground and}} is then driven by topographic relief or gravity force to move through the deep strata. Groundwater in the deep aquifers is then heated by surrounding hot rocks or mixed with uprising connate or magmatic fluids through transmissible pores and fractures. Depending on the temperature or salinity, buoyancy effects, together with the compression and thrusting of strata, may drive the flow of groundwater (Cherubini et al. [2013]; Tsang and Niemi [2013]). Artificial discharge and recharge further alter the pattern of groundwater flow.

Four types of water hazards caused by faults were given, i. e. transverse inrushing water hazard, vertical conducting water hazard, overflowing water hazard from floor and bursting water hazard from roof. Aiming at hydro-geological characteristics of faults and different types of water hazards, water control technologies and methods were proposed, including in advance pre-dewatering and drainage, directional guided inclination detection and transformation of key interval by grouting as well as remaining scientifically water-proof coal/rock pillars, which has important significance for reducing coal pillar left for fault and increasing recovery of coal resources...|$|R
