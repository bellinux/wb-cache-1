40|$|We {{propose a}} {{monetary}} {{model in which}} the unemployed satisfy the o ¢ cial US de-…nition of unemployment: they are people without jobs who are (i) currently making concrete e¤orts to …nd work and (ii) {{willing and able to}} work. In addition, our model has the property that people searching for jobs are better o ¤ if they …nd a job than if they do not (i. e., unemployment is ‘involuntary’). We integrate our model of involuntary unemployment into the simple New Keynesian framework with no capital and use the resulting model to discuss the concept of the ‘non-accelerating in‡ation rate of unemployment’. We then integrate the model into a medium sized DSGE model with capital and show that the resulting model does as well as existing models <b>at</b> <b>accounting</b> for the response of standard macroeconomic variables to monetary policy shocks and two technology shocks.
