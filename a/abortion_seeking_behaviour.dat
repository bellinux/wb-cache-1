40|$|Abstract Background When {{developing}} an effective early preventive strategy for employees {{and students with}} CANS (Complaints of Arm, Neck or Shoulder, not caused by acute trauma or systemic disease), insight in help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and knowledge of factors associated with help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> within the target population, is a prerequisite. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether perceived hindrance is associated with help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> specifically in employees and students identified with CANS. Additionally, the associations of factors related to functioning and participation, work-environment and demographics with help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> were explored in these groups. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among employees and students of two universities in the South of the Netherlands. The questionnaire included questions to assess (1) demographics, work/study and activity related factors (2) experience of CANS (3) perceived hindrance (4) help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> A subpopulation of the survey, consisting of those employees and students with self-reported CANS, received additional questionnaires to examine the impact of (1) participant characteristics (2) complaint and health related variables (3) functioning and participation (4) work-environment and social support, on help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Results 37. 3 % of the employees and 41. 4 % of the students reported CANS. Of these, respectively 43. 3 % and 45. 5 %, did not seek help and had no intention to seek help either. Employees and students who had not sought help reported less hindrance, less perceived disabilities and shorter duration of complaints, compared those who did seek help. Employees and students within this group who had also no intention to seek help, perceived fewer disabilities and reported shorter duration of complaints. Conclusion The absence of help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> in respondents with CANS is a bottleneck for implementation of preventive strategies. In employees and students with CANS, help <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is primarily determined by factors related to experienced hindrance. Our findings emphasize the need to tailor preventive strategies, in order to optimize screening and participation in early interventions for CANS...|$|R

Our study {{is trying to}} fi nd out this attitude among {{parents of children with}} pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted to analyse all admitted children with pneumonia at Dhulikhel Hospital from September 1, 2006 to August 31, 2007. “Duration of illness at home prior to hospital presentation” was taken as the index of health <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the parents. Results: The mean duration of illness prior to hospital presentation for males and females were 4. 40 days and 4. 16 days respectively (P> 0. 05). Children who had been hospitalised in the past had a mean of 4. 93 days; those never hospitalised before had 4. 08 days (P> 0. 05). Children from Bhaktapur and Kathmandu were brought to the hospital the earliest. Younger children were brought to the hospital sooner; children less than fi ve years were brought earlier, particularly infants.

Seven older women and three men participated in this study through purposive sampling. Qualitative data were gathered via in-depth interviews and were analyzed using content analysis. The results of this study illustrated that older people started to seek health care after understanding the need to seek health care due to the severity of their symptoms. The older people began illness management by using their knowledge to take care of themselves. If management was ineffective, they would seek health care from professional health care providers and traditional healers.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to explore the role of variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> towards fish {{consumption}} frequency. Second, it aimed to investigate how personality related factors; variety seeking tendency (related to food and personality) and perceived behavioural control affect the nature of variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Third, to investigate how product and motivational related factors; attitudes, health involvement and perceived risk affect the nature of variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and fish consumption in the Sri Lankan context. In line with Hoyer and Ridgway (1984) proposed framework, a conceptual framework was developed with the constructs of variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> variety <b>seeking</b> tendency (related to food and personality), perceived behavioural control, attitudes, health involvement, perceived risk and fish consumption frequency to achieve the objectives. A questionnaire survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 250 consumers in Galle in Sri Lanka. The items used to measure the constructs were either taken or adopted from the previous research studies. Confirmatory factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling in AMOS 16. 0 were employed to analysis the data. This study found that variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> plays a vital role in fish consumption frequency among consumers. The findings confirmed the theory that variety seeking tendency as a general personality trait positively influences the variety seeking tendency related to food (VST Food) while specific VST Food showing a significant effect on fish consumption frequency. Health involvement was found to be positively significant with fish consumption frequency as well as with the VST Food while having an insignificant relationship with the variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Conveneinec/ availability, price/ value and knowledge were not significant indicators of perceived control. Nevertheless, PBC and perceived risk act as a barrier for variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However, the effect of perceive risk on the fish consumption frequency was negligible. Surprisingly, attitudes did not have a significant impact on either fish consumption frquency or variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The main reason for this is probably skewness of the data set. Practical implications drawn from this research are that fish marketers should tap the consumers’s intrinsic desire for variation through providing different fish species in to the market place. Further, it is suggested that providing information on the most commonly eaten fish species by the government authorities through mass media will reduce the perceived risk and PBC associated with variation of fish and stimulate the health involvement towards variation of fish consumption. This research has contributed to fill the gap in variety <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> literature in which specifically incorporating effect of both personal related and product/ motivational related factors. This research was based on a convenience sample of consumers which did not represent the whole population, thus the results could not generalize to Sri Lanka.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the connection between musicians’ information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and the creative process in music, providing a framework for understanding the role of information needs satisfaction in musical creativity. A number of studies in information science literature have been carried out attempting to model cognitive, affective, behavioural and contextual factors associated with music information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> However, only few studies have addressed the relationship between information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and musical creative activities such as composition, performance and improvisation, listening and analysis. Design/methodology/approach – The focus of this paper is to provide a framework for the study of information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> for the purposes of satisfying musical creativity information needs, combining the theoretical basis of an established model of information behaviour developed by Wilson and the theoretical perspectives of a music creative thinking model proposed by Webster. The key features of the two models are synthesized in a unified model of information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> for musical creativity and enriched with research findings identified in the literature of both musical information seeking and musical creativity. Findings – The proposed conceptual framework offers an integrated interpretation of the combinations of information needs, information resources and environmental/personal barriers, which enable musical creativity. In the authors’ approach “musical creativity” is treated as a musician’s aim or ambition or drive for expression and is influenced by the way musicians seek information for that purpose. Therefore, musical creativity is an intentional behaviour which acts as motivator for information seeking and is affected by the available information and the musician’s information seeking profile. The current study include three important findings: first, the design and development of music library and information services for musical creativity; second, the development of music information literacy skills for creativity; and third, the information seeking behavioural perspective for universal musical creativity, and the implications for cultural musical heritage diffusion around the world. Originality/value – An integrated information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> model which includes musical creativity is developed through the synthesis of two already existing approaches, that of Wilson for information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and that of Webster for creative thinking in music. The present conceptual study presents a three stage pattern or process for modelling information seeking for musical creativity: the process initiates with the intention-motivation for creativity, then proceeds to information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> and then concludes with the musical creativity outcomes. This is the first study that seeks to understand the relationships between creativity and information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the "extent of information desired" (EID) -scale through a behavioural approach. METHODS: Standardised interviews consisting of the EID-scale and four (half) open questions were conducted in a convenience sample of psychiatric in-patients and information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> was measured. At the same time, socially desirable behaviour was assessed by means of Marlowe-Crowne social desirability (MCSD). RESULTS: 39 patients were interviewed. The behavioural approach yielded mixed results, but there was no correlation between EID- and MCSD-scores. DISCUSSION: From the calculated correlations information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> is perceived as socially undesirable, whereas EID-scores seem unaffected by social desirability. CONCLUSION: It is difficult to define independent variables which would reflect information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour.</b> The ones we used might have been confounded. We found a correlation between the EID-scale used and the information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour,</b> without a strong correlation with social desirability. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The EID-scale used may predict patients' desire for information within a well-defined clinical context. The step to validation requires more robustness of the research model and a better profiling of patients. status: publishe...|$|R

Research approach – Five high and five low literate users of a local charity which provides social service information participated to carry out four online information seeking tasks. Data were captured using think-aloud, video, observation and semi structured interview techniques. A data analysis on the study previously discovered eight information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> strategies: Reading, Scanning, Focus, Satisfied, Verification, Recovery, Trajectories, Representation and Abandon. Several information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> models were evaluated prior to selecting Ellis (1989) information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> model which includes features such as: starting, chaining, browsing, differentiating, monitoring, extracting, verifying, and ending. The model {{is used as a}} theoretical lens to analyse the data combining with the previous findings to make interface design suggestions.

40|$|Information need" and "Information seeking behaviour" are two {{complementary}} concepts. Information need causes {{information seeking}} behaviour; {{as a result}} of this behaviour every information we reach causes new information needs. Information need and information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> are effected by many factors. One of the most important factors is the occupation of the individual, especially if the individual is a scholar. Because information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of scholars are determined their academic disciplines. In this research, the effects of occupation on information needs and information <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviours</b> of scholars are examined, and the differences between academic groups are emphasized. The findings of our research are also compared with the results of previous researches which had already taken their places in the literature. As a results of this comparison the similarities are identified, and at the end some recommendations which are based on the results of this research are made for information centers. The most important of these recommendations is the necessity for flexibility, in other words, the necessity of establishing information centers in order to meet the characteristics and needs of the users who use these centers. This research is based on comparative study; data have been collected through the analysis of literature, questionnaires and interview techniques.

40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether challenge <b>seeking</b> <b>behaviour</b> could be increased by stimulating persons with intellectual disability with music. The intention was also to evaluate whether the participants would attempt to seek challenges when they felt bored with a music experience. Method: Thirty adolescents and young adults with mild to moderate intellectual disability were randomly selected to take part in a repeated-measure experimental design, under three different conditions. In the first condition, the participants were provided adequate challenges through teaching fundamental musical skills. In the second condition, no optimal challenge was provided, and in the third condition, using special strategies, the participants were stimulated to look for novelty and challenge through involvement in creative musical tasks. Level of innovation, as an index of challenge seeking, was measured during the 8 minutes of free choice interval at the end of each condition.
