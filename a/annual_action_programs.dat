5000|$|His {{opinion in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), joined by no other justice in full, {{represented}} {{a compromise between}} the opinions of Justice William J. Brennan, who, joined by three other justices, would have upheld affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> under a lenient judicial test, and the opinion of John Paul Stevens, joined by three other justices, who would have struck down the affirmative <b>action</b> <b>program</b> at issue in the case under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Powell's opinion striking down the law urged [...] "strict scrutiny" [...] {{to be applied to}} affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> but hinted that some affirmative <b>action</b> <b>programs</b> might pass Constitutional muster. Powell, who dissented in the case of Furman v. Georgia (1972), striking down capital punishment statutes, was a key mover behind the Court's compromise opinion in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), which allowed the return of capital punishment but only with procedural safeguards.|$|R
