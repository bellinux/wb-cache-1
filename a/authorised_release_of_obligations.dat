40|$|Abstract. In the UK, {{research}} {{funded by}} the Environment Agency/English Nature has provided a series of spreadsheet-based assessment tools for calculating doses received by biota in coastal, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. The approach uses the reference organism concept where the organism of interest (feature species) is equated to a particular reference organism (based on its physical geometry and ecology). This paper describes the stages followed to collate additional species-, and site-, specific data and to undertake assessments to determine whether Natura 2000 sites are adequately protected from <b>authorised</b> <b>releases</b> <b>of</b> ionising radiation. The feature species used for the assessment were species listed under the EC Birds and Habitats Directives. The paper will describe the overall assessment process followed by the UK Environment Agency, demonstrating the staged assessment process adopted; how each feature species is mathematically aligned with the most appropriate reference organism geometry; and provide {{an example of the}} assessment conducted for the Natura 2000 sites located in the Humber Estuary, UK. 1...|$|R

40|$|Online at stacks. iop. org/JRP/ 21 / 337 Measurements of tritium (3 H) {{activity}} in marine {{species in the}} Severn Estuary (UK) show concentrations significantly above those predicted by standard models. Concentration factors of 104 between seawater and marine species are observed; standard models assume a concentration factor of 1. In addition, {{the vast majority of}} activity is present in the form of organically bound tritium (OBT). The critical group dose from tritium—to consumers of local flounder— is estimated as ∼ 36 µSv per annum. The measurements are related to the <b>authorised</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> wastes, via the sewer system, from the Amersham plc plant at Cardiff. The radiochemical plant manufactures a wide range of isotopically labelled compounds for use in life science research. The elevated levels of tritium observed in marine species have led to a programme of investigative work by specialist organisations. This paper describes the various definitions, measurements and significance of the term OBT. It also outlines the environmental observations and preliminary conclusions from the investigative programme to date. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Banovina {{came to an}} end {{together}} with Kingdom of Yugoslavia, following the invasion of Axis powers in April 1941. Šubašić joined Dušan Simović and his Yugoslav government-in-exile but, before leaving, he refused to <b>authorise</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> a large number of Croatian Communists and leftists arrested and kept in prisons under his supervision.

50|$|In 1970 Lamy was {{recruited}} {{to become the}} Assistant Film Commissioner of the NFB, making him Sydney Newmans deputy in {{the running of the}} organisation. As Newman spoke only English, Lamy took {{a leading role in the}} NFBs French language output; Québécois filmmakers dealt almost entirely with him. It was in this capacity that Lamy drew Newmans attention to potential problems with several politically sensitive French Canadian productions made around the time of the October Crisis, including Denys Arcands On est au coton, which Newman banned from distribution. When Lamy succeeded Newman as Government Film Commissioner in 1975 he <b>authorised</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> several of these same productions, feeling that enough time had elapsed since the October Crisis for their distribution to be a less sensitive matter.|$|R

50|$|In some jurisdictions, a deed {{of trust}} {{is used as}} an {{alternative}} to a mortgage. A deed of trust is not used to transfer property directly. It is commonly used in some states — California, for example — to transfer title to land to a “trustee”, usually a trust or title company, which holds the title as security ("in escrow") for a loan. When the loan is paid off, title is transferred to the borrower by recording a <b>release</b> <b>of</b> the <b>obligation,</b> and the trustee's contingent ownership is extinguished. Otherwise, upon default, the trustee will liquidate the property with a new deed and offset the lender's loss with the proceeds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the mission was to organize {{free and fair elections}} for a Constituent Assembly which would write a constitution for the nation. In preparation, a number of legal changes were demanded. On 12 June, AG Pienaar proclaimed a general amnesty for Namibians living abroad, and repealed or amended 56 discriminatory laws. [...] He also <b>authorised</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> political prisoners and captured combatants, who were resettled under UNTAG's supervision. SWAPO was also required to <b>release</b> captured members <b>of</b> South African security forces. Both SWAPO and South Africa claimed that the other side continued to hold prisoners, accusations repeatedly denied by each. Alleged detention locations were searched by UNTAG personnel and the lists of missing persons were examined and eventually reduced to just over 300 unaccounted for individuals. Refugees were also assisted after the amnesty. Many were airlifted into the country, registered, and given aid. [...] The repatriation and resettlement of refugees {{was one of the most}} widely celebrated and successful functions of UNTAG, while the conflict over the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> prisoners was one of the most difficult.|$|R
5000|$|Panzer Elite was {{developed}} by Wings Simulation and first published by Wing's parent company Psygnosis in 1999. This first version was v.1.05 and was considered very buggy, especially in multiplayer. A subsequent v.1.1 patch made it tolerable. During 2000, Psygnosis moved away from PC gaming and sold Wings and Panzer Elite to Jowood Productions. In 2001, Jowood <b>authorised</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> Panzer Elite Special Edition ("PESE"). This was Panzer Elite with an additional CD containing exclusive content developed by community members with names like the Lennort Brothers and Aldo. During 2002, patch 1.2 was released by the Lennort Brothers which brought first real multiplayer stability to Panzer Elite. PESE continues to be extremely well supported by a very active modding community called the Panzer Elite Development Group. This ongoing version of Panzer Elite is widely considered the leading and benchhmark WW2 Tank Simulator.

40|$|Alternative Provision, as a sector, is well {{positioned}} to offer a remarkable opportunity to cultivate a young personâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s humanity through care and challenge. Where practitioners embrace responsibility for young people and their environment, and honour context and complexity, they can mobilise the present as {{a rich source of}} possibility and agency. There needs to be a clear understanding of the contribution that Alternative Provision can make to young peopleâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s lives and how this relates to practice and policy perceptions of effectiveness. Yet because it is difficult to know, track, manage and regulate, Alternative Provision remains largely uninspected and unregulated, with lack of clarity in purpose holding back the potential to inspire change in pupil perception and experience. On top of these issues, schools face the challenge of being held directly accountable for Alternative Provision they commission for their pupils, and responsible for ensuring that it is suitable, safe and effective. Research into current practice and theory is needed to help schools and policy makers fulfil their mandates at a time when policy makers are at the cusp of re-designing the field. At these key beginnings of re-design for Alternative Provision in England, this ethnographic study offers to fill that research gap through a conceptualisation of practitioner approaches in one Alternative Provision site over an academic year, that led to pupil well-being, a sense of belonging and further training or employment. These outcomes, alongside the practitioner approaches of mutually transforming empathic engagement and mission, I argue, are central to sound thinking about Alternative Provision. The process involved â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 licensed chaos â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 with its <b>authorised</b> <b>release</b> <b>of</b> pupils into play, immersion, risk taking and ownership, is presented as one way of embodying this journey and is offered here as a model of process on which other schools could build their own. Methodological contributions are made through the exploration of life writing as ontology and as a way of communicating the ever-present realities for many pupils attending Alternative Provision. Critical reflection and acknowledgement of the researcherâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s role and transformation through the research process is shared. Reciprocal virtual ethnography is explored and put forward as an effective means of researching young people in Alternative Provision. This thesis tells a story of lives and learning that further humanises and empowers the field of Alternative Provision and its commissioning schools...|$|R
5000|$|Delerue {{composed}} {{the music for}} five of the films made by the noted British director Jack Clayton. Their first collaboration was The Pumpkin Eater (1964), followed by Our Mother's House (1967). In 1982 they reunited for the Disney film version of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes, but the production was fraught with problems. Unhappy with the sinister tone of Clayton's original cut, the studio {{took control of the}} film, and held it back from release for over a year, reportedly spending an additional $5 million on re-editing the film, cutting some scenes and replacing them with newly-shot footage, with the aim of making the film more commercial and 'family-friendly'. To Delerue's great disappointment, Disney also insisted on the removal of his original music (which was considered 'too dark'), and they replaced it with a new, 'lighter' score by American composer James Horner. Speaking later about the rejection of his score, Delerue said: [...] "It was extremely painful ... because it was probably the most ambitious score I wrote in the United-States." [...] Delerue's music for the film was only available to collectors in low-quality bootleg copies until 2011, when Disney <b>authorised</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> approximately 30 minutes of music, sourced from Delerue's personal tape copy of the score (which originally ran for over an hour). This was issued by Universal France (along with Delerue's music for the 1991 film Regarding Henry) in a limited edition of 3000 CDs, as the inaugural <b>release</b> <b>of</b> its [...] "Ecoutez le Cinema!" [...] soundtrack series. Despite this disappointment, Delerue worked with Clayton twice more, on his last feature film, The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987), and Clayton's final screen project, a feature length BBC TV adaptation of Muriel Spark's Memento Mori (1992), which aired just a month after Delerue's death.|$|R
