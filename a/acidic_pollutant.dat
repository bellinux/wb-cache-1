In 1985, this neutrophytic and nutrient-loving lichen species was very poorly developed in both towns {{due to the}} <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutant</b> gases. The following increase was hesitant in 1995. Measuring units that were occupied in 1985 remained without evidence of the species in 1995, {{even though it was}} found in other units. In 2005, it had established itself in many areas, and the frequency at the examined trees was increased significantly. The well-known preference of X. parietina for higher pH manifests itself clearly in Wetzlar. From the beginning of the study, it preferred the lime dust-affected north of the town, and its distribution pattern was complementary to that of the previously described acidophytes H. physodes and L. conizaeoides. In 2010, both in Wetzlar and Giessen, the number of populated areas increased in comparison to 2005 again, and their frequency on the trees rose. Other indicators of hypertrophication like X. candelaria, X. polycarpa, Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Physcia adscendens and P. tenella increased considerably in this period. Typical of these species is that they emerged first in the north of Wetzlar near the lime dust emitters due to their high bark pH claims.|$|E

The system comprises three components: a GIS network module, a remote sensing evapotranspiration module and a spatio-temporal module. With these components and their functions, {{the system is}} well suited for agricultural drainage analysis and management. This paper focuses on the applications of IDNAS for practical acid drainage evaluation and management in a sugarcane filed in Australia, which are of increasing concern for land and environmental management for the sugar industry and other estuary land users. Two case studies of the system are presented. One is on the acidic pollution estimation which evaluates the extend of acidity and the contributing areas. Another one is on the simulation of acid outflow events and prediction {{of the amount of}} <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutant</b> brought into the river system associated with significant rainfall events. The results of these case studies can be used for efficient assessment of acid control practice and for development of better management policies.

30|$|The use of lichens as bioindicators {{to assess}} air {{pollution}} {{has been a}} long tradition in Europe. Nevertheless, there are rare long-term mappings of lichens under standardized conditions. Comparative assessments of the air pollution situation are also hardly possible; as in previous studies, different methods have been observed, and the transfer to modern, regulated and standardized methods[1] fails as the original data are no longer available. The towns of Central Hesse, Giessen and Wetzlar, represent a positive exception from these points: they have been mapped repeatedly at irregular intervals since 1970, and the original survey data of the respective investigations are still available. In our study areas, the surveys were not all conducted using the same methodology. Thus, in the first mapping in 1970 for example, it was only distinguished whether crustose, foliose or fruticose lichens could be found on the studied trees[2, 3]. Therefore, we can only make a statement about those areas where only crustose lichens occurred, which at that time was almost exclusively the acid-enduring and toxitolerant species of Lecanora conizaeoides. The sole occurrence of this species indicates, by the standards of today's Association of German Engineers (VDI) guideline interpretation, an extremely high immission load with <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutant</b> gases - primarily SO 2. Besides the recording of the lichen vegetation from 1970 in Giessen and 1985 in Wetzlar, measurements of the pH of the bark of the mapped trees were made, so that, in this case, a comparison with our current studies of 2010 was possible[4 – 7].|$|E

Although acidic components (SO 2 and NO 2) significantly offset the CO 2 enhancement, the aboveground yield increased considerably when the concentration of pollutants was moderate (200 times dilution). Our results indicate that using excess CO 2 from the power plant emissions to optimize growth in commercial green house could be viable. Full Tex...|$|R

Previous reduced-form approximations to the MAGIC model are discussed in detail, and their drawbacks are highlighted. An improved reduced-form model for acid neutralizing capacity is presented, which incorporates long-term depletion of the watershed acid neutralization fraction. In addition, improved fish biota models are incorporated in the integrated assessment model, which includes reduced-form models for other physical and chemical processes of acid deposition, as well as the resulting socio-economic and health related effects.

These airmasses are responsible for export and import of pollutants depositing in nearby states. Trajectory analysis revealed that soil is contributed by the dust storms coming from Oman through Gulf and Iran, while most of black carbon (BC) sources are located in India. A detailed review of trajectories associated with wet deposition events indicated that airmasses coming from Europe and Middle East carry high concentration of <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants</b> which are deposited in Himalayan ranges. Similarly, trajectory analysis revealed that <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants</b> from continental anthropogenic sources are transported to an ecosensitive site in Western Ghats in India and the outward fluxes of anthropogenic activities of Indo-Gangetic region are transported towards Bay of Bengal.

A role of Cl− ions is also hypothesized [93, 245]. The formation mechanism of black discolouration products [plattnerite (PbO 2) and galena (PbS)] was recently investigated: no plattnerite could be detected in artificial ageing tests, while the natural ageing of fresco red lead samples yielded calcite CaCO 3, minium Pb 3 O 4, plattnerite PbO 2, anglesite PbSO 4 and gypsum CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O, with the minium grains being gradually converted to alteration products (plattnerite and anglesite) via a sulphation step followed by solvolytic disproportionation [237, 242]. Plattnerite might be formed if <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants</b> attack the paint layer [242]; or when biological colonization is present [238].

We provide a broad overview of some of the changes that have occurred in affected species, using biological records collected by national recording schemes to illustrate the various effects of air pollution; we also review the direct and indirect impacts of air pollutants on these groups.

40|$|The {{results of}} recent {{controlled}} environment and micrometeorological measure- ments of NH 3 fluxes are presented {{to highlight the}} processes controlling NH 3 plant-atmosphere exchange. The presence of NH+ in leaf tissues results {{in the existence of}} an NH 3 'compensation point' concentration for substomatal tissues (Xs), so that both emission and deposition are possible from stomata. In addition, NH 3 may deposit efficiently on to leaf cuticles, short-circuiting any stomatal emis- sion, so that a 'canopy compensation point' (Xc) may be defined that is smaller than Xs. Ammonia is generally deposited to nitrogen limited ecosystems, indi- cating a small Xs and small leaf cuticle resistance (Rw). In contrast, fluxes over croplands are typically bidirectional and may reflect a larger Xs as a consequence of greater N supply. The paper discusses the processes defining Rw (humidity, <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants)</b> and Xs (plant phenology, species, N nutrition) and proposes a new resistance approach, which integrates Xs and Rw into one model. Estimating long term bidirectional NH 3 fluxes is still uncertain, though it is now possible to apply a single model concept to a range of ecosystem types and satisfactorily infer NH 3 fluxes over diurnal time scales...|$|R
30|$|The {{development}} of the frequency of L. conizaeoides is shown in Figure 11. This toxitolerant and strongly acidophytic species shows the decrease of acid emissions at best. In Wetzlar {{as well as in}} Giessen, it was the most common - and sometimes only - lichen at times of high SO 2 pollution. Until 1995, its frequency declined due to the reduction of sulfur dioxide. However, this happened in Wetzlar much more strongly than in Giessen. In 2005, L. conizaeoides could hardly be found in Wetzlar, and the further decline is also visible in Giessen; in 2010, it had virtually disappeared. The behavior of this lichen correlates very well with the reduction of SO 2 concentration in the period shown here (Figure 5). The stronger decline of the species in Wetzlar can be interpreted as follows: in 1985, the concentration of SO 2 was still so high that the basic lime dust could hardly reduce the effect of bark acidification. With the following decline of <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants,</b> the pH of the tree bark increased more quickly due to the more effective neutralizing of the limestone dust.

In the last decade an intense research {{was focused on the}} elaboration of well tuned TiO 2 photocatalysts with the basic idea to understand the relationship between exposed facet and reactivity. In this work, four TiO 2 morphologies are examined namely: nanotubes (NT), nanoplates (NPL), nanorods (NR) and nanospheres (NS). The solar photocatalytic properties are compared in the disinfection of a Fusarium solani inoculated solution. Disinfection using the solar light has been studied and the effect of formic acid (FA) was examined. We demonstrated, for the first time, that the solar inactivation of the resistant spores of Fusarium in water is related to the exposed TiO 2 facets. At very low concentration of photocatalyst, the inactivation of F. solani over TiO 2 nanospheres shows the best disinfection efficiency with respect to the others morphologies. Experiments on simultaneous photocatalytic decontamination of FA and inactivation of F. solani showed that the presence of FA strongly retards the disinfection reaction in the case of TiO 2 nanospheres while the FA degradation occurred simultaneously with F. solani inactivation in the case of TiO 2 NT.

In this work we develop a method for titrating micro-scale (30 µl) volumes {{and use it to}} study fluid secreted by the human airway epithelial cell line Calu- 3, a widely used model for submucosal gland serous cells. Microtitration curves revealed that HCO 3 - is the major buffer. Peak buffer capacity (β) increased from 17 to 28 mM/pH during forskolin stimulation, and was reduced by > 50 % in fluid secreted by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) -deficient Calu- 3 monolayers, confirming an important role of CFTR in HCO 3 - secretion. Back-titration with NaOH revealed non-volatile buffer capacity due to proteins synthesized and released by the epithelial cells. Lysozyme and mucin concentrations were too low to buffer Calu- 3 fluid significantly, however model titrations of porcine gastric mucins at concentrations near the sol-gel transition suggest that mucins may contribute to the buffer capacity of ASL in vivo. We conclude that CFTR-dependent HCO 3 - secretion and epithelially-derived proteins are the predominant buffers in Calu- 3 secretions...|$|R

The China-Japan acid rain problem {{is an interesting}} case of unidirectional transboundary pollution which has received little attention in the economics literature. We construct a simple model to highlight the key incentives underlying environmental policy making in each country. We examine simultaneous and sequential noncooperative games to illustrate the shortcomings of decentralized policy making. Sequentiality seems to be important, since one may interpret China’s disposition against limiting its sulfur dioxide emissions {{as a sign of}} policy leadership vis-à-vis Japan. Motivated by the inefficiency of decentralized behavior, we design international schemes under which an international agency (IA) is in charge of implementing income transfers from Japan to China. Participation in each scheme is voluntary. We show that the proposed international schemes are Pareto efficient and implementable. We als o show that policy leadership play no role in the allocation of resources when the IA is a common follower.

Transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry was used to analyze morphology, composition, size, and mixing state of individual SSA at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in summertime. Individual fresh SSA contained cubic NaCl coated by certain amounts of MgCl 2 and CaSO 4. Individual partially aged SSA contained irregular NaCl coated by a mixture of NaNO 3, Na 2 SO 4, Mg(NO 3) 2, and MgSO 4. The comparison suggests the hydrophilic MgCl 2 coating in fresh SSA likely intrigued the heterogeneous reactions at the beginning of SSA and acidic gases. Individual fully aged SSA normally had Na 2 SO 4 cores and an amorphous coating of NaNO 3. Elemental mappings of individual SSA particles revealed that as the particles ageing Cl gradually decreased, the C, N, O, and S content increased. 12 C - mapping from nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry indicates that organic matter increased in the aged SSA compared with the fresh SSA. 12 C - line scan further shows that organic matter was mainly concentrated on the aged SSA surface. These new findings indicate that this mixture of organic matter and NaNO 3 on particle surfaces likely determines their hygroscopic and optical properties. These abundant SSA as reactive surfaces adsorbing inorganic and organic acidic gases can shorten acidic gas lifetime and influence the possible gaseous reactions in the Arctic atmosphere, which need to be incorporated into atmospheric chemical models in the Arctic troposphere...|$|R

On the basis of a dendrological record from 1850 to 1998, our analyses support a decline in radial growth starting as early as the 1940 s through to the 1970 s; in the 1970 s there was a reversal of this decline. In comparing trees near ridges (2000 m) with those in draws (1500 m), we found differences in the (a) timing of the decline, (b) rate of decline, and (c) homogeneity of the decline, with trees near ridges showing earlier, faster, and more homogeneous declines than trees in draws. We hypothesized that changes in climatic conditions and/or atmospheric pollutants, both of which changed beyond ranges of natural variability, were related to the observed decline in radial growth. In trees near ridges, up to 67. 1 % of changes in radial growth could be explained by a combination of climatic conditions (7. 6 %) and annual emissions of nitric oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) (an additional 59. 5 %). In trees from draws, up to 38. 3 % of the changes in radial growth could be explained by climatic conditions only.

The studies focused on the evaluation of suitable plants, the associated thermal benefits, and air quality changes arising from the installation. For the study on suitable plants, the estimated daily atmospheric water deficit experienced showed that plants experienced irregular periods of depleted water in the root zone, hence pointing to the need to use drought tolerant plants even under humid tropical conditions. The evaluation of environmental benefits compared conditions on the roof before and after the installation of the green roofs. The green roofs installed significantly reduced the amount of visible radiation recorded on the facades of residential apartment blocks directly facing the multi-storey carpark, thereby reducing glare and improving visual comfort of the occupants.

Several variables were measured in different horizons of the podzolic soil polluted by emissions from local sources in areas of several thousands of square kilometres. Alkalinization dominates the processes in the soil, since sulphur is absorbed only in small quantities and Ca is much better absorbed. Ca content in humus horizon may rise even to 100 000 mg kg-’ and the pH of originally very acidic soil may rise to 8. 3. Total aluminum (Al) content was high in the heavily polluted plots, since emissions contain much Al. On the other hand, the exchangeable Al was very low in these alkaline sites.

Ongoing climate change is affecting degradation rates and risks [22]. Damage due to air pollution typically develops in synergy with light and humidity exposure, which is easier to observe [23, 24]. Air pollution can be a critical factor in some situations. A typical example is the outdoor formation of black crusts on calcareous stone due to acidic-sulfuric impact and soot deposition [25, 26].

Where salvage is not feasible, mortality in the standing stock tends to reduce the current supply and renders its overall change indeterminate. Endogenous soil protection is then introduced. It is shown that the anticipated damage justifies measures to alleviate site degradation. Consequently, short-run supply is ambiguously effected. The paper concludes by considering the impacts of pollution on the long-run steady state supply. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acidic</b> air <b>pollutants</b> {{generally}} are dissolved in water droplets. Mean droplet diameter may range {{from more than}} 10 jm in dense fog to less than 1 gm at low relative humidity. Droplet size influences the deposition of inhaled acid within the respiratory tract and thus may influence toxicity. To help assess health risks from acid pollution, we performed controlled exposures of normal and asthmatic volunteers to sulfuric acid aerosols at nominal concentrations of 0 (control), 500, 1000, and 2000 jg/M 3. Exposures lasted 1 hr with intermittent heavy exercise. Response was assessed by lung function tests and symptom questionnaires. Under foggy conditions (mean droplet size 10 jim, temperature 500 F), no marked effects on lung function were found. However, both normal and asthmatic subjects showed statistically significant dose-related increases in respiratory symptoms. In a separate study, normal subjects exposed at 700 F with mean droplet size 0. 9 jim showed no marked effect on function or symptoms. Asthmatics showed dose-related decrements in forced expiratory performance and increases in symptoms, most obvious at 1000 and 2000 jg/M 3. The different results of the two studies probably reflect an influence of droplet size, but further investigation is needed to confirm this. The aggregate results suggest that only mild, if any, short-term respiratory irritant effects are likely at acid concentrations attained in ambient pollution...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of activated carbons (ACs) involves two main steps: the carbonization of the carbonaceous {{of raw materials}} at temperatures below 1073 K {{in the absence of}} oxygen and the activation had realized at the temperature up to 1173 but the most useful temperature at 1073 K. In our study we used the most common industrial and consumer solid waste, namely PET, alone or blended with other synthetic polymer PAN. By mixing the two polymers in different ratios, an improvement of the yield of the AC production was found and some textural properties were enhanced by comparison with the AC prepared using each polymer separately. When all the samples were exposed through the carbonization process with a pyrolysis the mixture of PAN-PET (1 : 1 w/w) yield around 31. 9 %, between that obtained with PET (16. 9 %) or PAN (42. 6 %) separately. The combine activation, with CO 2 at 1073 K, allow ACs with a lower burn-off degree isothermally, when compared with those attained with PET or PAN alone, but with similarly chemicals or textural properties. The resultant ACs are microporous in their nature, as the activation time increase, the PET-PAN mixture AC are characterized by a better developed porous structure, when associated with the AC prepared from PAN. The AC prepared from PET-PAN mixture are characterized by basic surface characteristics, with a pHpzc around 10. 5, which is an important characteristic for future applications on <b>acidic</b> <b>pollutants</b> removals from liquid or gaseous phase. In this study we had used the FTIR methods to determine the main functional groups in the surface of the activated carbons. The adsorbents prepared from PAN fibres presents an IR spectrum with similar characteristics to those obtained with PET wastes, but with fewer peaks and bands with less intensity, in particular for the PAN- 8240 sample. This can be reflected by the stretching and deformation modes of NH bond in the range 3100 – 3300 cm- 1 and 1520 – 1650 cm- 1, respectively. Also, stretching mode associated to C–N, C=N, can contributed to the profile of IR spectrum around 1170 cm- 1, 1585 – 1770 cm- 1. And the TGA methods was used to study the loses of the precursors mass according to the excessive of the temperature. The results showed that, there were different decreasing of the mass of each precursors. PAN degradation started at almost 573 K and at 1073 K, PAN preserve more than 40 % of the initial mass. PET degradation started at 650 K, but at 1073 K, it has lost 80 % of the initial mass. However, the mixture of PET-PAN (1 : 1 w/w) showed a thermogravimetric profile between the two polymers tested individually, with a final mass slightly less than 30 %. From a chemical point of view, the carbonisation of PET mainly occurs in one step between 650 and 775 K...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} fogs {{in industrialized}} cities are contaminated by <b>acidic</b> air <b>pollutants.</b> In Brussels, Belgium, the pH of polluted fogwater {{may be as}} low as 3 with osmolarity as low as 30 mOsm. In order to explore short-term respiratory effects of a realistic acid-polluted fog, we collected samples of acid fog in Brussels, Belgium, which is a densely populated and industrialized city, we defined characteristics of this fog and exposed asthmatic volunteers at rest through a face mask to fogs with physical and chemical characteristics {{similar to those of}} natural fogs assessed in this urban area. Fogwater was sampled using a screen collector where droplets are collected by inertial impaction and chemical content of fogwater was assessed by measurement of conductivity, pH, visible colorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry over a period of one year. The fogwater composition was dominated by NH 4 + and SO 4 - ions. First we evaluated the possible effect of fog acidity alone. For this purpose 14 subjects with asthma were exposed at rest for 1 hr [mass median aerodynamic diameter to a large-particle (MMAD), 9 microns] aerosol with H 2 SO 4 concentration of 500 micrograms/m 3 (pH 2. 5) and osmolarity of 300 mOsm. We did not observe significant change in pulmonary function or bronchial responsiveness to metacholine. In {{the second part of the}} work, 10 asthmatic subjects were exposed to acid fog (MMAD, 7 microns) containing sulfate and ammonium ions (major ions recovered in naturally occurring fogs) with pH 3. 5 and osmolarity 30 mOsm. Again, pulmonary function and bronchial reactivity were not modified after inhalation of this fog. It was concluded that short-term exposure to acid fog reproducing acidity and hypoosmolarity of natural polluted fogs does not induce bronchoconstriction and does not change bronchial responsiveness in asthmatics.

40|$|International audienceThe {{adsorption}} of aromatic compounds (nitrophenols, nitroaniline, chlorophenols, chloroanilines) {{present in}} wastewater using dealuminated faujasite zeolite has been investigated. The adsorption capacity of faujasite zeolite {{depends on the}} pH, (the neutral form of the pollutants is more easily adsorbed into zeolite than the dissociated form), and on the solubility in water of the aromatic compounds. The adsorption capacity {{for a family of}} compounds increases with decreasing water solubility. In this study, we have shown that the <b>pollutant</b> <b>acidic</b> character enhances their adsorption into the zeolite. Thus, the changeover of phenol to aniline decreases the adsorbent-adsorbate interaction, {{as well as in the}} substitution of the NO(2) group by a Cl group. The adsorption data was analyzed using the Fowler-Guggenheim isotherm. The sorption mechanism of nitrophenol in faujasite zeolite was investigated using Raman spectroscopy and through a thermodesorption kinetic study. The relative affinity of the phenolic compounds toward the surface of the dealuminated faujasite was related to the electron donor-acceptor complex formed between the basic sites on the zeolite (oxygen) and the hydrogens (acidic site) of the aromatic ring and of the phenols and anilines functions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{characterize}} the chemical composition, size distributions, and fractional Fe solubility of atmospheric particles over Asian marginal seas, South Indian Ocean and Australian coast, selected water–soluble inorganic and organic species in aerosols and precipitation, trace metals and soluble Fe in aerosols {{were analyzed by}} multi–instruments. Results showed that sea salt and non–sea–salt sulfate (nss–SO 42 –) were the main components in aerosols. Over Asian marginal seas, Cl– and Na+ were the dominant ions in precipitation, accounting for ˜; 72 % of the total ions. Both SO 42 – and NO 3 – accounted for − 26 % of the total anions, controlling the acidity of the precipitation. Non–sea–salt Ca 2 + (nss–Ca 2 +) accounted for 6. 9 % of the total cations, dominating the neutralizing component in rainwater. Observed methane sulfonate (MSA) concentrations and MSA/nss–SO 42 – increased southward. The concentrations of sea salt were affected by wind speeds, which was mainly accumulated in particle size > 10 μm. Particle size distributions of nss–SO 42 – and NH 4 + mainly peaked in the fine mode, while NO 3 – was mainly accumulated in the coarse mode. Oxalate presented a bimodal size distribution pattern in both fine and coarse modes. Based on the air mass back trajectories, enrichment factors and Fe/Al, V/Al ratios, aerosol samples collected over Asian marginal seas could be affected by both long–range transported dust and anthropogenic emissions. Good relationship was found between total dissolved iron and nss–SO 42 –, indicating that acid processing during long–range transport could {{play an important role}} in fractional iron solubility in aerosols. The inverse relationship between atmospheric total Fe and fractional Fe solubility fitted in the global–scale trend. This study implicates that dust and <b>acidic</b> air <b>pollutants</b> from continental sources can interact and affect iron solubility in aerosols in the marine atmosphere. However, due to the small size of samples in this study, more investigations need to be conducted in future...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether enhanced dry deposition of <b>acidic</b> atmospheric <b>pollutants</b> by broadleaf woodland expansion could increase the potential for acidification of surface waters in acid-sensitive areas. Dry sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition was modelled with the Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange (FRAME) model using a roughness length value calculated specifically for birchwoods. Two scenarios were investigated for an acid-sensitive area in Scotland where broadleaf woodland expansion, mainly as birchwood, is occurring: (1) 2002 emissions and broadleaf woodland cover of 5. 6 %; (2) 2020 projected emissions and broadleaf cover of 29 %. The roughness length calculated for birch with Raupach's simplified drag-partition model was 0. 73 m, lower than the value of 1. 0 m for conifers which is the default for forest land cover in FRAME. Modelled dry S and N deposition increased between 2002 and 2020 from 8. 7 to 29 x 10 (- 3) keq ha(- 1) year(- 1) of H(+). However, modelled total dry and wet non-marine S and N deposition decreased during the same period from 1070 to 682 x 10 (- 3) keq ha(- 1) year(- 1) of H(+) due to the lower projected emissions in 2020 and the dominance of wet deposition in the remote and upland study area (mean annual rainfall 2275 mm). The modelled total non-marine S and N deposition was used to calculate streamwater critical loads exceedance with the First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model for five catchments in the study area. The modelled deposition for both the 2002 and 2020 scenarios was less than the calculated streamwater critical loads so the catchments were not considered at risk of streamwater acidification under the projected future emissions and increased broadleaf woodland cover. Nevertheless, broadleaf expansion could pose a greater risk of acidification in acid-sensitive areas with lower rainfall, closer to pollutant sources, where dry deposition accounts for a higher proportion of total S and N deposition.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gaseous air <b>pollutants,</b> <b>acidic</b> {{deposition}} and mineral deficiency {{on the gas}} exchange of trees are reviewed, and published data which illustrate important responses are described in detail. Data are presented which show that mixtures of SO 2 plus NO 2 can decrease photosynthesis in Betula pendula, that ambient pollutant concentrations (especially O 3) tend to increase stomatal conductance of Populus deltoides X Populus nigra {{in the early part}} of the day for young growing leaves and throughout the day for mature leaves, and that simulated acid rain (pH 2. 8) can cause temporary increases of stomatal conductance. Data for forest sites indicate that ambient concentrations of gaseous air pollution are sufficient to alter the gas exchange of woody plants (Fagus sylvatica, Populus deltoides X Populus nigra, Picea sitchensis and Picea abies). Both inhibitions and stimulations of stomatal conductance have been observed, often associated with no effect or small depressions of photosynthesis. The link between stomatal response to gaseous pollutants and growth effects remains unclear. Initial exposure to wet deposited sulphates and nitrates often leads to stomatal opening while longterm exposure results in closure. Soil-mediated effects may be cumulative and operate via effects on nutrient supply and thus mesophyll characteristics and phloem loading...|$|R
