40|$|AbstractDuring recombination, when Escherichia coli RecA mediates {{annealing}} across DNA repeats, Watson–Crick chemistry {{can only}} specify the complementarity of pairing, {{but not the}} most optimal frame of alignment. We describe that although stochastic alignments across poly(dA) and poly(dT) can lead to sub-optimally annealed duplexes containing ssDNA gaps/overhangs, the same are realigned into an optimal frame by a putative motor activity of RecA [Sen et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 10196 – 10206]. In the present study, we analyze the nature of realignment intermediates in real time, by employing a fluorescent probe, 2 -aminopurine (2 AP), which can not only report the status of RecA on the unstacked duplex, but also the fluidity of bases in such a filament. Although known to display a lower affinity for duplex DNA, RecA seems to remain functionally associated with these sub-optimally <b>aligned</b> <b>repeat</b> duplexes, until the realignment approaches completion. Moreover, a comparison of 2 AP fluorescence in repeat versus mixed sequences indicates that bases in a RecA repetitive DNA filament exhibit higher degrees of freedom that might mediate a ‘non-planar hydrogen bonding cross talk’ across the bases on either strand. We discuss a model to explain the mechanistic basis of realignment and its implications in signaling the end of homology maximization, which triggers RecA fall off...|$|R

Methods: A new implementation of the dynamic time warping is applied to compute a warp-average of the single trials. The trilinear modeling method is applied to ®lter the single trials prior to alignment. Alignment is based on normalized signals and their estimated derivatives. These features reduce the misalignment due to aligning the random alpha waves, explaining amplitude differences in latency differences, or the seemingly small amplitudes of some components.

40|$|Nanog is a {{transcription}} factor that plays {{a central part}} in the gene regulatory network that maintains and induces pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the molecular basis by which Nanog achieves its functions is not fully understood. At the centre of C-terminal domain of Nanog a tryptophan repeat (WR) is located, comprising 10 penta-peptide repeats each starting with a tryptophan. A mutant form of Nanog (Nanog-W 10 A) in which all 10 tryptophan residues have been substituted by alanine has an impaired capacity to drive LIF-independent self-renewal and a reduced efficiency in reprogramming primed epiblast stem cells to naïve pluripotency. To understand how the WR contributes to Nanog function, Nanog-W 10 A-ERT 2 was introduced into Nanog null cells. Upon hydroxytamoxifen addition, the Nanog-ERT 2 fusion proteins were detected on chromatin within 1 hour, allowing a comparison of genome-wide transcriptional responses to Nanog and Nanog-W 10 A by microarray. When treated with LIF, Nanog-W 10 A can activate most of Nanog targets as efficiently as Nanog. In contrast, Nanog-W 10 A did not efficiently repress most Nanog targets, including Otx 2 and Tcf 15 that were previously suggested to prime ESCs for differentiation. The microarray experiments performed {{in the absence of}} LIF signalling showed that Nanog and LIF co-regulate an extensive list of targets, including Klf 4 and Mras. When LIF is absent, wildtype Nanog can still activate pro-self-renewal factors, including Esrrb and repress differentiation-priming factor, such as Tcf 15 and Otx 2. In contrast, in the absence of LIF, the activation of pro-self-renewal factors Klf 4 and Mras is reduced. In addition, activation of Esrrb by Nanog-W 10 A induction delays but does not prevent differentiation. These effects allow the de-repression of Otx 2 and Tcf 15 by Nanog-W 10 A to dominate. Therefore, the function of Nanog is not only mediated by the activation of pro-self-renewal genes, but also repression of pro-differentiation signals. The functional significance of the repression of Nanog targets was further exemplified by the robust capacity of Otx 2 to dominate over the self-renewal signals and to drive differentiation. The Otx 2 protein is a direct interacting partner of Nanog that binds the Nanog WR tryptophan residues. The previously identified Otx 2 “tail domain” comprises two imperfectly <b>aligned</b> <b>repeats</b> and aromatic residues of each <b>repeat</b> <b>align</b> with aromatic residues of the Sox 2 “SXS/TY” motif previously identified to mediate the interaction between Sox 2 and Nanog. Aromatic residues of Otx 2 were demonstrated to directly interact with both Nanog and Sox 2. The interactions between Otx 2, Nanog and Sox 2 are essential for Otx 2 functions in driving ESCs differentiation, as Otx 2 mutants with alanine substitutions of the aromatic residues in both or either of the repeats have reduced efficiency to drive differentiation. As Nanog and Sox 2 may co-occupy many loci important in maintaining ESC self-renewal, Otx 2 may be able to “read” the Nanog/Sox 2 co-binding sites to dissolve the pluripotent networks. In summary, the repression function of Nanog is located within the Nanog WR region and represents an important module of Nanog in fine-tuning the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. This module involving Nanog WR can also be recognised by differentiation-priming factor Otx 2 and may represent an initial step during the exit of differentiation...|$|R

The object of this research programme {{was to investigate the}} stability of a silty clay under undrained <b>repeated</b> loading. <b>Equipment</b> has been designed and developed for the application of a quasi-sinusoidal compressive load form to triaxial samples. A series of monotonic strain controlled triaxial tests with pore pressure measurement was performed on normally consolidated and overconsolidated samples of saturated reconstituted Keuper Marl. These tests defined the critical state parameters, and hence the stable state boundary surface for this soil, and provided a basis for a comparison with the results of cyclic stress controlled triaxial tests. Two series of cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed: firstly, single stage tests using a constant level of repeated stress; and secondly, multistage tests. These aimed to investigate: a) stress conditions at failure under cyclic loading; b) strength of non-failed samples after cyclic loading; and c) strain and pore pressure behaviour under repeated loading. Criteria for the stability of a soil under cyclic loading are presented and a model is developed based on the pore pressure behaviour of the soil under repeated loading.

Intense blue colonies on ORSAB presumptively confirmed MRSA. Antibiotic sensitivity tests using 15 antibiotics revealed that the isolate was resistant against Amikacin 30 μg (AK 30), Amoxicillin 25 μg (AML 25), Methicillin 10 μg (MET 10), Oxacillin 1 μg (OX 1) Streptomycin 10 μg (S 10), and Tetracycline 10 μg (TE 10) while being intermediately resistant Oxacillin (OX 1) and susceptible to other antibiotics tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the isolate was 8 μg/mL. However, detection of the resistance gene mecA was proved negative.

40|$|AbstractThe animo acid {{sequence}} of dystrophin {{indicates that the}} molecule has globular N- and C-terminal domains separated by a long central rod domain. The central rod contains multiple repeats, about 100 amino acids long and of variable length. These diverge sufficiently in sequence that, in previous studies, only 14 of the most similar <b>repeats</b> have been <b>aligned</b> and analysed in any detail. We show here that a heptad pattern of hydrophobic residues is preserved across all repeats. Using the heptad pattern together with a consensus sequence template, we identified and <b>aligned</b> 25 <b>repeats</b> in the dystrophin rod sequence. Each repeat consists of a constant-length core helix of 54 residues, coupled via a short linker to a weakly conserved variable-length helix, and then via a second linker to the next core. The variable-length helix appears truncated in repeats 10 and 13 and extended in repeats 4 and 20. The extension of repeat 20 is particularly interesting since it corresponds to a hotspot of dystrophy-inducing mutations. Detailed modelling suggests that the classical Speicher-Marchesi [(1984) Nature 311, 177 - 180] model for spectrin may not be appropriate to dystrophin without some modification. We propose that whilst the repeating structural motif in dystrophin is probably a bead of triple coiled coil, this bead is twice as massive as, and out of phase with, those proposed for spectrin. Our model {{raises the possibility that}} the rod domain of dystrophin may confer elasticity on the molecule. Deletions which truncate this region would then reduce the extensibility of the molecule without affecting actin crosslinking, consistent with their typically producing the relatively benign Becker phenotype of muscular dystrophy...|$|R

These repeats are each approximately 300 nucleotides in length and have 45 % identical aligned nucleotides (common bases). When these metrically <b>aligned</b> DNA <b>repeats</b> were translated into amino acids, 9 (19 %) of the 47 in-phase amino acid residues were identical (common acids). This internal duplication was also apparent on visual inspection of the amino acid sequence of IFN-beta 1. In addition, metric {{analysis of}} the nucleotide sequence of the intron-free IFN-alpha 1 gene showed that this gene also contains two repeats, each approximately 300 nucleotides long, having 47 % common bases and 19 % common acids. Since the IFN-alpha 1 and -beta 1 genes {{are known to be}} related (by the present metric analysis they contain 53 % common bases and 45 % common acids), a consensus DNA sequence was derived from all four of these repeats. Manual alignment of the separate metric alignments corresponding to the two halves of the IFN-alpha 1 and -beta 1 genes provided a composite alignment with 58 % of the alignment positions having the same nucleotide in at least three of the four repeats. When this composite nucleotide alignment was translated to define a composite alignment of the four protein segments, 10 (31 %) of the 32 in-phase amino acid residues contained the same amino acid in at least three of the four segments. These sequences relationships provide insight into the origin of the IFN-alpha 1 and -beta 1 genes and furnish an additional basis for comparing them with other related genes...|$|R

Results Reference set of known regulatory elements from the HBB complex DNA sequences needed to regulate the set of developmentally controlled, erythroid-specific genes encoding �-globin and its relatives have been studied intensively, and in this gene complex, the fraction of human sequences aligning with mouse and rat (35 %) is very close to the genome average (Gibbs et al. 2004).

In the face of rote learning’s reputation as an out-moded pedagogical tool, the paper argues that it inhabits a paradoxical and productive site, whereby what begins as a repetition of the same, can open towards pure repetition (as Deleuze frames this notion), and facilitate inventiveness and a courting of the new. In this way, poetry, and the learning of it by rote, constitute a unique constellation, disputing the platitude that learning is ‘only discovering what one already knew’ and instead proposing that learning is closer to an awesome ordeal, one that leads to concepts and collisions that did not exist before and cannot be predicted in advance...|$|R

Collaboration across organization boundaries, in contrast, is negatively related to the value of intellectual capital and positively related to the number of times the star scientist has moved. Organizational boundaries act as information envelopes: The more valuable the information produced, the more its dissemination is limited.

However, the bioavailability of cellularly expressed or purified laccases in continuous operations is usually limited by mass transfer impediment or enzyme regeneration difficulty. Therefore, this study develops a regenerable bacterial surface-displaying system for industrial synthetic dye decolorization, and evaluates {{its effects on}} independent and continuous operations. Results A bacterial laccase (WlacD) was engineered onto the cell surface of the solvent-tolerant bacterium Pseudomonas putida to construct a whole-cell biocatalyst. Ice nucleation protein (InaQ) anchor was employed, {{and the ability of}} 1 to 3 tandemly <b>aligned</b> N-terminal <b>repeats</b> to direct WlacD display were compared. Immobilized WlacD was determined to be surface-displayed in functional form using Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and whole-cell enzymatic activity assay. Engineered P. putida cells were then applied to decolorize the anthraquinone dye Acid Green (AG) 25 and diazo-dye Acid Red (AR) 18. The results showed that decolorization of both dyes is Cu 2 + - and mediator-independent, with an optimum temperature of 35 °C and pH of 3. 0, and can be stably performed across a temperature range of 15 °C to 45 °C. A high activity toward AG 25 (1 [*]g/l) with relative decolorization values of 91. 2 % (3 [*]h) and 97. 1 % (18 [*]h), as well as high activity to AR 18 (1 [*]g/l) by 80. 5 % (3 [*]h) and 89. 0 % (18 [*]h), was recorded. The engineered system exhibited a comparably high activity compared with those of separate dyes in a continuous three-round shake-flask decolorization of AG 25 /AR 18 mixed dye (each 1 [*]g/l). No significant decline in decolorization efficacy was noted during first two-rounds but reaction equilibriums were elongated, and the residual laccase activity eventually decreased to low levels. However, the decolorizing capacity of the system was easily retrieved via a subsequent 4 -h cell culturing.

Measuring perseveration is difficult, but may index cognitive performance, aiding diagnosis and disease monitoring. Continuous recording of speech {{would produce a}} large quantity of data requiring painstaking manual analysis, and risk violating patients’ and others’ privacy. A secure record and an automated approach to analysis are required. Objectives: To record bone-conducted acoustic energy fluctuations from a subject’s vocal apparatus using an accelerometer, to describe the recording and analysis stages in detail, and demonstrate that the approach is feasible in AD. Methods: Speech-related vibration was captured by an accelerometer, affixed above the temporo-mandibular joint. Healthy subjects read a script with embedded repetitions. Features were extracted from recorded signals and combined using Principal Component Analysis to obtain a one-dimensional representation of the feature vector. Motif discovery techniques were used to detect <b>repeated</b> segments. The <b>equipment</b> was tested in AD patients to determine device acceptability and recording quality.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large family}} of viruses that infect bacteria, called phages, is {{characterized}} by long tails used to inject DNA into their victims' cells. The tape measure protein got its name because {{the length of the}} corresponding gene is proportional to the length of the phage's tail: a fact shown by actually copying or splicing out parts of DNA in exemplar species. A natural question is whether there exist units for these tape measures, and if different tape measures have different units and lengths. Such units would allow us to retrace the evolution of tape measure proteins using their duplication/loss history. The vast number of sequenced phages genomes allows us to attack this problem with a comparative genomics approach. Results Here we describe a subset of phages whose tape measure proteins contain variable numbers of an 11 amino acids sequence <b>repeat,</b> <b>aligned</b> with sequence similarity, structural properties, and simple arithmetics. This subset provides a unique opportunity for the combinatorial study of phage evolution, without the added uncertainties of multiple alignments, which are trivial in this case, or of protein functions, that are well established. We give a heuristic that reconstructs the duplication history of these sequences, using divergent strains to discriminate between mutations that occurred before and after speciation, or lineage divergence. The heuristic is based on an efficient algorithm that gives an exhaustive enumeration of all possible parsimonious reconstructions of the duplication/speciation history of a single nucleotide. Finally, we present a method that allows, when possible, to discriminate between duplication and loss events. Conclusions Establishing the evolutionary history of viruses is difficult, in part due to extensive recombinations and gene transfers, and high mutation rates that often erase detectable similarity between homologous genes. In this paper, we introduce new tools to address this problem. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the in&# 64258;uence of an {{external}} alternating magnetic &# 64257;eld on combustion of a ferro&# 64258;uid (liquid with dispersed magnetic nanoparticles) droplet is investigated. The {{response of the}} magnetic nanoparticles to the magnetic &# 64257;eld generates heat inside the droplet, due to magneto relaxation, which acts as a heat source. This phenomenon is produced by friction (viscous dissipation) between rotating nanoparticles and the liquid surrounding them. The rotating motion of the nanoparticles is induced by the magnetic dipole &# 64257;xed on each nanoparticle, which tends to align itself with the magnetic &# 64257;eld. In the absence of magnetic &# 64257;eld, Brownian motion of the liquid molecules is responsible for misaligning the dipoles, after collisions with the nanoparticle surface. Under the in&# 64258;uence of {{an external}} alternating magnetic &# 64257;eld, the process of <b>aligning</b> and misaligning <b>repeats</b> itself in each cycle, producing heat by viscous dissipation, due to a periodically reversing nanoparticle circular motion. Magneto relaxation heating, together with heat transfer from the &# 64258;ame, contribute to droplet heating, hence increasing the vaporization rate of ferro&# 64258;uid droplets. The current analysis considers a magnetic heat source that is much larger than that provided by heat transfer from the &# 64258;ame. Under this condition, {{as in the case}} of semi-transparent droplets absorbing heat from the &# 64258;ame by radiation, a thermal boundary layer is formed in the liquid on the droplet surface. Additionally, under certain conditions the temperature inside the thermal boundary layer can become higher than the temperature at the droplet surface. This leads to boiling occurs inside the droplet rather than at the surface, as in classical models. The temperature difference between the thermal boundary layer and the droplet surface results in an extra heat &# 64258;ux to the droplet surface, which increases the vaporization rate.

40|$|The only {{practical}} {{method for}} artificially breeding ewes with frozen semen is laparoscopic insemination into the lumen of the uterine horn. Like all surgical procedures, however, laparoscopic artificial inseminatiom has limitations. The procedure requires surgical skill and costly <b>equipment.</b> <b>Repeated</b> {{passage of the}} laparoscope through the abdominal wall causes adhesions. Depositing frozen/thawed semen at the os cervix results in low conception rates. The inability to pass an insemination pipette through the cervix has prevented artificial insemination in sheep from becoming a standard breeding method as in the cattle industry. This study compared laparoscopic and transcervical methods of insemination in nulliparous ewes and transcervical insemination in multiparous ewes after estradiol cypionate treatment. Forty nulliparous commercial-cross Rambouillet ewes were treated with pessaries containing fluorogesterone acetate to synchronize estrus. After 14 days, pessaries were removed and ewes were injected IM with 400 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Ewes were randomly divided into laparoscopic and transcervical treatment groups, 14 and 26 respectively. Ewes were inseminated with thawed semen (75 x 106 motile spermatozoa). Pregnancy rate with laparoscopic insemination was 85 % (confirmed at 55 days with real-time ultrasound) [...] With the transcervical method, the speculum could only be inserted into the vagina of five ewes and the insemination pipette could only be passed through the cervix in two ewes. The combined pregnancy rate for deep cervical and transcervical insemination was 40 % at 55 days. Forty multiparous commercial-cross Rambouillet ewes were synchronized as previously described. Ewes were randomly separated into a control and estradiol cypionate treatment group of 20 animals each. Within each group 10 ewes were inseminated with frozen/thawed Suffolk semen and 1 Owith Rambouillet semen. Ten ewes within each sire genotype were treated with 1 mg IM of estradiol cypionate 16 hours prior to insemination. Treated ewes were inseminated into the uterine body 90 % {{of the time and}} non-treated ewes 95 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} cervical passage between these groups. Pregnancy rates for transcervical artificial insemination in the Suffolk genotype were 0. 05 % and 40 % in the Rambouillet (pregnancy confirmed at 55 days by real-time ultrasound). Lambing rates for the Suffolk and Rambouillet groups were zero and 0. 05 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The current {{method for}} the {{immobilization}} of fission products that accumulate in electrorefiner salt during the electrochemical processing of used metallic nuclear fuel is to encapsulate the electrorefiner {{salt in a}} glass-bonded sodalite ceramic waste form. This process was developed by Argonne National Laboratory in the USA and is currently performed at the Idaho National Laboratory {{for the treatment of}} Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) used fuel. This process utilizes a “once-through” option for the disposal of spent electrorefiner salt; where, after the treatment of the EBR-II fuel, the electrorefiner salt containing the active fission products will be disposed of in the ceramic waste form (CWF). The CWF produced will have low fission product loading of approximately 2 to 5 weight percent due to the limited fuel inventory currently being processed. However; the design and implementation of advanced electrochemical processing facilities to treat used fuel would process much greater quantities fuel. With an advanced processing facility, it would be necessary to selectively remove fission products from the electrorefiner salt for salt recycle and to concentrate the fission products to reduce the volume of high-level waste from the treatment facility. The Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute and the Idaho National Laboratory have been collaborating on I-NERI research projects {{for a number of years}} to investigate both aspects of selective fission product separation from electrorefiner salt, and to develop advanced waste forms for the immobilization of the collected fission products. The first joint KAERI/INL I-NERI project titled: 2006 - 002 -K, Separation of Fission Products from Molten LiCl-KCl Salt Used for Electrorefining of Metal Fuels, was successfully completed in 2009 by concentrating and isolating fission products from actual electrorefiner salt used for the treated used EBR-II fuel. Two separation methods were tested and from these tests were produced concentrated salt products that acted as the feed material for development of advanced waste forms investigated in this proposal. Accomplishments from the first year activities associated with this I-NERI project included the down selection of candidate waste forms to immobilize fission products separated from electrorefiner salt, and the design of equipment to fabricate actual waste forms in the Hot Fuels Examination Facility (HFEF) at the INL. Reported in this document are accomplishments from the second year (FY 10) work performed at the INL, and includes the testing of waste form fabrication <b>equipment,</b> <b>repeating</b> the fission product precipitation experiment, and initial waste form fabrication efforts...|$|R
40|$|Irrespective of micro organisms or metazoans, {{cellular}} components sometimes unevenly inherited to the progenies during cell division. Currently, this phenomenon, {{which is}} known as an asymmetric cell division, is shown to be intimately connected with development and cellular homeostasis maintenance. In the asymmetric cell division subcellular constituents including transcripts, proteins, and organelle such as endoplasmic reticulum and centriole segregate unevenly. Moreover, chromosomal DNAs are also inherited unevenly, though the phenomenon remains to be confirmed. In this study, I constructed an assay system that enables us to detect the non-random sister chromatids segregation. Using the system I analyzed if the event is {{taken place in the}} budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, I succeeded in obtaining evidence that two sisters are selected and non-randomly segregated. 　　　As a model system to analyze the non-random chromosome segregation, I employed the rDNA repeats that reside on the chromosome XII in S. cerevisiae. In the region, the copy number of rDNA repeats frequently varies and it was expected that distinct sister chromatids arise during DNA replication. For this reason, I assumed the non-random sister chromatid segregation can be observed in the rDNA. I continuously separated the progenies of cell division (the daughter and mother cells) by centrifugal elutriation to trace the fate of sister chromatids that are bearing the rDNA repeats. Consequently, when compared the rDNA copy number in the sorted cells, the daughter and mother cell lineages clearly differed. The daughter lineage constituently inherited a sister chromatid that harbors increased copy number of rDNA, while in the mother lineage the number did not change. Therefore, it seemed like that the Chr. XII was differentiated during cell division and non-randomly segregated to the progenies. Remarkably, the pattern of sister chromatids inheritance showed the lineage specificity. This indicated that S. cerevisiae was recognizing the two sister chromatids. 　　　To explore the cis acting mechanisms underlying the non-random sister chromatid segregation, I analyzed the effect of centromere. In S. cerevisiae, centromeric sequences that associate with the kinetochore proteins have directionality. And also, some of the mitotic apparatuses involved in chromosome segregation are polarized during cell division. I speculated that there are some relationship between the polarity of centromere and mitotic apparatus, and the non-random sister chromatid segregation. To analyze the relationship, I exchanged the CEN 12 (Chr. XII centromere) sequences with other centromeric fragments that harbors opposite directionality and analyzed the phenotypes in the strain. Although the pattern of sister chromatid segregation was anaryzed in the CEN 12 -modified strains, the directionality of centromere seemed not to be important. 　　　As the other case, I also analyzed the effect of the directionality of rDNA repeat. On the tandemly <b>aligned</b> rDNA <b>repeats,</b> several biological processes, including transcription and replication, are performed in unidirectional way. I investigated whether this directionality is involved in the asymmetric chromosome segregation. For this purpose, the rDNA repeat was reconstructed in inverted direction using a strain that lost the rDNA repeat completely. Unexpectedly, the newly introduced rDNA repeats had lost the competency for increasing their copy number on Chr. XII. Therefore, the effect of the rDNA directionality could not be estimated. 　　　Apart from the cis elements, then I wondered if trans factors associate with the regulation of the sister chromatid segregation. In the mutants that affect stability(sir 2 △),nuclear localization (heh 1 △), and segregation (bud 6 △) of the IDNA, the fate of sister chromatid segtegation was analyzed. In the sir 2 △ and heh 1 △ the segregation pattern of Chr. XII was equivalent to that of WT. In the bud 6 △,it　was　not　able　to　detect　the rDNA copy number change by our analysis. From these result, I speculated that nuclear positioning and chromatin stnrctures of the rDNA {{had little to do with}} the pattern of sister chromatid segregation. 　　　Finally, I concerned about the possibility that the non-random chromosome segregation specifrcally occurred in the Chr. XII. To investigate this possibility. I performed BrdU pulse-chase analysis to trace the segregation pattern of whole chromosomes. In this analysis, I could not observe the apparently biased DNA strand retention in 16 chromosomes including the Chr. XII at least when recombination in the rDNA was repressed. 　　　In conclusion, I obtained the first evidence of the non-random chromosome segregation in S. cerevisiae. Thus S. cerevisiae seems to maintains a system which distinguish the two sister chromatids during cytokinesis. Further study will reveal how such a chromosome segregation was taken plac...|$|R
