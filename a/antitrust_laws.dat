5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

The legislature passed his recommendations, and approved his plan to exert more control over school funds and to require local taxation to support the public schools. He also encouraged the legislature to enact <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of the legislature {{to deal with a}} treasury surplus.|$|E

5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced the repeal into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. The repeal resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting the repeal passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for {{a day and a half}} in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E
5|$|In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Radovich's favor and {{declared}} the NFL {{was subject to}} <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws,</b> and the implication was that {{the legality of the}} draft and reserve clause were dubious. Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business. He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court's ruling. The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision. Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee's solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport's success. Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position. Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives.|$|E
40|$|Many {{of those}} {{concerned}} with public utility regulation assume that federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> has little bearing on regulated industries. That assumption is erroneous.

40|$|Of all Robert Bork’s many {{important}} contributions to <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> none was {{more significant than}} his identification of economic efficiency, disguised as consumer welfare, as the sole normative objective of U.

Sonotone that “Congress designed the Sherman Act as a ‘consumer welfare prescription. ’” This singular normative vision proved foundational to the reorientation of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> away from an interventionist, populist, Brandeisian, and vaguely Jeffersonian conception of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> as a constraint on large-scale business power and toward a conception of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> as a mild constraint on a relatively small set of practices that {{pose a threat to}} allocative efficiency...|$|R

25|$|At Yale, he {{was best}} known for writing The Antitrust Paradox, a book in which he argued that {{consumers}} often benefited from corporate mergers, and that many then-current readings of the <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> were economically irrational and hurt consumers. He posited that {{the primary focus of}} <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> should be on consumer welfare rather than ensuring competition, as fostering competition of companies within an industry has a natural built-in tendency to allow, and even help, many poorly run companies with methodologies and practices that are both inefficient and expensive to continue in business simply for the sake of competition, to the detriment of both consumers and society. Bork's writings on antitrust law—with those of Richard Posner and other law and economics and Chicago School thinkers—were influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> since the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|When the Newark {{franchise}} was dissolved {{prior to}} the 1950 season, he was demoted by the Yankees' organization to the Binghamton Triplets, an A-class team within its minor league system.

40|$|More than {{twelve years}} have elapsed since China began {{its efforts to}} enact a {{comprehensive}} <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> Today, drafts of the law are still being debated. Such a protracted legislative process is highly unusual in China, and can only {{be explained by the}} controversy the draft law generates. After a brief review of China’s current competition policy, this paper discusses the fundamental issues in China’s economy that give rise to the challenges facing China’s antitrust policymakers in enacting the new <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> These issues include the role of state-owned enterprises, perceived excessive competition in China’s economy, mergers and acquisitions by foreign companies, the treatment of administrative monopolies, and the enforcement of the <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> While those controversies create significant policy issues for China, they do not constitute valid objections to the enactment of the new <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> Meanwhile, it will be important for China to recognize that the new <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> alone will not be sufficient to fully realize its goal of promoting competition in its economy; other reforms will be necessary as well.

25|$|Another form of {{economic}} regulation, <b>antitrust</b> <b>law,</b> seeks to strengthen market forces so that direct regulation is unnecessary.

25|$|From 1929 to 1933, the {{industrial}} economy had {{been suffering from}} a vicious cycle of deflation.

25|$|Also in 1961, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Sports Broadcasting Act in {{response}} to a court decision which ruled that the NFL's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws.</b> The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks, but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games. Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, the United States Supreme Court {{decision}} Federal Baseball Club v. National League (259 U.S. 200), which grants baseball {{a special}} immunity from <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws,</b> {{had a major}} effect on the minor leagues. The special immunity meant that the American and National leagues could dictate terms under which every independent league did business. By 1925, major league baseball established a flat-fee purchase amount of $5,000 for the contract of any player from an NA league team. This power was leveled primarily at the Baltimore Orioles, then a Triple-A team that had dominated the minors with stars.|$|E
25|$|A fourth legal {{argument}} is that comprehensive campaigns violate federal anti-trust law. As unions work with other organizations, it is claimed that they form, essentially, a commercial enterprise which seeks to economically dominate the market much {{in the same way}} that a monopoly does. In support of this claim, critics note that the Supreme Court has read the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-LaGuardia acts in such a way that unions are held exempt from federal <b>antitrust</b> <b>laws</b> but only so long as a union acts in its own self-interest and does not lose its primary character as a labor union by combining with other, non-labor groups or organizations. In crafting community and comprehensive campaigns, critics say, unions lose their exemption under these acts.|$|E

The fact that private enforcement of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> is possible, and in fact equal, to public enforcement is not yet commonly recognized. In response to the European Commission’s White Paper on Damages actions for breach of the EC antitrust rules, private enforcement of antirust law is presently under intense discussion in EC Member States. This article should be considered as one of the contributions to this debate. It presents the main legal framework of private enforcement of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> in Poland. In order to do so, it directly refers to the Polish Act on competition and consumer protection, the Civil Code and the Civil Procedure Code. This article also discusses Polish case law in this area. It aims to assess whether existing Polish legal provisions are, in fact, sufficient to ensure effective private enforcement of Polish as well as EC <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> The article refers to the main proposals of the European Commission’s White Paper. It is concluded that private enforcement of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> is indeed possible in Poland on the basis of currently applicable procedural rules, even if there are no special instruments designed to facilitate it. However, it cannot be expect that in the current legal climate, private parties will eagerly and frequently apply for damages in cases of a breach of Polish <b>antitrust</b> <b>law.</b> <b>Antitrust</b> cases are special in many aspects and, thus, they require specific solutions in procedural terms. This article aims to pinpoint those areas, where the Polish law needs to be changed in order to develop and promote private enforcement of <b>antitrust</b> <b>law</b> in Poland. ...|$|R
