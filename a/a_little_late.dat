5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
25|$|The {{spread of}} TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when AT agreed {{to place the}} TCP/IP code {{developed}} for UNIX into the public domain. Various vendors, including IBM, included this code in their own TCP/IP stacks. Many companies sold TCP/IP stacks for Windows until Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95. This event was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> {{in the evolution of}} the Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols, which began to lose ground. These protocols included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).|$|E

25|$|Instead, President Johnson {{sought a}} way out of the {{commitment}} that he had originally escalated. Politically, this was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> in coming, but Washington had finally woken to the dire predicament it found itself embroiled in. Johnson attempted to get Hanoi to reopen serious peace negotiations and the carrot in this attempt was the cessation of all U.S. operations against North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel. Hanoi had only sought an end to the air campaign against the north (Operation Rolling Thunder), but Johnson went one further by calling a halt to all northern operations, both overt and covert. This order effectively ended MACSOG's agent team, propaganda, and aerial operations.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a little early, sometimes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late.</b> A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.|$|E

Some of the reporters camped in front of Condit's Washington apartment house were quoted as saying that they would remain there [...] "until he resigns".

Lowry believed that the show [...] "loses" [...] and that Oxygen attracts viewers who generally get drunk at bars and make a scene. He also suggested that [...] "maybe it's time to [...] "BAG" [...] these bad-attitude girls and beat a hasty retreat back to the real world".|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{and lead}} {{designer}} Billy Thomson had previously confirmed that Crackdown was designed {{from the outset}} to be a long-running series of games, stating that sequels for the game are very likely to be produced, especially if Crackdown performed well commercially. However, during the Industry All Stars event in September 2007, Wilson confirmed that Realtime Worlds was not working on a sequel to the game, saying [...] "Microsoft was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> in stepping {{up to the plate}} to ask for Crackdown 2, and by then we had already started working on bigger, better things". However, then-corporate vice president of Microsoft Game Studios, Shane Kim, stated that Microsoft still holds the intellectual property rights for Crackdown and that a Crackdown sequel was still a possibility.

500|$|The Division Bell {{deals with}} themes of {{communication}} {{and the idea that}} talking can solve many problems. In the Studio radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offered [...] "the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace". Songs such as [...] "Poles Apart" [...] and [...] "Lost for Words" [...] have been interpreted as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and former band member Roger Waters, who left in 1985; however, Gilmour denied this, and said: [...] "People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways, but it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up." [...] The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Drummer Nick Mason said: [...] "It does have some meaning.

[...] Jasmine Grant of Juicy magazine viewed the song as a [...] "heartfelt ballad," [...] and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone wrote that it sounds like [...] "a Twitter rant against haters." [...] Melissa Ruggieri of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as a [...] "lilting ballad" [...] and noted that Brown is [...] "semi-serious" [...] in the song. A reviewer on 4Music called the song [...] "undeniably emotional" [...] and wrote, [...] "we're wondering is if this is a heart-wrenching plea to Rihanna?" [...] Sharon O'Connell of Time Out magazine commented on the song's title: [...] "it's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late</b> for that."

2500|$|Allen {{employed}} a writing staff but they served as his sounding boards and early draft consultants {{as much as}} actual writers; it was Allen who had the final edit and rewrite of each week's script, working as long as twelve {{hours a day in}} his own right on ideas or sketches. His ad-libbing ability caused many a show to fade away behind the ending network identification, because Allen often ate up air time. It was not as unusual for him as for others to sign off with [...] "We're <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>late,</b> so good night, folks." [...] Buxton and Owen believed the Allen show needed it more than anyone else of his era. Allen also [...] "died" [...] more eloquently than other radio comics, particularly in the later years.

However, they found their flanks exposed, and were strongly counterattacked from three directions, and compelled to withdraw without the guns. During this retreat, they were fired on by their own guns, before being supported by a company of the 5th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers, in establishing a new line. Meanwhile, on the left, the 7th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers and the 4th Battalion Sussex captured Hill 1706 and the spur to the west in very close fighting. At daylight, the 3rd Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade, sheltering behind the northern flank of a little valley running west to east, were strongly attacked before joining a group of Hereford infantry in pushing the [...] "enemy back along the spur".

2500|$|Avro Anson bombers used by Bass Island Airways {{on the run}} to King Island were housed and {{serviced}} at the Belmont Common, {{one being}} destroyed by floods in 1952.
