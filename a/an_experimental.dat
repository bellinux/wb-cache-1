40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} propofol and ketamine on the cognitive function and immune function in young rats. MethodA total of 80 young rats were randomly divided into four groups: Control group, ketamine group (<b>experimental</b> group <b>A),</b> propofol group (<b>experimental</b> group B), ketamine and propofol group (experimental group C). All rats had continuous injection for three times, serum IL- 2, IL- 4 and IL- 10 and whole brain IL- 1 β level, hippocampal neuronal apoptosis level were measured. The cognitive ability in rats was tested by water maze. ResultsWater maze test showed on the 1 st d, the maze test latency of the control group, the experimental group B and the experimental group C water were decreased gradually; Compared with the control group after 3 days, the latency of the <b>experimental</b> group <b>A,</b> <b>experimental</b> group B and experimental group C were all decreased, the crossing circle times were also reduced. Hippocampal neuron apoptosis were (2. 3 ± 1. 7) %, (14. 7 ± 6. 9) %, (4. 2 ± 3. 3) %, (10. 2 ± 4. 8) % in control group, <b>experimental</b> group <b>A,</b> <b>experimental</b> group B and experimental group C, respectively. The neurons apoptosis of <b>experimental</b> group <b>A</b> was significantly increased. The serum IL- 4 and IL- 10 of the <b>experimental</b> group <b>A,</b> <b>experimental</b> group B and experimental group C after anesthesia {{were significantly higher than}} the control group. The whole brain IL- 1 β of the <b>experimental</b> group <b>A,</b> <b>experimental</b> group B and experimental group C were significantly lower than the control group. ConclusionsPropofol can reduce anesthesia effect of ketamine on the cognitive function and immune function in the young rats...|$|R
