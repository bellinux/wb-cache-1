50|$|An {{implication}} of indirect fire and improving guns was increasing range between gun and target, this increased {{the time of}} flight and the vertex of the trajectory. The result was decreasing accuracy (the increasing distance between the target and the {{mean point of impact}} of the shells aimed at it) caused by the increasing effects of non-standard conditions. Indirect firing data was based on standard conditions including a specific muzzle velocity, zero wind, air temperature and density, and propellant temperature. In practice, this standard combination of conditions almost never existed, they varied throughout the day and day to day, and the greater the time of flight, the greater the inaccuracy. An added complication was the need for survey to accurately fix the coordinates of the gun position and provide accurate orientation for the guns. Of course, targets had to be accurately located, but by 1916, <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretation</b> techniques enabled this, and ground survey techniques could sometimes be used.|$|E

40|$|Beach and shoreface sediments {{deposited}} {{in the more than}} 800 -km long ice-dammed Lake Komi in northern European Russia have been investigated and dated. The lake flooded the lowland areas between the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet in the north and the continental drainage divide in the south. Shoreline facies have been dated by 18 optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates, most of which are closely grouped in the range 80 - 100 ka, with a mean of 88 +/- 3 ka. This implies that that the Barents-Kara Ice Sheet had its Late Pleistocene maximum extension during the Early Weichselian, probably in the cold interval (Rederstall) between the Brørup and Odderade interstadials of western Europe, correlated with marine isotope stage 5 b. This is in strong contrast to the Scandinavian and North American ice sheets, which had their maxima in isotope stage 2, about 20 ka. Field and <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretations</b> suggest that Lake Komi was dammed by the ice advance, which formed the Harbei-Harmon-Sopkay Moraines. These has earlier been correlated with the Markhida moraine across the Pechora River Valley and its western extension. However, OSL dates on fluvial sediments below the Markhida moraine have yielded ages as young as 60 ka. This suggests that the Russian mainland was inundated by two major ice sheet advances from the Barents-Kara seas after the last interglacial: one during the Early Weichselian (about 90 ka) that dammed Lake Komi and one during the Middle Weichselian (about 60 ka).

Here we present a methodology developed to (1) identify poultry production locations, (2) estimate the amount of waste generated at each location, (3) identify the timing of poultry waste disposal and (4) identify locations at which waste from poultry production operations was disposed. The work done included: (1) <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretation,</b> (2) on-ground verification of the <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretation,</b> (3) review of animal waste management plans, (4) review of land disposal records and (5) direct observation {{of the land}} disposal of poultry waste.

A total of 317 landslides were identified and mapped in the area by extensive field work and by use of <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretations</b> to build a landslide inventory map. A landslide database was then derived automatically from the landslide inventory map. To evaluate landslide susceptibility, six input parameters (slope angle, slope aspect, topographical elevation, topographical shape, wetness index, and vegetation index) were used. To obtain maps of these parameters, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and ASTER satellite imagery of the study area were used. At the first stage, all data were normalized in [0, 1] interval, and parameter effects on landslide occurrence were expressed using Statistical Index values (Wi). Then, landslide susceptibility analyses were performed using an ANN. Finally, performance of the resulting map and the applied methodology is discussed relative to performance indicators, such as predicted areal extent of landslides and the strength of relation (r ij) value. Much of the areal extents of the landslides (87. 2 %) were classified as susceptible to landsliding, and r ij value of 0. 85 showed a high degree of similarity. In addition to these, at the final stage, an independent validation strategy was followed by dividing the landslide data set into two parts and 82. 5 % of the validation data set was found to be correctly classified as landslide susceptible areas. According to these results, it is concluded that the map produced by the ANN is reliable and methodology applied in the study produced high performance, and satisfactory results...|$|R

Digital elevation models (DEMs) are often used to map important topographic parameters such as slope.

In this paper a real-time differential GPS is used to acquire ground truth data. This ground truth is compared with DEMs generated from contours. This analysis shows that three commonly used contour-based interpolation procedures all produce good quality DEMs. When considering the replacement of more traditional slope maps based on field mapping or <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> and contour <b>interpretation</b> with DEM-derived slope maps, it is important to establish that DEM-derived slope maps do represent an improvement on existing approaches.

40|$|The Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) is a {{threatened}} alcid that nests {{almost exclusively in}} old-growth forests along the Pacific coast of North America. Nesting habitat has significant economic importance. Murrelet nests are extremely difficult and costly to find, which adds uncertainty to management and conservation planning. Models based on <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretation</b> of forest cover maps or assessments by low-level helicopter flights are currently used to rank presumed Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat quality in British Columbia. These rankings are assumed to correlate with nest usage and murrelet breeding productivity. Our goal was to find the models that best predict Marbled Murrelet nesting habitat in the ground-accessible portion of the two regions studied. We generated Resource Selection Functions (RSF) using logistic regression models of ground-based forest stand variables gathered at plots around 64 nests, located using radio-telemetry, versus 82 random habitat plots. The RSF scores are proportional to the probability of nests occurring in a forest patch. The best models differed somewhat between the two regions, but include both ground variables at the patch scale (0. 2 - 2. 0 ha), such as platform tree density, height and trunk diameter of canopy trees and canopy complexity, and landscape scale variables such as elevation, aspect, and slope. Collecting ground-based habitat selection data would not be cost-effective for widespread use in forestry management; <b>air</b> <b>photo</b> <b>interpretation</b> and low-level aerial surveys are much more efficient methods for ranking habitat suitability on a landscape scale.
