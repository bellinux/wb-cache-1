500|$|The game's {{difficult}} and unforgiving gameplay frustrated critics. Game Revolution explained that, while in previous Tomb Raider games [...] "instant death came <b>about</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were trying to}} rush through an area and you did something stupid", every step in Tomb Raider III [...] "is a potential threat of instant death, no matter how careful you're trying to be." [...] The publication {{went so far as}} to call Tomb Raider III [...] "a marketing concept", stating that the game is so difficult that it is impossible to beat without buying a strategy guide. Similarly, Electronic Gaming Monthly criticised the game for being rushed and highly frustrating, noting that it has [...] "too many instances of cheap deaths." [...] The magazine also remarked that the stealth elements in the Nevada levels were ineffective, especially when compared to Konami's 1998 hit Metal Gear Solid.|$|E
2500|$|Albini {{believed}} that Big Black {{had nothing to}} gain by adopting the usual corporate trappings of rock bands: [...] "If you don't use contracts, you don't have any contracts to worry <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't have a tour rider, you don't have a tour rider to argue <b>about.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't have a booking agent, you don't have a booking agent to argue with." [...] Handling the tour booking, equipment hauling, setup, and breakdown of shows themselves also meant that the band {{did not have to}} hire a booking agent or road crew with whom they would have to share profits. The lack of a drummer also meant one less member to split profits with, and since there was no drum kit the band did not have to rent a tour van to fit all of their equipment. Thus Big Black was able to profit from most of their tours. They embarked on a 1984 national tour of the United States in preparation for their forthcoming Homestead EP, utilizing the close-knit network of independent rock bands to learn of cities and venues to play.|$|E

[...] Assistant Nancy Seifer said [...] "There was a whole world out there that nobody in City Hall knew anything <b>about</b> ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> didn't live on Central Park West, you were some kind of lesser being." [...] While many experts traced the city's mid-1970s fiscal crisis to the Lindsay years, Lindsay disagreed, insisting that it may have come sooner if he had not imposed new taxes.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry <b>about,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E
