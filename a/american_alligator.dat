5|$|<b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> {{predation}} on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway or coming down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> is the only known natural predator of the panther. <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> {{was first}} {{classified}} by French zoologist François Marie Daudin as Crocodilus mississipiensis in 1801. In 1807 Georges Cuvier created the genus Alligator; the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> shares this genus with the Chinese alligator. They are grouped {{in the family}} Alligatoridae with the caimans. The superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are {{more closely related to}} the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor Endangered Species Act of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
500|$|The {{young are}} tiny replicas of adult <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> {{with a series}} of yellow bands around their bodies that serve as camouflage. Hatchlings gather into pods and are guarded by their mother and keep in contact with her through their [...] "yelping" [...] vocalizations. Young <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> eat small fish, frogs, crayfish, and insects. They are preyed on by large fish, birds, raccoons, and adult <b>American</b> <b>alligators.</b> Mother <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> {{eventually}} become more aggressive towards their young, which encourages them to disperse.

5|$|<b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> will {{occasionally}} prey {{on large}} mammals, such as deer, but will usually do so when fish and smaller prey levels go down. Rarely, <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> {{have been observed}} killing and eating bobcats, but such events are not common and have little effect on bobcat populations. Although <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> have been listed as predators of West Indian manatees, very little evidence exists of such predation. In the 2000s, when invasive Burmese pythons occupied the Everglades, <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> have been recorded preying on them, possibly controlling populations, thus preventing the invasive species to spread up north.|$|R
500|$|<b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> play an {{important}} role in the restoration of the Everglades as biological indicators of restoration success. <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> are highly sensitive to changes in the hydrology, salinity, and productivity of their ecosystems; all are factors that are expected to change with Everglades restoration. <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> also may control the long-term vegetation dynamics in wetlands by reducing the population of small mammals, particularly coypu, which may otherwise overgraze marsh vegetation. [...] In this way, the vital ecological service they provide may be important in reducing rates of coastal wetland losses in Louisiana. They may provide a protection service for water birds nesting on islands in freshwater wetlands. <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> prevent predatory mammals from reaching island-based rookeries and in return eat spilled food and birds that fall from their nests. Wading birds appear to be attracted to areas with alligators and have been known to nest at heavily trafficked tourist attractions with large numbers of <b>American</b> <b>alligators,</b> such as the St. Augustine Alligator Farm in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to basking on shore, <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> can and will climb trees to bask in if no shoreline is available. However, this is not often seen as the <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> will retreat back into the water by jumping from their perch.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, a Miocene fossil {{alligator}}'s skull {{was found}} at Marion County, Florida. Unlike the other extinct alligator species of in the same genus, the fossil skull was virtually indistinguishable {{from that of the}} modern <b>American</b> <b>alligator.</b> This alligator and the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> are now considered to be sister taxa, meaning that the Alligator mississippiensis lineage has existed in North America for over 8 million years.|$|E
5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative effect has been seen on overall <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> populations.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often less aggressive towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> in the United States since 1970.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> {{are missing}} an {{inhibited}} gene for melanin, {{which makes them}} albino. These <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> are extremely rare and almost impossible {{to find in the}} wild. They could only survive in captivity, as they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.|$|R

5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> is {{considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the <b>American</b> <b>alligator.</b> However, most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced coypu are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adult American alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had {{decimated}} their population, and the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> was listed as an endangered species by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species {{was removed from the}} list in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E

5|$|Domestic <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, {{possibly}} due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{honored the}} <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida's teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment {{decision}} to print an alligator emblem on {{a shipment of}} the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, perhaps because the team captain's nickname was Gator.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} the day or night. Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E

5|$|Nutria were {{introduced}} into coastal marshes from South America in the mid-1900s, and their population has since exploded into the millions. They cause serious damage to coastal marshes and may dig burrows in levees. Hence, Louisiana {{has had a}} bounty to try to reduce nutria numbers. Large <b>American</b> <b>alligators,</b> however, feed heavily on nutria, so <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> may not only control nutria populations in Louisiana, but also prevent them spreading east into the Everglades. Since hunting and trapping preferentially take the large <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> that {{are the most important}} in eating nutria, some changes in harvesting may be needed to capitalize on their ability to control nutria.|$|R
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in what seems to be cooperative hunting.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the Endangered Species Act allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their <b>American</b> <b>alligator</b> populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the <b>American</b> <b>alligator.</b> Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the Morelet's crocodile, the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|E

5|$|<b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> are apex {{predators and}} consume fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Hatchlings feed mostly on invertebrates. They play an {{important}} role as ecosystem engineers in wetland ecosystems through the creation of alligator holes, which provide both wet and dry habitats for other organisms. Throughout the year, but particularly during the breeding season, <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> bellow to declare territory and locate suitable mates. Male <b>American</b> <b>alligators</b> use infrasound to attract females. Eggs are laid in a nest of vegetation, sticks, leaves, and mud in a sheltered spot in or near the water. Young are born with yellow bands around their bodies and are protected by their mother for up to one year.|$|R
5|$|Schwimmer {{concluded}} in 2002 that the feeding patterns of Deinosuchus most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller Deinosuchus specimens of eastern North America {{would have been}} opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} the modern <b>American</b> <b>alligator.</b> They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs. The bigger, but less common, Deinosuchus that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs. Schwimmer noted no theropod dinosaurs in Deinosuchuss eastern range approached its size, indicating the massive crocodilian could have been the region's apex predator.|$|E
5|$|The state holds {{populations of}} white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, {{mountain}} lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles, red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairie ecosystems, American bison, greater prairie chickens, badgers, and armadillo are common, {{and some of}} the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbers, a region transitioning from prairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are home to black bear, red fox, grey fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma lives the <b>American</b> <b>alligator.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the <b>American</b> <b>alligator,</b> which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E
