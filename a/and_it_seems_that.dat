5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E
5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, {{even to the point of}} being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{generally}} satisfactory {{situation in}} Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems {{from time to}} time. He was on one occasion – probably because of his wide network of contacts – {{the subject of an}} anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at Padua in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the University of Bologna. This did not have the required result, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career – he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the Inquisition in Mantua in 1627 for reading forbidden literature. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church canonry.|$|E

5|$|Lem {{was awarded}} an honorary {{membership}} in the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) in 1973. SFWA Honorary membership is given {{to people who do}} not meet the publishing criteria for joining the regular membership, but who would be welcomed as members had their work appeared in the qualifying English-language publications. Lem, however, never had a high opinion of American science fiction, describing it as ill-thought-out, poorly written, and interested more in making money than in ideas or new literary forms. After his eventual American publication, when he became eligible for regular membership, his honorary membership was rescinded, an action that some of the SFWA members apparently intended as a rebuke, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Lem interpreted it as such. Lem was invited to stay on with the organization with a regular membership, but declined. After many members (including Ursula K. Le Guin) protested against Lem's treatment by the SFWA, a member offered to pay his dues. Lem never accepted the offer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may be outcompeting free-living decomposers for either water or nutrients in some systems as well, however to date there is no demonstration of this, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may more often increase, rather than decrease rates of decomposition by free-living microbial decomposers.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, the {{expansion}} of Buddhism to the North {{led to the formation}} of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some Silk Road cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.|$|E

25|$|Ibn al-Nadim once {{mentioned}} {{a book called}} Ardashir's Testament that Al-Baladhuri (died 279 Hijri), one of Persian (Middle) translators, had turned into an Arabic poem. Once again in the chapter about the books of the Persians, Romans, Indians and Arabs in the preaches and ethics and doctrines, he {{mentioned a}} book called Ardashir I's Testament to His Son Shapur <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> he meant another book.|$|E
25|$|At its height, the {{territory}} {{occupied by the}} Tribe of Simeon was in the southwest of Canaan, bordered on the east and south by the tribe of Judah; the boundaries with the tribe of Judah are vague, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Simeon {{may have been an}} enclave within the west of {{the territory}} of the tribe of Judah. Simeon was one of the less significant tribes in the Kingdom of Judah.|$|E
25|$|Rømer's {{explanation}} {{of the difference between}} predicted and observed timings of Io's eclipses was widely, but far from universally, accepted. Huygens was an early supporter, especially as it supported his ideas about refraction, and wrote to the French Controller-General of Finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert in Rømer's defence. However Cassini, Rømer's superior at the Royal Observatory, was an early and tenacious opponent of Rømer's ideas, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> Picard, Rømer's mentor, shared many of Cassini's doubts.|$|E

25|$|The {{daughter}} {{was not only}} in her father's power to be given in marriage, but he might dedicate her {{to the service of}} a god as a vestal or a hierodule or give her as a concubine. She had no choice in these matters, often decided in her childhood. An adult daughter might wish to become a votary, perhaps in preference to an uncongenial marriage, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> her father could not refuse her wish.|$|E
25|$|In antiquity, penance {{had been}} a public ritual. Penitents were divided into a {{separate}} part of the church during liturgical worship, and they came to mass wearing sackcloth and ashes in {{a process known as}} exomologesis that often involved some form of general confession. There is evidence that this public penance was preceded by a private confession to a bishop or priest (sacerdos), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that,</b> for some sins, private penance was allowed instead. Nonetheless, penance and reconciliation was prevailingly a public rite (sometimes unrepeatable), which included absolution at its conclusion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the end of}} Foundation and Earth, {{the main}} character, Golan Trevize, {{explains}} that psychohistory had a flaw, that it didn't apply for humaniform robots like R. Daneel Olivaw, Gaians like Bliss and the Mule and more like them. Also, Trevize says that, the only smart life beings are humans, and if other life beings attacked them, humans wouldn't be united to defeat them. If it was Galaxia, every planet would be united. With this message, all of Asimov's books have a chronological ending, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> humans have universal peace now.|$|E

25|$|Pepys stopped {{writing his}} diary in 1669. His {{eyesight}} began to trouble {{him and he}} feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries {{that he might have}} others write his diary for him, but doing so would result in a loss of privacy <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> he never went through with those plans. In the end, Pepys’s fears were unjustified and he lived another 34 years without going blind, but he never took to writing his diary again.|$|E
25|$|The Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, {{along with}} the {{contemporary}} parallels found in Canaan and Wadi el-Hol, are thus hypothesized to show an intermediate step between Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Phoenician alphabet. Brian Colless (2014) notes that 18 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet have counterparts in the Byblos syllabary, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the proto-alphabet evolved as a simplification of the syllabary, moving from syllabic to consonantal writing, {{in the style of}} the Egyptian script (which did not normally indicate vowels); this goes against the Goldwasser hypothesis (2010) that the original alphabet was invented by ignorant miners in Sinai.|$|E
25|$|The {{real problem}} is what this movie says about us. When those Abu Ghraib {{pictures}} came out years ago, {{at least half of}} America was horrified. The national consensus (albeit by a frighteningly slim margin) was that this wasn't who we, as a people, wanted to be. But now, four years later, Zero Dark Thirty comes out, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> that we've become so blunted to the horror of what we did and/or are doing at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and Bagram and other places that we can accept it, provided we get a boffo movie out of it.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to receiving compensation, farmers whose land {{was used to}} build the structures were paid after the war to fill in ditches and trenches and to demolish pillboxes. Today, hardly anything remains of the anti-tank ditches, {{but at the time}} they must have been the most conspicuous of all the fortifications. A few remain, much humbled, as field drains or field boundaries, whereas others can be seen only as crop marks. In the case of pillboxes, the sum of £5 is sometimes mentioned to pay for demolition, but the challenge of demolishing such structures is considerable <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> most farmers pocketed the cash, treating it as compensation.|$|E
25|$|Barnet Burns died on 26 December 1860 at Eldad, East Stonehouse, Plymouth. The death {{certificate}} stated that George Barnet Burns, lecturer, {{died at age}} 53 {{and the cause of}} death was morbus cordis cirrhosis of liver ascites. There were various times during his life when Burns had been found drunk <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> he finally succumbed to his alcoholism. His obituary stated that Barnet Burns was better known as Pahe-a-Range, the New Zealand Chief, that he had suffered a long and painful illness and that he left behind a widow and two children to lament their loss. The identities of the children mentioned in the obituary are not known.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the main}} {{official}} {{of law in}} the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar. The institution has some Anglo-Norman origins, but in Scotland north of the Forth it represented some form of continuity with an older office. For instance, Mormaer Causantín of Fife is styled judex magnus (i.e. great Brehon), <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>that</b> the Justiciarship of Scotia was just a further Latinisation/Normanisation of that position. By {{the middle of the}} thirteenth century, responsibility of the Justiciar became fully formalized. He supervised the activity and behaviour of royal sheriffs and sergeants, held courts and reported on these things to the king personally.|$|E
