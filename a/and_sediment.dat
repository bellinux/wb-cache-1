If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E

Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E

40|$|Goethite (Gt) is an {{important}} iron mineral in soils <b>and</b> <b>sediments.</b> Conventional measurements cannot effectively identify it at the low concentrations typical of soils <b>and</b> <b>sediments.</b> In this paper we demonstrate that diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in conjunction with thermal treatment provides a definitive technique for identifying Gt in soil <b>and</b> <b>sediments.</b> The DRS pattern of Gt exhibits diagnostic changes of the first derivative value (FDV) peaks after heating to 300 °C, whereas hematite (Hm) displays no shift in peak wavelength after heating. The degree of thermal changes induced in a sample depends on the concentration of both Gt and Hm. Application of this technique to natural soils <b>and</b> <b>sediments</b> demonstrates that it can effectively detect Gt even at very low concentrations in soils <b>and</b> <b>sediments.</b> © 2010 Elsevier B.

5|$|The water {{also appears}} murky {{due to a}} high level of turbidity; however, this is not usually a health risk. However, the turbidity, which is caused by wind, {{prevents}} photosynthetic stabilisation. Siltation is not considered a major problem and is only a factor in the East Basin, but dredging is not required. The problem has eased with the construction of the Googong Dam, and the spectre of heavy metal pollution has receded, partly due to the closure of some lead mines upstream. However, leaching and groundwater leakage still causes some pollution. Rubbish, oil <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> traps have been set up at the incoming openings to the lake to minimise pollution.|$|E
5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through South Dakota from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of South Dakota. Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern South Dakota. These are the youngest rock <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E
5|$|Little Catawissa Creek is {{considered}} by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery between its headwaters and Reservoir Road. Between Reservoir Road and {{the mouth of the}} creek, it {{is considered}} to be a Coldwater Fishery. The upper reaches of the creek, between its headwaters and a point slightly downstream of where it enters Schuylkill County are considered by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission to be Class A Wild Trout Waters and the rest of the creek's length is considered to be Approved Trout Waters. The upper reaches of the creek were Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1976 before becoming Class D Wild Trout Waters in 1984. This change was due to acid mine drainage <b>and</b> <b>sediment</b> buildup. However, the creek rebounded to Class A Wild Trout Waters by 1997. The creek is considered to be Class D Wild Trout Waters between T431 and T435.

5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%.

In this study, a 1 D flow <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> transport model is presented to simulate the hydrodynamics <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> transport in the distributary channel networks. The governing equations for river flow are the Saint-Venant equations <b>and</b> for suspended <b>sediment</b> transport are the nonequilibrium transport equations. The procedure of solving the governing equations is firstly to get the matrix form of the water level <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> concentration at all connected junctions by utilizing the transformation of the governing equations of the single channel. Secondly, the water level <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> concentration at all junctions can be obtained by solving these irregular spare matrix equations. Finally, the water level, discharge, <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> concentration at each river section can be calculated. The presented 1 D flow <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> transport model has been applied to the Pearl River networks and can reproduce water levels, discharges, <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> concentration with good accuracy, indicating this that model can be used to simulate the hydrodynamics <b>and</b> suspended <b>sediment</b> concentration in the distributary channel networks...|$|R
