5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter {{bees and}} mason bees are solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|E
5|$|Queen <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> {{bumblebees}} can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; by {{the same}} token, the sting is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E

The initial toll rates were announced in early 2007, {{with the lowest}} toll set at 75 cents. The toll road opened on November 19 of that year. The entire cost of the expressway portion was $843 million, paid for by South Bay Expressway to own the franchise on the tolled portion of SR 125. The interchange with SR 54 was constructed with $160 million of public funding.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are related to their nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, {{workers are}} all equally related genetically, <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E

5|$|Males {{are easy}} to {{identify}} due to their perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their antennae consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male <b>and</b> <b>worker</b> characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E

40|$|From an {{occupational}} health perspective, the match between work <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> {{was the central}} topic in this thesis. The term ‘work’ was used to encompass a combination of physical, mental and psychosocial work demands. The term ‘workers’ represents the resources of workers, in terms of physical, psychological and social capacities, health status and age. Studying the match between work <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> is essential for identifying highly demanding jobs requiring special requirements of the <b>worker,</b> <b>and</b> for identifying <b>workers</b> with specific health complaints, their associated impairments and desired adjustments. Identifying highly demanding jobs and work-related health complaints gives {{the opportunity to take}} preventive measures in the work situation in order to maintain workers’ health in their job, avoiding both increased risk of work-related complaints and an increasing burden of costs associated with health care, absenteeism and early retirement. The objective of this thesis was to gain knowledge on the match between work <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> in specific physically and mentally demanding work settings <b>and</b> specific <b>worker</b> populations (i. e. <b>workers</b> with disabilities <b>and</b> <b>workers</b> of different age groups) ...|$|R
