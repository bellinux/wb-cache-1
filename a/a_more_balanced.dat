5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after de-Stalinization and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|There {{is a local}} {{perception}} that Shepton Mallet has been in economic decline for some time. Some 350 manufacturing jobs {{were lost in the}} late 1990s and early years of the 21st century. However, the District Council asserts that, despite the loss of the manufacturing jobs on which Shepton Mallet has been historically dependent, more jobs in distribution, business services and public administration, health, education, quarrying, construction and hi-tech services (from companies such as the ISP Easynet) have been created, thereby creating <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> economy. In 2001, there were slightly more jobs in the town than economically active people, resulting in a small in-flow of workers.|$|E

25|$|Diversification (i.e. {{a greater}} range of commodities) {{over the past}} 15 years has {{provided}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> production base and less reliance on just a few major export markets, insulating the economy from fluctuations in world prices to some extent.|$|E
25|$|The {{nutritional}} {{balance of}} a raw diet can vary greatly {{depending on the}} recipe. Some raw diet proponents prefer to {{use a variety of}} ingredients, believing that will provide <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> diet than a single primary food.|$|E

25|$|A related though {{different}} style of bidding {{is for the}} players to bid individually, and partners' bids are then summed. The winning bid only decides trump; both (or all) teams' bids become their contract, meaning any team can score or be set. This creates <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> game.|$|E
25|$|The human {{security}} discourse {{was also used}} {{as a tool to}} resist aid policies becoming hijacked by narrow security concerns. States, such as the Republic of Ireland, promoted the Human Security concept as a way to ensure <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> approach to security and development issues both nationally and within the EU.|$|E
50|$|While WBLF's main {{competitor}} WRSC {{features a}} nearly entire lineup of conservative hosts such as Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, Michael Savage and Mark Levin, WBLF has <b>a</b> somewhat <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> lineup, airing Alan Colmes of Fox {{in addition to}} conservatives Dennis Miller and Rush Limbaugh.|$|R

25|$|In 2013, Isabela Granic {{and colleagues}} at Radboud University Nijmegen, the Netherlands, argued that even violent video games may promote learning, health, and social skills, but that not enough games had been {{developed}} to treat mental health problems.

25|$|The {{pursuit of}} state-controlled {{economic}} policies by Atatürk and İsmet İnönü {{was guided by}} a national vision: they wanted to knit the country together, eliminate foreign control of the economy, and improve communications.

50|$|Years {{later the}} Smithsonian Institution asked Manly for a {{monograph}} about the engine, {{and he wrote}} an account that significantly downplayed Balzer's contribution, reducing it to supplying a non-working design that he rebuilt.

25|$|At {{that time}} Edinburgh {{was the focus}} of {{geography}} within Scotland, with an active and lively scientific community from within which the seeds of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> and scientific approach to geography would emerge.

25|$|Mustafa Kemal and İsmet İnönü's {{pursuit of}} state-controlled {{economical}} policies {{was guided by}} a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey.

25|$|The Alfetta {{introduced}} a new drivetrain layout to the marque.

The suspension relied on double wishbones and torsion bars at the front and a De Dion tube at the rear.

25|$|In 2006, the Asian Cricket Council {{cancelled}} the Asian Test Championship, {{as well as}} the Asian and African Cup, due to {{the tightly}} packed international cricket tour schedule.

25|$|The stadium has an {{asymmetrical}} appearance {{from the}} air and from some angles from ground level, due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground. The height difference between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many seating positions inside the ground. Further expansion of the Gallowgate End could potentially produce <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>balanced</b> horseshoe arrangement of equal height stands, {{similar to that of}} Celtic Park.|$|E
