In fact, in an article published in The Times in 1838, countering a claim that she was a [...] "radical", Caroline stated: [...] "The natural position of woman is inferiority to man. Amen!

Nothing you can say or do will shake my forbearance. When I first found you in the dining-room, I acted most improperly; I lost my temper. I did worse; I was foolish enough and imprudent enough to send for a police officer. I owe you every possible atonement (afflicted as you are) for treating you in that cruel manner.

60|$|And then, in {{the fourth}} year of the BLUE WEEKLY'S career, came the Handitch election, and I was forced by the clamour of my antagonist, and very willingly forced, to put my {{convictions}} to the test.

60|$|In {{other and}} more {{sensible}} directions I sought also to progress. Gradually I was overcoming my shyness. It {{was a slow}} process. I found the best plan was not to mind being shy, to accept it <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> temperament, and with others laugh at it. The coldness of an indifferent world is of service in hardening a too sensitive skin. The gradual rubbings of existence were rounding off my many corners.

When I entered the hotel, the boxes were already being lugged about, and I had spoken a word to no one concerning them.
