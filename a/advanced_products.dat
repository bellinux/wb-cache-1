40|$|Summary: <b>Advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> were {{determined}} immunologically in blood from diabetics, patients with renal failure and subjects with various other diseases. Elevation of <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> levels in serum {{is not confined}} to the diabetic state but was also observed in some severely ill subjects. Patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis displayed high <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> levels in serum, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} diabetes. In contrast, <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> levels in uraemic subjects not treated by dialysis were not different from controls. In diabetics, levels of <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> were related to the state of late complications. Diabetics without sequelae showed <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> within the normal range, whereas in the presence of late complications mean <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> levels were elevated. In the case of retinopathy the increase in <b>advanced</b> glycation end <b>products</b> was associated with the severity of retinal status...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} on use of <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality information in meat processing. To serve segmented customer demand meat processors consider use of innovative sensor technology to sort meat products to customer orders. To assess {{the use of this}} sensor technology a discrete-event simulation model is built. Various scenarios were defined for processing strategy (buffered or non-buffered), the number of end product groups to sort to and the availability of product quality information. The performance of these scenarios is measured w. r. t. order compliance, labor consumption and throughput-time. Our results reveal that the current processing and product sorting strategy is in-effective for sorting to a large number of end product groups. Furthermore, the current availability of product quality information is insufficient to ensure high levels of order compliance for <b>advanced</b> <b>product</b> quality products...|$|R
