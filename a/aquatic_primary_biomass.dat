40|$|The {{emerging}} biofuel industry demands {{large amount}} of biomass feedstock. Although commercial ethanol has been produced from <b>primary</b> <b>biomass</b> sources such as corns, the global food crisis caused {{by the use of}} <b>primary</b> <b>biomass</b> has been raised. Thus, lignocellulosic biomass, known as second generation of biomass, has become a promising source for ethanol production. However, the more complex structure requires more advance technology. MSW with more than 60 % of biodegradable composition, as one of the promising biomass sources has the potential benefits of replacing <b>primary</b> <b>biomass</b> and preventing environment from MSW pollution. In this paper, three major biodegradable municipal solid waste (BMSW) components: kitchen organic waste (KOW), green organic waste (GOW) and paper and card waste (PCW), are classified and characterised according to substrate composition, cellulose crystallinity, bulk density and particle size. The substrate composition indicates how much cellulose, lignin, hermicellulose each model waste has. The cellulose content shows the potential glucose/ethanol product yield. Other chemical composition such as lignin and hemicellulose indicates how easy of each model waste can be converted. These contents are also important information when selecting pretreatment methods and conversion process conditions in the following steps. Based on the comprehensive understanding of biomass structures and compositions, studies look into the effects of substrate properties (such crystallinity, presence of lignin and cellulose content on process performances during enzymatic hydrolysis adsorption. Results indicated how the adsorption process is affected by the substrate properties. This provides understanding of the role of substrate properties during enzyme-cellulose adsorption...|$|R
40|$|Freshwaters in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR) are {{vulnerable}} to the atmospheric emissions and land disturbances caused by the local oil sands industry; however, they are also affected by climate change. Recent observations of increases in <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> production near the main development area have prompted questions about the principal drivers of these limnological changes. Is the enhanced primary production due to deposition of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from local industry or from recent climatic changes? Here, we use downcore, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a (VRS-chla) profiles (including diagenetic products) from 23 limnologically-diverse lakes with undisturbed catchments to characterize the pattern of primary production increases in the AOSR. Our aim is {{to better understand the}} relative roles of the local oil sands industry versus climate change in driving <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> production trends. Nutrient deposition maps, generated using geostatistical interpolations of spring-time snowpack measurements from a grid pattern across the AOSR, demonstrate patterns of elevated total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and bioavailable nitrogen deposition around the main area of industrial activity. However, this pattern is not observed for bioavailable phosphorus. Our paleolimnological findings demonstrate consistently greater VRS-chla concentrations compared to pre-oil sands development levels, regardless of morphological and limnological characteristics, landscape position, bioavailable nutrient deposition, and dibenzothiophene (DBT) -inferred industrial impacts. Furthermore, breakpoint analyses on VRS-chla concentrations across a gradient of DBT-inferred industrial impact show limited evidence of a contemporaneous change among lakes. Despite the contribution of bioavailable nitrogen to the landscape from industrial activities, we find no consistency in the spatial pattern and timing of VRS-chla shifts with an industrial fertilizing signal. Instead, significant positive correlations were observed between VRS-chla and annual and seasonal temperatures. Our findings suggest warmer air temperatures and likely decreased ice covers are important drivers of enhanced <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> production across the AOSR...|$|R

Riparian plants and <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers (<b>aquatic</b> plants, phytoplankton and periphyton) may be particularly affected by agrochemicals due to their taxonomic similarity to the intended targets (crop and weed species). The overall objective of this thesis {{was to assess the}} effects of fertilizers and the herbicide atrazine on riparian plants and <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers. Effects were assessed across varying scales of observation ranging from empirical field studies at the watershed scale to in-situ experimental manipulations in two temperate streams to a laboratory concentration-response experiment. Twenty-four stream/river sites located across the South Nation River watershed, Canada ranged in surrounding agricultural land use (6. 7 - 97. 4 % annual crops) and in-stream concentrations of reactive phosphate (4 - 102 μg/L) and nitrate (3 - 5404 μg/L). A gradient of atrazine contamination spanning two orders of magnitude (56 d time-weighted-average concentrations of 4 - 412 ng/L) was observed using polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS). A total of 285 riparian and aquatic plant species were identified with species richness ranging from 43 - 107 species per site. Atrazine and the percentage of surrounding annual crops had no statistically significant effects on community structure. In contrast, an increase in the percentage of non-native species, a decrease in submerged macrophytes and a decrease in overall floristic quality was observed along a gradient of increasing nitrate. Similarly, periphyton biomass increased with increasing nitrate across the watershed and was associated with the Chlorophyta. In contrast, no clear response was observed in periphyton exposed to nutrient enrichment and atrazine contamination in in-situ periphytometer experiments in two streams. Greenhouse concentration-response experiments provided evidence that the sensitivity of duckweed (Lemna minor) to atrazine was lower in populations previously exposed to the herbicide. However, the overall range in biomass 25 % inhibition concentrations was small (19 - 40 μg/L atrazine). A clear gradient in agrochemical contamination was observed at the watershed scale and this research provided evidence of negative effects on riparian and <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers.

We investigated {{the effects of}} an invasive riparian tree, Russian olive (Eleagnus angustifolia), on the ecosystem function of a desert spring stream, Deep Creek, Idaho. Reaches of Deep Creek were studied in the early 1970 s as a representative desert stream for the International Biological Program (IBP). The results of that study revealed that Deep Creek was an autotrophic (with primary production within the system meeting the energy demands for that community) stream which was exceptional because until then all streams {{were thought to be}} heterotrophic (relying on external terrestrial energy inputs to meet the energy demand in the system). One of the IBP study reaches has since been invaded by Russian olive, setting the stage for a unique before-after-invasion-control comparison. We repeated measures of community metabolism (which assesses primary production (P) and respiration (R)), allochthonous (leaf litter) inputs and standing stocks of <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers in invaded and control reaches. The ratio of gross primary production to respiration (P/R) at the control site and was similar to estimates from 1971 and 1972 in the summer and fall. At the invaded site P/R only decreased slightly during the summer but decreased from 1. 37 to 0. 47 in the fall, a change that appears to be driven by both decreased photosynthesis and by increased respiration. This change in trophic status may be associated with the more than 10 -fold increase in allochthonous input we observed at the invaded site during the fall. However, standing stock of <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers showed no evidence of having been affected by the presence of Russian olive.

Understanding nutrient and productivity trends in Lake Superior {{is necessary to}} better manage the largest freshwater lake in the world. Investigations of six sediment cores, from the western basin of Lake Superior, were used to characterize the greater lake basin. Sedimentary geochemical trends were measured as indicators of historic change due to effects associated with increasing population and land use changes in Lake Superior’s watershed. Measurements were concentrated within the last two centuries, providing historic context to evidence of observations of {{the mid to late}} 1800 s and into the present. Bulk and stable isotopic composition of C and N indicate that the lake has undergone productivity changes in response to nutrient availability within the strongly P-limited system. Interpretable response by the δ 13 C productivity proxy was significant despite the highly oligotrophic condition and low sedimentation rates of the lake. Primary production of the lake has shown a marked increase starting in the early 1900 s reaching a maximum in the 1960 s, heavier by 1. 7 ‰ on average (δ 13 CBulk), observed most strongly in proximity to the populated western end of the lake. Subsequent recovery from nutrient enrichment is observed as decreased productivity by 1980, in agreement with P reduction mandated by the United States and Canada. Measurements of n-alkane biomarkers were used as an additional method of determining changes in aquatic production. Carbon isotopic analysis of algal-derived biomarkers support bulk measurement indicating changes in <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> production drive the sedimentary organic geochemical record.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Relative {{effects of}} light, nutrients, and grazing on primary {{production}} were investigated in streams in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and in laboratory streams. Relative magnitudes of primary production and associated processes were examined {{for one year}} in a stream that flowed through a clearcut and an old-growth forest in the Cascade Mountains. Diel patterns of nutrients in four streams of different size indicated greater demand for inorganic nitrogen than phosphorus and suggested that uptake by <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers was responsible for diel fluctuations of nutrient concentrations. Atomic ratios of N/P supported the conclusion that primary producers were most probably nitrogen limited. In an experiment of light and nitrate addition to a stream in an old-growth forest, primary producer processes were enhanced by addition of light (11000 lux) and by addition of both light and nitrate. There was no effect of nitrate addition on accumulation of algae, gross primary production, net community primary production, community respiration, P/R ratios, or community structure of diatoms at low ambient light levels (1100 lux). Addition of light resulted in greater colonization of algae, gross primary production, net community primary production, community respiration, P/R ratios and altered community structure of diatoms. The watershed was clearcut one year later and the experiment was essentially repeated with artificial shading instead of artificial lighting. Responses of colonization and primary production to light and nitrate in the clearcut {{were similar to those}} observed in the previous experiment in the old-growth forest. Interactions between primary producers and grazers in lotic systems were examined in laboratory streams. Different densities of snails were established in laboratory channels; primary production in these channels was compared to production in a channel without grazers. Heavy and intermediate grazing resulted in decreases in standing crop of chlorophyll a, biomass/chlorophyll ratios, biomass of periphyton, gross primary production, and net community primary production. Low grazing densities did not significantly alter the above factors. Gross primary production increased with increasing standing crop of chlorophyll a but assimilation number was much greater at low standing crops; therefore, there was a partial compensatory mechanism for adjustment to grazing pressure. Total primary production was approximately equal at both high and intermediate densities of grazers and was greater at low densities of grazers and no grazing. Taxonomic structure of periphyton was altered by heavy and intermediate grazing but not changed at low grazing pressures. Snail growth increased with increasing biomass of periphyton. Responses of <b>aquatic</b> <b>primary</b> producers to canopy removal were examined in a clearcut and old-growth forest section of a stream in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Standing crop of chlorophyll a, biomass of periphyton, community respiration, assimilation number, and respiration per unit weight of periphyton were all significantly greater in the clearcut than in the old-growth forested section. Gross primary production was approximately 2. 5 times greater in the open section than in the shaded section. Turnover times of periphyton were shorter in the clearcut than in the old-growth forest site. Photosynthetic efficiency was greater in the shaded site than in the open section. Processes of primary production were generally enhanced in the clearcut section of Mack Creek as compared to the old-growth forested section.

We simulated daily 5 -hour hydropeaks for 5 days in an in situ, open air, experimental flume system fed by a 2 nd order stream in the Italian Alps.

Hydrographic conditions in 2012 were significantly different than in 2009, 2010, and 2011, driven largely by increased ice extent and thickness, later ice retreat, and earlier stratification of the water column. <b>Primary</b> producer <b>biomass</b> was more tightly coupled to hydrographic conditions in 2012 than in 2009 or 2011, and shallow and mid-column phytoplankton blooms tended to occur independent of one another. There was a high degree of variability in the relationships between different classes of secondary producers and hydrographic conditions, evidence of significant intra...|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} {{photosynthesis}} (P) and respiration (R) were calculated at 4 high order river sites {{during the dry}} season in tropical Australia when discharge is supplied by groundwater. The rivers were shallow, clear, and had low concentrations of nutrients. Increased irradiance at the riverbed, warmer water temperatures, and an increase in <b>primary</b> producer <b>biomass</b> over the dry season contributed to an approximate doubling of P. We surmise that most photosynthesis resulted in the production of dissolved organic carbon, rather than the growth of <b>primary</b> producer <b>biomass</b> which was nutrient limited. Respiration exceeded photosynthesis (P/R ~ 0. 5), and increased approximately linearly with P (r 2 = 0. 79 – 1. 00). Bacterial metabolism of photosynthetically produced dissolved organic carbon (PDOC) could partially explain the tight coupling of respiration and photosynthesis, though cannot account for the river’s overall net heterotrophy. The co-metabolism of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon, such as humic acids, by bacteria, which is made possible by the presence of readily degraded PDOC, provides an explanation for the river’s heterotrophy and the tight coupling between P and R...|$|R
