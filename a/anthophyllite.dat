The more magnesian-rich olivine-rich flow base facies tend {{to be free from}} tremolite and chlorite mineralogy and are dominated by either serpentine-brucite +/- <b>anthophyllite</b> if hydrated, or talc-magnesite if carbonated.

40|$|A new spectroscopic {{study of}} the {{orthorhombic}} amphiboles has been undertaken, using Mandouml;ssbauer and infrared spectroscopic techniques to determine site occupancies. The crystal structure of amphiboles is reviewed, and {{a new approach to}} the structures of chain silicates is outlined. Hydroxyl spectra of the specimens are of better quality than in the previous {{study of the}} orthoamphiboles (Law, 1969 / 70) and this allows a hyperfine structure to be seen in spectra of <b>anthophyllites.</b> Spectra are generally more difficult to interpret qualitatively than are spectra of related minerals, because of their complexity or because of low absorption intensities which characterise gedrite spectra. The development of a computer model for investigating the relationship between site occupancies and peak intensities allows, in principle, separate site populations for M 1 and M 3 sites to be determined from hydroxyl spectra. The Mandouml;ssbauer spectra, particularly of aluminium-rich gedrites, are too complex to be resolved completely, and this limits the accuracy of the site population information which can be obtained. Site occupancies are presented for the orthoamphiboles, however. A distinction is observed between high- and low-aluminium gedrites, and this empirical distinction is useful in discussing the properties of these amphiboles. </p...|$|R

25|$|There {{are thus}} two main classes of {{metamorphic}} komatiite; carbonated and hydrated. Carbonated komatiites and peridotites form {{a series of}} rocks dominated by the minerals chlorite, talc, magnesite or dolomite and tremolite. Hydrated metamorphic rock assemblages are dominated by the minerals chlorite, serpentine-antigorite, brucite. Traces of talc, tremolite and dolomite may be present, as it is very rare that no carbon dioxide is present in metamorphic fluids. At higher metamorphic grades, <b>anthophyllite,</b> enstatite, olivine and diopside dominate as the rock mass dehydrates.|$|E
25|$|Asbestos {{production}} {{began in}} the Urals of the Russian Empire in the 1880s, and in the Alpine regions of Northern Italy with the formation in Turin of the Italo-English Pure Asbestos Company in 1876, although this was soon swamped by the greater production levels from the Canadian mines. Mining also took off in South Africa from 1893 {{under the aegis of}} the British businessman Francis Oates, the Director of the De Beers company. It was in South Africa that the production of amosite began in 1910. The U.S. asbestos industry had an early start in 1858, when fibrous <b>anthophyllite</b> was mined for use as asbestos insulation by the Johns Company, a predecessor to the current Johns Manville, at a quarry at Ward's Hill on Staten Island, New York. US production began in earnest in 1899, with the discovery of large deposits in the Belvidere Mountain.|$|E
500|$|The sulfur deposits, {{south of}} Koh-i-Sultan's crater, are named Batar, Miri, Nawar and Zond and are within a [...] area. In the deposits, the sulfur {{is in the}} form of lenses within the {{volcanic}} rock. The Koh-i-Sultan deposits are the principal native source of sulfur in Pakistan. They were probably formed by the interaction of sulfuric acid and hydrogen sulfide or from sulfur-containing hot springs when the volcano was still active. Another theory suggests that they formed during the Holocene. Other mineral deposits found at Koh-i-Sultan are copper-containing alterations with alunite and quartz; alunogen, which can be used to obtain aluminium; limonite, used as a yellow dye, and a red ochre rock containing gypsum and <b>anthophyllite.</b> Copper deposits which also contain gold are part of an epithermal-sulfidic mineralization.|$|E
2500|$|Asbestos use {{dates back}} at least 4,500 years, when the {{inhabitants}} of the Lake Juojärvi region in East Finland strengthened earthenware pots and cooking utensils with the asbestos mineral <b>anthophyllite</b> (see Asbestos-ceramic). One of the first descriptions of a material that may have been asbestos is in Theophrastus, On Stones, from around 300 BC, although this identification has been questioned. In both modern and ancient Greek, the usual name for the material known in English as [...] "asbestos" [...] is amiantos ("undefiled", [...] "pure"), which was adapted into the French amiante and Portuguese amianto. In modern Greek, the word ἀσβεστος or ασβέστης stands consistently and solely for lime.|$|E
2500|$|Amphiboles {{have great}} {{variability}} in chemistry, described variously as a [...] "mineralogical garbage can" [...] or a [...] "mineralogical shark swimming {{a sea of}} elements". The backbone of the amphiboles is the 12−; it is balanced by cations in three possible positions, although the third position is not always used, and one element can occupy both remaining ones. Finally, the amphiboles are usually hydrated, that is, they have a hydroxyl group (−), although it can {{be replaced by a}} fluoride, a chloride, or an oxide ion. Because of the variable chemistry, there are over 80 species of amphibole, although variations, as in the pyroxenes, most commonly involve mixtures of Ca2+, Fe2+ and Mg2+. Several amphibole mineral species can have an asbestiform crystal habit. These asbestos minerals form long, thin, flexible, and strong fibres, which are electrical insulators, chemically inert and heat-resistant; as such, they have several applications, especially in construction materials. However, asbestos are known carcinogens, and cause various other illnesses, such as asbestosis; amphibole asbestos (<b>anthophyllite,</b> tremolite, actinolite, grunerite, and riebeckite) are considered more dangerous than chrysotile serpentine asbestos.|$|E

50|$|Retrogressive <b>anthophyllite</b> is {{relatively}} rare in ultramafic rocks {{and is usually}} poorly developed due to the lower energy state available for metamorphic reactions to progress and also the general dehydration of rock masses during metamorphism.
