5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the Walla Walla River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from the various flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E

5|$|Tragedy struck on 1 January 1862, when Arthur Brittan {{drowned in}} the Avon River while {{learning}} to swim. He got entangled in watercress, which the Brittans themselves had introduced to the Avon, {{and it took a}} half-hour for his body to be recovered. Arthur had left school by then and was helping his father on the farm. Joseph Brittan was heartbroken and there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> he went through a period of depression. Soon after the drowning, he advertised for both a dairyman and a farmworker, and even put Linwood House up for sale, though no property transaction was recorded.|$|E
5|$|Æthelhard {{resolved}} {{to go to}} Rome and consult with the pope about the decline in power of the see of Canterbury. The archbishop went to Rome along with Bishop Cyneberht of Winchester, and carried two letters from Coenwulf to the pope. After some discussions, Leo sided with Canterbury and demoted Lichfield back down to a bishopric. Besides these papal actions, there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the cathedral clergy of Canterbury never recognised the elevation of Lichfield.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{shows an}} excess of {{infrared}} emission compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide) near the star.

In addition to the presence of several planetesimal belts and cometary activity, there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> planets have formed within this disk and that the processes of planet formation may still be ongoing. Material from the Beta Pictoris debris disk is thought to be the dominant source of interstellar meteoroids in the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought has become much more frequent. There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E

The species is declining in Greece and Turkey because of habitat loss, and a large decrease in Israel {{is thought to be}} due to pesticides. In Somalia this bird is now rare. Migrating birds are shot in the countries around the eastern Mediterranean, despite legal protection in most countries, and there is some persecution of breeding birds in Greece and Syria, where this species is considered to be unlucky.

5|$|Synthetic {{diamonds}} {{for use as}} gemstones {{are grown}} by HPHT or CVD methods, and currently represent approximately 2% of the gem-quality diamond market. However, there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the market share of synthetic jewelry-quality diamonds may grow as advances in technology allows for larger higher-quality synthetic production on a more economic scale. They are available in yellow and blue, {{and to a lesser}} extent colorless (or white). The yellow color comes from nitrogen impurities in the manufacturing process, while the blue color comes from boron. Other colors, such as pink or green, are achievable after synthesis using irradiation. Several companies also offer memorial diamonds grown using cremated remains.|$|E

5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm {{is one of}} numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (two events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five events), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing {{threat to the}} remaining native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords began {{to build their own}} castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> Robert {{may have}} been briefly betrothed to a {{daughter}} of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, {{on his way back}} to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|According to monk and biographer Teodosije the Hilandarian, King Radoslav {{was a good}} ruler at first, {{but fell}} under the {{influence}} of his wife, Queen Anna, daughter of the Epirote ruler Theodore Komnenos Doukas (1216–1230). The Serbian nobility most likely disliked Radoslav due to this Greek influence. Radoslav was probably safe from domestic rebellion as long as Theodore remained strong. In 1230, Theodore was defeated and captured by Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, after which Radoslav's position seems to have weakened; some of his nobility revolted in the autumn of 1233. Teodosije said that the nobility no longer supported Radoslav, and instead supported Vladislav. Radoslav and his wife fled to Dubrovnik in 1233. He was unable to regain the kingdom, but eventually returned as a monk. There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> Radoslav organized rebellions against Vladislav, and that he thought that he would regain the throne. This is evident from a document dated February 4, 1234, which promised Ragusa trading privileges once Radoslav had returned to Serbia and become king again. Because of this, Vladislav began threatening Ragusa, which then turned to Ban Matej Ninoslav of Bosnia for help. The revolt against Vladislav was unsuccessful, and Radoslav joined the court of Epirote ruler Manuel in Dyrrhachium.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{research}} {{points out}} some other intriguing possibilities regarding the early {{origins of the}} Polish state in Greater Poland. There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the processes {{that led to the}} establishment of the Piast state began during the period ca. 890-910. During these years, a tremendous civilizational advancement took place in central Greater Poland, as the unearthed products of all kinds that have been discovered are better made and more elaborate. The timing coincides with the breakdown of the Great Moravian state caused by the Magyar invasions. Before and after its fall in 905-07, many Great Moravian people, fearing for their lives, had to escape. According to the notes made by Constantine VII, they found refuge in neighboring countries. Decorations found in Sołacz graves in Poznań have their counterparts in burial sites around Nitra in Slovakia. In the Nitra area, there was also in medieval times a well-known clan named Poznan. The above indicates that the Poznań town was established by Nitran refugees, and more generally, the immigrants from Great Moravia contributed to the sudden awakening of the otherwise remote and isolated Piast lands.|$|E

5|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{that in the}} years following the premiere, L'Orfeo may have been staged in Florence, Cremona, Milan and Turin, though firmer evidence suggests that the work attracted limited interest beyond the Mantuan court. Francesco may have mounted a production in Casale Monferrato, where he was governor, for the 1609–10 Carnival, and there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> the work was performed on several occasions in Salzburg between 1614 and 1619, under the direction of Francesco Rasi. Years later, during the first flourish of Venetian opera in 1637–43, Monteverdi chose to revive his second opera, L'Arianna there, but not L'Orfeo. There is some evidence of performances shortly after Monteverdi's death: in Geneva in 1643, and in Paris, at the Louvre, in 1647. Although according to Carter the work was still admired across Italy in the 1650s, it was subsequently forgotten, as largely was Monteverdi, until the revival of interest in his works in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Ívarr's {{connection}} to the Manx attack on the invading forces of Eóghan and Magnús may suggest that there was still considerable opposition on Mann by adherents of Haraldr Guðrøðarson to the prospect of Magnús' kingship there. Two years later, the Chronicle of Mann and the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost record that Magnús returned to Mann and {{with the consent of}} the Manxmen began his reign. There <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> opposition to Magnús, and thus possibly support of Haraldr Guðrøðarson, continued into the mid 1250s. For example, the chronicle records that Hákon bestowed upon Magnús the title of king in 1254; and further notes that, when Magnús' opponents heard of this bequeathment, they became dismayed and their hopes of overthrowing him gradually faded away. Furthermore, Henry's 1256 letter, which orders his men not to receive Haraldr Guðrøðarson and Ívarr, may indicate that the two were still alive and active at the time. Whatever the case, Magnús, the last reigning king of the Crovan dynasty, ruled unchallenged as King of Mann and the Isles until his death in 1265.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, even though there <b>are</b> <b>indications</b> <b>that</b> before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards {{had seen in the}} 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E
