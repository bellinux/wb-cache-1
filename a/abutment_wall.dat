50|$|There is {{no record}} of there having been a bridge over the River Wye at Hay, till past {{the middle of the}} 18th century. In remote times the {{inhabitants}} of the town and feudal lords of Hay Castle, most likely looked upon the Wye as a serviceable barrier against a sudden incursion of an enemy from that quarter; whilst for all legitimate purposes the coracle or the ford would give ample accommodation. But as the people of the district became more civilized, they would naturally desire a less primitive means of crossing the river; public subscriptions were invited, and as a result a large <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> and three piers were built, but then the work stopped for want of funds, but in the 29th year of the reign of George II., an act of parliament was obtained, appointing commissioners with powers to erect a bridge and to levy tolls for its maintenance. The following were the commissioners first appointed, viz.: Sir Edward Williams, Bart.; Thomas Beavan, of Court Evan Gwynn, George Devereux, Thomas Hughes, Esq.; Roger Jones, gent.; James Price, gent.; William Stephens, clerk; Henry Probert Howarth, clerk; John Jones, apothecary; Hugh Price, John Gwynn, Edward Allen, Henry Wellington, mercer; and Thomas Beavan, of the Court of Clyro. By authority of this act the commissioners entered into a covenant with Thomas Jones, of Llanthomas, John Harris, of Eardisley, and James Lloyd Harris of the town of Kington, for the erection of a bridge, and granting to them and their heirs a lease of the tolls arising therefrom for a period of 98 years, from 1 October 1768, at the expiration of which term the bridge would revert to the trustees for the time being. The said Thomas Jones was to pay the expense of procuring the Act of Parliament, which cost £278 8s. 4d., and other things! The lessees built a stone bridge consisting of seven arches over the Wye, and made the approaches on both sides. In February, 1795, the centre part and south end of the bridge was washed away by a great flood, which happened after the breaking up of a long and severe frost. Two arches only were left standing on the Raduorshire side, or north side, of the river. Long before this period the three lessees were dead. After the flood and the falling down of the bridge, James Lloyd Harris (son of one of the lessees) erected a temporary bridge of wood across the river, and continued to receive the tolls. Within the following five years he erected a timber bridge from the Brecknockshire side of the river, to communicate with the two stone arches of the old stone bridge which had been left standing by the flood. This was in contravention to the lease, because a stone bridge should have been erected. In 1839, the Dulas Bridge was described as having one arch.|$|E
40|$|Drilled shaft {{groups are}} often {{designed}} to resist lateral loads for transportation structures. The shaft group capacity usually {{corresponds to a}} load being applied at the shaft cap level. However, in <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> applications, the lateral load is, in fact, applied well above the cap elevation. Thus, the load is transferred to the cap with an additional moment, causing the cap to deflect and rotate more than if this added moment were absent. As a result, the lateral capacity for a given allowable deflection of the group should be reduced because of this effect. Design engineers usually select or approve the allowable deflection {{at the top of}} the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall.</b> However, deflection at the cap level is needed to design the group capacity. The main objective of this paper is to report the results from a series of finite element analyses on <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> cap configurations to study the effect of moment on the capacity of the shaft group under lateral load. A scaling factor is defined as the ratio between the group capacity at any load application point height and the group capacity for load applied at the cap level, and was found to be dependent on the wall height, spacing between shafts, and cap deflection level, and more or less independent on the soil type, cap thickness and shaft diameter.

Since, {{the effect of}} backfill soil resistance on {{behavior of}} <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> movement was mostly neglected in previous researches, the abutment-backfill interaction {{was selected as the}} research study area and therefore, deriving the final abutment displacement profile was set as the research objective. In frame abutment integral bridges, the superstructure is encased into the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> in which produces a fixed connectivity. This connection results in the same movement of abutment top elevation and the bridge superstructure. Furthermore, the abutment is mostly built in reinforced concrete, thus it acts as a rigid mass with a linear deformation behavior. With regard to these points and applying a new method for calculation of bridge deck displacement, the abutment deformation profile was formulated. In the new applied method, the final bridge deck displacement was expressed as a function of backfill soil resistance utilizing some available correlations due to soil behavior, such as British Standard, Massachusetts, Canadian and Husain-Bagnaroil. Fortunately, the results obtained from these correlations were in a close agreement with each other, which confirmed the integrity of applied method. Moreover, a finite element model was built in SAP 2000 for this case and subsequently the outcomes were compared with the results of applied method.

40|$|Problem statement: In this study, the {{behavior}} of <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> in full height frame&# 13; integral abutment bridges was investigated. It was seen {{that the effect of}} backfill soil resistance on&# 13; behavior of <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> movement is mostly neglected in previous studies. In this research, the final&# 13; bridge superstructure displacement under temperature-induced forces was formulated. In addition,&# 13; according to the final bridge displacement, the earth pressure that acts as a resistant force on the bridge&# 13; abutment using the new equation from British design manual for roads and bridges, BA 42 / 96 was&# 13; used. Besides, in the construction of integral bridges, the deck and girders are mostly encased into&# 13; <b>abutment</b> <b>wall,</b> which makes these bridge components as fixed elements. This fix connectivity makes&# 13; the top <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> move along with the bridge deck. Moreover, the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> in integral&# 13; bridges is made of reinforced concrete and thus, it could be assumed as a rigid mass that has a linear&# 13; deformation behavior. Approach: To implement a new method to calculate the amount of abutment&# 13; wall movement at different elevations in full height frame abutment integral bridges, considering the&# 13; parameters such as temperature changes, bridge deck elongation and the backfill soil resistance. First,&# 13; internal forces of the bridge abutment were formulated. They were all presented as functions of bridge&# 13; deck final displacement. Second, different methods to calculate the soil lateral pressure were used. &# 13; Third, the numerical modeling was applied and the corresponding results due to the bridge deck&# 13; elongation were extracted. Fourth, the results obtained from phases two and three were compared to&# 13; obtain some conclusion. Results: The results derived in this study, consisted of four data sets. First, the&# 13; existing forces such as the bridge deck elongation force, the backfill soil resistance etc. were&# 13; formulated according to the bridge final displacement. Then after, the static principals revealed the&# 13; amount of deck final elongation. For the second set, different correlations such as British Standard,&# 13; Massachusetts manual and etc. which had considered the effect of deck final displacement in their&# 13; formulas were presented and with regard to the first part, the backfill reactions were obtained. For the&# 13; third set, by combining the results from set one and two, different values for the deck final&# 13; displacement were derived. For the next step, according to the fix connectivity of the abutment and the&# 13; bridge deck, the abutment top elevation displacement was set equal to the deck final displacement. For&# 13; the bottom elevation, because of the rigidity of the wall and the rotational behavior about its&# 13; foundation, the displacement was set zero. Therefore, by assuming linear deformation behavior of rigid&# 13; masses, the abutment deformation profile for different elevations was concluded. For the last set, the&# 13; bridge computer model was built using SAP 2000 and the corresponding results were collected. &# 13; Conclusion: It was seen that, generally, except for some certain cases, all the used correlations in this&# 13; study were in a close agreement either with each other or with the Finite Element data. British&# 13; Standard method had the closest results to the finite element data and thus preferably it is&# 13; recommended while the others not denied...|$|E

However, such elimination may have an adverse effect on the displacement demand at the pile-abutment connection and on the earth pressures on the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> due to the thermal expansion/contraction cycles of the bridge. These adverse effects have resulted in regulations that impose restrictions on the maximum length and skew angle of integral abutment bridges.

40|$|To reduce {{long-term}} {{maintenance costs}} {{arising from the}} deterioration of concrete bridges due to leaky expansion joints, integral bridges have been becoming increasingly popular in many countries.

These have adverse effects {{on the performance of}} integral bridges in terms of deformation mechanisms, lateral earth pressures acting on the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall,</b> bending moment and axial stress in the deck. All these are of great concern to engineers. Centrifuge model tests were conducted on spread-base integral bridge abutments to simulate these temperature effects on the soil-structure interaction. Thermal expansion and contraction of the deck were modelled by imposing controlled cyclic displacements {{at the top of the}} <b>abutment</b> <b>wall.</b> Substantial horizontal sliding and the rocking of the abutment due to soil densification and "strain" ratchetting were observed.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringDunja PericIntegral Abutment Bridges (IABs) are Jointless Bridges {{whereby the}} deck is {{continuous}} and monolithic with <b>abutment</b> <b>walls.</b> IABs are outperforming their non-integral counterparts in economy and safety. Their principal advantages {{are derived from}} the absence of expansion joints and sliding bearings in the deck, making them the most cost-effective system in terms of construction, maintenance, and longevity. The main purpose of constructing IABs is to prevent the corrosion of structure due to water seepage through joints. The simple and rapid construction provides smooth, uninterrupted deck that is aesthetically pleasing and safer for riding. The single structural unit increases the degree of redundancy enabling higher resistance to extreme events. However, the design of IABs not being an exact science poses certain critical issues. The continuity achieved by this construction results in thermally induced deformations. These in turn introduce a significantly complex and nonlinear soil-structure interaction into the response of <b>abutment</b> <b>walls</b> and piles of the IAB. The unknown soil response {{and its effect on}} the stresses in the bridge, creates uncertainties in the design. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the mechanism of load transfer due to thermal expansion, which is also dependent on the type of the soil adjacent to the <b>abutment</b> <b>walls</b> and piles, a 3 D finite element analysis is carried out on a representative IAB using state-of-the-art finite element code ABAQUS/Standard 6. 5 - 1.

However, such elimination may have an adverse effect on the displacement demand at the pile-abutment connection and on the earth pressures on the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> due to the thermal expansion/contraction cycles of the bridge. These adverse effects have resulted in regulations that impose restrictions on the maximum length and skew angle of integral abutment bridges. This research consisted of a deep analysis of the problem by considering soil-structure interaction. The approach was multifaceted as it included experimental and numerical analysis. The experiments consisted of laboratory tests and large-scale filed tests, as well as monitoring of full-scale bridges already instrumented in Indiana.

The following parameters were investigated to develop recommendations for the design of integral abutment bridges: bridge length, skew angle, foundation stiffness, <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> stiffness, concrete shrinkage, and the sequence of loading. The parametric study results indicated that the maximum length and skew angle for integral abutment bridges with medium to stiff soils in the foundations could be 500 -ft and 60 o, respectively.

It was suggested based on past experiences that even though the bridge structure during a seismic event could remain linear, the nonlinear abutment-soil interaction can lead to significant system nonlinearity. Therefore, it is recommended that for the realistic system response prediction, the abutment-soil interaction is included in the bridge response studies. In SAP 2000 models, pounding and nonlinear abutment-soil response are modeled using a combination of springs as shown in Figure 5. The nonlinear gap element ensures that no pressure is applied to the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> during a reversal, whereas the nonlinear elasto-plastic spring constitutes the soil properties (with optional post yield stiffness).

40|$|Bridge {{abutments}} provide {{resistance to}} deformation and earthquake induced inertial forces from the bridge superstructure. In order to limit the inertial forces transmitted into the abutment walls and piles, the abutment walls {{are designed to be}} sheared off in major seismic events. Therefore, the force-resistance mechanism of bridge abutments in the longitudinal direction is mainly provided by backwall-soil interaction. Current design practice in California makes use of bi-linear load- deformation curve and does not account for the structure backfill properties. An experimental and an analytical research program were conducted at UCSD to further investigate such structure backfill interaction characteristics. In order to meet the objectives of this research project, a field investigation was conducted to develop a proper characterization of the soil types used for abutment structure backfills. The experimental program included five large-scale tests. In {{the first phase of the}} experiment, an <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> (without a foundation) was built at 50 % scale of a prototype diaphragm abutment. The second phase of this research program was performed on a backwall sheared off from wingwalls and stem in seat-type abutments. The specific aims of the experimental program were to examine the effect of structure backfill soil type, backfill height, vertical movement of the wall, and pre- existing cut slope in backfilling on stiffness and capacity of the abutments in the longitudinal direction. An analytical model was developed for evaluating the response of bridge abutments loaded longitudinally. The approach involves calculating maximum passive resistance of the structure backfill material, and creating p-y curves to predict the force-displacement relationship of longitudinally loaded bridge abutments. The finite element program Plaxis 2 D was used to model the <b>abutment</b> <b>wall</b> experiments. The procedure was validated by comparing the finite element results with the experimental results. In conclusion, the study indicates that the response of bridge abutments in the longitudinal direction is nonlinear and a function of several factors which need to be considered. The passive resistance of the structure backfill is controlled by the soil shear strength and the interface friction angle. Finally, the vertical movement of the wall has a significant effect on post-peak behavior of abutment...|$|E

Toll houses were built {{at each end of the}} bridge, and the one on the Teignmouth side survives.|$|R

50|$|A {{sandstone}} {{parapet wall}} {{runs along the}} eastern edge {{at the top of}} each <b>abutment.</b> The <b>walls</b> terminate in rectangular sandstone columns. These columns extend downwards to form pilasters on the eastern facades of the abutments. A narrow projecting sandstone coping runs along the top of each parapet wall.|$|R
