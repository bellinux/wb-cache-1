500|$|Reagan's {{policies}} {{proposed that}} economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were {{low enough to}} spur investment, which would then lead to higher employment and wages. Critics labeled this [...] "trickle-down economics"—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a [...] "trickle-down" [...] effect to the poor. Questions arose whether Reagan's policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty, and many poor and minority citizens viewed Reagan as indifferent to their struggles. These views were exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Reagan's economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at $3.35 an hour, slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60%, cutting the budget for public housing and Section 8 rent subsidies in half, and eliminating the antipoverty Community Development Block Grant program. The widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before Reagan's economic policies took effect. Along with Reagan's 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income, he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20%. Reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%. Reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times {{over the course of his}} presidency, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> fiscal responsibility. According to Paul Krugman, [...] "Over all, the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut; as a share of GDP, the increase was substantially larger than Mr.Clinton's 1993 tax increase." [...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut.|$|E

2500|$|According to William A. Niskanen, one of {{the architects}} of Reaganomics, [...] "Reagan {{delivered}} on each of his four major policy objectives, although not {{to the extent that}} he and his supporters had hoped", and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a [...] "major reversal in the tax treatment of business income", with effect of [...] "reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment". Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President's calculus, such as Congress. President Reagan raised taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> fiscal responsibility, but the overall tax burden went down during his presidency.

[...] According to historian and domestic policy adviser Bruce Bartlett, Reagan's tax increases over the course of his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut. Though since the Reagan tax reductions, top marginal tax rates have remained lower than at any point in US history since 1931, when the top marginal rate was raised from 25% to 63%.|$|E
