500|$|Fortitude South {{has been}} {{credited}} with ensuring the German 15th Army was not deployed against the Allied invasion force too soon and ensuring the success of Operation Overlord. Gerhard Weinberg stated that the Germans [...] "readily accepted the existence and location" [...] of FUSAG, believed {{the threat to the}} Pas de Calais was real and [...] "it was only at the end of July" [...] that they realized a second assault was not coming; [...] "by that time, {{it was too late to}} move reinforcements". However, Mary Barbier wrote [...] "it is time to consider that the importance of the deception has been overrated". She argues that 15th Army was largely immobile and not combat-ready, that despite the deception numerous German divisions – including the 1st SS Panzer Division, which was held in reserve behind the 15th Army – from across Europe were transferred to Normandy to repel the invasion, and that the Germans had realized as early as May that a real threat to Normandy existed. Barbier further commented that while the Germans believed the deception due to [...] "preconceived ideas about the importance of the Pas De Calais", the <b>Allied</b> <b>staff</b> had overestimated the effectiveness of the deception after the 15th Army's inaction because they held a [...] "preconceived notion of what FORTITUDE would accomplish". Following the Battle of Normandy, the phantom 80th Division was [...] "transferred" [...] around the east coast of England, moving back and forth between VII Corps and the equally bogus II Corps. The division was eventually [...] "disbanded" [...] in April 1945.|$|E

[...] Other intelligence described the Japanese defenders as [...] "sick and malnourished" [...] when in fact, at least 6,500 from the Imperial Japanese Army and marines from the Special Naval Landing Forces held the beachhead. They were largely experienced troops, in good spirit, well prepared and well provisioned. What had filtered down to the GIs making the attack on 19 November, was that there were only two squads of Japanese at Buna.|$|R

40|$|In 2001 the Child Development Unit (CDU) in Brisbane piloted {{a series}} of monthly {{multidisciplinary}} case discussions via videoconference {{in the area of}} child development. During 2001 two sessions were provided; during 2004 there were 40. The substantial growth in 2004 was due to the expansion of child development services to include special interest group meetings and multipoint case conference meetings. In 2004, a total of 49 h of videoconferencing was conducted. The average session length was 75 min. Education and training sessions were delivered to 32 hospitals and health centres in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The maximum number of sites involved during a single videoconference was 25. The average number of attendees for each videoconference was five per site, including <b>allied</b> health <b>staff,</b> nurses and paediatricians.
