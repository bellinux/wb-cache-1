40|$|Abstract: Qualitative {{research}} on the perceptions of industrial relations stakeholders of the persistence of gender wage inequality during the period 1990 to 2003 is reported. During this period {{the gap between the}} <b>average</b> <b>weekly</b> ordinary time <b>earnings</b> of women and men working full time in Australia decreased by only one and a half percentage points, from 17 percent in 1990, to 15. 5 percent in 2003 and the gap in Western Australia widened by 5 percentage points. Interviewees and the literature indicated that gender wage inequality was greatest within occupations whilst also occurring between occupations. Stakeholders interviewed felt that gender-related social/cultural values pervade the formal system of industrial relations as well as the wider society. These social/cultural values, changing slower than economic and industrial relations factors, result in persistent gender wage inequality as these values affect occupational choice before the market, the availability of jobs and training in the market and thus wages. Stakeholders showed that they believed that their gender-related values affected actions taken to, and decisions made in, industrial tribunals. Remedies for gende...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in wage {{inequality}} and the rising incidence of low earnings in the 1980 ’s can be traced {{in large part to}} the sharp decline in the real hourly wages of lowskill men. This paper examines alternative explanations for this wage collapse. A widely accepted story is that this collapse reflected declining demand (job opportunities) for low-skill jobs, a consequence of biased technological change. The result was skill mismatch: too few low-skill jobs for the low-skill workforce. The evidence described in this paper offers little support for this hypothesis; while substantial shifts in the skill mix of employment took place between 1973 and 1983, there was little skill restructuring after 1983. Crucially, however, it was in this latter period that we observe the highest rates of investment in computer-based technologies by firms in all sectors of the economy. An alternative “shifting wage norms ” explanation is proposed. A survey of the evidence suggests that many employers began to adopt low-wage human resource strategies in the late 1970 ’s. These employment practices undermined traditional wage-setting institutions (collective bargaining, internal labor market norms) that had protected low-skilled workers from the full force of labor market competition. In addition, these practices, together with unprecedented increases in the supply of low-skill foreign workers, resulted in a massive increase in the effective supply of labor competing for low-skill jobs. These developments led to a collapse of wages at the bottom of the wage distribution, a collapse facilitated by a 25 percent decline in the real value of the legal minimum wage in the 1980 ’s. After rising for almost three decades, the <b>average</b> real <b>weekly</b> <b>earnings</b> of produc-tion and nonsupervisory workers fell by 7. 5 percent between 1973 and 1979 and b...|$|R
