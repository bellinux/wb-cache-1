By 1994, 53% of the Grammar School's pupils held assisted places, the highest proportion of all schools in the scheme.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{declared}} war on Germany on 4 August 1914, {{and as part of}} the British Empire, Southern Rhodesia was also now at war. The British South Africa Company (which then administered the territory) took no steps to aid recruiting for the forces, so many men paid their own fares to England to join up. A number of eligible recruits could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> so Guest, together with Captain Alwyn Knowles of the Bedfordshire Regiment, who as a reserve officer was awaiting his call-up, organised a private fund to pay their passages. When the recruits arrived in England they were enlisted by Captain (later Colonel) John Banks Brady (who was in 1934 to be elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly as member for Bulawayo North) to form a Rhodesian platoon in the King's Royal Rifle Corps.|$|E

5000|$|Silk {{was born}} in Kings Norton, Worcestershire, England. She studied in Birmingham, then, {{following}} the advice of Theodore Lierhammer, in Vienna under Johannes Ress. She later confessed to having been initially [...] "disappointed" [...] by Ress, who insisted on her studying coloratura rather than her preferred Lieder by Hugo Wolf and Johannes Brahms. However she recognised that his training gave her a good vocal technique, and she relished the opportunities pre-First World War Vienna <b>afforded</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> operas and concerts, also spending afternoons hearing Ferruccio Busoni playing the piano.|$|R
25|$|Concerned that {{he might}} not be able to <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a university, Wilson tried to enlist in the United States Army. He planned to earn U.S. {{government}} financial support for his education, but failed the Army medical examination due to his impaired eyesight. Wilson was able to afford to enroll in the University of Alabama after all, earning his B.S. and M.S. degrees in biology there in 1950. In 1952 he transferred to Harvard University.|$|E
25|$|In Toronto, blockos are {{a form of}} block party {{based on}} a {{tradition}} of outdoor gatherings in the West Indies. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out to restaurants, clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) developments without incident.|$|E

Dunkle was interested in aviation and went to Seattle to take flying lessons, where he became friends with Mills and Waterworth. With aviation becoming popular in Alaska, many Alaskans wanted to learn to fly, but could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Seattle for lessons. Dunkle encouraged Mills and Waterworth to open a flying school in Anchorage and offered to make them a loan in exchange for free flying lessons when they moved to Alaska.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|The young Mueller enjoyed reading {{science fiction}} and, helped by his grandfather, {{woodworking}} – although his first model ship capsized. When he was aged 11 or 12 Mueller also built and raced model aircraft – such as gliders and rubber band model airplanes. Always curious {{about how things}} worked, he also built radios, {{following in the footsteps}} of his father. Interested in these activities, the teenage Mueller wanted to be an aeronautical engineer but discovered that where he could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to school, the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy (now Missouri University of Science and Technology) in Rolla, Missouri, there was no aeronautical engineering department. They did offer mechanical engineering, so he enrolled in that program but found it discouraging and switched to electrical engineering.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{decided to}} help fight for the Empire and sent 6,500 mounted troops to assist the British efforts, making the war New Zealand's first {{overseas}} military campaign. Virtually every man in New Zealand was desperately keen to get to war, so the first soldiers to go were {{selected on the basis}} of who could <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> If a man could provide his own horse, rifle and equipment, costing about £25 in total, he could go to war. The first two of the 10 contingents paid their own way. The proposal to send the first contingent – 200 mounted riflemen – was approved by Parliament prior to the outbreak of war on 28 September 1899. Prime Minister Richard Seddon's proposition to do so was overwhelmingly supported, meeting opposition from only five members of parliament.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km). Yalta is crowded in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation are very high. Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to the Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch had thus in fact {{imposed a}} pax neerlandica on the Baltic region. They leaned {{then to the}} Danes, then to the Swedes, but never forgot Dutch {{interests}} in the process. This was, of course, highly resented by all parties involved, not least the English, and also France, which now began to revive from its weak diplomatic position during the minority of Louis XIV of France and the subsequent ministry of Cardinal Mazarin. During the early 1660s English diplomats were highly successful in fomenting all kinds of trouble for the Dutch in Copenhagen and Stockholm. Denmark, in particular, seemed amenable to a reversal of alliances in the {{events leading up to}} the Second Anglo-Dutch War. However, when that war broke out, the Danes decided that they simply could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> against Dutch wishes, and they again sided with the Republic by closing the Sound to English commerce.|$|E

C. Robert Cargill of Ain't It Cool News adds that only those over 35, [...] "who have savings accounts and weren't tapped out by Christmas," [...] can <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the movies regularly then.

500|$|According to Angelou, the book's title {{came from}} the rent parties of the 1920s and 1930s, where people would pay the host an {{inexpensive}} entry fee and then eat and drink throughout the weekend. As Angelou stated, people would [...] "sing and swing and get merry like Christmas so one would have some fuel with which to live {{the rest of the}} week". These parties, also called [...] "parlor socials", were attended by members of the working class who were unable to <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Harlem's more expensive clubs. As critic Mary Jane Lupton stated, [...] "The concept of the rent party helps describe Angelou's position...She is a single mother from the South who goes to California and sings and swings for a living. She entertains others for little money as a singer, B-girl, and dancer, without getting very merry at all". Scholar Sondra O'Neale described the phrase as [...] "a folkloric title symbolic of the author's long-deserved ascent to success and fulfillment".|$|E
500|$|Árbenz {{was born}} in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, the second-largest city in the country, in 1913. He {{was the son of}} a Swiss German pharmacist, also named Jacobo Árbenz, who immigrated to Guatemala in 1901. His mother was a Ladino woman from a middle-class family. His family was {{relatively}} wealthy and upper-class; his childhood has been described as [...] "comfortable". At some point during his childhood, his father became addicted to morphine and began to neglect the family business. He eventually went bankrupt, forcing the family to move to a rural estate that a wealthy friend had set aside for them [...] "out of charity". Jacobo had originally desired to be an economist or an engineer, but since the family was now impoverished, he could not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a university. He initially did not want to join the military, but there was a scholarship available through the Escuela Politécnica for military cadets. He applied, passed all of the entrance exams, and entered as a cadet in 1932. His father committed suicide two years after Árbenz entered the academy.|$|E

This mean you made the tie seriously {{and you have the}} intention of letting it tied permanently or the knot is not easily loosened. Or you just cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> let <b>go</b> some precious item. For example when you tie one end of a rope, with big wild buffalo on the other end, onto a tree, you have to use this 'Kinorut' method so that your rope won't get loose from the tree with the precious commodity. For example a Dusun bring in a buffalo to a bazaar, he'll tie one end of the buffalo rope on a tree and using 'Kinorut' method. Kinarut is inhabited also by the Dusun-kadazan anyway.|$|R

[...] At the same time Panahi began experimenting with photography and making short films with an 8mm film camera. He also acted in one film and assisted Kanoon's library director in running a program that taught children how to operate a film camera. Starting at the age of twelve, Panahi would work after school in order to <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> see films.

2500|$|Bolsa Família is {{a social}} welfare program of the Brazilian government. The program {{attempts}} to both reduce short-term poverty by direct cash transfers and fight long-term poverty by increasing human capital among the poor through conditional cash transfers. It also works to give free education to children who cannot <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to school to show the importance of education. The {{part of the program}} that is about direct welfare benefits could perhaps best be described as a basic income with some prerequisites. Families with children, to be eligible for the income, must ensure that their children attend school and have been vaccinated. The Bolsa Familia program has been mentioned as one factor contributing to the reduction of poverty in Brazil, which fell 27.7% during the first term in the Lula administration. About 12 million Brazilian families receive funds from Bolsa Família, which has been described as [...] "the largest programme {{of its kind in the}} world." ...|$|E
