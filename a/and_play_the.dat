5|$|The Minnesota Wild of the NHL play in St. Paul at the Xcel Energy Center.

5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for a clash of heads with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to {{ever play}} in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a route that is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game in Fort Wayne.|$|E

5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and play them at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{marketing}} strategies {{were used to}} market the game. The official L.A. Noire website was redesigned on 27 January 2011 to show a preview of characters and cases in the game. On 25 April 2011, L.A. Noire was honoured as an official selection at the Tribeca Film Festival, becoming the first video game to do so. Rockstar also ran a competition to win a trip to Los Angeles to attend the Festival of Film Noir Grauman's Egyptian Theatre, <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game a month before its official release. L.A. Noire {{was the focus of}} the 15 April 2011 episode of GameTrailers TV with Geoff Keighley, which featured interviews with the development team and previews of the MotionScan technology.|$|E

5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Crozier started {{all of his}} team's games, the last goalie {{to do so in}} the NHL. He also led the league in both wins and shutouts with 40 and 6 respectively. His 2.42 GAA was the second lowest in the league. At the end of the season, Crozier was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie and he was also named to the NHL First All-Star Team. During his sophomore season, Crozier missed the team's first couple of games due to pancreatitis. He would return <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> team's {{remaining}} 64 games, posting 27 wins and leading the league with seven shutouts. The Red Wings were also able to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Benefiting from Crozier's strong play in the playoffs, the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals. After eliminating the Black Hawks in the semi-finals, the Red Wings squared off against the Montreal Canadiens in the 1966 Stanley Cup Finals. The Red Wings won the first two games, but the Canadiens came back and won the next two. During the game four loss, Crozier suffered a leg injury. Although Crozier returned for game five, the injury limited his mobility. In the end, the Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in game six. Even though the Red Wings lost the Stanley Cup, Crozier was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is awarded to the most valuable player in the playoffs. He became the first goaltender to win the award and also the first player to win it in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 {{during the}} IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships. The two sides {{agreed on the}} terms: four games in Canada, {{to be held in}} Montreal (Montreal Forum), Toronto (Maple Leaf Gardens), Winnipeg (Winnipeg Arena), and Vancouver (Pacific Coliseum) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace. The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> games under {{international}} rules. The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen system in place in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Joe Kryczka, president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), who was present at the negotiations, felt however, that the Soviets had demanded the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team. The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The Mets {{were tied}} with the Cubs and Giants in the wild-card race as {{late in the}} season as September 25 at 88–72. However, the Mets lost their {{remaining}} two games and finished their season one game back of the Cubs and Giants who ended tied at 89–73. This record was also the best non-division-winning record and as such a tie-breaker was necessary to determine the wild-card winner. A coin flip on September 14 gave the Cubs' home field advantage, setting Wrigley Field as the location for the game. In the event of a three-way tie the Cubs were presented with the choice to either host two home games or receive a bye <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> winner of a Mets-Giants game on the road because they had the best combined record against the Mets and Giants. Cubs' general manager Ed Lynch decided on the second option, though the choice was moot as the Mets fell out of the race. The Cubs' Steve Trachsel and Mark Gardner of the Giants were slated to start the tie-breaker on the September 28.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur and depth of field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download <b>and</b> <b>play</b> <b>the</b> game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
