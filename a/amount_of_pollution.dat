5|$|Annually, Manila is {{hit with}} 5 to 7 typhoons {{creating}} floods. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) struck the Philippines. In its aftermath, {{the lack of}} infrastructure led {{to one of the}} worst floodings in the Philippines and creating a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution.</b> Following the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, the city began to dredge its rivers and improve its drainage network. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission is in charge of cleaning up the Pasig River and tributaries for transportation, recreation and tourism purposes. Rehabilitation efforts have resulted in the creation of parks along the riverside, along with stricter pollution controls.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{regulation}} uses {{a variety}} of approaches to limit these emissions, such as command-and-control (which mandates the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> or the technology used), economic incentives, or voluntary programs.|$|E

25|$|Human {{activity}} in the area also accounts for a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution,</b> The Pan American Health Organization estimated in 1993 that only about 10% of the sewage from the Central American and Caribbean Island countries is properly treated before being released into the sea.|$|E
25|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{pollution from}} fossil fuels {{is regarded as}} a negative externality. Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution. This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.|$|E
50|$|Onna {{is located}} near large {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} drilling operations. Both Exxon Mobil and Total S.A. have operations in the area. Their operations have caused some controversy.

25|$|The {{recycling}} of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} in India and China generates a significant <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution.</b> Informal recycling in an underground economy {{of these countries}} has generated an environmental and health disaster. High levels of lead (Pb), polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated dioxins and furans, as well as polybrominated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) concentrated in the air, bottom ash, dust, soil, water, and sediments in areas surrounding recycling sites.|$|E
25|$|For years, it {{was thought}} by American {{government}} scientists who measure air pollution that diesel locomotive engines were relatively clean and emitted far less health-threatening emissions than those of diesel trucks or other vehicles; however, the scientists discovered that because they used faulty estimates {{of the amount of}} fuel consumed by diesel locomotives, they grossly understated the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> generated annually (In Europe, where most major railways have been electrified, there is less concern). After revising their calculations, they concluded that the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, a major ingredient in smog and acid rain, and soot would be by 2030 nearly twice what they originally assumed.|$|E
25|$|The Sierra Club {{criticized the}} capital {{projects}} as adding to urban sprawl while hurting air quality. In response, {{the expense of}} implementing Open Road Tolling has justified by claiming it significantly decreases the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> from vehicle exhaust that enters the air. This is because the old barrier style tollbooths adds {{to the amount of}} time that certain vehicles spend on the roadway by requiring them to slow down, stop, and sometimes idle for several minutes while waiting to pay their tolls. The introduction of the I-Pass system has greatly alleviated this problem since all vehicles with an I-Pass or E-Zpass can continue to travel at normal highway speeds through the toll plazas.|$|E
50|$|Oil Refineries Ltd.'s vast {{petrochemical}} {{plants have}} released significant <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> {{to the environment}} around Haifa Bay. However, starting in March 2011, after being connected to the new national natural gas distribution grid, the plants will switch to using natural gas (rather than mostly fuel oil) as their main power source, thus greatly reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> air <b>pollution</b> emanating from the complex. The switch to natural gas {{is also expected to}} save the company US$200 million per year in fuel and other costs.|$|R

25|$|The {{production}} of an alkali {{on a large}} scale became an important goal as well, and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the {{production of}} sodium carbonate. The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give sodium sulphate and hydrochloric acid. The sodium sulphate was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants (barilla) or from kelp, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash, and also to potash (potassium carbonate) produced from hardwood ashes.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Rutgers University Journal of Law and Urban Policy, African-American {{residents}} of Waterfront South {{have a greater}} chance of developing cancer {{than anywhere else in}} the state of Pennsylvania, 90% higher for females and 70% higher for males. [...] 61% of Waterfront South residents have reported respiratory issues, with 48% of residents experiencing chronic chest tightness. Residents of Waterfront South formed the South Camden Citizens in Action, or SCCA, in 1997 in order to combat the environmental and health issues imposed from the rising <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> and the trash-to-steam facilities being implemented by the CCMUA. [...] One such facility, the Covanta Camden Energy Recovery Center (formerly the Camden Resource Recovery Facility), is located on Morgan Street in the Waterfront South neighborhood and burns 350,000 tons of waste from every town in Camden County, aside from Gloucester Township. [...] The waste is then converted into electricity and sold to utility companies that power thousands of homes.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{of nuclear}} energy argue that nuclear power is a clean and {{sustainable}} energy source which provides huge amounts of uninterrupted energy without polluting the air or emitting the carbon emissions that cause Global warming. Use of nuclear power provides plentiful, well-paying jobs, energy security, reduces a dependence on imported fuels and exposure to price risks associated with resource speculation and Middle East politics. Proponents advance the notion that nuclear power produces virtually no air pollution, {{in contrast to the}} massive <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> and carbon emission generated from burning Fossil fuel like coal, oil and natural gas. Modern society demands always-on energy to power communications, computer networks, transportation, industry and residences at all times of day and night. In the absence of nuclear power, utilities need to burn fossil fuels to keep the energy grid reliable, even with access to solar and wind energy, because those sources are intermittent. [...] Proponents also believe that nuclear power is the only viable course for a country to achieve energy independence while also meeting their [...] "ambitious" [...] NDC's (nationally determined contributions) to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement signed by 195 nations. They emphasize that the risks of storing waste are small and existing stockpiles can be reduced by using this waste to produce fuels for the latest technology in newer reactors. Finally, even though alarmist media reports of nuclear accidents raised fear levels a lot, in fact the Chernobyl disaster caused 56 direct deaths and Fukushima reactors caused no actual deaths {{as a result of the}} nuclear meltdown. The operational safety record of nuclear is excellent when compared to the other major kinds of power plants and by preventing pollution, actually saves lives every year.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to an ordinary market, in a pollution market the amount purchased {{is not necessarily}} the amount 'consumed' (= the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> emitted).

50|$|Depending on {{the method}} of {{electricity}} generation used, regular greenhouse produce can create more greenhouse gases than field produce, largely due to higher energy use per kilogram of produce. With vertical farms requiring much greater energy per kilogram of produce, mainly through increased lighting, than regular greenhouses, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> created will be much higher than that from field produce. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>pollution</b> produced is dependent on how the energy used in the process is generated.|$|E
