5|$|Of an {{estimated}} ten million words of writing in Newton's papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of Newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, {{with his own}} annotations. Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> to protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in Newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the church.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 21, Sahajanand Swami was {{appointed}} successor to Ramanand Swami {{as the leader of}} the Uddhav Sampraday by Ramanand Swami, prior to his death. The Uddhav Sampraday henceforth came to be known as the Swaminarayan Sampraday. According to sources he proclaimed the worship of one sole deity, Krishna or Narayana. Krishna was considered by him his own ista devata. In contrast with the Vaishnava sect known as the Radha-vallabha Sampradaya, he had a more puritanical approach, rather than the theological views of Krishna that are strongly capricious in character <b>and</b> <b>imagery.</b> While being a worshipper of Krishna, Swaminarayan rejected licentious elements in Krishnology in favor of worship in the mood of majesty, alike to earlier Vaisnava teachers, Ramanuja and Yamunacarya.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the frames}} and {{pictorial}} {{areas of the}} diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> in unison.|$|E

5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science <b>and</b> <b>imagery.</b> The animators realistically recreated what an explosion {{would look like}} in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program was used to simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Evangelion is an apocalyptic anime, set in {{a futuristic}} Tokyo fifteen years after a {{worldwide}} cataclysm. The story centers on Shinji, a teenage boy who is recruited by his father into the shadowy organization Nerv to pilot a giant bio-machine mecha called Evangelion in combat against monstrous beings known as Angels. The series explores the experiences and emotions of Evangelion pilots and members of Nerv {{as they attempt to}} prevent another catastrophe. It features religious symbolism throughout the series, including themes <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> derived from Kabbalah, Christianity, and Judaism.|$|E
5|$|In the Roman empire's {{hierarchical}} system, a vassal king {{usage of}} the King of Kings title did not indicate {{that he is a}} peer of the emperor or that the vassalage ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A lead token depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the Parthian monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus' crown; this combination of title <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the Sassanians and the protector of the region against them.|$|E

40|$|Sensory-cognitive {{programs}} {{utilized by}} Lindamood-Bell ™ {{are relevant to}} Feuerstein’s theory of Cognitive Modifiability in three components of language learning. When oral and/or written language are deficient, three processing abilities typically need development: concept <b>imagery,</b> phoneme awareness, <b>and</b> symbol <b>imagery.</b> Genetic gifts to many individuals, they must be developed for others, irrespective of intelligence. With specific programs that engage at the sensory level to stimulate concept <b>imagery,</b> phoneme awareness, <b>and</b> symbol <b>imagery,</b> a processing base emerges enabling significant gains in spoken and/or written language competence for both children and adults. The key is intensive Socratic questioning that brings language, oral-motor feedback from articulation, <b>and</b> both symbol <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> concept <b>imagery</b> into conscious integration until that processing and integration become automatic. Sensory-cognitive program procedures develop Feuerstein’s Cognitive Function goals...|$|R
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Tolkien was the 19th-century Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, following the general style and approach of the work. The Desolation of Smaug as portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, has been noted as an explicit motif borrowed from Morris. Tolkien wrote also of being impressed as a boy by Samuel Rutherford Crockett's historical novel The Black Douglas and of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain, Gilles de Retz. Incidents in both The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings are similar in narrative and style to the novel, and its overall style <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.|$|E

The snake, noncompliant to the wishes of its handler, is eventually removed and replaced with something related to the episode title, which in this series is always a single noun. The opening ominous string crescendo <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> are a parody of the opening credits of the 1976 BBC television adaptation of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E

5|$|Thematically, Viking metal draws {{extensively}} on elements of black metal, but the lyrics <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> are pagan and Norse rather than anti-Christian or Satanic. It combines the exaltation {{of violence and}} virility through weapons and battlefields, which is common to many death and black metal bands, {{with an interest in}} ancestral roots, particularly a pre-Christian heritage, which is expressed through Viking mythology <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> of northern landscapes. Some bands such as Sorhin keep the Satanic elements of black metal but musically are influenced by more recent folk tunes. Visuals such as album art, band photos, website design, and merchandise all highlight the dark and violent outlook of Viking metal lyrics and themes. The art on albums by Viking metal artists frequently depicts Viking Age archeological finds: Thor's hammers are especially common, but other artifacts such as Oseberg posts and even the Sutton Hoo helmet have appeared. Some bands incorporate far more ancient, pre-medieval imagery, such as the Finnish band Moonsorrow's use of prehistoric rock carvings and megaliths. Other Finnish bands, such as Ensiferum, Turisas, and Korpiklaani, focus on Sami traditions and shamanism, further stretching the definition of Viking metal. Not all bands rely on Viking-related visuals or other ancestral images to aid their musical character: for instance, the members of Týr do not wear Viking costumes on stage, and only their folk-influenced music and lyrical themes distinguish them from other heavy metal bands.|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles <b>and</b> <b>imagery.</b> He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.|$|E

In {{the aftermath of the}} school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music <b>and</b> <b>imagery</b> for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{increased}} use of precision agriculture techniques, information concerning within-field crop yield variability is becoming increasingly important for effective crop management. Despite the commercial availability of yield monitors, many crop harvesters are not equipped with them. Moreover, yield monitor data can only be collected at harvest and used for after-season management. On the other hand, remote sensing imagery obtained {{during the growing season}} can be used to generate yield maps for both within-season and after-season management. This paper gives an overview on the use of airborne multispectral <b>and</b> hyperspectral <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> high-resolution satellite <b>imagery</b> for assessing crop growth and yield variability. The methodologies for image acquisition and processing and for the integration and analysis of image and yield data are discussed. Five application examples are provided to illustrate how airborne multispectral <b>and</b> hyperspectral <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> high-resolution satellite <b>imagery</b> have been used for mapping crop yield variability. Image processing techniques including vegetation indices, unsupervised classification, correlation and regression analysis, principal component analysis, and supervised and unsupervised linear spectral unmixing are used in these examples. Some of the advantages and limitations on the use of different types of remote sensing <b>imagery</b> <b>and</b> analysis techniques for yield mapping are also discussed...|$|R
