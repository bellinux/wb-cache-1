5|$|Many Greek Orthodox populations, {{particularly}} {{those outside the}} newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer to themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, born {{on the island of}} Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‘‘What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> at?’’ one of the soldiers asked. ‘‘At Hellenes,’’ the children replied. ‘‘Are you not Hellenes yourselves?’’ the soldier retorted. ‘‘No, we are Romans,’’ the children replied.|$|E
500|$|Robey {{was engaged}} to play the title role in the 1905 {{pantomime}} Queen of Hearts. The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing [...] "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, [...] "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of my blue bag on washing day." [...] Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as [...] "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated [...] "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over {{the next few years}} he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, [...] "What <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> <b>Looking</b> at Me For?" [...] and [...] "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.|$|E

It is {{happiness}} to die for one's people!" [...] and to the Germans, [...] "You hang me now, but I'm not alone. There are two hundred million of us. You can't hang us all. They will avenge me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first Chinese {{historical}} archive {{also recorded}} that on 4 September 1730 AD (on the lunar calendar), Tian Wenjing, {{governor of the}} Eastern River, fell ill. Emperor Yongzheng sent a royal doctor to visit and provided him with 200g of GuilingJi. In red calligraphy it was written: [...] "Please try your best to recover. You should have told me sooner. Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> all over? Here is your reward.” Imperial records show that Emperor Yongzheng usually rewarded ministers with only 5g of GuilingJi. By rewarding Tian Wenjing with not only 200g, but also the original GuilingJi prescription it showed the emperor highly valued Tian Wenjing.|$|E
2500|$|Petra {{also used}} the record to defuse the backmasking controversy, which had begun to spread into Christian music, as {{conservative}} church leaders accused Christian artists of hiding subliminal messages {{that could only be}} heard when records were played in reverse. Inserting a blatant piece of backmasking in the break between the title track and hard rocker [...] "Judas' Kiss," [...] the band's message was less than subtle. Played in reverse, the backmasked portion stated: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for the devil for when you oughta be looking for the Lord?" [...] It was not the first – nor would it be the last – time Petra weighed in against critics of contemporary Christian music.|$|E
6000|$|... "Russ, I've {{been sick}} myself--in bed for three days," [...] she said. [...] "I'm better now. I hope <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> so pale. Do you still think, brood about that fight?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, Christian {{rock group}} Petra {{included}} in their song [...] "Judas Kiss", from the 1982 album More Power to Ya, the message, [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> for the devil for, when {{you ought to}} be looking for the Lord?" [...] Bloodhound Gang's 1996 controversy-begging track [...] "Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)" [...] mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly, and included the backmasked phrase [...] "Devil child, wake up and eat Chef Boyardee Beefaroni". The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled [...] "Backmaskwarning!", which contains the forward lyrics [...] "Play that record backwards / Here's a message yo for the suckas / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself". The backwards messages in the song include, [...] "clean your room", [...] "do your homework", [...] "don't stay out too late", and [...] "eat your vegetables".|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hilary Busis asks a [...] "Serious question: Is a Storybrooke in which everyone's suspicious, caustic, and attacking {{the people around}} them {{really going to be}} that {{different}} from the town's general status quo? (At least, as long as Grumpy is around?) We'll have to wait two long weeks for the answer to that burning (freezing?) question, thanks to the American Music Awards. At least Once prepared for its off week by giving us both halves of a two-parter—a story that, {{when all is said and}} done, maybe didn't need to be told over the course of two hours, though it was nice to see the show take some time to privilege character over plot tonight. The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> forward to the show not spending quite so much time on the Frozen crew?" ...|$|E
