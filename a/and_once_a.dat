5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head <b>and</b> <b>Once</b> <b>a</b> Thief.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E

25|$|This spider {{builds a}} funnel-shaped web to catch its prey. It usually {{consists}} of a multitude of stressed silk threads spun over a flat surface (such as a window sill) near any corner, with a funnel-like structure reaching for the corner, in which the spider would typically reside (hence the name). These webs can become quite large if undisturbed. They act like cord strings, helping the spider glide over them, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> prey stumbles into the web, it will quickly get attacked, then dragged inside the funnel part and eaten, but very rarely stored underneath the structure.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{method of}} obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through in vitro {{evolution}}. Though this term is often used interchangeably with in vitro selection, in vitro evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is genetically altered over subsequent rounds through genetic recombination or through point mutations. For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using error-prone PCR to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with in vitro selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.|$|E

25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission antenna system. One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the Southwold Railway Society {{submitted}} {{plans to}} build a new line between the parish of Easton Bavents and Henham Park, to link the town to the nearest mainline service at Halesworth. However, these plans were criticised for having no relation to the original route of the railway and for environmental and other reasons. In July 2007 the plans were rejected by both Waveney and Suffolk Coastal District Councils. In December 2008 the Society introduced a new proposal for a Railway Park, including railway track and a museum, on a site at present occupied by a car-breaker's yard, next to the local sewage works. That proposal has been superseded by another, in which a short section of railway, together with other attractions and facilities, would be constructed in the village of Wenhaston, a few miles inland from Southwold <b>and</b> <b>once</b> <b>a</b> stop on the Southwold Railway. The plan has not met with universal approval. In February 2016, the original Railway Park proposal for Blyth Road, Southwold, was revived, and a new planning application submitted.|$|E
25|$|Lamptey joined Venezia in Italy {{and later}} Unión de Santa Fe in Argentina. There, {{he and his}} wife had their third child, Diego. But soon, Diego died of a rare disease. A major {{emotional}} blow was also the fact that Lamptey wanted to bury his son in Ghana, but the authorities declined. Heartbroken, Lamptey temporarily gave up football. After unsuccessful stints at Ankaragücü and União Leiria, Lamptey got himself a new German player agent who transferred him to SpVgg Greuther Fürth. However, Lamptey and his wife were unhappy there, unable to live through the culture shock in Germany. Lamptey was not entirely unsuccessful, being a reliable backup, but was found too fragile for the rough Second Bundesliga. He was also reportedly ignored by his German colleagues, <b>and</b> <b>once,</b> <b>a</b> colleague flat out refused to sleep in the same hotel room as him. This blatant racism shocked Lamptey, but even worse was the fact that his child Lisa also died soon after birth. Also Lamptey's second dead child was buried abroad, in Germany. The Lampteys soon left for Asia.|$|E
