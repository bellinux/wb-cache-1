50|$|Graphite is {{also used}} in the hot forming of glass. Graphite moulds are {{prepared}} by carving into them, machining them into curved forms or by stacking them into shapes. Molten glass is poured into a mould where it is cooled until hard enough to be removed and placed into an <b>annealing</b> <b>kiln</b> to cool slowly.|$|E
50|$|Italian glass blowing {{techniques}} such as latticinio and zanfirico are adapted here to make beads. Furnace glass uses large decorated canes built up out of smaller canes, encased in clear glass and then extruded to form the beads with linear and twisting stripe patterns. No air is blown into the glass. These beads require a large scale glass furnace and <b>annealing</b> <b>kiln</b> for manufacture.|$|E
50|$|After {{designing}} a piece, a lampworker must plan how to construct it. Once ready to begin, the lampworker slowly introduces glass rod or tubing into the flame to prevent cracking from thermal shock. The glass is heated until molten, wound around a specially coated steel mandrel, forming the base bead. The coating is an anti-fluxing bead release agent {{that will allow}} the bead to be easily removed from the mandrel, either a clay based substance or Boron nitride. It can then be embellished or decorated using a variety of techniques and materials. All parts of the workpiece must be kept at similar temperatures lest they shatter. Once finished the piece must be <b>annealed</b> in an <b>kiln</b> to prevent cracking or shattering.|$|R
30|$|Microfluidic devices {{consisting}} of a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) mold created with a channel-patterned glass substrate were formed by soft lithographic methods [34]. First, photoresist (Shipley 1827) was spin coated onto clean glass slides (soda-lime glass slides, Corning) which were then exposed to UV light through a Kodak technical pan film photomask {{consisting of}} the appropriate microfluidic channel pattern. These photoresist-coated glass slides were treated in developing solution and baked overnight at 120 °C. The thickness of the photoresist layer {{was determined to be}} 2.3 μm to 2.4 μm using a Dektek 3 Stylus Profilometer. The patterned glass slides were then etched by immersing them into a buffered oxide etchant (BOE) solution [35]. The BOE solution was prepared by mixing 48 % HF (EMD Chemicals Inc., Germany) and aqueous NH 4 F (200 g/ 300 mL purified water, Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) in a 1 : 6 volume ratio. The etching process was repeated until the depth of the channels was between 15 μm and 19 μm. The slides were then washed with acetone to remove the remaining photoresist and dried under flowing nitrogen gas. Next, PDMS (Sylgard silicone elastomer- 184) and its cross-linking agent (10 : 1 volume ratio) were mixed in a plastic beaker and degassed inside a desiccator under vacuum. The liquid PDMS mixture was poured over a patterned glass slide and allowed to cure in an oven at 70 °C. After 1 h, the nascently-formed PDMS elastomer was peeled off of the glass slide. This mold and a freshly cleaned glass coverslip were placed into a 25 W oxygen plasma cleaner (PDC- 32 G, Harrick) for 30 s and were then immediately brought into contact to form the PDMS/glass microfluidic device. It should be noted that both the glass slides and coverslips used in these procedures were cleaned in a boiling solution of ICN 7 X detergent (Costa Mesa, CA) mixed with purified water at a 1 : 4 volume ratio. Following this, the slides were <b>annealed</b> in a <b>kiln</b> (Sentry Xpress 2.0, Orton Ceramic Foundation, OH) at 500 °C for 5 h before the oxygen plasma treatment.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to design and create a process for manufacturing replacement glass prisms for the Piedras Blancas lighthouse and several other lighthouses nationwide. The prisms were designed to be in multiple metal arrays spread across {{the floor of the}} beacon room (the topmost room of the lighthouses). The prisms functioned to transmit extra, radiant light from the beacon light through the floor of the beacon room and disperse it into the maintenance room below. Using computer aided drafting (CAD) software, an original prism was measured and modeled; the corresponding mold was also modeled. G-codes for controlling the movement of a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill were created to machine the two halves of the mold. A donated block of graphite was machined according to the developed G-codes. As a proof of concept method for casting these prisms, I used a lampworking setup – consisting of a propane-oxygen torch, the associated hoses, regulators, and tanks, an <b>annealing</b> <b>kiln,</b> and the necessary lampworking tools – to melt one end of a borosilicate glass rod into a large gather of molten glass. I forced this gather into the mold, thereby filling the mold, and allowed the glass to solidify. Then I opened the mold, removed the prism, melted off the extra rod, and flattened the top face of the prism. This method, although suitable for the proof of concept, will not be efficient for casting the needed quantity of prisms due to the additional, time consuming steps required. For producing large quantities of these prisms, suggested future work may involve pouring molten glass into the mold via the use of a crucible...|$|E
