40|$|AbstractObjectiveWhole body {{hypoperfusion}} {{and lower}} torso ischaemia-reperfusion contribute to post-operative organ dysfunction in patients undergoing repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Serum lactate <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit are markers of tissue ischaemia {{and are used}} to assess the adequacy of resuscitation. This study examines the prognostic value of immediate post-operative levels of serum lactate <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit in ruptured AAA. MethodsThirty patients (24 men and 6 women of median age 74, range 51 – 85, years) who survived to at least 12 h after ruptured AAA repair were studied retrospectively. The relationship between immediate post-operative lactate, <b>base</b> deficit <b>and</b> mortality was determined. ResultsFifteen patients (50 %) died, all from organ failure. An elevated lactate (> 2. 1 mmol/l) <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit (<− 2 mmol/l) were present in 20 (67 %) and 27 (90 %) patients, respectively. Lactate (p< 0. 001) <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit (p= 0. 003) were significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors. Lactate (p= 0. 021) <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit levels (p= 0. 028) were independently significant for predicting mortality and a significant interaction existed between lactate <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit levels for predicting mortality (p= 0. 027). The sensitivity and specificity of lactate ≥ 4. 0 mmol/l was 13 of 15 (87 %) and 12 of 15 (80 %), respectively, <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit ≤− 7 mmol/l was 12 of 15 (80 %) and 12 of 15 (80 %), respectively. The likelihood ratios for a positive result with the defined cut-off values for lactate <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit were 4. 3 and 4. 0, respectively. Lactate ≥ 4. 0 mmol/l <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit ≤− 7 mmol/l were associated with a 94. 5 % probability of death while lactate ≤ 4. 0 mmol/l <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit ≥− 7 mmol/l were associated with a 4 % probability of death. ConclusionThese data demonstrate that an immediate post-operative serum lactate ≥ 4. 0 mmol/l <b>and</b> <b>base</b> deficit ≤− 7 mmol/l are good predictors of outcome after ruptured AAA repair. The prognostic value of these simple and inexpensive tests require corroboration in a larger prospective study...|$|R
