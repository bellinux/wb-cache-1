5|$|When Néstor Kirchner {{refused to}} run for {{re-election}} in 2007 and proposed Cristina Kirchner instead, it was rumored that the couple might attempt {{to run for}} the presidency in alternate elections, to circumvent the constitutional limit of a single re-election. The death of Néstor Kirchner in 2010 derailed such a plan. She had a low positive image, below 30%. On 21 June 2011, Cristina Kirchner announced she would run for a second term as president. A few days later, she announced that her economic minister Amado Boudou would run for vice-president on her ticket. This selection was an unexpected one, as Boudou usually <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rock star instead of a politician. She personally chose most of the candidates for deputy in the Congress, favoring members of the Cámpora.|$|E

He had previously been arrested in Nicaragua when attempting to volunteer for an upcoming war. In November 1909, the San Juan carried 1,673 tons of cargo and valuable treasure from the Charles Butters Mine in El Salvador. A fireman from the steamer Peru, Robert Latewitz, was also onboard the San Juan, having been removed from his ship due to insanity.

25|$|In {{terms of}} archaeological evidence, bronze {{crossbow}} bolts dating from {{as early as}} the mid-5th century BC have been found at a Chu burial site in Yutaishan, Jiangling County, Hubei Province. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with a bronze trigger, dating from the 6th century BC, were found in Tombs 3 and 12 at Qufu, Shandong, previously the capital of Lu. Other early finds of crossbows were discovered in Tomb 138 at Saobatang, Hunan Province and dated to the mid-4th century BC. However, ammunition for crossbows could have apparently also been shaped as spherical bullets. Jing Fang (78-37 BC), a Western-Han era Chinese mathematician and music theorist, discussed astronomical topics such as solar and lunar eclipses. He wrote that the moon, shaped like a ball, produced no light, yet instead <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mirror in reflecting the light illuminated only by the sun, which he compared to the shape of a round crossbow bullet.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that frightened her. Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on the edge of an old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E

500|$|The Ambrose {{leader cable}} was an armored cable {{with a single}} {{internal}} conductor (see picture) that <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> long radio antenna laid on the Channel floor. It originated at Fort Lafayette (near the present day Verrazano-Narrows Bridge), then extended 16 miles down the Ambrose Channel to the vicinity of Lightship Ambrose offshore. [...] It was powered by a generator at Fort Lafayette that produced 500Hz (cycles per second) current at 400volts, resulting in an alternating electromagnetic field {{along the length of}} the cable that could be detected to approximately a thousand yards away. [...] The current was mechanically keyed to send the word [...] "NAVY" [...] in Morse Code.|$|E

It had a velocipede seat and steering bar for a rider. A cloth screw propeller was operated by the rider through a cog wheel and ratchet attachment operated by the rider pedaling. He first called the hybrid invention an [...] "air bicycle", that navigated through the air like driving a bicycle. He later named it a [...] "gas kite", an [...] "aerial velocipede", an [...] "aerial bicycle", [...] and ultimately a [...] "sky-cycle." [...] The propeller <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> screw of a boat and propelled the airship forward and up with the backward air current generated.

[...] This did not go unnoticed by her family or school friends, who often remarked that she looked and <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> girl. A failed relationship with a boy during her teenage years convinced Harisu of the need to change her sex, and by the time she graduated from the all-boys Naksaeng High School, she was already undergoing hormone replacement therapy. It was for this reason that she was exempted from the military service usually required of males in the Republic of Korea, being rejected on the grounds of [...] "mental illness". By the end of the 1990s, Harisu had undergone breast augmentation, sex reassignment surgery, rhinoplasty, and increase of hips, having had surgery performed in Korea and Japan.|$|E

500|$|The {{remainder}} of Rome's territory--if not its nature--was defended {{for several decades}} following 410 AD largely by Flavius Aëtius, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another. In 436 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the Battle of Arles, and again in 436 AD at the Battle of Narbonne. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked Concordia, Altinum, Mediolanum, Ticinum, and Patavium, they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor Valentinian III's own hand, leading Sidonius Apollinaris to observe, [...] "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only {{know that you have}} <b>acted</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man who has cut off his right hand with his left".|$|E

Quinton Flynn was selected to voice Raiden in the series' English adaptation by casting director Kris Zimmerman, who had previously worked with him. Flynn remembers having {{a long time to}} develop the character, being instructed by Zimmerman to use an older voice from a character he previously voiced. Flynn stated that Raiden was one of his favorite video-game voice characters, and explained a notable difference between his roles in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4; For Metal Gear Solid 4 Flynn made a deeper sound to match the cyborg Raiden in contrast to the original youthful Raiden from Metal Gear Solid 2. Flynn added more it was [...] "grizzled, yeah – but different enough from the style of Snake".|$|E

[...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E
