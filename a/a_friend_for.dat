5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as <b>a</b> <b>friend,</b> <b>for</b> what he's done for me.|$|E

Later that year, she {{reunited with}} {{director}} Joe Wright to film their third production together, Anna Karenina, {{in which she}} starred as the title character. She deemed her collaboration with Wright {{as the most important}} of her career. Knightley garnered positive reviews for her performance, prompting early Oscar buzz.|$|E
25|$|During the offseason, Nicklaus {{addressed}} {{two problems}} which had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout {{noticed that he}} had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, compared with a more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed {{with the help of}} Phil Rodgers, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{originally}} {{started to}} film using id Software's 1997 first-person shooter (FPS) video game Quake II but, {{after three months}} of pre-production, was dissatisfied with the game's visual quality. After experimenting, he chose The Sims 2, a 2004 life simulation game published by Electronic Arts. His audio work for Strange Company's 2006 film BloodSpell delayed the start of Male Restroom Etiquettes production. However, after he was able to start, he finished after about two weeks of work. He recorded himself for the narration, and <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> background voices. He edited audio in Steinberg Cubase SX3 and video footage from the game in Sony Vegas 6.|$|E

25|$|Rezko's first {{significant}} political act was hosting a fundraiser for Harold Washington during Washington's successful campaign to become Chicago's mayor. He has since raised funds {{for many other}} politicians. In addition to Blagojevich and Obama, prominent Democrats that Rezko or his company, Rezmar, have contributed money to, or fund-raised for, are Congressman Luis Gutierrez, <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> over two decades, Comptroller Dan Hynes, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn, former Chicago Mayors Daley and Washington, and former Cook County Board President John Stroger.

New Interface (<b>a</b> design with <b>friends</b> <b>for</b> the future), released June 25, 2013, was produced by Joel Ford of Ford & Lopatin and mixed by Patrick Krief of The Dears. The Boston Globe stated [...] "The Wandas 'New Interface (<b>A</b> Design with <b>Friends</b> <b>for</b> the Future),' is experimentation done right, as the band's more artistic forays add depth and intrigue to the sound without sacrificing the band's core of solid song craft.|$|R

Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out {{the way they did}} as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating <b>a</b> <b>friend...</b> <b>For</b> money, I'll bet they're capable of anything." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E

500|$|Welch and Rawlings {{continued}} their partnership {{in the band}} Dave Rawlings Machine. [...] Welch co-wrote five of the songs with Rawlings, and provided guitar and harmony vocals. [...] Andy Gill of The Independent described the 2009 debut album A Friend of a Friend [...] as [...] "akin to one of Welch's albums, but with the balance of their harmonies swapped to favour Rawlings' voice". [...] Although ostensibly Rawlings' first solo album, Alex Ramon of PopMatters noted the similarities to Welch albums. Paste Magazines Stephen Deusner praised A Friend of <b>a</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>for</b> incorporating [...] "a wide swath of traditional American music," [...] comments echoed by Rolling Stones Will Hermes and in the PopMatters piece.|$|E
500|$|Herriman was {{described}} as self-deprecatingly modest, and he disliked being photographed. [...] The New York Journal-Americans obituary described him as a devoted husband and father, of slight build, mild-mannered and an anonymous contributor to charities. [...] He was generous to his friends, and sold his first Hollywood house, which he had bought for $50,000, to <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> $40,000. Though a private person, he {{was said to be}} an entertaining host to his friends. [...] He would sometimes stay silent during social occasions and would often leave the room to wash dishes, which he said he enjoyed as it gave him the opportunity to think. [...] His favorite game was poker, which he particularly enjoyed playing with his fellow cartoonists.|$|E
500|$|Two record {{companies}} showed {{an interest in}} Higgins—Sony and [...] She signed with Eleven, partly because they agreed {{that she would not}} be [...] "made into a pop star" [...] and partly because they were happy for her to take time off for a backpacking holiday. Higgins' manager is Eleven's John Watson, who also manages rock band Silverchair. Watson later disclosed that [...] "Missy's the only time in my career I knew after 90 seconds I really wanted to sign her." [...] The backpacking trip had been planned with <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> years and the pair spent most of 2002 in Europe; while Higgins was travelling, [...] "All for Believing" [...] started to receive airplay on Los Angeles radio station KCRW. Such radio exposure attracted the attention of American record labels and, by year's end, an international recording deal with Warner Bros. had been negotiated.|$|E

500|$|Watch Me Disappear was Augie March's most {{mainstream}} pop work to date, {{described as}} a further distillation of the band's earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal {{of much of the}} backing instrumentation which had acted as [...] "clutter" [...] around Richards' vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was [...] "a slow burner that takes time to get to know you, but once it does, it's <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> good". Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] as [...] "likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals". She noted a [...] "commercial potential" [...] for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.|$|E
500|$|Grand Unification was {{released}} in the UK on 13 March 2006 by Island Records, preceded by the single releases of [...] "Paint Your Target", [...] "Grand Unification Pt. I" [...] and [...] "Waste a Moment". The album debuted at number 28 on the UK Albums Chart, and its first single ("Paint Your Target") reached number nine on the Singles Chart. That month, Fightstar were listed by the US rock magazine Alternative Press as one of 100 bands to watch in 2006 and Kerrang! editor Paul Brannigan called the album [...] "one of the best British rock albums of the last decade". The band played at the Download Festival at Donington Park, and followed Biffy Clyro and Funeral for a Friend at the Full Ponty festival in Wales. Fightstar toured several countries, including Australia, Japan and the UK, with Funeral for <b>a</b> <b>Friend</b> <b>for</b> three months in 2006. The band released Grand Unification in North America on 17 April 2007 on Trustkill Records. This version {{was different from the}} British and Japanese versions because it features [...] "Fight For Us" [...] (the B-side of the fourth single [...] "Hazy Eyes") as a bonus track.|$|E
500|$|Reporters and illustrators on the Journal often {{worked in}} pairs. Davenport was teamed with Lewis {{and the two}} soon forged a solid relationship. [...] In early 1896, Lewis went to Ohio to {{investigate}} the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, that state's former governor, William McKinley. To interview the candidate, Lewis was required to undergo an interview himself, with McKinley's political manager, Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Hanna had set aside his business career to manage McKinley's campaign, and was paying all expenses for a political machine which helped make McKinley the frontrunner in the Republican race. [...] Lewis got his interview with McKinley, then remained in Ohio, investigating Hanna. [...] In 1893, Governor McKinley had been called upon to pay the obligations of <b>a</b> <b>friend</b> <b>for</b> whom he had co-signed loans; Hanna and other McKinley supporters had bought up or paid these debts. [...] Lewis viewed Hanna as controlling McKinley, able to ruin the candidate by calling in the purchased notes. [...] Becoming increasingly outraged by what he deemed as Hanna's purchase of the Republican nomination, and so likely the presidency, Lewis began to popularize this view {{in the pages of}} the Journal. [...] The first Davenport cartoon depicting Hanna appeared soon after.|$|E
