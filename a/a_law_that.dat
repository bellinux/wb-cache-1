5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish {{in regard}} to Wood's patent; {{the rest of the}} constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} {{classical}} problem of output regulation for linear systems subject to control constraint. The asymptotically regulatable region, {{the set of}} all initial conditions of the plant and the exosystem for which output regulation is possible, is characterized {{in terms of the}} null controllable region of the antistable subsystem of the plant. Continuous output regula-tion laws, of both state feedback type and error feedback type, are constructed from a given stabilizing state feedback law. It is shown <b>that</b> <b>a</b> stabilizing feedback <b>law</b> <b>that</b> achieves <b>a</b> larger domain of attraction leads to <b>a</b> feedback <b>law</b> <b>that</b> achieves output regulation on a larger subset of the asymptotically regulatable region. <b>A</b> feedback <b>law</b> <b>that</b> achieves global stabilization on the asymptoti-cally null controllable region leads to <b>a</b> feedback <b>law</b> <b>that</b> achieves output regulation on the entire asymptotically regulatable region.

5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall.

5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to <b>a</b> <b>law</b> <b>that</b> disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
