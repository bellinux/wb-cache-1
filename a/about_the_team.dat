25|$|After teaming {{together}} since 1985, The Rockers split up in December 1991 after backstage disputes. The {{exact nature of}} the dispute has not been confirmed by the WWF other {{than it was a}} monetary issue that lead to Jannetty quitting the WWF on behalf of both Rockers. According to Michaels's book, Jannetty had claimed that World Championship Wrestling were willing to give them a very high guaranteed contract but when Michaels inquired about it {{it turned out to be}} an exaggeration. Jannetty disputes this saying that Michaels was the driving force suggesting to quit the WWF, but had Jannetty do the phone call to ask for a release from their contract. When Vince McMahon actually agreed to let them go Michaels appeared shocked according to him, and later went to McMahon unbeknownst to him to explain this was Jannetty's idea only and that he had no intention of leaving the WWF himself. After cooler heads prevailed it was decided that The Rockers should split with Michaels turning heel to feud with Jannetty. Jannetty was not happy <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> splitting, while Michaels could not wait to work as a singles wrestler.|$|E
25|$|With two {{controversial}} races, {{the trip}} to England generated both bad feelings and bad press for Courtney and the Cornell rowing team. The controversial first heat with Leander caused ill will in England with many considering that Cornell acted in an unsportsmanlike manner. Courtney believed he received good treatment from the fans at Henley, and was mistreated by the English press. Courtney also {{had to contend with}} bad press back home. Courtney believed that part of the problem was the rivalry between competing wire services. C. S. Francis, a Cornell alumni who helped raise money for {{the trip to}} England, was also the editor of the Troy Times, which was associated with United Press. Francis stayed with the Cornell team and helped out United Press reporters with information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team.</b> The Chicago Associated Press wanted to have their own representative. When this was denied, Courtney claimed that they tried to get even. Courtney insisted that several things that Chicago Associated Press reported, such as troubles and disagreements between members of the team and Mr. Francis' saying the drawing of the Leander rowing club was fixed, were fabrications. After the regatta, the members of the Cornell rowing team released a statement to the press to address the matter of the Leander race. It stated that it was their understanding that under the rules if they stopped they would have been disqualified. They also said they would consider another race with Leander if they would have won.|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, Owumi's agent Goran Gramatikov was {{approached}} by another agent looking for players of African descent to play professional basketball in Libya. By December 27, 2010, Owumi had signed a lucrative deal with Al-Nasr, a team from Benghazi that played in the top Libyan league, and was arriving in the country. Despite fears of the country's instability {{in the midst of}} the budding Arab Spring and discouragement from his girlfriend Alexis Jones, he chose to remain with the team, prompted by the poor conditions in Macedonia. He later said, [...] "The most important thing was to get out of the bad situation I was in, and once I had the opportunity to get some place better to play basketball, that's all I really cared about. I didn't really care <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> I cared about the money and that it was going to be on time and that I was going to be able to further my career and get to feed my family." ...|$|E
500|$|Magness-Blake {{said one}} of the most {{dangerous}} parts of Thunder's job is at the beginning of the game when he leads the team onto the field, as there are cheerleaders ahead of him waving their pom-poms and a team of excited football players behind him. Ann Judge has also remarked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> getting [...] "amped up" [...] with energy and excitement as Thunder leads them onto the field, explaining that [...] "To him, amped up means danger." [...] On one occasion, a person walked out unexpectedly in front of Thunder as he was leading the players onto the field. [...] Thunder stopped immediately, averting a potentially dangerous situation. Another unexpected event occurred in 2014 during Super Bowl XLVIII when the pyrotechnics display was supposed to have been executed before Thunder led the team out but it went off unexpectedly during his run. [...] Thunder responded to the situation with aplomb, continuing to run forward onto the field, though he performed flying lead changes with each explosion.|$|E
500|$|While {{recovering}} from a broken leg, {{at the age of}} 28, Westley was appointed as manager of Kingstonian in December 1996 after approaching the club about their vacant managerial post. His first two games in charge of the club both ended in 4–4 draws against Walton & Hersham and Harrow Borough respectively, with Westley saying [...] "at the time, there was something raw and exciting <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> that I sent out. Although there was also something evidently missing". His first victory in charge of the club was a 2–0 win over Wokingham Town in the Isthmian League Cup, before securing his first league win in the following game, a 5–2 win away at Aylesbury United. Kingstonian drew clear of relegation, with Westley recalling a 3–2 victory over champions Yeovil Town at Huish Park as a [...] "memorable victory". Despite securing safety for the club, he was sacked after just five months, being replaced by Geoff Chapple. He managed Kingstonian for 25 games, recording nine wins, eight losses, and eight draws.|$|E

500|$|On September 5, 1991, Pittsburgh mayor Sophie Masloff {{proposed}} a new 44,000-seat stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates on the city's Northside. Three Rivers Stadium, the Pirates' {{home at the}} time, had been designed for functionality rather than [...] "architecture and aesthetics". The location of Three Rivers Stadium came to be criticized for being in a hard-to-access portion of the city, where traffic congestion occurred before and after games. Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy's purchase, plans <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team</b> remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain. In 1996, Masloff's successor, Tom Murphy, created the [...] "Forbes Field II Task Force". Made up of 29political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13possible locations. The [...] "North Side site" [...] was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium's design. The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver {{from the site of}} early Pirates home field Exposition Park.|$|E
500|$|Waugh was {{approached}} at the Oberoi by an Indian man, {{who was also}} staying at the hotel. The man called himself [...] "John" [...] and gave no surname. John {{said he was a}} man who had won money betting on cricket and asked Waugh to provide pitch and weather information; he also asked the Australian to reveal inside knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> such as tactics and player selections, in exchange for US$4,000. Waugh accepted the money and agreed to provide information about the pitch and weather, but he refused to divulge the tactics that the Australians intended to use against their opposition, or information on which players would play and what their role would be. Information on pitch conditions provides an insight into the strategies that the team might adopt and which players might be used, and teams will field different players depending on the pitch, as their skills are suited to different conditions. The arrangement with John remained in place until the end of the 1994–95 Australian summer. Waugh later said that at the time, he did not see anything wrong with his actions, reasoning that the agreement was similar to a player speculating about their form and the playing conditions in a pre-match media interview.|$|E
500|$|As a {{freshman}} at Wisconsin in 1997, Echols was redshirted, but in 1998, he entered week one of the season as a starting cornerback opposite fellow redshirt freshman Jamar Fletcher. Against Purdue on October 11, he intercepted quarterback Drew Brees in the end zone, ending their first drive of the game. Wisconsin won 31–24. He finished the season with three interceptions. In 1999, he started the season off poorly, being beat for touchdowns often; however, as the season progressed, his performances improved. During the season, he intercepted just one pass. Before his junior season in 2000, Echols and 25 of his teammates were suspended {{for the start of}} the season by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. He served his one-game suspension during week two of the season, in which Wisconsin won 27–23 against Oregon. On November 4, against Minnesota, he intercepted a pass and returned it 56yards for a touchdown. He finished the season with five total interceptions, as well as a fumble recovery. Echols also set a school record with 25 pass deflections. He was named second–team All–Big Ten Conference for his performances that season. Entering 2001, Echols became the only returning member of Wisconsin's secondary after the other players either graduated or declared for the 2001 NFL Draft. In an interview <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>team,</b> secondary coach Todd Bradford said that Echols, [...] "is probably as good a tackling defensive back as there is in the country." [...] On September 27, after Wisconsin lost to Oregon early in the month, Oregon's quarterback Joey Harrington, in a diary for ESPN.com, stated that Echols, [...] "is one of the best corners I have ever played against. He was very impressive." [...] He finished his senior season at Wisconsin with three interceptions. He graduated in 2002 with a degree in behavioral science and law.|$|E
