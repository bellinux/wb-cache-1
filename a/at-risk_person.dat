40|$|As {{technology}} {{advances in}} the field of Computer Vision, new applications will emerge. One device that has emerged is the smart-camera, a camera attached to an embedded system that can perform routines a regular camera could not, such as object or event detection. In this thesis we describe a smart-camera system we designed, implemented, and evaluated for fall prevention monitoring of at-risk people while in bed, whether it be for a hospital patient, nursing home resident, or at home elderly resident. The camera will give a nurse or caregiver environmental awareness of the <b>at-risk</b> <b>person</b> and notify them when that person performs an action {{that could lead to a}} hazardous event. This camera uses Haar Cascade facial detection techniques, Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) for person detection, and Mixture of Gaussians (MOG) background subtraction while operating. Regions are created by a person from a graphical user interface (GUI). The camera looks within these regions to find a face, a standing person, or just a change in the image. A notification is sent to the smartphone of the nurse or caregiver of the corresponding <b>at-risk</b> <b>person</b> when the camera finds one of these three detections in the drawn region. The Cloud is utilized to send the notification to the nurse or caregiver’s smartphone. Given a properly placed camera and properly drawn regions, notifications can be sent when the <b>at-risk</b> <b>person</b> is doing an action that demands the attention of the nurse or caregiver, such as getting out of bed. The smart-camera does contain drawbacks. It is likely to give alerts when visitors are in the room, and it does not know how to pause notifications when a nurse, doctor, or caregiver comes into the room...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a Zigbee smart noninvasive wearable physiological parameters monitoring device has been developed and reported in this paper. The system {{can be used to}} monitor physiological parameters, such as temperature and heart rate, of a human subject. The system consists of an electronic device which is worn on the wrist and finger, by an <b>at-risk</b> <b>person.</b> Using several sensors to measure different vital signs, the person is wirelessly monitored within his own home. An impact sensor has been used to detect falls. The device detects if a person is medically distressed and sends an alarm to a receiver unit that is connected to a computer. This sets off an alarm, allowing help to be provided to the user. The device is battery powered for use outdoors. The device can be easily adapted to monitor athletes and infants. The low cost of the device will help to lower the cost of home monitoring of patients recovering from illness. A prototype of the device has been fabricated and extensively tested with very good results. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{health-related}} quality of life (HRQOL) of persons at risk for type 2 85 diabetes to that of the Finnish general population. In addition, the associations between physical activity and HRQOL <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> were studied. Methods. One hundred thirty-two <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> were recruited from health care centres in Central Finland. Participants filled out questionnaires including demographic characteristics, HRQOL (SF- 36), frequency of vigorous physical activity (<= 2 times a week, once a week, less than once a week) and comorbidities. Results. HRQOL of <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> differed significantly from that of the Finnish population in four of the eight dimensions 90 of SF- 36. Compared with reference values of the general population, the values of <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> were worse for general health and pain, but better for mental health and role limitation (emotional) dimensions. Among <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> those physically more active had less depressiveness and lower body weight. HRQOL decreased linearly with decreasing physical activity in all dimensions. Conclusions. People with elevated risk for type 2 DM have reduced HRQOL in general health and body pain dimensions, but mental health and emotional role dimensions were better compared with that of the population. Among <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons,</b> 95 the benefits of physical activity on HRQOL were seen in all HRQOL dimensions.

40|$|Freedom of {{movement}} {{is essential for}} refugees to enjoy meaningful protection against {{the risk of being}} persecuted, and enables them to establish themselves socially and economically as foreseen by the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (“Convention”). The very structure of the Convention presumes the right to leave in search of protection, since a refugee is defined as an <b>at-risk</b> <b>person</b> who is “outside” his or her own country. Once outside the home state, the Convention makes express provision for rights not to be sent away (non-refoulement), to enjoy liberty upon arrival, to benefit from freedom {{of movement}} and residence once lawfully present, to travel once lawfully staying, and ultimately to return to the home state if and when conditions allow. Respect for refugee freedom of movement in its various forms is thus central to good faith implementation of the Convention. The right of refugees to move has moreover been reinforced by the advent of general human rights norms in the years since the Convention’s drafting. Of particular importance is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”), the relevant provisions of which have been authoritatively interpreted to apply equally to citizens and non-citizens, including refugees. Despite the clear legal foundation of refugee freedom of movement at international law, states are also committed to the deterrence of human smuggling and trafficking, to the maintenance of effective general border controls, to safeguarding the critical interests of receiving communities, and to effectuating safe and dignified repatriation when refugee status comes to an end. Legal obligations to respect refugee freedom of movement therefore co-exist with, and must be reconciled to, other important commitments. With a view to promoting a shared understanding of how best to understand the scope of refugee freedom of movement in the modern protection environment we have engaged in sustained collaborative study of, and reflection on, relevant norms and state practice. Our research was debated and refined at the Eighth Colloquium on Challenges in International Refugee Law, convened between March 31 and April 2, 2017, by the University of Michigan’s Program in Refugee and Asylum Law. These Guidelines are the product of that endeavor and reflect the consensus of Colloquium participants on how states can best answer the challenges of implementing the right of refugees to freedom of movement in a manner that conforms with international legal principles...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the changing {{role of the}} ethical value of autonomy in law and policy relating to AIDS {{in a number of}} European jurisdictions. In {{the early years of the}} epidemic the autonomy of infected and <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons,</b> and of social groups was promoted as a means of reducing the spread of HIV in the general population. Accordingly autonomy was deemed worthy of respect for instrumental reasons. This means-end calculation was premised on the lack of medical therapies, as well as the need to avoid discrimination in order to prevent <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> from going underground as far as health care systems were concerned. In law this instrumentalisation of autonomy was reflected in a specific application of the proportionality test, i. e. to impose coercive or discriminatory measures would be disproportionate, or even inimical, to the end of reducing the spread of HIV. This was a contingent analysis, strongly informed by the state of medical knowledge at the time, as well as by the relative power of professionals, health bureaucrats and lay activists. With the introduction of effective therapies such as Highly Active Retroviral Therapy (HAART) and Zidovudine (AZT) the terms of the proportionality analysis have changed decisively. As a result, it is now more likely than before that coercive measures will be implemented. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{knowledge}} regarding hereditary {{diseases and}} genetics, {{as well as}} personal attitudes toward gene tests, are major determinants of optimal utilization of genetic testing. In the present study, we aimed to ex-plore the general attitudes toward genetic testing in a sample representative of the German general popula-tion (n 5 2, 076) and to compare the attitudes of persons at risk for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal can-cer/familial adenomatous polyposis (HNPCC/FAP) (n 5 36) who had attended a university genetic counseling service, with a matched general population sample. We administered a subset of a questionnaire previously used in a Finnish study (Jallinoja et al., 1998). The 12 statements pertain to approval, disapproval, and con-cern for genetic testing. Overall, the results reveal high approval of genetic testing in the German population and in <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons.</b> In accordance with other studies, {{we find that the}} attitudes of individuals for whom hereditary disease is a salient issue of personal relevance and the attitudes of the general public are very sim-ilar. Only a few significant differences between these two samples emerged, indicating that <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> hold a more favourable view of the testing. One intriguing finding was the high rate of “don’t know ” re-sponses, especially in the general population sample. Compared to results from Finland, approval of genetic testing is lower in the German population, and endorsement of “don’t knows ” is remarkably higher.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Using an {{interdisciplinary}} clinical and molecular approach, the authors identified APC germline mutations in families with {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP). Correlation of mutation site with disease manifestation {{and the impact of}} molecular data on clinical proceedings were examined. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Germline mutations in the APC gene predispose to FAP. Established and proposed genotype-phenotype correlations as well as the influence of mutation site on surgical procedures have been reported. The predictive value of APC mutation analysis for disease manifestation and therapeutic decision making needs to be investigated further. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three kindreds of the local FAP registry were included in this study. CHRPE phenotype was defined as at least one large characteristic lesion or a total of four lesions in both eyes. APC mutations were identified by protein truncation test and automated DNA sequencing from patient lymphocyte DNA and RNA. RESULTS: APC germline mutations were identified in 85 / 123 families with FAP. They were located between codons 213 and 1581 of the APC gene and displayed distinct genotype-phenotype correlations. CHRPE status facilitated mutation analysis by discriminating regions of interest within the APC coding region. Severe manifestations of desmoids were restricted to mutations between codons 1444 through 1581. Whereas 91 % (75 / 82) of <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> were excluded as mutation carriers, APC germline mutations were detected before clinical examination in 9 % (7 / 82) of <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons.</b> One patient agreed to endoscopy only after mutation detection.

40|$|Research {{into the}} early course of {{schizophrenia}} has identified a prepsychotic prodromal stage (mean duration: 4. 8 years) and a psychotic prephase (mean duration: 1. 3 years). Comparisons of individually matched samples have demonstrated prodromal symptoms common to schizophrenia and moderate to severe depression. It is not until positive symptoms emerge that psychosis and mood disorders become distinguishable from each other. In both disorders the prodromal stage early produces functional impairment and related social consequences. Hence, early intervention is of great public health relevance. This intervention is targeted at manifest symptoms and not at the underlying, still unknown disease process.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design study was to {{determine}} if providing diabetes supplies and diabetes self-management education to uninsured or underinsured diabetics improved health outcomes. Health outcomes included diabetes self-management skills and serum fructosamine. Self-management skills were measured with a Likert scale. Serum fructosamine was measured with a capillary blood sample analyzed in the Duet™ Glucose monitor. The study used a convenience sample of uninsured or underinsured Type 1 and Type 2 diabetics with serum fructosamine levels greater than 310 umol/liter. The sample size of twenty was determined by power analysis. Twenty-five participants were enrolled from May 1999 through May 2000, and twenty completed the study. The setting was a nonprofit community agency in a large southern metropolitan area. Participants met individually with the researcher every two weeks for four sessions. A fifth session was held one month after session four. At each session a module of the "I'm in Control" diabetes education program (Oklahoma State Department of Health, 1997) was reviewed, and participants were given insulin and diabetic supplies. Data were collected at the first and fifth session. A dependent! test (one-tailed, a=. 05) was used to compare the means of the pretest-posttest serum fructosamine levels. Data analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the pretest-posttest scores(!= - 4. 199, df= 19, 12 =. 000). Scores decreased an average of 95 umol/liter. The first hypothesis (<b>At-risk</b> <b>persons</b> with diabetes will have lower mean glucose levels following participation in a diabetes supply and diabetes self-management program.) was supported. The means of the pretest-posttest self-management skills inventory were analyzed with a dependent 1 test (one-tailed, a=. 05). There was a statistically significant difference in the pretest-posttest scores (1 = 6. 43, df= 19, 12 =. 000). The second hypothesis (<b>At-risk</b> <b>persons</b> with diabetes will have improved diabetes self-management skills following participation in a diabetes supply and diabetes self-management program.) was supported.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 3 healthcare claims repositories (2006 – 2010) to compare rates of pneumococcal disease in immunocompetent adults with chronic medical conditions (“at-risk”) and immunocompromised adults (“high-risk”), with rates in adults without these conditions (“healthy”). Risk profiles and episodes of pneumococcal disease—all-cause pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) —were ascertained from diagnosis, procedure, and drug codes. Results. Rates of all-cause pneumonia among <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> aged 18 – 49 years, 50 – 64 years, and ≥ 65 years were 3. 2 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 1 – 3. 2), 3. 1 (95 % CI, 3. 1 – 3. 1), and 3. 0 (95 % CI, 3. 0 – 3. 0) times the rates in age-matched healthy counterparts, respectively. We identified rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythemato-sus, Crohn’s disease, and neuromuscular or seizure disorders as additional at-risk conditions for pneumococcal dis-ease. Among <b>persons</b> with <b>at-risk</b> conditions, the rate of all-cause pneumonia substantially increased with the accumulation of concurrent at-risk conditions (risk stacking) : among persons 18 – 49 years, rate ratios increase...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: HIV {{testing is}} key to the {{delivery}} of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) : testing HIV-uninfected <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> is the first step for PrEP initiation and ongoing HIV testing {{is an essential part of}} PrEP delivery. Thus, novel and cost-effective HIV-testing approaches to streamline delivery of PrEP are urgently needed. Within a demonstration project of PrEP for HIV prevention among high-risk HIV serodiscordant couples in Kenya (the Partners Demonstration Project), we conducted a pilot evaluation of HIV self-testing. Methods: Clinic visits were scheduled quarterly and included in-clinic HIV testing using fingerstick rapid HIV tests and refills of PrEP prescriptions. HIV oral fluid self-test kits were provided for participants to use in the two-month interval between scheduled quarterly clinic visits. Acceptability of HIV self-testing was assessed using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Results: We found that 222 of 226 (98 %) HIV-uninfected persons who were offered accepted self-testing. Nearly all (96. 8 %) reported that using the self-testing kit was easy. More than half (54. 5 %) reportedly did not share the HIV results from self-testing with anyone and almost all (98. 7 %) the participants did not share the HIV self-testing kits with anyone. Many participants reported that HIV self-testing was empowering and reduced anxiety associated with waiting between clinic HIV tests. Conclusions: HIV self-testing was highly acceptable and may therefore be a feasible strategy to efficiently permit routine HIV testing between PrEP refills...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} reliable electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) changes associated with adult major depressive disorder. These changes might be evident before clinical {{manifestation of the}} illness in <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons.</b> The aim {{of the study was}} to identify depression-related EEG sleep and HPA changes in healthy adolescents at high risk for depression, and to examine the relationship between EEG sleep (or HPA) changes and the onset of depression. Forty-eight adolescent volunteers with no personal history of a psychiatric illness, including depression, but who were at high risk for developing depression by virtue of parental depression (high-risk group), and 48 adolescent volunteers with no personal or family history of a psychiatric disorder (normal controls) were recruited. EEG sleep and HPA measures were collected on three consecutive evenin gs and nights at baseline. Clinical follow-up evaluations were conducted at regular intervals over a 5 -year period. Compared with normal controls, adolescents at high risk for depression had shorter latency to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, increased phasic REM sleep, more REM sleep and elevated nocturnal urinary-free cortisol (NUFC) excretion at baseline. Shorter REM latency, higher REM density and elevated NUFC (measured at baseline) were associated with the development of depression during follow-up. The findings that REM sleep abnormalities and elevated HPA activity occur before the onset of depression in at-risk adolescents suggest that these variables serve as vulnerability markers for the illness. © 2009 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate rates of all-cause pneumonia among “at-risk ” and “high-risk” children and adults in Germany—in comparison with age-stratified healthy counterparts—during the period following the 2006 recommendation for universal immunization of infants with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Methods: Retrospective cohort design and healthcare claims information for 3. 4 M persons in Germany (2009 – 2012) were employed. Study population was stratified by age and risk profile (healthy, “at-risk ” [with chronic medical conditions], and “high-risk ” [immunocompromised]). At-risk and high-risk conditions, as well as episodes of all-cause pneumonia, were identified via diagnosis, procedure, and drug codes. Results and discussion: Rates of all-cause pneumonia were 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 7 - 1. 8) to 2. 5 (2. 4 - 2. 5) times higher among children and adults with at-risk conditions versus healthy counterparts, and 1. 8 (1. 8 - 1. 9) to 4. 1 (4. 0 - 4. 2) times higher among children and adults with high-risk conditions. Rates of all-cause pneumonia among <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> increased in a graded and monotonic fashion with increasing numbers of conditions (i. e., risk stacking). Conclusions: An increased risk for all-cause pneumonia in German children and adults with a spectrum of medical conditions persists in the era of widespread pneumococcal vaccination, and pneumonia risk in persons with ≥ 2 at-risk conditions is comparable or higher than those with high-risk conditions...|$|R
40|$|In the {{emerging}} risk society (Beck, 1992), healthy bodies, {{rather than the}} sick or diseased, {{are the focus of}} medical attention. Nowhere is this more evident than in the field of predictive genetic testing. Few empirical studies of predictive testing have explored the everyday reality of living at risk for a fatal inherited disorder. Fewer still have focused on those already living with such a disorder and their caregivers. Drawing upon 24 semi-structured interviews with <b>at-risk</b> <b>persons</b> and their family members, this study examined the implications of living at risk for, or with, the adult-onset disorder, Huntington disease (HD). Qualitative data analysis revealed that genetic risk was not understood or retained as an objective numerical fact, much as it is constructed so by Mendelian genetics. Rather, genetic risk for HD was re-conceptualized as an index of threat to self and other family members. Discussion about genetic risk for HD was infused with emotions and moral undertones; the latter reflected a felt obligation to other family members. As such, decisions around genetic risk were sometimes constrained by perceived responsibility to others in the family. Living with risk for HD or with the illness itself had noticeable effects on self-identity and relationships with others. While the response of social others was often sympathy, perceived stigma did exist in relation to HD, affecting communication about the illness and sometimes restricting social behavior. Implications for research and clinical practice are discussed...|$|R
