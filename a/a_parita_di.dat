This feature is commonly referred as: Above Sheathing Ventilation (ASV), an eaves-ridge open cavity present under the waterproof layer thank to the laying of the tiles over a batten and/or counter-batten support system. Air enters both at eaves section and through the air-permeability of the overlapping tiles, and flows to the ridge, sinking the heat transfer generated by the solar radiation. This study surveys the thermal behaviour during the summer season of a building in which varies the air-permeability between tiles, compared to a concrete flat roof building. Several studies have demonstrated the performance of a pitched roof, but it is not well yet investigated the impact of air-permeability of the external waterproof surface over the chimney effect, because several factors contribute to the complexity of the problem, such as the increasing mass flow rate and the Buoyancy-driven forces. The analysis has been approached by means of a numerical model, solving the fluid-dynamic and the heat transfer problems in unsteady state. Time series for wind, solar radiation and indoor space cooling were introduced to simulate realistic boundary conditions, taking into account different air-permeability of the waterproof surface and ASV thickness of the pitched roof...|$|E

5000|$|Huertas {{is portrayed}} as [...] "General Esteban" [...] in The Sharpie of the Culebra Cut, a Scrooge McDuck comic by Keno Don Rosa that is set in Panama in 1906. In the comic, General Esteban is a villain who wants to seize power in Panama to enrich himself using the Panama Canal (which he plans to rename Esteban Canal, and it would make {{him one of the}} most {{powerful}} and richest dictators in the world). As Rosa could find no real life Colombian or Panamanian villains, he based the villain off Huertas but only named him [...] "General Esteban" [...] to try to make a different, fictional character. After great treasure discovered by Scrooge McDuck and Teddy Roosevelt, Esteban's visions of power grow even greater as he can hire mercenaries, build armaments and even his own navy with the ancient gold. However, he is knocked down by <b>a</b> <b>Parita</b> chief and extradited to Colombia. The Parita chief claims [...] "we know well of the evil war chief Esteban".|$|R

40|$|This {{interview}} {{provides a}} panorama {{of the institutional}} intiatives {{on the issue of}} gender and language in Italy since the creation of the Comitato nazionale <b>di</b> <b>parità</b> in 1983 and the publication of Alma Sabatini’s seminal study Il sessismo nella lingua italiana in 1987 to date. Robustelli argues that because of its ample scope including linguistic, cognitive, and cultural aspects, Sabatini’s work has not only raised the interest of feminist groups, but also gained scholarly and institutional attention. She claims that in the Italian context it has been necessary to highlight discriminatory language practices against women and promote non-stereotypical and non-sexist language uses. She also maintains that more time is necessary to translate a non-heteronormative framework into linguistic practices, although some progress has been made. She eventually gives information on current projects, studies, directives, and laws focusing on gender and language...|$|R
