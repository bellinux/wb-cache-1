While the path to luxury brand success may be partly paved with extensions, there are even more examples of brand extension disasters that litter the way. Brand extensions continue to be among the most researched and studied phenomena in marketing. When it comes to luxury brands, however, the factors that lead to successful extension have received far less attention. In this article, we consider the notion of perceived premium degree of the brand as a function of its category, and what we term the degree of adjacency between its product categories. Building on our research, which found that a luxury brand's perceived premium degree has a different impact on profitability depending on whether or not the brand is spread across <b>adjacent</b> <b>product</b> categories, we demonstrate when luxury brand extensions work [...] and when they fail. Perhaps most importantly, we herein introduce the premium adjacency matrix as a tool for luxury brand managers to consider in formulating extension strategies.

40|$|Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) face {{enormous}} {{financial risk}} when {{embarking on a}} new product launch. SMEs {{are less likely to}} implement more formal risk minimization strategies for new product development (NPD) such as StageGate, often citing reasons of resource constraints or the more prevalent notion that “this stuff doesn’t apply to us”. Two key elements of any such risk minimization strategies are an early emphasis on benchmarking competitors and a thorough study of the attitudes and behaviours of potential customers. The SME’s investment of time and resource in early acquisition of this knowledge is a critical factor for success (Cooper 2001). Armed with this information, the SME is able to adopt a Customer Focused Design (CFD) strategy, whereby the product development effort is remains focused on the external customers wants and needs through all phases. SMEs that are able to satisfy these needs more effectively enjoy an obvious competitive advantage (Matzler and Hinterhuber 1998; Lüthje 2004). SMEs are often challenged by these tasks (Freel 2000; Larsen and Lewis 2007; Owens 2007). They may be overwhelmed by the prospect of expected costs, lack of expertise, and financial pressures to rush to market. Too often the more conventional path is chosen, whereby a solution is proposed, developed and tested in the market to “see if it sticks”. Such methodologies are less effective and subject the SME to increased financial risk. International studies of SMEs attitudes and behaviour towards NPD reveal common challenges of resource limitations, skills deficiencies and organizational issues (Xueli, Soutar et al. 2002; de Jong and Vermeulen 2006; Siu, Lin et al. 2006; Murphy and Ledwith 2007; Owens 2007). New Zealand firms are no exception, and are burdened with similar challenges as their international counterparts. This study aims to propose a simple framework for small firms who wish to acquire knowledge about their target markets and potential customers with limited time and resources. The framework enables SMEs to incorporate customer focused design principles into their product definition phase, and better orient themselves to the consumer marketplace. The study makes use of a New Zealand based case study to evaluate how the framework may be employed to identify quick and inexpensive efforts that can reproduce some elements of more sophisticated CFD and benchmarking methods. The obtained results are incorporated into a product design specification and embodied into a physical prototype to further illuminate the process. In addition to the primary area of study, prospects for new <b>adjacent</b> <b>product</b> lines and new potential markets for future development are also gained from the research...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{intersection}} of patents and antitrust where a patent holder uses the monopoly power it possesses {{in the market for}} a patented product to exclude competitors in an adjacent market and attempt to monopolize or monopolize the adjacent market. The present scheme for awarding patents cannot judge when the issuance of a patent will lead to the appropriate balance between innovation and economic efficiency. Where a patent holder’s invention uses an interface with <b>adjacent</b> <b>products,</b> the patent holder may be tempted to extend its patent monopoly into adjacent markets that depend upon the interface with the patented invention. Economic theory suggests that it is inappropriate to immunize a patent holder from antitrust liability when it attempts to extend its patent monopoly into adjacent markets because it could decrease consumer surplus. Courts have expressed their reluctance to scrutinize a patent holder’s innovations and design changes because of the potential benefits of the innovations and their reluctance to second-guess the marketplace. However, applying traditional antitrust principles, courts have found that monopolists could be liable for unlawfully extending their monopoly positions into adjacent markets in the areas of computer peripherals and software applications; aftermarkets for replacement parts, service and maintenance of durable goods; design changes to medical devices; and changes in drug formulas. While the patent laws provide a spur to innovation by granting limited monopoly rights, the antitrust laws curb the excessive reach of these monopoly rights by acting as a check on excessive expansion of the scope of the patent grant. Courts are the only participants in the legal process that have the competence to ensure that patents do not cause economic stagnation and harm by permitting a patent holder to extend its monopoly into an adjacent market. Consequently, courts should be willing to apply antitrust principles to cases involving the monopolization of interfaces through design changes. ...|$|R

The orientation of four ORFs, two upstream (ORF 1 and ORF 2) and one downstream (ORF 4) of scaA (ORF 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas ORF 5 and ORF 6 were transcribed divergently. Computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for ATP (GxxGxGKS) in the putative 28, 054 -Da protein encoded by ORF 1. ORF 2 potentially encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29, 705 Da with six potential membrane-spanning regions.

40|$|AbstractLow-energy {{collisions}} between [M ☆- 1]− ions {{derived from}} the three isomers of dichlorobenzene and deuterated water and ammonia are found to produce distinctive hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reaction product patterns. The predominant products observed for p-, m-, and o-dichlorobenzene are 1, 2, and 3 sequential deuterium exchanges, respectively. The reactivity is substantially higher for D 2 O than ND 3. We postulate a mechanism that involves {{the formation of a}} five-membered-ring intermediate. The intermediate is thought to be initiated by the attack of ND 3 or D 2 O at the localized negative charge site on the aromatic ring. A successful exchange is followed by the relocation of the charge site of the <b>adjacent</b> carbon. Ion <b>products</b> with higher degrees of deuterium substitution than the expected predominant products of their corresponding isomers are believed to be the results of isomerization of the reactant ions occurring in the ion source. The proposed mechanism fully explains the observed product spectra derived from all the isomers of chlorinated benzenes.

40|$|In {{response}} to competitive pressures, firms are increasingly adopting revenue management opportunities afforded by advances in {{information and communication}} technologies. Motivated by revenue management initiatives in industry, we consider a dynamic pricing problem facing a firm that sells given initial invento-ries of multiple substitutable and perishable products over a finite selling horizon. Since the products are substitutable, individual product demands are linked through consumer choice processes. Hence, the seller must formulate a joint dynamic pricing strategy while explicitly incorporating consumer behavior. For a general model of consumer choice, we model this multi-product dynamic pricing problem as a stochastic dynamic program and characterize its optimal prices. In addition, since consumer behavior depends {{on the nature of}} product differentiation, we introduce a linear random utility framework that captures the cases of vertical and horizontal product differentiation. When products are vertically differentiated, our results show monotonicity properties (with respect to quality, inventory, and time) of the optimal prices and reveal that the optimal price of a product depends on higher quality product inventories only through their aggre-gate inventory rather than individual availabilities. Further, this aggregate inventory solely determines the product’s markup over an <b>adjacent</b> lower quality <b>product</b> in the assortment. We exploit these properties to develop a polynomial-time exact algorithm for determining the optimal prices. When products are horizon...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion of spent UO{sub 2 } fuel {{has been}} studied in {{experiments}} conducted for nearly six years. Oxidative dissolution in vapor and dripping groundwater at 90 C occurs via general corrosion at fuel-fragment surfaces. Dissolution along fuel-grain boundaries is also evident in samples contacted by the largest volumes of groundwater, and corroded grain boundaries extend at least 20 or 30 grains deep (> 200 {micro}m), possibly throughout millimeter-sized fragments. Apparent dissolution of fuel along defects that intersect grain boundaries has created dissolution pits that are 50 to 200 nm in diameter. Dissolution pits penetrate 1 - 2 {micro}m into each grain, producing a ''worm-like'' texture along fuel-grain-boundaries. Sub-micrometer-sized fuel shards are common between fuel grains and {{may contribute to the}} reactive surface area of fuel exposed to groundwater.

The use of MPLs in advanced PEFCs has aided manufacturing of higher performing fuel cells with substantially reduced cost. However, the underlying mechanisms are not yet completely understood {{due to a lack}} of information about the detailed MPL structure and properties. In the present work, the 3 D phase segregated nanostructure of an MPL is revealed for the first time through the development of a customized, non-destructive procedure for monochromatic nano-scale X-ray computed tomography (NXCT) visualization. Utilizing this technique, it is discovered that PTFE is situated in conglomerated regions distributed randomly within connected domains of carbon particles; hence, it is concluded that PTFE acts as a binder for the carbon particles and provides structural support for the MPL. Exposed PTFE surfaces are also observed that will aid the desired hydrophobicity of the material. Additionally, the present approach uniquely enables phase segregated calculation of effective transport properties, as reported herein, which is particularly important for accurate estimation of electrical and thermal conductivity. Additionally, two analytical models are developed for estimation of thermal conductivity and diffusivity of MPL, as a function of structural properties, i. e., porosity and pore size. Based on these models, the pore size distribution and porosity of an MPL with a high diffusivity and thermal conductivity is proposed. Finally, a performance model is developed that is used to study the effects of MPL properties on fuel cell performance. Overall, the new imaging technique and associated findings may contribute to further performance improvements and cost reduction in support of fuel cell commercialization for clean energy applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between two empirical findings in the lit- erature on price discrimination; why different retailers offer different versions of a product, and how competition distorts the price schedule of a multi-version product. In chapter II, I examine whether a monopolist offering a single product in different container sizes alters that product’s price schedule when a new product is intro- duced. To assess the validity of this hypothesis, I use a model of second-degree price discrimination {{to show that the}} introduction of a new product does not distort the price schedule of an existing product. Using detailed, store-level data from the Dominick’s Fine Foods supermarket chain, I test the model’s prediction by investigating whether stores within this chain distort the prices of different sizes of a sport drink when they introduce a new sports drink. I find that a product release hampers the monopolist’s ability to distort the relative prices of a <b>product’s</b> <b>adjacent</b> container sizes. This result supports thehypothesis that new product introduction can explain both puzzles. Chapter III continues this investigation by relaxing the single-firm assumption, allowing competing firms to sell multiple versions of different products. The mail order catalog industry proves to be a useful setting in which to assess the relation- ship between price discrimination and competition. Because mailing lists are pure information goods, they have zero marginal costs. Hence, any price variation cannot be attributed to cost differences and must therefore be attributed to price discrimi- nation. The results indicate that increased competition is generally associated with an increased propensity to price discriminate. Further, list owners offer menus with more choices in more competitive markets. That is, not only are lists in more competitive segments more likely to price discriminate, they will also partition their consumers into finer subsets. These results, like those from chapter II, suggest that {{the relationship between}} price discrimination and the presence of close substitutes is largely dictated by con- sumer preference...|$|R

The research focus of this project was to determine, through adjacent category innovation whether my new branded premium craft carbonated soda product range was a consumer relevant innovation, scalable and therefore able to sustainably enhance market growth and profitability for my project partner, DB Breweries. A mixed methods research approach using qualitative and quantitative surveys revealed strong consumer preferences for the product to be authentic, artisanal, premium, health focussed and particularly targeted to females, older consumers and {{as an alternative to}} alcohol. These findings represented market opportunities, however, the clear-cut preference for a homespun, handcrafted, local and small batched produced product as opposed to mass machine manufactured, was an unexpected finding with significant implications for the project. This core finding created a tension between the preference for authenticity and the original concept of leveraging my project partner’s scale machine based manufacturing capacity. These findings and my advisory board’s guidance reshaped the business model canvas, proposing a joint venture between Chapman (my company) and my project partner, which as an established beverage company would bring know-how and distribution with my company being the entrepreneurial, authentic, artisanal, small batch producer. The reshaped strategy and business model shifted the adjacent category innovation from a product to a geographical perspective, with export potential to China and possibly the Muslim market. The online sales channel in China has significant export appeal with its deep retail market penetration and rapid growth, but very low current penetration in the beverage category which is forecast for significant growth. Successful export entry into China would establish a potential platform to enter segments of the global Muslim market, a commercially attractive market for premium non-alcoholic beverages. A deeper understanding of the rapidly growing negative consumer perception of artificial sweeteners led to a further innovative opportunity emerging from this project. As a consequence of this intersectional thinking a sub-project to develop a New Zealand natural sweetener based on indigenous plants, fruits or trees commenced. This research project has revealed the new branded premium carbonated soda product range to be a consumer relevant innovation, scalable but not as a straight forward <b>product</b> <b>adjacent</b> category innovation and with export success has the potential to significantly enhance market growth and profitability for DB Breweries. This project is now on a trajectory to be commercialised...|$|R
40|$|We have reanalysed {{the problem}} of growth of a dense product rim on a sphere of parent phase. To {{decouple}} {{the problem of}} calculating deformation from rheology, we assume spherical symmetry, and incompressible phases. Within the product, the radial deviatoric strain and its time-derivative prove to be of opposite sign: strain is compressive, but the strain rate is tensile. Further, the radial deviatoric strain in the new <b>product</b> <b>adjacent</b> to the interface is invariant in time. Propagation of the phase interface is determined by a competition between two mechanisms: as an element of material is transformed, its shear strain energy is increased; and the core pressure performs work compressing it. For elastic phases, this competition results in metastability. Within a certain pressure range, either phase can occur alone, but the two phases can not coexist. Because this result is inconsistent with experiments by Kawazoe et al. (2010) in which a rim of high-pressure phase (wadsleyite) coexists with a central core of low-pressure phase (olivine), we then incorporate plastic flow. Assuming perfect plasticity, we show that for a given applied pressure exceeding the coexistence pressure, a rim of product can now nucleate if the excess pressure δ. p exceeds a critical value depending on yield stress. Increasing δ. p above this value allows product to grow into the parent phase. There are now two possibilities, depending {{on the value of}} δ. p. Growth may eventually cease to produce a state in which the product rim is in equilibrium with a parent core; or growth may follow a more complicated path: within a range of excess pressures, the growth rate can decrease strongly from its initial value to produce a quasi-equilibrium state, before increasing again to a rate similar to that at which transformation began. We interpret these results to mean that if δ. p is increased slowly in a series of experiments with constant yield stress, the sample passes through a series of equilibria until δ. p is large enough for the second type of growth to be possible transformation is then completed rapidly on the timescale set by interface kinetics. This result may be relevant to the problem of deep earthquakes. Lastly, using existing experiments in which a wadsleyite rim grows on an olivine sphere, we apply the theory to estimate the yield strength of wadsleyite: our estimates are consistent with measurements by independent methods. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a start {{was made with}} meiotic {{observations}} of mouse translocation types - a Robertsonian translocation and a translocation between a metacentric and an acrocentric chromosome - which also occur in man. It is generally accepted that, when no chromosomal rearrangements are involved, man shows {{a higher level of}} non-disjunction than the mouse. When the meiotic behaviour of translocations in mouse and man would be more similar than that found for the autosomal bivalents (and sex bivalent) of these species Chapter 1 reviews the methodology to establish this difference mouse systems characterized by chromosome aberrations would become more attractive as models for the study of endogeneous and exogeneous factors on the meiotic process and extrapolation from mouse to man would be facilitated. As it appeared in these studies that not only the translocation complex but also the normal bivalents contribute to a significant extent to the non-disjunction rates in the heterozygote for a translocation of the meta/acro type, this material appeared even more favourable as an experimental substitute for man than was initially expected. Meiosis in male mice, heterozygous for the Robertsonian translocation Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr, has been studied in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of non-disjunction for the trivalent formed at meiosis I by the Rb chromosome and the two acrocentric homologues 11 and 13 (Chapters 2 and 3). As an exogeneous factor of possible influence, the meiotic effects of two types of radiation, administered at relatively low doses 2 and 3 hours before prometaphase-metaphase II (probably during metaphase-anaphase I), were determined in Rb 4 Bnr/+-males (Chapter 3). The segregational behaviour of the multivalent at anaphase I has been compared in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,RBnr, structurally homozygous for the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome whereby arm 13 of one of the two metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1, and T(I 113) 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (Chapter 4). The multivalents formed by the latter karyotype at meiosis I are highly comparable to those of the former one; for details see section III below. The results obtained, and presented below, warrant a further investigation of these mouse meiotic systems as models for the situation in man as is for example indicated by the significant increase of normal bivalent non-disjunction found in the T(1; 11. 3 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and the T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotypes. In the next sections the chapters on which the conclusions are based, have been indicated between parentheses. I Indications for the relation between delay before and around anaphase I and non-disjunction in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, inter mouse variation was noted with respect to the duration of the meiotic prophase, i. e. the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase V'. This was concluded {{on the basis of the}} frequency of late diplotene/metaphase I cells with labelled chromosomes recorded autoradiographically in mice killed various time intervals after the i. p. administered injection with 3 H-thymidine (3). - For Rb 4 Bnr/+ males, compared to their +/+ controls, a greater mean number of late diplotene/metaphase 1 cells was counted in the separate groups along the seminiferous epithelium, whereas the mean distance between the subsequent groups was smaller. As these data are in contradiction with the reduction by 58 % of the epidydimal sperm count for Rb 4 Bnr/+ compared to +/+, the greater number was thought to be an accumulation effect due to delay during diplotene/metaphase I for at least a fraction of the cells. Implicitly a causal relation between delay and cell death before the spermatozoal stage is also suggested (2). - The duration of the period "end meiosis I (metaphase I) - end meiosis II'' was approached autoradiographically for Rb 4 Bnr/+-males with the aid of cells showing a labelled Y chromosome only. The best assessment of the duration of this period was 3 hours or less. Inter mouse variation with respect to the duration of the period "end of the premeiotic S phase-metaphase ill (see above) prevented a more accurate estimate (3). - Irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ males for 14. 5 minutes with a dose of 15. 2 rad fast neutrons (mean energy 1. 7 MeV) significantlydecreased the incidence of ancuploid secondary spermatocytes, scored 2 and 3 hours after application. This was explained by selective cell killing of those cells giving rise to aneuploid daughter cells after anaphase I, rather than by protection against non- disjunction by the irradiation dose, as follows: For Rb 4 Bnr/+ during the final period of the primary spermatocyte stage, cells show a continuous distribution with respect to the extent of delay. Cells with a strong delay will die off before the secondary spermatocyte stage, while the fraction showing only minor delay will survive (in the unirradiated situation) but with an increased risk of producing aneuploid daughter cells. The results suggest that, in terms of cell death, the victims of the 15. 2 rad neutron irradiation predominantly have to be searched in the last category. A causal relation between delay and ensuing non-disjunction at anaphase I, and between delay and the neutron irradiation effect respectively, is thus suggested but the basis for these interactions remains unknown (3). II Irradiation induced damage during meiosis in male Rb 4 Bnr Robertsonian translocation heterozygotes- After irradiation of Rb 4 Bnr/+ male mice for 14. 5 minutes with either a dose of 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays, only neutrons affected, viz. significantly decreased (see above), the incidence of aneuploid secondary spermatocytes estimated 2 and 3 hours after irradiation. The reason for this difference remained unknown and could not be explained on the basis of a difference in the levels of radiation induced damage. The two radiation types induced comparable levels of chromosome damage, i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions per cell, when compared in either late diplotene/metaphase I or metaphase II cells. For these parameters the neutrons: X ray RBE ratios estimated were 5. 4 for meiosis 1 and 3. 3 for meiosis II cells (3). - After an irradiation-fixation interval of 2 to 3 hours, the chromosome damage (i. e. numbers of breaks, fragments and deletions) induced by either 15. 2 rad neutrons or 60 rad X rays was 5 - 10 times higher when scored in metaphase II than in diakinesis/ metaphase I cells. At the moment of irradiation the two categories of cells were, most probably, at prometaphase/metaphase 1 and late diplotene/early diakinesis, respectively. The difference in chromosome damage was argued to be merely the consequence of differences in chromosomal processes taking place during the irradiation-fixation interval and not a reflection of a difference in radiation sensitivity between the two meiosis I stages (3). III The meiotic behaviour in T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, also with reference to the behaviour of the normal bivalentsThe T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype includes the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome in homozygous condition whereby the 13 arm of one of the metacentrics is involved in a reciprocal translocation with the acrocentric chromosome 1. The T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr karyotype is double heterozygous for the T(1; 13) 7 OH reciprocal translocation and the metacentric Rb(11. 13) 4 Bnr chromosome. Its multivalent at meiosis I differs from the one in the former karyotype in one respect: The (acrocentric) chromosome 11 is here involved once separately and once as one of the arms of the metacentric, i. e. attached to the 13 arm, whereas in the former karyotype the two chromosomes 11 are involved each in a metacentric. - For the short translocated segment 13 t, in both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males, chiasma terminalization with proceeding meiosis I was observed less frequently compared with T 70 W+. It was argumented that this is probably due to spermatocyte I degeneration taking place to a higher extent in the former two karyotypes as in both, in comparison to T 7 OH/+, a greater frequency of meiosis 1 cells with short contracted bivalents was observed. The latter phenomenon was in an earlier study shown to correlate highly with a decreasing sperm count (4). - In T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+, Rb 4 Bnr a chiasmate association of the long interstitial segment 13 i was absent in 12. 5 % (N= 1000) of the meiosis I cells, but only in 2. 7 % (N= 1000) of these cells in T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males. A cause for this discrepancy could not be given the phenomenon could not be contributed to a precocious "disappearance" of the 13 i chiasma - and seems to be an effect of the metacentric chromosome present in homozygous condition in the former karyotype (4). A significant increase of the 3 : 1 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes after anaphase 1 in comparison to T 7 OH/+ (3. 5 %) was found for T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (10. 9 %) but most significantly for T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr (22. 6 %). In the latter karyotype this refers only to the four chromosomes involved in that part of the multivalent caused by the T 70 H translocation. In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr, a preference of the small marker chromosome 1 13 to segregate; with the metacentric Rb 4 Bnr chromosome was indicated and this could be sustained by the high frequency of Ts(1 13 ) 70 H tertiary trisomics among the progeny of males of this karyotype. The results suggest that factors predisposing for 3 : 1 segregation and life expectancy of the tertiary trisomic product produced among the progeny may coincide (4). In T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr males the alternate and <b>adjacent</b> 1 segregation <b>products</b> could be distinguished at meiosis II and almost equal frequencies were found for both. In the offspring however, karyotypes resulting from adjacent 1 were found more frequently but this disagreement is probably due to the limited sample size of the offspring karyotyped (4). In both T(1; 11. 13 S),+/+,Rb 4 Bnr and T 70 H,+/+,Rb 4 Bnr male mice, the normal bivalent non-disjunction after anaphase I appeared to be highly elevated in comparison to +/+ and T 70 H/+ For the former karyotype a correlation was observed, moreover, between nondisjunction for the normal bivalents and adjacent 2 segregation of the multivalent chromosomes. This suggests either an interaction between the two phenomena or, alternatively, their coincidence may be an effect of the general (poor) physiological status of the cells. A sharp distinction between these alternatives cannot be made. The indication of spermatocyte I degeneration (see first point of this section) in both karyotypes puts weight on the latter hypothesis, assuming an interaction between the poorer physiological status of the cell and adjacent 2 /normal bivalent non-disjunction. ...|$|R
