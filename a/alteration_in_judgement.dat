40|$|The impossibility results <b>in</b> <b>judgement</b> {{aggregation}} show a {{clash between}} fair aggregation procedures and rational collective outcomes. In this paper, {{we are interested in}} analysing the notion of rational outcome by proposing a proof-theoretical understanding of collective rationality. In particular, we use the analysis of proofs and inferences provided by linear logic in order to define a fine-grained notion of group reasoning that allows for studying collective rationality with respect to a number of logics. We analyse the well-known paradoxes <b>in</b> <b>judgement</b> aggregation and we pinpoint the reasoning steps that trigger the inconsistencies. Moreover, we extend the map of possibility and impossibility results <b>in</b> <b>judgement</b> aggregation by discussing the case of substructural logics. In particular, we show that there exist fragments of linear logic for which general possibility results can be obtained. ...|$|R
