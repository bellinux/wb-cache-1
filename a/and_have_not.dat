5|$|Many {{subsequent}} {{films have}} drawn on elements of Casablanca. Passage to Marseille reunited actors Bogart, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre and director Curtiz in 1944, {{and there are}} similarities between Casablanca and another later Bogart film, To Have <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not</b> (1944).|$|E

5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has not, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> in {{the common}} English language vernacular. In some dialects ain't is also used as a contraction of do not, does not, and did not. The development of ain't for {{the various forms of}} to be not, to have not, and to do not occurred independently, at different times. The usage of ain't for the forms of to be not was established by the mid-18th century, and for the forms of to have not by the early 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Another {{threat to}} {{albatrosses}} is introduced species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs. Albatrosses {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|E
5|$|Bacall's {{first film}} {{appearance}} was with Humphrey Bogart in the 1944 film To Have <b>and</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Not.</b> The following year she married Bogart {{and went on}} to appear with him in The Big Sleep (1946), Dark Passage (1947), and Key Largo (1948). She also starred in comedies such as How to Marry a Millionaire in 1953 with Marilyn Monroe, Designing Woman in 1957 with Gregory Peck, and Sex and the Single Girl in 1964 with Natalie Wood. Bacall also appeared in Murder on the Orient Express (1976) and The Shootist (1976).|$|E
5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E

5|$|Denmark's first churches {{from the}} 9th century were built of timber <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> survived. Hundreds of stone {{churches in the}} Romanesque style {{were built in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. They had a flat-ceilinged nave and chancel with small rounded windows and round arches. Granite {{boulders}} and limestone were initially the preferred building materials, but after brick production reached Denmark {{in the middle of the}} 12th century, brick quickly became the material of choice. Among the finest examples of brick Romanesque buildings are St. Bendt's Church in Ringsted (c. 1170) and the unique Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (c. 1200) with its five tall towers.|$|E
5|$|Each of the {{principal}} Upanishads {{can be associated with}} one of the schools of exegesis of the four Vedas (shakhas). Many Shakhas are said to have existed, of which only a few remain. The new Upanishads often have little relation to the Vedic corpus <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been cited or commented upon by any great Vedanta philosopher: their language differs from that of the classic Upanishads, being less subtle and more formalized. As a result, they are not difficult to comprehend for the modern reader.|$|E

Track runner Zourah Ali was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremonies, while table tennis player Yasmin Farah was the flag bearer for the closing ceremonies. Djibouti failed to win an Olympic medal at these Games, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> won a medal since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.|$|E

5|$|Gauguin {{first visited}} Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> survived.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is a Jupiter-size planet. The {{estimated}} minimum mass is 1.37 {{times the}} mass of Jupiter. The planet {{has been found to}} orbit its host star every 279.8 days at a distance of 0.896 AU, which is approximately 89.6% of the mean distance between the Sun and the Earth. HD 205739 b has a mildly elliptical orbit, given its orbital eccentricity of 0.27. The planet's elliptical orbit is typical with respect to discovered planets whose orbits are longer than twenty days <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> grown circular because of tidal forces. According to its discoverers, HD 205739 b's elongated orbit causes its surface temperature to fluctuate by up to 100 K.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to be restricted to Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been able to incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported Shehri as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat, who was still alive and well. The Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the Shehri brothers had disappeared <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been heard from since.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine {{became the}} easternmost forming {{tropical}} cyclone on record when it developed formed over Guinea. The most intense storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Ellen, a Category 3 cyclone that remained over open water. The final named storm was meteorologically significant in that it became the first recorded tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone. No names were retired during the season; however, due to the addition of male names into the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 1979, several of the names were removed <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been used since.|$|E
