25|$|Much of the Army of Northern Virginia, local defense {{troops and}} a {{battalion}} of sailors as well as Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet, were able to escape from Petersburg and Richmond just {{in advance of the}} Union troops entering those cities on April 3 because Confederate rear guard forces, especially at Forts Gregg and Whitworth, Fort Mahone and Sutherland's Station, fought desperate delaying actions on April 2 to give most of the Confederates <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> Union Army pursuers.|$|E

25|$|The Wachau, {{along with}} the rest of the Austrian wine industry, responded to the scandal with the {{development}} of strict wine laws and quality assurances. Producers in the Wachau already had <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> this movement with the development a couple years earlier of the Vinea Wachau in 1983, a collaborative association that aimed to distinguish Wachau wine from other Austrian wines. In addition to holding its members to a guaranteed minimum quality level above the requirements of Austrian wine laws, the Vinea Wachau also established its own classification and wine labeling system that is still being used for Wachau wines today.|$|E
25|$|The OBPA holds {{a breakfast}} event every Wednesday at a Denny's {{restaurant}} in Oceanside, California. The breakfast starts at 8 am although members start showing up {{as early as}} 6:30 am to get <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the festivities. The group occupies {{the back room of}} the restaurant which is decorated with model aircraft hanging from the ceiling and photos of aircraft and pilots lining the walls. Attendees come from communities throughout southern California. Less frequent are visitors from around the world including Germany, Australia, Hungary and South Africa. Some come for the camaraderie while others find relief discussing the rigors of combat with people who have had similar experiences.|$|E
25|$|Not {{much was}} {{expected}} of the Drillers, nowhere {{more evident than in}} the pre-season coaches poll that had them pegged to finish 4–36. Such opinions were hardly unexpected though, as the Power were a dismal 6–34 the year prior. Even then most of the players inherited were good for little more than trade bait as the NPSL required that teams could field no more than four imports. Experienced players were very hard to come by, as not only had there not been any Canadian teams prior to provide a talent base, but there was another Canadian team entering the league that year, the Toronto Shooting Stars, and they had <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> finding players.|$|E
50|$|Chairman's Challenge: Each chef was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} {{his or her}} own buffet display and was given 3 hours to create three hot and two cold entrees.

50|$|By {{successfully}} {{defeating the}} Union reconnaissance party, A.P. Hill convinced Sedgwick that Lee still held Fredericksburg in force. Accordingly, Hooker remained along the Rappahanock giving Lee <b>a</b> valuable <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> his invasion. However, Hooker remained unsure of Lee's true position and intentions and accordingly ordered a reconnaissance by his Cavalry, {{which resulted in}} the Battle of Brandy Station on June 9.|$|R
50|$|See, kids usually don't {{start playing}} hockey until they're six or seven. Ice isn't grass. It's {{a whole new}} surface and {{everybody}} starts from ground zero. … By the time I was ten, I had eight years on skates instead of four, and a few seasons' worth of ice time against ten-year-olds. So I had <b>a</b> long <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> everyone else.|$|R
25|$|Steele was now desperately {{short of}} supplies, outnumbered and {{in danger of}} being {{surrounded}} at Camden. After his senior officers agreed with him that he had no other reasonable choice, Steele ordered a night withdrawal toward Little Rock on April 26 and the early morning of April 27, 1864. The Confederates did not detect Steele's movement until later in the day. Steele's forces used a pontoon bridge which they had carried on the campaign to cross the Ouachita River. Steele thus gained <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the Confederates who pursued the federal force as soon as they realized that Steele had withdrawn from Camden. First, the Confederates had to get across the swollen, and bridgeless, Ouachita River on the morning of April 28 by constructing a raft bridge. This delay allowed Steele to get a further head start, although rain soon slowed him down. The Confederates struggled through the rain, as well, but they did not have as many wagons or as much equipment to slow down their pursuit.|$|E
500|$|Bell began {{crafting}} his script, {{adding a}} mafia-related sub-plot and replacing the airplane drop with a fall from a building, for budgetary reasons. The biggest hurdle for the episode, however, was crafting the Rube Goldberg machine. However, because Bell had [...] "extra time" [...] {{to write his}} script, the art department was given <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> crafting the contraption. Gillian Anderson later explained that working with the machines required a lot of patience, because multiple takes had to be filmed {{in order to make}} sure everything went as planned. Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, broke a [...] "long-standing rule" [...] on the show and re-cast Willie Garson—who had appeared in the third season episode [...] "The Walk"—as Henry Weems. Millikan noted that Garson was [...] "literally the best person for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...]300 Winchester Magnum's high {{availability}} in popular rifles such as Winchester's Model 70 and Remington Model 700 made the cartridge a popular choice among the shooting public. Although the [...]300 H Magnum, [...]30-338 Winchester Magnum and the [...]308 Norma Magnum had <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the [...]300 Winchester Magnum these cartridges soon faded into obsolescence. Only the [...]300 Winchester Magnum was {{to survive as}} a readily available cartridge. [...] Other cartridges, while available, are more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Other {{operating}} systems existed, but most languages {{tended to be}} Fortran or Fortran-based. Bell Laboratories, as proof of both portability concept and circuit design, moved the first C compiler to their Cray-1 (non-vectorizing). This act would later give CRI <b>a</b> six-month <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the Cray-2 Unix port to ETA Systems' detriment, and Lucasfilm's first computer generated test film, The Adventures of André and Wally B..|$|R
5000|$|The {{inheritance}} {{of the entire}} infrastructure, resources and membership of the old Communist party gave the DPS <b>a</b> sizable <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> their opponents in the newly formed parties. It allowed them to win the first multi-party parliamentary election held on 9 and 16 December 1990, and presidential elections held on 9 and 23 December 1990. The party has ruled Montenegro [...] (either alone or as a leading member of different ruling coalitions).|$|R
50|$|An {{equalizer}} {{was added}} in 2004. The difference in {{time between the}} women's and men's 15K national records was 4:53, so the elite women runners got <b>a</b> five-minute <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the elite men. The first finisher, man or woman, receives a $5,000 bonus. Even so, the women had only won the prize once (in 2007). In 2012, the equalizer was increased to 6:35, and Janet Cherobon won the $5,000 bonus that year and in 2013.|$|R
2500|$|British {{railways}} had <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> American railroads, {{with the}} first [...] "bed-carriage" [...] (an early sleeping car) being built there as early as 1838 for use on the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway. [...] Britain's early sleepers, when made up for sleeping, extended {{the foot of the}} bed into a boot section at the end of the carriage. [...] The cars were still too short to allow more than two or three beds to be positioned end to end.|$|E
2500|$|NBC-TV's Garrick Utley, {{anchoring}} NBC Nightly News that evening, also interrupted his newscast {{in order}} to break the story, doing so about three minutes after Cronkite on CBS. The news was not reported on that night's ABC Evening News, which was anchored by Howard K. Smith and Harry Reasoner, because ABC at the time fed their newscast live at 6:00 pm Eastern instead of 6:30 to get <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> CBS and NBC for those stations that aired ABC Evening News live (although not every affiliate did).|$|E
2500|$|The route {{down the}} eastern Sierras {{was done on}} the south side of Donner Lake with a series of switchbacks carved into the mountain. The Truckee River, which drains Lake Tahoe, had already found and scoured out the best route across the Carson Range of {{mountains}} east of the Sierras. The route down the rugged Truckee River Canyon, including required bridges, was done ahead of the main summit tunnel completion. To expedite the building of the railroad through the Truckee River canyon, the Central Pacific hauled two small locomotives, railcars, rails and other material on wagons and sleighs to what is now Truckee, California and worked the winter of 1867–68 on their way down Truckee canyon ahead of the tracks being completed to Truckee. In Truckee canyon, five Howe truss bridges had to be built. This gave them <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> getting to the [...] "easy" [...] miles across Nevada.|$|E
5000|$|Although Jamaica's {{contestant}} had won {{the prior}} year, the first student outside the United States to ever win the bee, Jamaica was excluded from this year's bee under a new rule that all qualifying bees could not occur before February 1, to allay concerns that some spellers could get <b>a</b> greater <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> preparing for the national bee. This caused {{a fair amount of}} controversy, with public figure such as Jesse Jackson calling the change [...] "exclusionary." ...|$|R
50|$|The Dipsea's handicapping system often {{produces}} younger {{or older}} winners, which {{adds to the}} unusual intrigue and suspense created by the race's permissible shortcuts, like 'Suicide' and 'The Swoop'. Most participants, {{with the exception of}} 'scratch' runners, are given <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> based <b>on</b> their age and gender. The oldest and youngest runners are given up to a 25-minute advantage over the fastest competitors, making it possible for virtually any age group to produce a race winner; previous winners include children as young as 8, and men and women as old as 72.|$|R
5000|$|Eliminator: The {{eliminator}} {{is designed}} as a tag-team event involving only the two contender members of each team. Unlike the parent version, The Eliminator is based more upon the Pursuit course, using obstacles such as the balance beams, wire bridge and hand ladder. Each contestant completes half of the course, and tags their team mate who is waiting at the half way stage. Like the parent series, {{the team with the}} most points receive <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start,</b> depending <b>on</b> their points advantage. Every point is worth a half a second advantage.|$|R
2500|$|Christmas creep is a {{merchandising}} {{phenomenon in}} which merchants and retailers exploit the commercialized status of Christmas by {{moving up the}} start of the holiday shopping season. The term was first used in the mid-1980s. It is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before Black Friday in the United States and before Halloween in Canada. The term is not used in the UK and Ireland, where retailers call Christmas the [...] "golden quarter", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit. It can apply for other holidays as well, notably Valentine's Day, Easter and Mother's Day. The motivation for holiday creep is for retailers to lengthen their selling interval for seasonal merchandise in order to maximize profit and to give early-bird shoppers <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> that holiday. However, {{it is not clear that}} this practice has been consistently beneficial for retailers.|$|E
2500|$|General Lee's Army of Northern Virginia {{evacuated}} Petersburg, Virginia and the Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia {{on the night}} of April 23 and began a march toward Danville, Virginia, hoping to link up with General Joseph E. Johnston's army which was attempting to slow the advance the Union army group commanded by Major General William T. Sherman in North Carolina. Much of the Army of Northern Virginia and Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet were able to escape from Petersburg and Richmond just in ahead of the Union troops entering those cities on April 3 because Confederate rear guard forces, especially at Forts Gregg and Whitworth, Fort Mahone and the Battle of Sutherland's Station, fought desperate delaying actions on April 2 to give most of the Confederates <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> Union Army pursuers. General Lee first planned to reunite the four columns of his army which left Petersburg and Richmond and to resupply the army at Amelia Court House, Virginia, [...] southwest of Richmond. Lee's men left their positions in Petersburg and Richmond with only one day's rations. Lee expected to find a supply train of rations that he had ordered brought to Amelia Court House to meet the army.|$|E

5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about <b>a</b> meter's <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though the}} 8mm Remington Magnum {{has never been}} very popular, {{it is a very}} {{suitable}} cartridge for the hunting of elk, moose, caribou, and larger African antelope. However, the [...]338 Winchester Magnum had <b>a</b> 30-year <b>head</b> <b>start</b> <b>on</b> the market, and is short enough for medium length actions, which increases the models of rifles it could be produced in. It is also available with heavier bullets, although this isn't a problem for people that load their own rounds of this caliber. Bullet selection is quite critical with the 8mm Remington Magnum since the bullets have to be designed and constructed to hold together at magnum velocities.|$|R

Nevertheless, he was nearly caught by the forced marches of the pursuing cavalry columns when he recklessly paused in his retreat to attack a Carrancista garrison. The Battle of Guerrero was fought on March 29, 1916, after a 55-mile night march through the snowy Sierra Madre by Colonel George A. Dodd and 370 men of the 7th Cavalry. 360 Villistas had remained in Guerrero celebrating the victory won over the Carrancista garrison and 160 more were in the next valley in nearby San Ysidro.|$|R
