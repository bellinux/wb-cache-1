5|$|With the {{initiative}} {{back with the}} Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa. At the Battle of the Kasserine Pass his forces gave the Allies a beating, {{but in the end}} strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance. Kesselring now concentrated on shoring up his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from Sicily but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An Allied offensive in April finally broke through, leading to a collapse of the <b>Axis</b> <b>position</b> in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months, forcing a postponement of the Allied invasion of Northern France from the middle of 1943 to the middle of 1944.|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{immediately}} {{turned to}} the Luftwaffe to help blunt the offensive. At this point, its close support corps was deployed in the Crimea, {{taking part in the}} siege of Sevastopol. 8th Air Corps under the command of Wolfram von Richthofen was initially ordered to deploy to Kharkov from the Crimea, but the command was rescinded. In an unusual move, Hitler kept it in the Crimea, but did not put the corps under the command of Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet 4), which already contained 6th Air Corps, under the command of General Kurt Pflugbeil, and Fliegerführer Süd (Flying Command South), a small anti-shipping command based in the Crimea. Instead, he allowed Richthofen to take charge of all operations over Sevastopol. The siege in the Crimea was not over, and the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula had not yet been won. Still, Hitler was pleased with the progress there and content to keep Richthofen where he was and withdraw air support from Fliegerkorps VIII in order to prevent a Soviet breakthrough at Kharkov. The use of the Luftwaffe to compensate for the German Army's lack of firepower suggested that the OKW saw the Luftwaffe primarily as a ground support arm. This angered Richthofen who complained that the Luftwaffe was treated as [...] "the army's whore". Now that he was not being redeployed to Kharkov, Richthofen also complained about the withdrawal of his units to the region, arguing that the Kerch and Sevastopol battles were ongoing and owing to the transfer of aerial assets to Kharkov, victory in the Crimea was no longer guaranteed. In reality, the Soviet units at Kerch were already routed and the <b>Axis</b> <b>position</b> at Sevastopol was comfortable.|$|E

As long as the port of Tobruk was held by the British, the <b>Axis</b> <b>position</b> on the border was unstable, as the Italo-Germans were distracted by the siege, while the British could rebuild their strength in Egypt. The British Mobile Force columns based at Halfaya, Sofafi, Buq Buq and Sidi Barrani began to harass the Germans in the area around Capuzzo and Sollum and after an ambush near Sidi Azeiz, the local German commander sent an alarmist report to Rommel, leading to an attack by Group Herff from [...] that pushed the British back to Buq Buq and Sofafi but the April attacks on Tobruk were costly failures.|$|E

40|$|In {{parallel}} <b>axis</b> <b>positioning</b> systems an accuracy–throughput speed contradiction is present. The configuration {{is often}} {{such that the}} minimum number of actuators from kinematic {{point of view is}} used. The mechanical system should possess sufficient stiffness but also low mass. Structural stiffness, and hence accuracy, is obtained at the cost of mass. In intermittent motion systems the moving mass should be minimized, because it limits the attainable acceleration and thus the throughput speed. This dynamic performance barrier can be shifted with additional parallel actuators. To enhance prudence in the initial design phase, knowledge about the opportunities and limitations of parallel axis systems is required. The basic dynamical aspects of parallel <b>axis</b> <b>positioning</b> systems, with a minimum and additional number of parallel actuators, are examined for beam and plate systems. The results of the numerical models are verified with an experimental plate system...|$|R
