5|$|Acting <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> {{key role}} in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in his central characters. In his first several features, he tended {{to use the same}} lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|Samson {{has been}} the subject of both rabbinic and Christian commentary, with some Christians viewing him as a type of Jesus, based on {{similarities}} between their lives. Notable depictions of Samson include John Milton's closet drama Samson Agonistes and Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 Hollywood film Samson and Delilah. Samson <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> major role in Western art and traditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is {{supplied}} {{by a number}} of arteries. The posterior auricular artery provides the majority of the blood supply. The anterior auricular arteries provide some supply to the outer rim of the ear and scalp behind it. The posterior auricular artery is a direct branch of the external carotid artery, and the anterior auricular arteries are branches from the superficial temporal artery. The occipital artery <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role.|$|E
5|$|The reserve {{was created}} to protect fifteen plants of {{regional}} interest and three plant communities listed in the Habitats Directive. Its flora are linked to calcium present in marl. It {{is located in a}} transition zone between the oceanic and semi-continental climates and that gives increased biodiversity, with typical species of the atlantic areas and others more continental. The reserve <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role in a wildlife corridor.|$|E

5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH. For example, having {{two copies of}} ApoE4 (a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role in Alzheimer's disease) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome. The occurrence of hyperglycemia (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers {{a higher risk of}} poor outcome.|$|E
5|$|AMPK {{probably}} <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role {{in increased}} peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK {{is known to}} cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; the metabolic actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens {{can both}} {{mobilize}} solid copper as a cyanide compound. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna, Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper. The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A {{sample of the}} fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and zinc. The fungus <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.|$|E
50|$|Drif <b>also</b> <b>played</b> <b>an</b> {{active role}} in the {{activities}} of the FLN around this time. Alongside Djamila Bouhired and Hassiba Ben Bouali, Drif canvassed to gain support among Algiers women for the movement.

5|$|Dr. Odine is a {{scientist}} and magic researcher from Esthar. He discovered the GFs and junctioning and engineered {{a machine that}} mimics Ellone's power. Seventeen years before the game, he developed the necessary technology to allow Laguna to entomb Adel. As a researcher of the Lunatic Pandora, he also helps {{to prevent it from}} reaching Tears' Point and initiating a Lunar Cry. Odine <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role in the plot to destroy Ultimecia, explaining how to survive time compression.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang music {{generally}} {{could be}} found as the social entertainment at a host of different occasions. It is used during large feasts, festive/harvest gatherings, for entertainment of visiting friends and relatives, and at parades. Kulintang music also accompanies ceremonies marking significant life events, such as weddings and returnees from the Hajj. Kulintang music <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> significant role during state functions, used during official celebrations, entertaining of foreign dignitaries and important visitors of distant lands, court ceremonies of either the sultanate or village chieftains, enthroning/coronations of a new leader and the transferral of a sultanate from one family to another.|$|E

Their music {{is marked by}} Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks and uniforms, <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> large role in the band's elaborate live shows.

5|$|TBI is {{a leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} around the globe and presents a major worldwide social, economic, and health problem. It is the number one cause of coma, it plays the leading role in disability due to trauma, and {{is the leading cause of}} brain damage in children and young adults. In Europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause. It <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> significant role in half of trauma deaths.|$|E
5|$|The MAM is {{enriched in}} enzymes {{involved}} in lipid biosynthesis, such as phosphatidylserine synthase on the ER face and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase on the mitochondrial face. Because mitochondria are dynamic organelles constantly undergoing fission and fusion events, they require a constant and well-regulated supply of phospholipids for membrane integrity. But mitochondria {{are not only}} a destination for the phospholipids they finish synthesis of; rather, this organelle <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> role in inter-organelle trafficking of the intermediates and products of phospholipid biosynthetic pathways, ceramide and cholesterol metabolism, and glycosphingolipid anabolism.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} <b>also</b> <b>plays</b> <b>a</b> part in Operation Garbo, a three-volume novel {{written by}} Harry Winter, a pseudonym {{for an undisclosed}} number of people. The techno-thriller novel is about a Soviet invasion of Sweden, and while Boden Fortress is not a {{main part of the}} story, one chapter in the first volume briefly mentions Södra Åberget Fort, and two chapters in the second volume are devoted to events at and around the forts, Södra Åberget and Mjösjöberget Forts are mentioned by name while Rödberget Fort is described more in detail.|$|E
