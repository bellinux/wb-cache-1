He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E

5|$|The entire {{theme for}} the film celebrates the {{relationship}} between a small girl named Emily (voiced by Emily Osborne), and her kindly but ailing grandfather (voiced by Peter Ustinov). Emily's playful innocence is contrasted with Granpa's increasing frailty. Aware that he will not be <b>around</b> <b>for</b> much longer, he shares his memories of adventures and days gone by.|$|E

5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around in her head and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved <b>around</b> <b>for</b> her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go <b>around</b> <b>for</b> runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of airspeed and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer <b>around</b> <b>for</b> predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E

5|$|Besides English {{translation}} and localization, the international version of Kingdom Hearts II {{differs from the}} original Japanese version {{in the content of}} gameplay and several scenes. The Hydra boss in the Hercules-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald <b>around</b> <b>for</b> missing a date, Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.|$|E

It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{initially}} told Kennedy {{the tumor}} was inoperable, but he looked <b>around</b> <b>for</b> other opinions and decided on the most aggressive and exhausting course of treatment possible. On June 2, 2008, Kennedy underwent brain surgery at Duke University Medical Center {{in an attempt to}} remove as much of the tumor as possible. The 3½-hour operation, conducted by Dr. Allan Friedman while Kennedy was conscious to minimize any permanent neurological effects, was deemed successful in its goals. Kennedy left the hospital a week later to begin a course of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Opinions varied regarding Kennedy's prognosis: the surgery typically only extended survival time by a matter of months, but sometimes people lived for years.|$|E
40|$|Application Service Maintenance Projects {{normally}} {{deals with}} Incidents as First Level support function. Incidents in majority directly link with Production Environment, so Turn <b>around</b> Time <b>for</b> Incidents {{is a significant}} factor. Many Companies are having Service Level Agreements with Customer <b>for</b> Turn <b>around</b> Time <b>for</b> Incidents. There {{is a need to}} focus on Estimating and Predicting Turn <b>around</b> Time <b>for</b> Incidents. Improvement in Turn around Time helps in improving the Service Level Agreements earlier agreed with the Customer. Saved time can be diverted to other Project Activities like Enhancements or for new requests. This will also helps as one of the paths for Companies to get new business with the Customer. We have used Capability Maturity Model Integration(CMMI) V 1. 2 Quantitative Project Management(QPM) methodology for Application Service Maintenance(ASM) Projects for estimating and predicting turn <b>around</b> time <b>for</b> incidents. By implementing this best practice in SEI CMMI Level 5 Company we have achieved a significant improvement of approximately 50 percent reduction in Average Turn <b>around</b> Time <b>for</b> incidents. </p...|$|R

5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep {{boreholes}} to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt.

5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came <b>around</b> <b>for</b> a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
