5000|$|The main {{element of}} the tort is [...] "interference". This must be both direct and physical, with {{indirect}} interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance. [...] "Interference" [...] covers any physical entry to land, {{as well as the}} abuse of a right of entry, when a person who has the right to enter the land does something not covered by the permission. If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires, this is also trespass. It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land. For the purposes of trespass, the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner; it is not, however, a trespass to use that road if the road is constructed with a public use easement, or if, by owner acquiescence or through <b>adverse</b> <b>use,</b> the road has undergone a common law dedication to the public. In Hickman v Maisey and Adams v. Rivers, the courts established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass: [...] "although a land owner's property rights may be subject to the right of mere passage, the owner of the soil is still absolute master."British courts have broadened the rights encompassed by public easements in recent years. In DPP v Jones, the court ruled that [...] "the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway."

Furthermore, entrepreneurial search processes for optimal price and quality differentiation may require the implementation of TM practices which deviate from strict application-agnosticism and thus violate BEREC's layer separation principle. They may according to BEREC be labeled unreasonable. Instead of the complex case-by-case assessment inducing regulatory micro-management necessary in BEREC's framework, an alternative from a network economic perspective is proposed. Based on an economic understanding of congestion, a market-driven interpretation of applicationagnosticism and a corresponding layer separation constitute the main pillars of a resilient and dynamic understanding of TM...|$|E

Whilst government support is often based on overcoming market failures in the availability or use of supports to SMEs, I argue that successful government intervention is difficult to make effective at realistic cost – benefit ratios. The analysis demonstrates little evidence of market failure in provision or take-up of business support. If a market gap existed in the past, it is no longer apparent. Any systemic market failures that remain can influence only the start-up, very early stage growth, and/or the very smallest single-person businesses. I also find that different modes of delivery by centralised, regionalised, or localised structures have very little influence on market penetration. Decentralisation can increase take-up marginally, but this has been achieved only with tenfold increases in costs and major increases in administrative complexity. There is some marginal but significant benefit of policy delivery being in the hands of market, or near-market, agencies. But for all delivery bodies there is massive variability in use, impact, and satisfaction levels achieved. Finally, a brief analysis of gender differences suggests some significant variations in use of advice from different sources, but that government sources have some of the most <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> levels for female-headed business, and this particularly applies to Business Link. Over the period 1991  –  2004 there is little to indicate the overwhelming success of government SME support policies, particularly at the level of cost that they now involve. ...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This {{briefing}} paper {{provides an}} overview of the key findings from the completion of three reports relating to the use of new media in crisis situations that have been completed as part of the COSMIC project. COSMIC, “Contribution of Social Media in Crisis management”, is a two-year project that is funded under the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme FP 7 -SEC- 2012 under grant agreement no. 312737. The first report, D 2. 1, identified existing information communication technologies (ICTs) and new media applications that being used for crisis management purposes. Key lessons learned include: 	Stakeholders should focus on the capabilities of different ICTs to meet their communication needs in preparing for, responding to and recovering from a crisis. 	Different applications have different functionalities and can be accessed using different means. There is no “one size fits all”, rather, stakeholders should consider their individual needs in different types of crises and utilise the appropriate applications to meet those requirements. 	There is currently a lack of publicly available information to fully understand the extent to which different stakeholders are using different types of new media applications. The second report, D 2. 2, included an analysis of the use of ICTs and new media applications in eight scenario case studies involving different types of crisis in Europe and Internationally. Key findings include: 	Some scenarios, e. g., the UK heat wave (2013) demonstrated that the value of social media is limited, whilst in others it is a valuable tool to aid crisis management, showing that the type and nature of the crisis matters when considering the use of social media in crisis management activities. 	There is a shortage of publicly available information evaluating the usefulness of social media following a crisis by public authorities. 	There is, at times, a high risk of miscommunication and misuse of social media in a crisis. 	The news media can contribute to crisis management efforts via their engagement with social media. 	The use of social media should not replace traditional communication systems, but rather, supplement them. The final report, D 2. 3, examined the <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> and reliability of new media. Key findings include: 	The <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> of new media applications during a crisis includes; improper use of infrastructure, misinformation and disinformation, which can significantly impact the reliability of the use of new media in a crisis. 	New media may be intentionally or unintentionally misused in a crisis. The report highlights the different sources and types of misuse of ICTs. 	While trying to respond to potential misuses of information, various stakeholders, including government authorities, may themselves hinder the effective use of new media technologies for crises communication. 	Stakeholders appear to be taking measures to manage and verify the information they receive, yet, further developments in technology are required to help improve verification practices to ensure the reliability of information. The findings from each of these reports will be taken into consideration throughout the duration of the project and will feed into the development of guidelines for citizens, government authorities, first responders and industry for the most effective use of ICTs to aid the security of citizens during a crisis. This briefing paper serves as a brief overview to be used as preparatory reading for two stakeholder engagement workshops that will be held in February 2014, in Greece and the Netherlands.

40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: How does {{corporate}} governance affect a manager's intention to promote {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) ? Is the relationship between financial transparency and CSR activities affected by the business group affiliation and ownership structure of firms? Research Findings/Insights: CSR ratings are negatively correlated {{with the level of}} earnings management when all firms are considered. However, the relationship is weaker for chaebol firms and firms with highly concentrated ownership, which suggests that CSR practices can be abusively used by those firms to conceal their poor earnings quality. The <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> of CSR is discouraged if the fraction of shares owned by institutional investors is high. However, no evidence is found for a similar moderating effect for foreign investors. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study suggests that the business group affiliation and the ownership structure of a firm are important factors in determining the managerial incentives to engage in CSR, which can explain the mixed results reported in previous research. In addition, the possibility of a simultaneous relationship between CSR and other key firm characteristics, such as earnings quality, should be considered when conducting research on CSR. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study provides the insight to investors and other stakeholders that the managerial incentives behind CSR activities can differ depending on a firm's characteristics. Care must be taken when assessing the CSR activities, in particular, of firms with weak {{corporate governance}}. For policy makers, it is important to ensure that CSR-related disclosures by firms are based on actual plans and are not intended to deceive stakeholders, especially when the firms are not actively monitored by external shareholders...|$|E

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{efficient}} use of new {{information and communication technologies}} can be of crucial importance in emergency response and crisis communications. New media applications are able to perform a range of functions such as facilitating two-way communication, enabling citizens and first respondents to request/offer assistance, enhance campaigning activities for fund raising purposes, and enable individuals/groups to efficiently organize for action. Likewise, social networking, crowdsourcing, and data mining technologies offer new means through which different stakeholders, such as officials, responders, citizens, can gather and disseminate information so as to optimize emergency response. Yet, new media technologies, and particularly social media, may often be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally in ways that can impede efficient communication during emergencies and crises. The present “Report on the <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> and reliability of new media” (D 2. 3) aims to provide an overview the <b>adverse</b> <b>use</b> of new media by scammers, hackers, terrorist groups, ordinary citizens, as well as, at times, government authorities and companies. The report also aims to provide an in-depth discussion of an issue that users of new media technologies face in the utilization of such technologies during crises and emergencies: reliability of information. Following a brief introduction (Chapter 1), the report will comprise three chapters. In Chapter 2, the report will focus on types of misuse of new media and their management. The first two sections of Chapter 2 will consider misuse of new media technologies along two axes: types of misuse and players in misuse. In the first section of the chapter, the report will focus on are misrepresentation, rumor spreading, propaganda, surveillance and censorship, and lateral surveillance. After discussing these misuse types, the section to follow will proceed with an analysis of key “players” in misuse of new media technologies. Using examples from case studies of emergencies and crises conducted by the COSMIC team in Deliverable 2. 2., as well as examples form other recent emergencies and crises (such as the Arab Spring and Hurricane Katrina) the chapter will describe the role that scammers, hackers, government authorities, and private corporations may play both as misusers and responders, depending on the circumstances. In the final section of Chapter 2, the report will discuss how different stakeholders try to manage misuse of new media. In terms of management of misuse, the report distinguished between external threats as those that come from the outside a given system or organization and internal threats that come from within an organization. In this section, particular {{attention has been paid to}} the concept of sousveillance, which can be defined as surveillance from below (performed by the public on institutions) as an approach that can increase the accountability of powerful players and prevent abuse of power. Also, the report discussed new countersurveillance techniques that can protect citizens’ right to privacy and free speech at times of crises (specifically political crises). Finally, discussion of management of internal threats underlined how datamining techniques can be used for early detection and prevention of misuse during times of crises. An important lesson learned from the discussion on Chapter 2 is that in many cases, while trying to respond to potential misuses of information, various stakeholders, including government authorities, may themselves hinder effective utilization of new media technologies for crises communication. Hence, a proper approach to management of misuse of new media technologies should definitely involve multitude of stakeholders, and particularly supranational organizations, that can provide a system of checks and balances. The focus of Chapter 3 was dissemination of misinformation via new media technologies at times of crises and techniques that can be used by various stakeholders (including citizens and mainstream journalists) to verify information. In this chapter, specific attention was paid to primary data collected from Internet users about reliability of information during the Gezi Protests that took place in Turkey in 2013. The findings from these data suggest that while Internet users are aware of the potential pitfalls of relying on the Internet for information about crises and emergencies, they often see the Internet as a more viable choice for up to date information when compared to mainstream media. Moreover, the data suggests that a considerable proportion of users engage in techniques to actively verify the information they receive. However, some of these techniques may end up amplifying the problem of dissemination of misinformation. As such, development and widespread adoption of technologies that can assist stakeholders in information verification is needed. Given this need, Chapter 3 concludes with an overview of some of the technologies (e. g., Semantically Interlinked Online Communities-SIOC), applications (e. g., Hoodcast) and techniques (crowdsourcing) that can be viable options to assist not only citizens but all stakeholders who utilize new media for getting information during times of emergencies and crises. Based on these analyses, the last chapter (Conclusion) provides a summary of key insights regarding misuse of new media technologies during crisis, management of misuse and information verification. Also, the last chapter proposes a set of principles that can guide future efforts to alleviate the adverse uses of new media described in the report...|$|E

Using a model of competition among insurers, we generate predictions about the correlation between risk and the probability of taking private insurance under both symmetric information and adverse selection. These predictions constitute the basis for our adverse selection test.

Methods: An observational prospective cohort study with a follow-up period of 6 months was conducted among current and former professional cricketers from South Africa. Using validated questionnaires to assess symptoms of common mental disorders as well as several stressors, an electronic questionnaire was set up and distributed by the South African Cricketers Association (SACA). Results: A total of 116 participants enrolled at baseline (overall response rate of 33 %) and 76 of those participants completed the 6 month follow-up (follow up rate of 66 %). The prevalence of symptoms of CMD in current professional cricketers was 38 % for distress, 38 % for sleep disturbance, 37 % for anxiety/depression and 26 % for <b>adverse</b> alcohol <b>use.</b> Among former professional cricketers, baseline prevalence as was 26 % for distress, 24 % for anxiety/depression, 21 % for sleep disturbance and 22 % for <b>adverse</b> alcohol <b>use.</b> Career dissatisfaction led to an increased risk of distress, anxiety/depression and sleep disturbance in current professional cricketers. Surgeries and adverse life events led to an increase in reported symptoms of distress and anxiety/depression in current professional cricketers.
