5|$|Approximately 12,000 {{millipede}} {{species have}} been described. Estimates of the true number of species on earth range from 15,000 to as high as 80,000. Few species of millipede are at all widespread; they have very poor dispersal abilities, depending <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> on terrestrial locomotion and humid habitats. These factors have favoured genetic isolation and rapid speciation, producing many lineages with restricted ranges.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{competition}} has had many secondary sponsors {{that invest in}} the tournament as well. Many of these sponsors are nationally based but have expanded to other nations.

5|$|In {{practical}} terms, horses {{prefer to}} eat {{small amounts of}} food steadily throughout the day, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in nature when grazing on pasture. Although {{this is not always}} possible with modern stabling practices and human schedules that favor feeding horses twice a day, {{it is important to remember}} the underlying biology of the animal when determining what to feed, how often, and in what quantities.|$|E

5|$|Painted turtle pet-keeping {{requirements}} {{are similar to}} those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. According to Petco, the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades.|$|E

5|$|Spiders in the French {{territory}} of New Caledonia in the Pacific {{were identified as}} L. hasselti in 1920, based on morphology.

5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). In wet and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not need to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought {{that some of the}} earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters {{may also}} live near areas of human civilization. In Mongolia, {{they may be}} found in yurts to keep warm during the winter, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not have {{thermoregulation}} like the Djungarian hamster. They have five main predators: the Eurasian eagle owl, the steppe eagle, the corsac fox, the common kestrel, and the saker falcon. All distribution areas have more females than males, because males are at higher risk from predators, as they cannot move as quickly.|$|E

5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{in many other}} languages. This means that a nasal in a syllable coda will not move {{to the position of}} the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E
5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so. Many species deposit the eggs on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect the eggs within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons the eggs after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, {{each with its own}} specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of the landscape is used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> today.|$|E
5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, {{to live on the}} edges of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|In a competition, {{using the}} engine ends the soaring flight. Unpowered gliders are lighter and, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{not need a}} safety margin for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E
