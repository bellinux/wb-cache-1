25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{consists}} of much fewer blades i.e., two to six, {{as compared to}} ducted fans. <b>Axial</b> <b>fans</b> operate at high specific speed i.e., high flow rate and low head and hence adding more blades will restrict the high flow rate required for its operation. Due to fewer blades, {{they are unable to}} impose their geometry on the flow, making the rotor geometry and the inlet and outlet velocity triangles meaningless. Also the blades are made very long with varying blade sections along the radius.|$|E
40|$|Performance of <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> {{is found}} to reduce {{drastically}} when instability is encountered during its operation.

The present work involves measuring the sound spectrum measurements in ducted <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> under stall conditions at frequency range from 9000 Hz to 9600 Hz. Objective of the experiment is to measure the frequency domain signal and study the sound Characteristics in ducted <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> by using spectrum analyser.

40|$|Suppressing the {{ducted fan}} noise at low {{frequencies}} without varying the flow capacity {{is still a}} technical challenge. This study examines a conceived device consisting of two tensioned membranes backed with cavities housing the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> for suppression of the sound radiation from the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> directly. The noise suppression is achieved by destructive interference between the sound fields from the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> of a dipole nature and sound radiation from the membrane via vibroacoustics coupling. A two-dimensional model with the flow effect is presented which allows {{the performance of the}} device to be explored analytically. The air flow influences the symmetrical behavior and excites the odd in vacuo mode response of the membrane due to kinematic coupling. Such an asymmetrical effect can be compromised with off-center alignment of the <b>axial</b> <b>fan.</b> Tension plays an important role to sustain the performance to revoke the deformation of the membrane during the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> operation. With the design of four appropriately tensioned membranes covered by a cylindrical cavity, the first and second blade passage frequencies of the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> can be reduced by at least 20 dB. The satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory demonstrates that its feasibility is practical. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

Airfoil has great {{influence on the}} performance of <b>axial</b> <b>fan.</b> In order to study performanceof <b>axial</b> <b>fan.</b> Four kinds of airfoilshave been applied to optimize the impeller of <b>axial</b> <b>fan.</b> The 3 D internal flowsof the axial fanunder different operating conditions were simulated based on a steady numerical method in ANSYS CFX 14. 5. The results show that the curve of total pressure of the fan with LS airfoil blades is slightly steeper, and that of the fan withCLARK-Y(C= 11. 7 %) (C is the blade thickness ratio) airfoil blades is relatively flat. The total pressure of the <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> with CLARK-Y(C= 11. 7 %) blades is highest among others. While achieving the highest efficiency in all the operating conditions except the lowest flow rate. Moreover, the blades loading of the CLARK-Y(C= 11. 7 %) airfoil blades fan isentirely more uniform than that inothers.

25|$|By {{designing}} the fan blades with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} number of blades so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of excess air through the fan, <b>axial</b> <b>fans</b> are high specific speed devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects they have to be operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of a stator to prevent the effect.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil.

This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge.

40|$|Abstract — Recently, the {{importance}} and necessity of engineering analysis has shown a steady growth. However, researchers working in small and medium enterprises know little about the usefulness of engineering analysis and suffer from lack of technical knowledge. <b>Axial</b> <b>fan</b> is air fluid machinery in various fields of industry such as automobile, electric appliance, and heavy machinery.

40|$|The role of {{internal}} and external forcing of sedimentation in turbidite systems remains a subject of debate. Here we propose new insights from the quantitative analysis of architectural parameters of the Congo <b>Axial</b> <b>Fan.</b> Fifty-two channel-levee-lobe systems, spanning the last ca. 200 ka, are visible on the seafloor, most of them having slightly elongated lobe complexes at their termination. Volumes of lobe complexes (usually 3 to 196 km 3) are highly variable in time and space. The cumulative volume of the lobe complexes represents approximately 30 % {{of the volume of}} the <b>Axial</b> <b>Fan.</b> The <b>Axial</b> <b>Fan</b> is sequentially divided into periods of increasing/decreasing channel lengths and basinward/landward migrations of avulsion points, representing successive prograding/retrograding architectural patterns called architectural cycles. These cycles are either symmetrical saw toothed and bell-shaped with progressive progradation and retrogradation phases, or asymmetrical, with long-lasting progradation phases and abrupt retrogradation phases that correspond to channel avulsions occurring high up on the fan. Our study points to the interplay between {{internal and external}} factors controlling the architecture of the Congo <b>Axial</b> <b>Fan.</b> The local topographic constraint is {{a major factor in the}} fan’s stacking pattern. However, cyclic evolution of the architecture reveals major shifts in the deposition site that are linked to very upfan avulsion events.

The fan involves a shrouding duct as flow guidance for uniform flows. Pressure difference between before and ahead of rotating blades causes the flows movements. The case where the flow resistance such as a heat exchanger is located prior to the rotors is typical in-field model for several air conditioning systems. Main interest lies on the looking for an optimal position of <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> in a circular duct. Experimental apparatus for fan performances and numerical research for detail analysis are adopted in this investigation in parallel.

Inlet flow distortions are flow non-uniformities that cause a reduction in performance and operating flow ranges of <b>axial</b> flow <b>fan.</b> CFD simulations were carried out for the following configurations: (a) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion without tip injection and (b) 90 o circumferential extent steady total pressure distortion with tip injection. The configuration with six injectors, injector velocity of 60 m/s, 0 ° pitch angle, and injector skew angle of- 15 ° (in an orientation opp. osing the direction of rotor rotation) is used for tip injection study. Total pressure values have been noted down from Ansys CFX post at the exit of the <b>axial</b> <b>fan,</b> both in distorted and uniform regions (with and without tip injection case). The simulation results are analyzed to obtain <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> performance parameters like the pressure rise coefficient, flow coefficient.
