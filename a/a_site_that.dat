5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>that</b> they are found in.|$|E
