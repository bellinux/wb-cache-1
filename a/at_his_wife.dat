25|$|The Festival of Herod II {{stands out}} among the scenic representations. The fresco shows the king on his throne, {{pointing}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Herodias, as she presents him {{with the head of}} John the Baptist on a platter. Further scenes show the Miracles of Jesus, the Resurrection, and the birth and death of the Virgin Mary. All these paintings are outstanding due to their lively expression and harmonious colouration.|$|E
25|$|In December 714, Pepin of Herstal died. Prior to his death, he had, <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Plectrude's urging, {{designated}} Theudoald, {{his grandson}} by their late son Grimoald, his heir {{in the entire}} realm. This was immediately opposed by the nobles because Theudoald was a child of only eight years of age. To prevent Charles using this unrest to his own advantage, Plectrude had him imprisoned in Cologne, the city which {{was destined to be}} her capital. This prevented an uprising on his behalf in Austrasia, but not in Neustria.|$|E
25|$|Graudyn set a {{personal}} best of 1:44.10 {{minutes at the}} Bislett Games in 1988 – this time placed him in the top ten {{in the world that}} year and he was third among Europeans, bettered only by British duo Steve Cram and Sebastian Coe. However, he failed to match this form at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, being eliminated in the quarter-final round. That proved to be the last major international event that he ran <b>at.</b> <b>His</b> <b>wife,</b> Yuliya Graudyn, would later win world and European medals for Russia.|$|E

25|$|After {{the hero}} Houyi shot down {{nine of the}} ten suns, he was {{pronounced}} king by the thankful people. However, he soon became a conceited and tyrannical ruler. In order to live long without death, he asked for the elixir from Xiwangmu. But his wife, Chang'e, stole it on the fifteenth of August {{because she did not}} want the cruel king to live long and hurt more people. She took the magic potion to prevent her husband from becoming immortal. Houyi was so angry when discovered that Chang'e took the elixir, he shot <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> as she flew toward the moon, though he missed. Chang'e fled to the moon and became the spirit of the moon. Houyi died soon because he was overcome with great anger. Thereafter, people offer a sacrifice to Chang'e on every lunar fifteenth of August to commemorate Chang'e's action.|$|E
500|$|Martin and Rustin are {{summoned to}} Vermillion Parish {{to examine the}} murder scene of a young prostitute. The woman's corpse, crowned with deer antlers and bound to a tree in a {{kneeling}} position, is surrounded by numerous twig latticeworks loosely resembling Cajun bird traps. Rustin notices several stab wounds and ligature marks scattered about on the corpse, suspecting the victim to be {{the centerpiece of a}} ritual murder—the [...] "paraphiliac love map" [...] to the perpetrator's fantasy. Martin dismisses his suspicions, and suddenly invites Rustin to dinner <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Maggie's (Michelle Monaghan) insistence, much to Rustin's dismay as it is his deceased daughter's birthday. However, he reluctantly agrees to come, but infuriates Martin when he shows up intoxicated.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the lyrics}} aimed <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Faith, Biggie {{expressed}} {{an inability to}} find merit in what Shakur had claimed. He believed that Shakur intended to attack him through Faith, [...] although he remained unsure of whether an encounter between them had occurred. Ultimately, he thought that if something had occurred {{it was none of}} his business, and that Shakur should not have publicly disclosed this information in a song. Biggie responded to this matter in a similar fashion to [...] "Hit 'Em Up", rapping in a joint release by himself and Jay-Z in the song [...] "Brooklyn's Finest", where he says [...] "If Faye have twins, she'd probably have two Pacs. Get it? Tupac's?" [...] Shortly after the release of [...] "Hit 'Em Up", Evans went on the radio and denied that she had been with Shakur.|$|E

500|$|Like {{most of the}} pair's works, Carousel {{contains}} a lengthy ballet, [...] "Billy Makes a Journey", in the second act, as Billy looks down to the Earth from [...] "Up There" [...] and observes his daughter. [...] In the original production the ballet was choreographed by de Mille. [...] It began with Billy looking down from heaven <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> in labor, with the village women gathered for a [...] "birthing". [...] The ballet involved every character in the play, some of whom spoke lines of dialogue, and contained a number of subplots. [...] The focus was on Louise, played by Bambi Linn, who at first almost soars in her dance, expressing the innocence of childhood. [...] She is teased and mocked by her schoolmates, and Louise becomes attracted to the rough carnival people, who symbolize Billy's world. [...] A youth from the carnival attempts to seduce Louise, as she discovers her own sexuality, but he decides she is more girl than woman, and he leaves her. [...] After Julie comforts her, Louise goes to a children's party, where she is shunned. [...] The carnival people reappear and form a ring around the children's party, with Louise lost between the two groups. [...] At the end, the performers form a huge carousel with their bodies.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was equally}} unorthodox and inventive as a batsman, if rather less skilled. [...] He wrote a lively {{account of his}} cricketing days and was, characteristically, a talented conjurer and magician.

2500|$|In July 2007, armed FBI agents {{raided the}} homes of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe, {{the same people who}} had filed the {{complaint}} with the DoD Inspector General in 2002. Binney claims they pointed guns <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and himself. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union. None of these people were charged with any crimes. In November 2007, there was a raid on Drake's residence. His computers, documents, and books were confiscated. He was never charged with giving any sensitive information to anyone; the charge actually brought against him is for 'retaining' information (...) [...] The FBI tried to get Roark to testify against Drake; she refused. Reporter Gorman was not contacted by the FBI.|$|E

2500|$|Typically Pearce {{read the}} news to Melburnians with his catchphrase sign-off, [...] "God bless you, and you", the second [...] "you" [...] being {{directed}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Betty. He is best regarded for his coverage of the Moon landing in July 1969. In 1978 Pearce retired and was replaced as GTV Channel 9 newsreader by Brian Naylor. In 1993 he was still working for GTV Channel 9 as a news adviser and head of correspondence, although his official title was Director of Community Affairs. Melissa Agnew describes Pearce in her 2008 book, Here Is the (Australian) News, {{as one of the}} [...] "commanding voices ... who, with his golden voice of authority delivered the news on Channel 9". Both Peter Mitchell (Seven News Melbourne) and Peter Hitchener (Nine News Melbourne) acknowledge Pearce as [...] "one of their biggest influences. They both worked under him at Channel 9".|$|E
