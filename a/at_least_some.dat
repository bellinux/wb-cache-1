5|$|A Darwinopterus {{specimen}} showcases that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> pterosaurs {{had a pair}} {{of functional}} ovaries, as opposed to the single functional ovivary in birds, dismissing the reduction of functional ovaries as a requirement for powered flight.|$|E
5|$|Although ceratopsians are {{generally}} considered herbivorous, a few paleontologists, such as Darren Naish and Mark Witton, have speculated online that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> ceratopsians {{may have been}} opportunistically omnivorous.|$|E

5|$|Reaction {{from within}} the Wikipedia {{community}} to the Essjay/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp, voluminous, and mixed. While most editors denounced <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.|$|E

5|$|A new extant genus {{discovered}} in 2014, Dendrogramma, {{which appears to}} be a basal metazoan but of unknown taxonomic placement, has been noted to have similarities with the Ediacaran fauna. It has since been found to be a siphonophore, possibly even sections of a more complex species, though this in turn has raised suspicions for a similar status for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> ediacaran organisms.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of {{the poems}} {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, {{there is a large}} enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for scholars to discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of engo (related words) and kakekotoba (pivot words).|$|E
5|$|Complete skeletons {{have been}} {{described}} only for the most advanced abelisaurids (such as Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus), {{making it difficult to}} establish defining features of the skeleton for the family as a whole. However, most are known from <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> skull bones, so known shared features come mainly from the skull.|$|E

5|$|Dopamine-derived melanin {{probably}} {{appears in}} <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> other biological systems as well. Some of the dopamine in plants {{is likely to}} be used as a precursor for dopamine-melanin. The complex patterns that appear on butterfly wings, as well as black-and-white stripes on the bodies of insect larvae, are also thought to be caused by spatially structured accumulations of dopamine-melanin.|$|E
5|$|Ice rafted debris distribution: Sediment {{transported by}} ice {{does not extend}} as far East during H3/6. Hence some {{researchers}} have been moved to suggest a European origin for <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of this change, {{particularly}} over Europe, is due to decreases in airborne pollution. Most governments of developed nations have taken steps to reduce aerosols released into the atmosphere, which helps reduce global dimming.|$|E

5|$|It is {{now known}} that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some,</b> and {{probably}} all, dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers, including large, vaned, wing and tail feathers. This development, first hypothesized in the mid-late 1980s and confirmed by fossil discoveries in 1999, represents {{a significant change in}} the way dromaeosaurids have historically been depicted in art and film.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waitt’s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events.

5|$|Since <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey {{could move}} quickly, {{evidence that it}} walked instead of ran could indicate {{that it was a}} scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been fast enough to prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{legend of}} the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, {{may be related to}} similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>some</b> of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the Shope papilloma virus. It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.|$|E
