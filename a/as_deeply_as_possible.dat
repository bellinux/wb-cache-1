For {{knowledge}} representation based on ontology and its use, {{it is desirable}} to understand phenomena in the target world <b>as</b> precisely and <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> The ontology should reflect the understanding of them and provide a fundamental framework to manage the behavior of instances adequately.

This paper discusses how many kinds of identity exist and what kind of identity suits to what purpose.

In order to optimize observing in the time available, a field in the northern continuous viewing zone was selected and images were taken for ten consecutive days, or approximately 150 orbits. Shorter 1 - 2 orbit images were obtained of the fields immediately adjacent to the primary HDF in order to facilitate spectroscopic follow-up by ground-based telescopes. The observations were made from 18 to 30 December 1995, and both raw and reduced data have been put in the public domain as a community service. We present a summary of the criteria for selecting the field, the rationale behind the filter selection and observing times in each band, and the strategies for planning the observations to maximize the exposure time while avoiding earth-scattered light. Data reduction procedures are outlined, and images of the combined frames in each band are presented. Objects detected in these images are listed in a catalog with their basic photometric parameters...|$|R

The Program Committee for the Third Symposium responded by creating an event designed to “foster(s) dialogues among and across constituencies to promote engagement in coaching re s e a rch and cross fertilization among: training/education providers, practitioners, researchers, field-builders, and those who work with multiple capacities” (Program Committee Notes, 2005, p. 4).

50|$|Armor-piercing {{rifle and}} pistol {{cartridges}} are usually {{built around a}} penetrator of hardened steel, tungsten, or tungsten carbide, and such cartridges are often called 'hard-core bullets'.

50|$|Geophysical {{methods used}} in {{archaeology}} are largely adapted from {{those used in}} mineral exploration, engineering, and geology. Archaeological mapping presents unique challenges, however, which have spurred a separate development of methods and equipment. In general, geological applications are concerned with detecting relatively large structures, often <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> In contrast, most archaeological sites are relatively near the surface, often within the top meter of earth. Instruments are often configured to limit the depth of response to better resolve the near-surface phenomena {{that are likely to}} be of interest. Another challenge is to detect subtle and often very small features - which may be as ephemeral as organic staining from decayed wooden posts - and distinguish them from rocks, roots, and other natural “clutter.” To accomplish this requires not only sensitivity, but also high density of data points, usually at least one and sometimes dozens of readings per square meter.|$|E
50|$|The Canada lynx has 28 teeth, same as {{in other}} lynxes but unlike other felids, with four long canines for {{puncturing}} and gripping. The lynx can feel where it is biting the prey with its canines because they are heavily laced with nerves. The lynx also has four carnassial teeth that cut the meat into small pieces. In order for the lynx to use its carnassials, it must chew the meat with its head to its side. There are large spaces between the four canines {{and the rest of}} the teeth, and the second upper premolars are absent, to ensure that the bite goes <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> into the prey. The claws are sharp and completely retractable (capable of being drawn within). The paws, broadened by the wide-spaced metatarsals, can spread as wide as 10 cm and allow the lynx to move fast and with ease on the snow. The spoor is more distinct in hard snow than in mud, though the toes are not clearly visible in deep snow.|$|E
50|$|The {{album and}} {{included}} booklet {{tell the story}} of a woman named Nervosa who begins her story by taking a job at The 120 Days Of Sodom (named from the controversial novel of the same name by Marquis de Sade) which is a combination strip club and slaughterhouse. The 120 Days Of Sodom has two floors, a killing floor and a dance floor above it. The dance floor features a transparent bottom so that visitors to the strip club can see through to the killing floor where animals are being slaughtered. Like her sister Anorexia, Nervosa's story takes place within two texts. The first section of each chapter tells Nervosa's story in a more stylized, fairy tale-esque and metaphorical manner. Within this text, Nervosa spends the story laboring to dig a hole <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> which parallels her quest to reach the depths of human depravity. The subsequent text in each chapter is narrated by Nervosa herself, and takes place in real time in the actual world. One evening while giving a private dance, Nervosa is assaulted, beaten and raped. She later learns she has become pregnant {{as a result of the}} rape and seeks an unsafe abortion. At this point in the story, the real time narrative ceases and the remaining chapters are carried exclusively through metaphorical means. Nervosa, broken and dying within her deep hole she has dug, wakes in a sunlit field and finds that she has been carried to safety by a small lamb who died in the process of rescuing her. The lamb however, resurrects and explains that he had given his life to save Nervosa simply to fulfill his lifelong desire to be with her.|$|E

[...] The main offensive was to begin [...] "as soon as possible and no later than 23 June" [...] (al più presto possibile ... non oltre il 23 corrente). On the morning of 20 June, Mussolini told Badoglio to start the offensive immediately by the next morning, stating [...] "I do not want to suffer the shame of the Germans occupying Nice and remitting it to us." [...] Badoglio ordered Graziani: [...] "Tomorrow, the 21st, at the commencement of action at 0300 hours, the First and Fourth Armies will whole-heartedly attack along the entire front. Goal: penetrate <b>as</b> <b>deeply</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> into French territory." [...] At 1745 hours that day, Graziani ordered Army Group West:The Germans have occupied Lyon, it must be categorically avoided that they arrive first at the sea. By three-o'-clock tonight 3:00 a.m., you must attack along the whole front from the Little Saint Bernard to the sea (per questa notte alle 3 dovete attaccare su tutta la fronte dal San Bernardo al mare). The air force will contribute by mass bombardment of the fortifications and cities. The Germans, during the day tomorrow and the day after, will send armoured columns originating from Lyon in the direction of Chambéry, Saint-Pierre de Chartreuse and Grenoble.Graziani then modified his directive of 16 June: now, the main goal of the offensive was Marseille. This final edition of the offensive plan had only two main actions, Operation M through the Little Saint Bernard and Operation R along the Riviera, the action in the Maddalena Pass being reduced to a diversionary advance. The immediate objective of Operation M was Albertville, while that of R was the town of Menton. At 2000 hours on 20 June, Mussolini countermanded the attack order, but before it could go out to the troops, he received confirmation that Germany was continuing its push down the Rhône valley despite the impending armistice. He then revoked his countermand, only shifting the emphasis to the northern sector of the front, as his generals had urged all along.On 20 June, the guns of Fort Chaberton—nicknamed a [...] "battleship in the clouds" [...] (cuirassé des nuages) by the French—switched targets to Ouvrage Janus. This French position was unable to train its battery of six guns on the Italian position and return fire. Due to the supporting fire of the fort, the Italian troops were able to advance and capture the village of Montgenèvre. However, no further gains were made in the Briançon sector as the French were able to hold the line. On 21 June, the French had been able to maneuver a battery of 280-mm mortars of the 154th Artillery Regiment into a position {{at the foot of the}} Fort de l'Infernet to fire on Fort Chaberton. Over a three-day period, with firing delayed and interrupted by adverse weather, the French were able to silence six of the eight armoured turrets of the Italian fort in only 57 shots. Obscured by fog, the remaining two turrets continued to fire until the armistice.|$|E
