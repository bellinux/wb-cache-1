Compared with earlier periods, the ten years from 1998 to 2008 were relatively successful for Andover, seeing them win a number of league and cup honours as well as registering their biggest ever win.|$|E

500|$|The {{time-space diagram}} of Rule 90 is a plot {{in which the}} th row records the {{configuration}} of the automaton <b>at</b> <b>step</b> [...] When the initial state has a single nonzero cell, this diagram has the appearance of the Sierpiński triangle, a fractal formed by combining triangles into larger triangles. Rules 18, 22, 26, 82, 146, 154, 210 and 218 also generate the same diagram. One way to explain this structure uses the fact that, in Rule 90, each cell is the exclusive or of its two neighbors. Because this is equivalent to modulo-2 addition, this generates the modulo-2 version of Pascal's triangle. The diagram has a 1 wherever Pascal's triangle has an odd number, and a 0 wherever Pascal's triangle has an even number. This is a discrete version of the Sierpiński triangle.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic stated that the song and [...] "A Little Bit", the second single released from the parent album, were a [...] "double-punch" [...] and picked the former song as a standout from the album. Cashbox Canada, ranking the song at number ten on [...] "Top 10 Love Songs: The Crush", praised it as [...] "an ode to love <b>at</b> <b>step</b> one". Similarly, Chuck Taylor of Billboard reviewed [...] "Irresistible" [...] favorably, calling it [...] "a sexy, uptempo romp about new found love that proves Simpson's pop intuition." [...] In another review, Taylor complimented the contemporary appeal of the track and felt {{that it would be a}} staple at radios. He also noticed that the breakdown and spoken passages of the song gave it a [...] "street edge", something not previously heard from Simpson. Teresa Gubbins of The Dallas Morning News had mixed feelings towards the song in her review, writing that its sound might help Simpson get attention on urban radios, but did nothing to demonstrate her voice. Larry Printz of The Morning Call also expressed a similar view of the song, stating that the song [...] "is loaded with platitudes, but [...] easy on the ears." ...|$|E

[...] Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded <b>at</b> <b>step</b> n, it must have a ternary representation whose nth digit is not 1. [...] For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s. [...] It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, 1/3 = 0.13 and 7/9 = 0.213 are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.2222...3, 1/3 = 0.022222...3 and 7/9 = 0.2022222...3.
