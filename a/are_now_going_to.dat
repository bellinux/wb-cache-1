2500|$|International {{changes have}} {{affected}} shipping through the Seaway. Europe {{is no longer}} a major grain importer; big US export shipments <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> South America, Asia and Africa. These destinations make Gulf and West Coast ports more critical to 21st-century grain exports. Referring to the Seaway project, a retired Iowa State University economics professor who specialized in transportation issues said, [...] "It probably did make sense, at about the time it (the Seaway) was constructed and conceived, but since then everything has changed." ...|$|E

The rooms, and the courts, and the towers, and battlements are all arranged {{as they used to be}} in former ages; and the furniture contained within is of the ancient fashion.

The Lord has led me into these distant and savage regions, to carry his word, and to proclaim his name; and a most unworthy and unprofitable servant should I prove, were I to hesitate about approaching them I am appointed to teach. No, no; fear nothing.
