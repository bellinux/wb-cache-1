25|$|Though Koop {{was opposed}} to {{abortion}} on personal and religious grounds, he declined to state that <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> performed by qualified medical professionals posed a substantial health risk to the women whose pregnancies were being terminated, despite political pressure to endorse such a position.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Price co-sponsored the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, {{which would}} have amended the ACA to allow all {{employers}} opposed to abortion and contraception to offer health insurance plans that do not cover these services. The bill also would have amended the Public Health Service Act to strengthen protections of health care workers who refuse to participate in <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E

25|$|Thirteen {{states have}} laws {{that require a}} second {{physician}} to be present during late-term <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> in order to treat a fetus if born alive. The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order {{to assist in the}} case of a living fetus.|$|E
500|$|Term limits {{would have}} {{prevented}} Solis from seeking reelection to the State Senate. After months of deliberation, she {{decided to run for}} the U.S. House of Representatives in 2000 against 18-year incumbent Matthew G. Martínez in the 31st congressional district, which consisted largely of working class Hispanics and Asians. This action was criticized by Hispanics and others, and only two members of Congress, Barbara Boxer and Loretta Sanchez, supported her. Martínez was more conservative than many of his constituents, as he had supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), opposed gun control, and supported bans on specific <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures.</b> [...] He was also criticized for lacking effort and neglecting his district. Solis was able to obtain the support of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor (which called her a [...] "warrior for working families"), Emily's List, Handgun Control Incorporation, the Sierra Club and the California League of Conservation Voters. [...] With their help, Solis outspent Martínez by a 4-to-1 margin and had hundreds of volunteers working for her.|$|E
500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth are we so far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Mecklenberg testified as {{an expert}} witness in a {{manslaughter}} prosecution against a Boston obstetrician, and criticized the <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> used by the defendant.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum or suction {{aspiration}} uses aspiration {{to remove}} uterine contents through the cervix. It {{may be used}} as a method of induced <b>abortion,</b> a therapeutic <b>procedure</b> used after miscarriage, or a procedure to obtain a sample for endometrial biopsy. The rate of infection is lower than any other surgical <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> at 0.5%.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1990s, {{the state}} of Nebraska {{attempted}} to ban a certain second-trimester abortion procedure known as intact dilation and extraction (sometimes called partial birth abortion). The Nebraska ban allowed other second-trimester <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> called dilation and evacuation abortions. Ginsburg (who replaced White) stated, [...] "this law does not save any fetus from destruction, for it targets only 'a method of performing abortion'." [...] The Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska ban by a 5–4 vote in Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), citing a right to use the safest method of second trimester abortion.|$|E
2500|$|Joined by justices David Souter, John Paul Stevens, and Stephen Breyer, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented, [...] {{contending that}} the ruling was an [...] "alarming" [...] one that ignored Supreme Court {{abortion}} precedent and [...] "refuse to take Casey and Stenberg seriously." [...] Referring {{in particular to}} Planned Parenthood v. Casey, Ginsburg sought to ground the Court's abortion jurisprudence based on concepts of personal autonomy and equal citizenship rather than the Court's previous privacy approach: [...] "Thus, legal challenges to undue restrictions on <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a woman's autonomy to determine her life's course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blackmun further {{described}} how the court’s past precedent had whittled down the “commercial speech” exemption through past precedent; for example, Bigelow v. Virginia, , {{in which the}} Court struck down a Virginia statute prohibiting the advertisement of out-of-state <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures.</b> [...] He also distinguished commercial speech from such “unprotected” categories of speech such as “fighting words” and obscenity. [...] Nor does having a purely economic interest {{in the content of}} speech deprive the speaker or listener of the protection of the First Amendment. [...] This is especially true for the consumers in this case, as the poor, elderly, and infirm needed access to such information to make informed decisions about how to get their prescriptions filled inexpensively. [...] For such people in need, Blackmun reasoned, such information was more than simply a convenience. [...] Furthermore, he stressed the importance of price advertising in a free market economy, because they serve to provide the underlying information for citizens to make private economic decisions.|$|E
5000|$|William Mudd Martin Haskell (born 1946) is an American {{physician}} who, in 1992, {{described an}} <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> known clinically as intact dilation and extraction (D&X), and popularly by the controversial, non-medical, non-technical term [...] "partial-birth abortion".|$|R
25|$|Candidates {{competing}} for the Democratic nomination for the 2008 Presidential election cited Gonzales v. Carhart as judicial activism. In upholding the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, Carhart is the first judicial opinion upholding a legal barrier to a specific <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The wire {{coat hanger}} method was a popularly known illegal <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{although}} {{they were not the}} norm. In fact, Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned Parenthood, said, in a 1960 printing of the American Journal of Public Health: ...|$|R

50|$|Meadows is {{a pro-life}} {{supporter}} and has called abortion a 'tragedy'. He opposes any {{federal funding for}} abortion and believes parents should be notified of underage <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures.</b> He also opposes churches and other religious sites providing birth control options.|$|E
5000|$|Vacuum {{aspiration}} {{may be used}} {{earlier in}} pregnancy than dilation and curettage (D&C). Manual vacuum aspiration is the only surgical <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> available earlier than the 6th week of pregnancy. [...] Vacuum aspiration has lower rates of complications when compared to D&C.|$|R
25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote for}} the Court that the {{respondents}} had failed to prove that Congress lacked authority to ban this <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b> Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Clarence Thomas, and Justice Antonin Scalia agreed with the Court's judgment, joining Kennedy's opinion.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Walorski {{rejected}} the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a bill banning Late termination of pregnancy or late-term <b>abortions,</b> an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> given beyond 20 weeks into a pregnancy. In 2013, Walorski {{had said she}} would support a ban on late-term abortions.|$|R
50|$|Delaying an {{abortion}} {{may increase the}} likelihood of complications arising from <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures.</b> The risk of death to the mother as well, or major complications significantly increases for each week into pregnancy, particularly if the abortion is delayed until the third trimester.|$|E
50|$|A doctor's {{referral}} is not necessary, {{although an}} independent ultrasound usually {{needs to be}} done. The number of Canadian medical schools that give instruction in <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> is decreasing, which could potentially create a shortfall in medical personnel skilled in this area.|$|E

50|$|Pregnant {{women who}} want abortions, {{generally}} have to seek them clandestinely. Some women have even deliberately conducted themselves {{in such a way}} as to bring about miscarriage. Those women who have received proper treatment for their health complications due to <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> have often felt stigmatized by those treating them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to Planned Parenthood, CMP stated that [...] "we {{look forward to}} showing the public more clear evidence that Planned Parenthood routinely profits {{from the sale of}} baby parts and changes the <b>abortion</b> <b>procedures</b> it uses on pregnant women in order to do so".|$|E
50|$|In January 2011, Williams' office brought {{multiple}} charges {{through a}} grand jury against Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell primarily for killing infants after birth.

50|$|In 2006 {{the channel}} was reprimanded by the Norwegian Media Authority after a rerun {{of an evening}} show was aired in an early morning {{timeslot}} on NRK2 (which formerly had slots for independent programming), showing an explicit video of an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b> Jan Hanvold apologized and described the incident as a technical mistake.|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries like Cameroon, unsafe abortion is a major public health problem. It can be responsible for severe complications including damage to the digestive and/or urinary tract, sepsis, and uterine perforation. Uterine perforation could be caused {{by most of the}} instruments that are used to evacuate the uterus. We report a case of apparent uterine perforation and subsequent migration of the plastic or rubber catheter into the peritoneal cavity during an <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure</b> performed in a setting that may have been unsafe. The discovery was made during a diagnostic laparoscopy indicated for secondary infertility of tubal origin 16 years after the <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b> This is a rare clinical finding which is of therapeutic and diagnostic importance. To the best of our knowledge, a single similar case has been reported so far in the literature...|$|R
50|$|In 1842, the Shogunate in Japan banned induced {{abortion}} in Edo, {{but the law}} {{did not affect the}} rest of the country until 1869, when abortion was banned nationwide. However, the crime was rarely punished unless the conception was a result of adultery or the woman died as a result of the <b>abortion</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R
