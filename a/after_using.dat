At first he made slow progress; The Philanderer, written in 1893 but not published until 1898, had to wait until 1905 for a stage production. Similarly, Mrs Warren's Profession (1893) was written five years before publication and nine years before reaching the stage.|$|E

40|$|Conference ProceedingsRapid {{urbanization}} in Hong Kong and Southern China within highly constrained territories {{has resulted}} in a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} people living close to urban landfills and a sharp rise in concern over the nuisance and potential impact on health of their operation. Public acceptance of landfills has been shown to be linked both to the efficacy of controls on filling operations and the quality and relevance of the long-term site <b>after</b> <b>use.</b> To date, the lengthy construction and operation period of landfills has encouraged the planning and design of the <b>after</b> <b>use</b> to the end of the development process. Once filling and final capping are complete, however, options for <b>after</b> <b>use</b> are severely limited. This research study found that a large number of potential landfill <b>after</b> <b>uses</b> exist, and that these could be categorized as: ball sports, other sports, passive recreation, and facilities & other uses. Analysis of the <b>after</b> <b>uses</b> with respect to the minimum area required for each, the maximum slope gradient and tolerance to landfill settlement revealed distinct relationships between these parameters. This understanding can assist in the selection and design of appropriate <b>after</b> <b>uses,</b> and facilitate acceptance by local residents of the presence of the landfill...|$|R

5|$|After {{escaping}} the research station, Joanna agrees {{to work with}} the Carrington Institute to stop dataDyne. Daniel Carrington contacts her and explains that Zeigler had been working on an algorithm capable of decoding extraterrestrial glyphs at a dig site in South America. Traveling to Peru, Joanna learns that the glyphs are leading dataDyne to search for an ancient artefact which acts as a power-source for the Graal, a device which endows individuals with superhuman powers. Joanna plants a tracking device onto the artefact before sneaking aboard a dataDyne dropship. The dropship takes her to Africa, where Zhang Li has located the Graal buried under the African sands. The Carrington Institute plans an offensive on dataDyne forces with the battle taking place on a large bridge. Joanna rescues several Carrington Institute agents before avenging her father's death by killing Mei Hem. Joanna infiltrates an arena and faces off against Zhang Li, who dispatches Sekhar <b>after</b> <b>using</b> the Graal. Despite the advantage, Joanna defeats Zhang Li in a final battle. Daniel Carrington commends her efforts, informing her that she did “Perfect”.|$|E

5|$|Dell Williams, {{founder of}} the first feminist sex toy {{business}} in the United States, Eve's Garden, was inspired to launch her store <b>after</b> <b>using</b> a Magic Wand as a student in Dodson's course in the early 1970s. Williams said the Magic Wand was her favorite sex toy because of its dependability and its power at delivering pleasure to the clitoris. In 1974, Dodson recommended the device in her book Liberating Masturbation. In 1975 in her demonstrations, she replaced the Panasonic Panabrator with the Magic Wand. In 1977, Dodson recommended the device to Dian Hanson, former editor of men's magazines Leg Show and Juggs. Hanson recalled her initial experience after receiving the recommendation from Dodson. Hanson said she was instructed to purchase the Magic Wand but was advised to be cautious regarding its emotional and physical influence because it could have properties which could cause habit-forming dependency. She observed that in comparison to her prior vibrator operated by two D batteries, the Magic Wand was significantly more effective.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, <b>after</b> <b>using</b> company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Parkinson {{was made}} {{commander}} of the Royal New Zealand Artillery, having been made a temporary lieutenant colonel.

Indeed, product judgement is likely to evolve over time and influence the intention to continue using. At yet, little research is avalaible on the evolution of product jugdgement with use. In this paper, we examined the evolution of User eXperience (UX) and affective-motivational factors between evaluation before and <b>after</b> <b>use.</b> Results showed that interaction with the product significantly influences initial representations with, in our study, more negative judgments <b>after</b> <b>use.</b> Moreover, using Expectation-Disconfirmation Theory, significant influences of initial evaluations (i. e. judgement before use) and disconfirmation (i. e. difference between judgement <b>after</b> and before <b>use)</b> were found on behavioral intention <b>after</b> <b>use...</b>|$|R
