50|$|Nico{{morphine}} (Vilan, Subellan, Gevilan, MorZet) is the 3,6-dinicotinate ester of morphine. It is {{a strong}} opioid <b>agonist</b> <b>analgesic</b> {{two to three times}} as potent as morphine with a side effect profile similar to that of dihydromorphine, morphine, and diamorphine. Nicomorphine was patented as Vilan by Lannacher Heilmittel G.m.b.H. of Austria in 1957. and was first synthesized in 1904 either there or at another firm in what was then Austria-Hungary. The hydrochloride salt is available as ampoules of 10 mg/ml solution for injection, 5 mg tablets, and 10 mg suppositories. It is possible that other manufacturers distribute 10 mg tablets and other concentrations of injectable nicomorphine in ampoules and multidose vials. It is used, particularly in the German-speaking countries and elsewhere in Central Europe and some other countries in Europe and the former USSR in particular, for post-operative, cancer, chronic non-malignant and other neuropathic pain. It is commonly used in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) units. The usual starting dose is 5-10 mg given every 3-5 hours.|$|E
40|$|Spiradoline (a {{congener}} of the kappa opioid agonist, U- 50488 H) {{was evaluated}} for analgesic and related activities in rodents. In nine antinociceptive assays utilizing various thermal, pressure and chemical and physical irritants, {{the potency of}} spiradoline ranges from 4. 7 to 23 (mean = 1 3) times that of U- 50488 H. Naloxone blocks the analgesic effect of spiradoline. The in vivo naloxone pA 2 for this antagonism is much lower than that for the antagonism of morphine and approximates that of U- 50488 H. The analgesic potency of spiradoline is greatly reduced in mice made tolerant to U- 50488 H but not in those made tolerant to morphine. Repeated treatment with spiradoline does not induce physical dependence as evidenced {{by a lack of}} naloxone-precip-itated jumping and withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia. In sum, these observations suggest that spiradoline is a potent kappa <b>agonist</b> <b>analgesic.</b> However, further evaluation of spiradolin...|$|E

Tramadol ((+) -trans- 2 -(dimethylaminomethyl) - 1 -(m-methoxyphenyl) -cyclohexanol) is an orally active synthetic opioid <b>agonist</b> <b>analgesic.</b> Its mechanism of action derives from its attachment to the µ- receptor and blockage of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. It’s reported adverse effects include nausea, dizziness, and sleepiness, dry mouth, sweating and lowering of seizure threshold. Tramadol hydrochloride shows a good efficacy and safety profile and controls the pain symptoms. The drug and excipients were examined for the pre-compression parameters. The prepared formulations were evaluated for hardness, weight variation, friability, dispersion time, water absorption ratio, disintegration, dissolution and stability studies. The values of pre-compression parameters were within prescribed I. P. limits and indicate good free flowing properties. In all the formulations friability was less than 1 % indicates tablets had a good mechanical resistance. Hardness of the tablets was found to be in the range of 40. 6 to 47. 5 N.

40|$|Rigors (chills or shivering) can occurafter {{patients}} receive general anes-thesia, amphotericin B, interleukin- 2 (aldesleukin), monoclonal antibodies, {{and blood}} products. 1 They {{are believed to}} occur from the thermoregulatory re-sponse to hypothermia or muscle hyper-activity with clonic or tonic patterns. 2 Rigors can lead to increased oxygen con-sumption, vasoconstriction, and in-creased vascular resistance, which can further compromise recovery. Several antineoplastic drugs can induce rigors. Failure to control this adverse effect may cause patients to abandon potentially life-extending or life-saving therapies. Several agents have been tried to prevent and treat this adverse event; however, meperidine remains {{the gold standard for}} many institutions, even though, to our knowledge, there have been no random-ized controlled trials reported that vali-date its use. Meperidine is a phenylpiperidine opi-oid <b>agonist</b> <b>analgesic</b> with anticholiner-gic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic ef-fects and is considered to be the most ef-fective agent available for the treatment and prevention of postanesthetic and am-photericin B–induced rigors. 3, 4 A study that investigated the thermoregulatory response to meperidine showed that it has a greater propensity for reducing the shivering threshold over the vasoconstriction threshold than do anes-thetics. 5 The more common adverse effects associated with meperidine therapy are nausea and vomiting; however, a more serious adverse effect can occur in patients with poor renal function. 6 Meperidine is metabolized into active and inactive metabolites in the liver and these metabolites are subject to renal elimination.

40|$|U 50488 H is a benzeneacetamide kappa-opioid {{receptor}} (kappa-OR) <b>agonist</b> <b>analgesic,</b> {{widely used}} for investigating the pharmacology of G protein-coupled kappa-ORs. However, U 50488 H {{is also known}} to directly block various voltage-gated ion channels in a G protein-independent manner. We investigated the direct actions of U 50488 H on various high voltage-activated (HVA) and low voltage-activated (LVA) neuronal Ca 2 + channels heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. U 50488 H inhibited HVA rat Cav 1. 3 (rCav 1. 3), human Cav 2. 1 (hCav 2. 1), hCav 2. 2, hCav 2. 3, and LVA hCav 3. 1 and hCav 3. 2 channels in a concentration-dependent manner, with similar potencies characterised with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of ~ 30 mu-M. U 50488 H concentrations causing direct Cav inhibition are typically > 100 times higher than those producing kappa-OR activation. Investigation of the mechanism of U 50488 H block of the Cav 2. 2 channel revealed that U 50488 H interacted with all major kinetic states of the channel - resting, open, and inactivated. U 50488 H {{did not affect the}} voltage dependence of activation but shifted the steady-state inactivation curve by ~ 11 mV to more hyperpolarized potentials. U 50488 H also increased the rate of Ba 2 + current inactivation during a step depolarization and significantly delayed recovery from slow inactivation, compared with control. Cav 2. 2 current inhibition was frequency dependent during repetitive step depolarization at 1 Hz and 3 Hz, consistent with use-dependent block. In summary, our results suggest that preferential interaction of U 50488 H with inactivated Cav 2. 2 channels significantly contributes to reduced Cav 2. 2 channel availability and slow recovery form inactivation. We conclude that U 50488 H non-selectively blocks heterologously expressed neuronal HVA and LVA Cav channels in the absence of kappa-ORs. This cross-reactivity also suggests potentially common U 50488 H binding motifs across Cav channel targets...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that functionally selective G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists may have enhanced therapeutic benefits has revitalized interest for many GPCR targets. In particular, although k-opioid receptor (KOR) <b>agonists</b> are <b>analgesic</b> {{with a low}} risk of dependence and abuse, their use is limited by a propensity to induce sedation, motor incoordi-nation, hallucinations, and dysphoria-like states. Several labo-ratories have produced {{a body of work}} suggesting that G protein–biased KOR <b>agonists</b> might be <b>analgesic</b> with fewer side effects. Although that has been an intriguing hypothesis, suitable KOR-selective and G protein–biased agonists have not been available to test this idea. Here we provide data using a G protein–biased agonist, RB- 64 (22 -thiocyanatosalvinorin A), which suggests that KOR-mediated G protein signaling induces analgesia and aversion, whereas b-arrestin- 2 signaling may be associated with motor incoordination. Additionally, unlike un-biased KOR agonists, the G protein–biased ligand RB- 64 does not induce sedation and does not have anhedonia-like actions, suggesting that a mechanism other than G protein signaling mediates these effects. Our findings provide the first evidence for a highly selective and G protein–biased tool compound for which many, but not all, of the negative side effects of KOR agonists can be minimized by creating G protein–biased KOR agonists...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Morphine {{injected}} locally to the paw of {{an adult}} or an infant rat is analgesic. Opiates specific to m and k opioid receptors, and less consistently to d opioid receptors, given locally {{to the site of}} injury in adult animals are also analgesic in a variety of models of inflammatory pain. To determine which opioid receptor(s) are involved in local analgesia in the immature animal, agonists specific for m, k, and d opioid receptors were injected into the intraplantar pad in infant rats and the resultant nociceptive behavior and Fos expression assayed in the formalin test. The k opioid receptor agonist U 50, 488 reduced nociceptive behavior in both phases of the formalin test and reduced Fos expression in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord, at 3 and 21 days of age. Morphiceptin (m opioid <b>agonist)</b> was <b>analgesic</b> in the 21 -day-old pups, but not the 3 -day-old pups, measured behaviorally or by Fos expression. DPDPE (d opioid <b>agonist)</b> was not <b>analgesic</b> at either age. We also tested the effects of opioid receptor antagonists on morphine’s local analgesic action. Naltrexone, {{and to a lesser extent}} the m opioid antagonist CTOP, antagonized morphine’s analgesic effect. Kappa and d opioid receptor blockers were inactive.

40|$|Abstract Background While {{cannabinoid}} receptor <b>agonists</b> have <b>analgesic</b> activity in inflammatory pain states they produce {{a range of}} side effects. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the arachidonic acid-amino acid conjugate, N-arachidonyl-glycine (NA-glycine) is effective in acute pain models. Results In the present study we examined the effect of NA-glycine in a rat model of inflammatory pain. Intrathecal administration of NA-glycine (70 – 700 nmol) and the pan-{{cannabinoid receptor}} agonist HU- 210 (10 nmol) reduced the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraplantar injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). The actions of HU- 210, but not NA-glycine were reduced by the cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist AM 251. The cannabinoid CB 2 receptor antagonist SR 144528 also {{had no effect on}} the actions of NA-glycine. In contrast, N-arachidonyl-GABA (NA-GABA, 700 nmol) and N-arachidonyl-alanine (NA-alanine, 700 nmol) had no effect on allodynia and hyperalgesia. HU- 210, but not NA-glycine produced a reduction in rotarod latency. Conclusion These findings suggest that NA-glycine may provide a novel non-cannabinoid receptor mediated approach to alleviate inflammatory pain. </p...|$|R

40|$|Chronic pain {{represents}} a research field on great clinical relevance and social impactful. It is associated {{to a variety}} of pathological events causing un altered excitability of peripheral nerves derived by tissue damage depending on physical, biological and chemical injury. In the last years much attention has been paid in the identification of novel molecules involved in mediating pain sensation useful as therapeutic tools for the development of new analgesic drugs.

40|$|Nicotinic {{agonists}} {{display a}} wide-range profile of antinocicep-tive activity in acute, tonic, and chronic pain models. However, their effectiveness {{is limited by}} their unacceptable side effects. We investigated the antinociceptive effects of two new 42 * nicotinic partial agonists, varenicline and sazetidine-A, in acute thermal and tonic pain mouse models. Both drugs failed to induce significant effects in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests after subcutaneous administration. However, they blocked nic-otine’s effects in these tests at very low doses. In contrast to acute pain tests, varenicline and sazetidine-A dose-depend-ently induced an analgesic effect in the mouse formalin test after systemic administration. Their antinociceptive effects were mediated, however, by different nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Sazetidine-A effects were medi-ated by 2 * nAChR subtypes, whereas varenicline actions were attributed to 34 nAChRs. Moreover, low inactive doses of varenicline blocked nicotine’s actions in phase II of the formalin test. Overall, our {{results suggest that the}} antagonistic actions of varenicline at low doses are mediated by 2 *-nAChRs and at higher doses as an agonist by 34 *-nAChRs.

All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists.

40|$|Cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptors {{are located}} at key sites {{involved}} in the relaying and processing of noxious inputs. Both CB 1 and CB 2 receptor <b>agonists</b> have <b>analgesic</b> effects {{in a range of}} models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Importantly, clinical trials of cannabis-based medicines indicate that the pre-clinical effects of cannabinoid agonists may translate into therapeutic potential in humans. One of the areas of concern with this pharmacological approach is that CB 1 receptors have a widespread distribution in the brain and that global activation of CB 1 receptors is associated with adverse side effects. Studies of the endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) have demonstrated that they are present in most tissues and that in some pain states, such as neuropathic pain, levels of endocannabinoids are elevated at key sites involved in pain processing. An alternative approach {{that can be used to}} harness the potential therapeutic effects of cannabinoids is to maximise the effects of the endocannabinoids, the actions of which are terminated by re-uptake and metabolism by various enzymes, including fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX 2). Preventing the metabolism, or uptake, of endocannabinoids elevates levels of these lipid compounds in tissue and produces behavioural analgesia in models of acute pain. Herein we review recent studies of the effects of inhibition of metabolism of endocannabinoids versus uptake of endocannabinoids on nociceptive processing in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain...|$|R

Our search yielded eleven total citations, of which four studies (266 patients) met the inclusion criteria of DEX for analgosedation in burn patients. There are no meta-analyses published that met our inclusion criteria. Even though there were only a small number of clinical trials available, the meta-analysis shows evidence for deeper and better sedation as well as for prevention of hypertension when using DEX as an adjunct during burn procedures. No evidence was found for reduced pain scores in this setting.

In the present study, we compared {{the effect of a}} selective FAAH inhibitor, URB 597, to that of a pan-{{cannabinoid receptor}} agonist HU 210 in rat models of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Systemic administration of URB 597 (0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and HU 210 (0. 03 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) both reduced the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the CFA model of inflammatory pain. In contrast, HU 210, but not URB 597, reduced mechanical allodynia in the partial sciatic nerve-ligation model of neuropathic pain. HU 210, but not URB 597, produced a reduction in motor performance in unoperated rats. The effects of URB 597 in the CFA model were dose dependent and were reduced by coadministration with the cannabinoid CB 1 antagonist AM 251 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), or the CB 2 and SR 144528 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). Coadministration with AM 251 plus SR 144528 completely reversed the effects of URB 597. These findings suggest that the FAAH inhibitor URB 597 produces cannabinoid CB 1 and CB 2 receptor-mediated analgesia in inflammatory pain states, without causing the undesirable side effects associated with cannabinoid receptor activation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryOpioids {{remain the}} {{standard}} for analgesic care; however, adverse effects of systemic treatments contraindicate long-term administration. While most clinical opioids target mu opioid receptors (MOR), those that target the delta class (DOR) also demonstrate analgesic efficacy. Furthermore, peripherally restrictive opioids represent an attractive direction for analgesia. However, opioid receptors including DOR are analgesically incompetent {{in the absence of}} inflammation. Here, we report that G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK 2) naively associates with plasma membrane DOR in peripheral sensory neurons to inhibit <b>analgesic</b> <b>agonist</b> efficacy. This interaction prevents optimal Gβ subunit association with the receptor, thereby reducing DOR activity. Importantly, bradykinin stimulates GRK 2 movement away from DOR and onto Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP). protein kinase C (PKC) -dependent RKIP phosphorylation induces GRK 2 sequestration, restoring DOR functionality in sensory neurons. Together, these results expand the known function of GRK 2, identifying a non-internalizing role to maintain peripheral DOR in an analgesically incompetent state...|$|R

40|$|Neuropathic pain is an {{important}} public health problem for which only a few treatments are available. Preclinical studies show that melatonin (MLT), a neurohormone acting on MT 1 and MT 2 receptors, has analgesic properties, likely through MT 2 receptors. Here, we determined {{the effects of the}} novel selective MLT MT 2 receptor partial agonist N-{ 2 -([3 -bromophenyl]- 4 -fluorophenylamino) ethyl}acetamide (UCM 924) in 2 neuropathic pain models in rats and examined its supraspinal mechanism of action. In rat L 5 -L 6 spinal nerve ligation and spared nerve injury models, UCM 924 (20 - 40 mg/kg, subcutaneously) produced a prolonged antinociceptive effect that is : (1) dose-dependent and blocked by the selective MT 2 receptor antagonist 4 -phenyl- 2 -propionamidotetralin, (2) superior to a high dose of MLT (150 mg/kg) and comparable with gabapentin (100 mg/kg), but (3) without noticeable motor coordination impairments in the rotarod test. Using double staining immunohistochemistry, we found that MT 2 receptors are expressed by glutamatergic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Using in vivo electrophysiology combined with tail flick, we observed that microinjection of UCM 924 into the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray decreased tail flick responses, depressed the firing activity of ON cells, and activated the firing of OFF cells; all effects were MT 2 receptor-dependent. Altogether, these data demonstrate that selective MT 2 receptor partial <b>agonists</b> have <b>analgesic</b> properties through modulation of brainstem descending antinociceptive pathways, and MT 2 receptors may represent a novel target in the treatment of neuropathic pain...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dexmedetomidine is the {{selective}} 2 -adrenoceptor <b>agonist</b> with <b>analgesic</b> potency. Magnesium has antinociceptive effects in animal and human models of pain. Our hypothesis {{was that the}} addition of magnesium and dexmedetomidine to thoracic epidural bolus of ropivacaine may increases the duration of analgesia. Methods: Sixty patients undergoing thoracotomy were enrolled to receive either dexmedetomidine(Group D) or magnesium sulphate (Group M) till first epidural top up. In Group D, patients received 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine +ropivacaine 0. 375 % and group M patients received magnesium sulphate 75 mg +ropivacaine 0. 375 % epidurally as an initial bolus dose. Pain assessment using a visual analogue scale (VAS), Time to reach maximum sensory block level, Sensory block level, first epidural top, heart rate, blood pressure sedation scores were observed in the postoperative period. In post – operative monitoring, any untoward complications like hypotension, hypertension, bradycardia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression were also observed. Results: The demographic profile of patients was comparable in both the groups. Time to reach maximum sensory block level in group D vs M (16. 30 ± 4. 27 vs. 14. 28 ± 3. 38) was significantly earlier in the M group. Postoperative analgesia was prolonged significantly in the D group (8. 00 ± 1. 01) as compare to group M (5. 27 ± 0. 69). Sedation scores were noted < 3 in the group D. While the incidence of dry mouth, decrease heart rate significantly {{were higher in the}} D group. Incidence of nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression were similar in both grou...|$|R
