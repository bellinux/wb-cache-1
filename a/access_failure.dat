We also present novel analyses that reveal aspects of end-to-end failures that {{would be hard to}} discern otherwise. First, we combine endto-end failure observations across a large number of clients to classify failures as server-related or client-related. Second, we correlate failures attributed to a client or server with BGP churn for the corresponding IP address prefix(es), to shed light on the end-to-end impact of BGP instability. Our study is based on failure observations during a monthlong experiment involving 134 client hosts (across Planet-Lab, commercial dialup and broadband ISPs, and a corporate network) repeatedly accessing 80 websites. We find that the median failure rate of web accesses is about 1. 5 %, which is non-negligible. About 34 - 42 % of the web <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> are due to DNS problems, primarily due to the inability of the client to connect to its local DNS server. The majority of the remaining failures are due to TCP connection establishment failures. Also, by correlating failure observations across clients and servers, we find that server-side problems are the dominant cause of TCP connection failures...|$|R

40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β 1 {{genotype}} polymorphisms determine AV fistula patency in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundIn hemodialysis patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> is {{primarily due to}} fistula stenosis, which predisposes to thrombosis and subsequent access loss. The risk for <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> differs interindividually, an observation that is independent from vascular anatomy in {{a significant number of}} patients. Fistula stenosis is histologically characterized by intimal hyperplasia, which is induced by growth factors, among which transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) is of major importance. The quantitative production of TGF-β 1 interindividually differs due to polymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of the cytokine. We hypothesized that the TGF-β 1 genotype, by influencing the development of arteriovenous fistula stenosis, determines the risk for vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> MethodsOne hundred twenty patients who had undergone placement of an AV fistula for initiation of hemodialysis treatment were genotyped for the polymorphic bases at position + 869 and + 915 of the TGF-β 1 gene. The primary end-point was time from fistula placement to <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> ResultsAV fistula patency was significantly associated with the TGF-β 1 genotype (P = 0. 0046); patency was 62. 4 % and 81. 2 % after 12 months for TGF-β 1 high and intermediate producers, respectively. In contrast, AV fistula patency neither differed between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, nor between patients with and without manifest cardiovascular disease. ConclusionPolymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of TGF-β 1 influence the risk for hemodialysis <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> By inducing synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, overproduction of TGF-β 1 may accelerate the development of intimal hyperplasia, resulting in fistula stenosis and subsequent <b>access</b> <b>failure...</b>|$|E

To conserve the usage of energy, which is a scarce resource, the information to be broadcast must be organized so that the client can selectively tune in at the desired portion of the broadcast. In this paper, the efficient, energy conserving transaction processing in mobile broadcast environments is examined with widely accepted approaches to indexed data organizations suited for a single item retrieval. The basic idea is to share the index information on multiple data items based on the predeclaration technique. The analytical and simulation studies have been performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of our methodology, showing that predeclaration-based transaction processing with selective tuning ability can provide a significant performance improvement of battery life, while retaining a low access time. Tolerance to <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> during transaction processing is also described.

40|$|In {{patients}} receiving hemodialysis, {{the provision of}} safe and effective vascular access using an arteriovenous fistula or graft {{is regarded as a}} critical priority by patients and health professionals. Vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> is associated with morbidity and mortality, such that strategies to prevent these outcomes are essential. Inadequate vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia resulting in stenosis and frequently thrombosis are critical to the pathogenesis of <b>access</b> <b>failure.</b> Systemic medical therapies with pleiotropic effects including antiplatelet agents, omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oils), statins, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) may reduce vascular <b>access</b> <b>failure</b> by promoting vascular access maturation and reducing stenosis and thrombosis through antiproliferative, antiaggregatory, anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory effects.

Carotid atherosclerosis was defined as a CIMT≥ 0. 9  mm or the incidence of atherosclerotic plaques. Results: The patients’ mean age was 54. 5 ± 10. 6 years, and 60 % of the patients were male.

40|$|Can {{we always}} tell, just through reflection, {{what we should}} believe? That is the {{question}} of access, the central disagreement between epistemic internalists and externalists, and the focus of the dissertation. Chapter 1 gives an argument for access, connecting it with the question of whether we can intentionally bias our own investigations to favour desirable hypotheses. I argue that we can't: since we have to take any known biases into account when evaluating the evidence obtained, attempts to bias our inquiries will be self-undermining. Surprisingly, this explanation fails for agents who anticipate violating access; and such agents can in fact intentionally bias their investigations. Since this possibility remains counterintuitive when we focus on alleged counterexamples to access, this is a serious problem for externalism. Chapters 2 and 3 offer a solution to this problem and related, more familiar, ones. Chapter 2 lays some technical foundations, by investigating iterated knowledge in David Lewis's contextualist theory of knowledge. I show that his account has the surprising consequence that agents cannot attend to "negative access failures", cases in which someone fails to know something without knowing that they fail to know it. Whilst this prediction is prima facie unattractive, I show how it can be defended. Chapter 3 uses this Lewisian treatment of negative <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> to solve our problems for externalism. For I show that these problems arise not from maintaining that, in some situations, agents are unable to tell what they should believe, but rather from maintaining that rational agents can sometimes suspect that they are currently in such a situation or anticipate that they will be in such a situation in the future. Externalists can reject this stronger thesis. To explain how, I sketch a theory of evidence which integrates the Lewisian treatment of negative <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> to predict that agents always have to think that they can tell what they should believe, even though this isn't always true. By rejecting access, but maintaining that agents can never anticipate violating it, this theory reconciles the most attractive features of externalism and internalism. by Bernhard Salow. Thesis: Ph.

In contrast, a large payload leads a longer time for transmitting a packet, which increases the possibilities of channel <b>access</b> <b>failures</b> and causes lower PDR too.
