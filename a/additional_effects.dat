5|$|Negative {{effects of}} the coast trade on the native peoples of the Northwest {{included}} waves of epidemic disease, smallpox worst of all. Other health problems included the spread of alcoholism, tuberculosis, venereal diseases including syphilis, and sterility. The coast trade also promoted and enhanced the pre-existing system of native slavery and native slave trading. The overall number of slaves increased, as did their distribution and exploitation. Despite these negative effects, the North West Coast natives were largely spared the <b>additional</b> <b>effects</b> that would have come had there been more permanent posts, political administration, missionizing, and colonization. The early traders were mostly seasonal visitors and the later HBC posts were few and small. Missionization and direct colonial rule over the coastal natives did not begin in earnest until the late 19th century. During the early 19th century, native culture not only survived but flourished.|$|E
5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although <b>additional</b> <b>effects</b> on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

25|$|Between 1972 and 1991, 29 {{volcanic}} eruptions were recorded, mostly on Java. The two most violent {{volcanic eruptions}} {{in modern times}} occurred in Indonesia; in 1815 Mount Tambora in Sumbawa erupted killing 92,000 people. Tambora produced the largest eruption known on the planet during the past 10,000 years. Also the eruption created an umbrella of volcanic ash which spread and blanketed Southeast Asia, plunging it into darkness for a week, and made a whole world without a summer in 1815.

500|$|Similar to {{the work}} in Shaun of the Dead, blood and gore was {{prevalent}} throughout the film. Visual effects supervisor Richard Briscoe revealed the rationale for using the large amounts of blood: [...] "In many ways, the more extreme you make it, the more people know it is stylised and enjoy the humour inherent in how ridiculous it is. It's rather like the (eventually) limbless Black Knight in Monty Python's Holy Grail." [...] The most time-consuming gore sequence involved a character's head being crushed by a section of a church. A dummy was used against a green screen and the head was detonated at the point when the object was about to impact the body. Throughout the film, over seventy gunfight shots were digitally augmented; Briscoe's rationale for adding the <b>additional</b> <b>effects</b> was that [...] "The town square shootout, for example, is full of extra little hits scattered throughout, so that it feels like our hero characters really do have it all going off, all around them. It was a great demonstration of [...] seemingly very trivial enhancements {{can make a difference}} when combined across a sequence." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have <b>additional</b> <b>effects</b> from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called heterotopic ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E
500|$|Method Studios was {{contracted}} {{to handle the}} film's visual effects work. The studio's supervisor Sean Faden, worked alongside the film's visual effects supervisor, Brad Parker throughout the production. Several of the film's scenes {{proved to be a}} challenge for the team. Director Reeves wanted the [...] "car-crash" [...] sequence to appear as if it were filmed uncut in first-person. Several plates were shot with the first involving actor Jenkins backing the car out of the gas station and swerving, the second plate shot had a model of the car capable of being spun mechanically on a [...] "rotisserie" [...] in front of a blue screen which could simulate the car's roll down the hill. Jenkins' stunt double and a dummy were placed in the car as the rotisserie spun with <b>additional</b> <b>effects</b> work used to animate the dummy as the car rolled. The two shots were then combined to deceive the viewer into believing that it was one complete shot. Houdini software was used for much of the film's shots which involved Abby in her vampiric form. Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, [...] "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood. But in this case, the timing of the bleeding was so dependent on the emotional beats of the scene that this technique wouldn’t have allowed us enough control." [...] Actress Chloë Grace Moretz was first shot with minimal prosthetic blood applied to her face for reference. Then using techniques utilized in a prior Method Studios film, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Faden had the Houdini software track Moretz's shaking movements and render the gradual release of blood from her face.|$|E

2500|$|The rings {{associated}} with the four ancient basins are the oldest structures within the mapped area and have to some degree controlled the structural trends of subsequent tectonism. Several of the lobate ridges described by Strom follow arcuate patterns along rings of the Barma-Vincente Basin; Hero Rupes is an example. These lobate ridges appear to be of compressive tectonic origin and, although global in distribution, may be deflected locally {{by the presence of}} preexisting, basin-related structure. <b>Additional</b> <b>effects</b> of these ancient basin rings may be seen where the rim of Dostoevskij intersects the Barma-Vincente rings (for example, the horst at –40°, 174°); parts of the Dostoevskij rim appear to have been structurally accented by this intersection. These relations are similar to those {{associated with}} highly degraded, ancient basins on Mars (Chicarro and others, 1983). The smooth plains material displays numerous ridges that generally resemble lunar mare ridges and also are considered to be of tectonic origin. The mercurian ridges are probably related to minor compressive stresses that postdate smooth plains emplacement. Numerous lineaments are associated with basin rim material, but most of these lineaments are probably related to ejecta deposition. A few may be faults, particularly where they occur close to preexisting basin rings.|$|E
