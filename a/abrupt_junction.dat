We consider four distinct cases: (i) a light-heavy (<b>abrupt)</b> <b>junction</b> in which the DB impinges on the junction from the segment with lighter mass, (ii) a heavy-light junction, (iii) an up mass-ramp in which the mass in the heavier segment increases continuously as one {{moves away from the}} junction point, and (iv) a down mass-ramp. Depending on the mass difference and DB characteristics (frequency and velocity), the DB can either reflect from, or transmit through, or get trapped at the junction or on the ramp. For the heavy-light junction, the DB can even split at the junction into a reflected and a transmitted DB. The latter is found to subsequently split into two or more DBs. For the down mass-ramp the DB gets accelerated in several stages, with accompanying radiation (phonons). These results are rationalized by calculating the Peierls-Nabarro barrier for the various cases.
