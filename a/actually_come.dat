5|$|Season two {{begins with}} Coach Taylor {{living and working}} in Austin as an {{assistant}} coach at fictional TMU, while wife Tami remains in Dillon with daughter Julie and newborn baby Gracie. Tami is struggling with the demands of the new baby and Julie's rebellious behavior. The Panthers' new coach, Bill McGregor, creates friction between Smash and Matt by showing blatant favoritism to Smash, drives Tim so hard he passes out during practice from dehydration and is hospitalized, alienates assistant coach Jason Street by his condescending manner, and alienates Boosters president Buddy Garrity by barring him from team practices. When Smash and Matt <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to blows on the field and a crucial game is won by Smash, Buddy engineers the firing of the new coach and persuades Taylor that both the team and his family are suffering in his absence. Taylor agrees to return.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{can compete}} indirectly, either via exploitative or {{apparent}} competition. Exploitative competition involves individuals depleting a shared resource and both suffering {{a loss in}} fitness as a result.

25|$|Adaptation {{rather than}} replacement. Names {{that came to}} look like they were coined as Old English may <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> from Roman-period ones. For example, the city of York's {{connection}} to its original Romanised Celtic name Eburacum is not immediately obvious. But knowledge of the intermediate forms of the name, Old English *Eburwīc (later Eoforwīc) and Norse Jórvík, makes the connection clearer.|$|E

25|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the poem suggests that the statue does not <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to life, but that Evgenii loses his sanity. Pushkin makes Evengii go mad to create “a terrrifying dimension {{to even the most}} humdrum personality {{and at the same time}} show the abyss hidden in the most apparently common-place human soul”. In this regard, Evgenii is seen to become a disinherited man of the time in much the same vein as a traditional epic hero.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> {{close enough for}} long enough so the strong nuclear force can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, {{there is a large}} energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Paige {{assumed the}} {{position}} of deputy sheriff in Jackson County, Missouri, {{with the understanding that}} he need not bother to <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to work in the sheriff's office. The purpose of the charade was to set up Paige with political credentials. Soon after, he was running for a Missouri state assembly seat {{with the support of the}} local Democratic club against incumbent Representative Leon Jordan. Candidate Paige never gave a speech, and was never taken seriously. Jordan defeated Paige by the margin of 1,870 votes to 382 (83%–17%).|$|E

25|$|Dominicans began {{coming to}} Philadelphia after 1965. Prior to 1990 {{there was a}} very small {{population}} of Dominicans. The a significant wave of Dominican immigration started in 1990 with a group of Dominicans moving from New York to gain jobs. Though, immigration from the Dominican Republic to the Philadelphia region is increasing, most Dominicans moving to Philadelphia <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> from New York City and other nearby areas. The vast majority of Dominicans live scattered in Lower Northeast and eastern North Philadelphia especially north of Erie Avenue, sharing neighborhoods with the city's larger Puerto Rican population. Smaller numbers of Dominicans live in West Philadelphia. Dominicans are one of Philadelphia's fastest growing ethnic groups.|$|E
25|$|As of 8 December 2014, the National Council {{has voted}} {{to limit the}} {{operational}} life-time of the Beznau Nuclear Power Plant to 60 years, forcing its two reactors to be decommissioned by 2029 and 2031, respectively. The lower house has also {{voted in favor of}} banning the construction of new reactors for commercial usage. However, the adoption of such amendment still has to be confirmed by the Council of States, the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. In addition, a citizens' initiative to restrict the operational life-time of nuclear reactors to 45 years will have to be voted upon, irrespective of whether the legislature's amendment will <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> into force or not.|$|E
25|$|However, Sonia's arrest {{proved to}} be a red herring and it was later {{revealed}} that the killing blow had <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> from Pauline's husband Joe, who broke down and confessed to Dot Branning that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in a fury, struck her across the head with a frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life. The plot's eventual climax in February 2007 led to the exits of several established characters connected with Pauline. This included Martin, Sonia and Joe, who was dramatically killed off after confessing to Pauline's murder—he fell out of the Fowlers' first floor window while trying to apprehend a hysterical Dot.|$|E

25|$|The Northwestern Athletics' mascot is Willie the Wildcat. However, the team's first mascot was not Willie, but a live, caged bear cub {{from the}} Lincoln Park Zoo named Furpaw. In fall 1923, Furpaw {{was driven to}} the playing field to greet the fans before each game. After a losing season, the team decided that Furpaw was the harbinger of bad luck and banished him from campus. Willie made his debut ten years later in 1933 as a logo, but did not <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to life until 1947, {{when members of the}} Alpha Delta {{fraternity}} dressed up as him during the Homecoming parade. The Northwestern University Marching Band (NUMB) performs at all home football and lead cheers in the student section and the alma mater {{at the end of the}} game.|$|E

I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's {{not so much about}} this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." [...] He further said, [...] "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1921–22 season saw Sprague Cleghorn {{leave and}} Jack Darragh retire, opening spaces for new defencemen Frank Boucher and Frank [...] "King" [...] Clancy. Clancy's first goal came {{on his first}} shot, against Hamilton in {{overtime}} on February 7, and was noted for having <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> in (illegally) through {{the side of the}} net. Broadbent and Cy Denneny, the [...] "Gold Dust Twins", finished one and two in league scoring, together producing 59 of Ottawa's 106 goals. Broadbent scored in 16 consecutive games, an NHL record, that as of 2009, still stands. The Senators won the regular season title but lost to eventual Stanley Cup winner Toronto St. Patricks 5–4 in a two-game total goals series. The series had the Boucher brothers play for Ottawa, while Cy Denneny played for Ottawa and his brother Corbett played for Toronto.|$|E
500|$|The storyline—dubbed [...] "who killed Pauline?" [...] by the British press—continued into 2007, {{as first}} Pauline's funeral is {{interrupted}} by the police in order to perform an autopsy on her body, and then Pauline's nemesis Sonia is arrested for the murder. It is later revealed that the killing blow had <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> from Pauline's husband Joe, who breaks down and confesses to Dot that he had rowed with Pauline on Christmas Day (off-screen) and, in a fury, struck her across {{the head with a}} frying pan, causing a brain haemorrhage that claimed her life.

Pauline is cremated, and her ashes buried at Arthur's graveside, by Dot, in an episode that aired in June 2007.

500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one of those little girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E

500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} famously share {{a turbulent}} relationship; {{one of their}} arguments was even released on a 1995 bootleg single titled Wibbling Rivalry. Although in recent years their relationship had stabilised, during the band's early career there were a handful of incidents where the two have <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> to blows. In an L.A. show during their first American tour in 1994, Liam took to changing {{the words of the}} songs so that they were offensive to both Americans and Noel. A confrontation after the show which led to a chair being thrown and a brawl caused him to leave the tour and head for Las Vegas; Gallagher later claimed he had [...] "visions of Fear and Loathing flashing in [...] eyes". During recording sessions for the second Oasis album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, the brothers had a violent fight involving a cricket bat, when Liam invited everyone from a local pub back into the studio while he was trying to work. In 1995, Noel was obliged to sing [...] "Wonderwall" [...] on Later... with Jools Holland when Liam failed to turn up.|$|E
500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, <b>actually</b> <b>come</b> off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E
