Although all fields of knowledge can potentially take advantage from AR, Tori et al. [72] argue that education will be particularly modified by its introduction. The coexistence of virtual and real environments <b>allows</b> <b>learners</b> to experience phenomena that otherwise would be impossible in the real world. This <b>allows</b> <b>learners</b> to visualize complex spatial relationships and abstract concepts and, therefore, develop important abilities that cannot be evolved in other technology learning environments [78].|$|R

40|$|Metacognitive {{monitoring}} and control must be accurate and efficient in order to <b>allow</b> self-guided <b>learners</b> to improve their performance. Yet few examples exist in which <b>allowing</b> <b>learners</b> to control learning produces higher levels of performance than restricting learners??? control. Here we investigate the consequences of <b>allowing</b> <b>learners</b> to self-pace study of a list of words on later recognition, and show that learners with control of study-time allocation significantly outperformed subjects with no control, even when the total study time was equated between groups (Experiments 1 and 2). The self-pacing group also outperformed a group for which study time was automatically allocated {{as a function of}} normative item difficulty (Experiment 2). The advantage of self-pacing was apparent only in subjects who utilized a discrepancy reduction strategy???that is, who allocated more study time to normatively difficult items. Self-pacing can improve memory performance, but only when appropriate allocation strategies are used...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of whiteboards. The initial whiteboards, {{analogous}} to blackboards, date from the late 1950s. The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically to refer to virtual whiteboards in which computer software applications simulate whiteboards by allowing writing or drawing. This is a common feature of groupware for virtual meeting, collaboration, and instant messaging. Interactive whiteboards <b>allow</b> <b>learners</b> and instructors to write on the touch screen. The screen markup can be on either a blank whiteboard or any computer screen content. Depending on permission settings, this visual learning can be interactive and participatory, including writing and manipulating images on the interactive whiteboard.|$|E

L 4 All is {{a system}} that records and shares {{learning}} trails through educational offerings with the aim of facilitating progression of lifelong learners from Secondary Education, through to Further Education and on to Higher Education (HE). The focus is on helping those post- 16 learners who have traditionally not participated in HE. L 4 All <b>allows</b> <b>learners</b> to access information and resources registered with the system by their providers, to plan their own learning, and to maintain a record of their learning. Tutors are able to register recommended learning pathways through courses and modules, thereby encouraging progression into HE. The system <b>allows</b> <b>learners</b> to share their learning plans and experiences with other learners (if they wish) in order to encourage collaborative formulation of future learning goals and aspirations.

50|$|Social {{networks}} like Facebook, Twitter and Ning <b>allow</b> <b>learners,</b> {{once they}} {{move beyond the}} personal connections, to embrace a community where they can learn from each other. Social interaction {{is an important part}} of the learning process. As technology has grown and become an integral part of the lives of children, teens and young adults, older adults have been forced to adapt. For example, as more adults have been forced to move through the job market recently, they've turned to technology to develop new skills and to find work. Even fast-food restaurants require job seekers to complete employment applications online.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most widely}} used online {{communication}} tool is e-mail between teachers, which provides opportunities for asynchronous communication, instantaneous distribution to a mass audience, mobile access, and file exchange. [...] Teacher-created websites provide online access to administrative information, calendars, links, blogs, etc. Internet forums <b>allow</b> <b>learners</b> and teachers to articulate ideas, give and receive feedback, reflect on the perspectives of others, and receive clarification of concepts. [...] social networking sites are used for focused and open communication between users. Blogs allow individuals to express their ideas in greater detail and with multimedia.Arch-Theway is an online communication tool for School and Parent Communication.|$|E
50|$|Group webpages, blogs, wikis, and Twitter <b>allow</b> <b>learners</b> and {{educators}} to post thoughts, ideas, and comments on a website in an interactive learning environment. Social networking sites are virtual communities for {{people interested in}} a particular subject to communicate by voice, chat, instant message, video conference, or blogs. The National School Boards Association found that 96% of students with online access have used social networking technologies, and more than 50% talk online about schoolwork. Social networking encourages collaboration and engagement and can be a motivational tool for self-efficacy amongst students. Every student {{has his or her}} own learning requirements, and a Web 2.0 educational framework provides enough resources, learning styles, communication tools and flexibility to accommodate this diversity.|$|E
