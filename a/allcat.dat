40|$|It {{is claimed}} here that by 1936 Bridgman had {{developed}} severe criticisms of orthodox quantum mechanics {{from the point}} of view of his operational philosophy. We try to meet these criticisms by a radical analysis of the measurement of the finite and discrete length and time intervals between particulate events. We show that a scale invariant counter paradigm based on two arbitrary finite and discrete measurement intervals A & At offers an alternative starting point for constructing relativistic particle mechanics. Using the scale invariant definitions <b>AllcAt</b> = 1; Ae=/KAt = 21 r for the Einstein limiting velocity c and for “Kepler’s constant ” K- proportional to the area per unit time swept out by a particle moving with constant velocity past a center- we derive the finite and discrete Lorentz invariant bracket expression [xi, 5 j] = KcSij for rectangular coordinates and velocities in three dimensions. Defining field per unit charge as the force per unit mass acting on a test particle with this constraint, we find that these fields satisfy the free field Maxwell equations provided only charge per unit mass for this test particle is a Lorentz invariant, generalizing the Feynman-Dyson-Tanimura proof. This scale invariant theory for classical relativistic fields is broken by any measurement of length with measurement accuracy Al < A/ 2 m,c because electron-positron pairs are produced with finite probability, violating the single test particle postulate. This allows us to recover our new fundamental theory based on the combinatorial hierarchy and bit-string discrimination. Recent mass ratios, coupling constants and cosmological parameters obtained by bit-string dynamics are quoted. 2 [...] . the ultimately important thing about any theory is what it actually does, not what it says it does or what its author thinks it does, for these are often very diferent things indeed. - P.
