In these cases, the miniatures are often mounted on trays, or bases, for ease of mass movement.|$|E

According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge {{of his or her}} language and it is the 'mental reality' which is responsible for all those aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'. Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data.

25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic Water core of the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard there is quite a lot of freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic core of the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal. The Atlantic Water core temperature is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of the depth of the Svalbard Branch of the WSC.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of what I call metalinguistic-semantic {{competence}} (MSC) in the processes of utterance interpretation, {{and in some cases}} expression interpretation. MSC is so-called because it is grounded in a speaker’s explicit knowledge of (or beliefs about) the lexically-encoded meanings of individual words. More specifically, MSC derives, in part, from having concepts of words—or conceptsW as I distinguish them— whose representational contents, I propose, are corresponding items in a speaker’s mental lexicon. The leading idea is that once acquired speakers use their conceptsW to form explicit beliefs about the meanings of words in terms of which extralinguistic concepts those words can (and cannot) coherently be used to express in ordinary conversational situations as constrained by their linguistically-encoded meanings. Or to put the claim differently, I argue that a speaker’s explicit conception of word-meanings is <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> conscious <b>reflection</b> of his/her tacit understanding of the various ways in which lexical meanings guide and constrain without fully determining what their host words can (and cannot) be used/uttered to talk about in ordinary discourse.

In this study, we have tested whether circulating anodic antigens can be included into an established egg count model. A data set with 3 repeated faecal egg count and serum CAA measurements of 50 individuals from {{a community in}} Burundi with moderate endemicity was used. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, both antigens and egg counts were related to an underlying worm pair distribution, {{taking into account the}} variation in repeated measurements (within individuals) and the variation in worm burdens (between individuals). Models with various assumptions (e. g. presence or absence of density-dependent egg production) were tested. Whereas observed and predicted egg counts agreed fairly well, the circulating antigen data could not be described satisfactorily. In particular, the predicted number of negative antigen concentrations was much lower than observed, while the number of light positives was overestimated. There seems to be a mechanism that causes a shift of expected (low) positive CAA concentrations towards zeros, which the proposed models do not provide for. Possible biological as well as assay-related mechanisms that may account for this shift are discussed. The assumption that serum CAA concentrations are <b>a</b> simple <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of worm (pair) burdens could not be corroborated by this modelling exercise.

2500|$|In {{the year}} 1848, McCord {{published}} {{her first book}} of poetry. My Dreams, a collection of fugitive poems, from the press of Carey & Hart, Philadelphia. A close study of these poems reveals a genuine poetic talent, {{but there is not}} the certainty of maturity, not the metrical perfection of first-rate poetry. The lyrist is an honestly doubting lyrist in many passages. There are a number of them that are either of adolescent composition, withheld until 1848 for publication, or at least of adolescent conception, possibly worked over for this volume. Hope is the keynote of a majority of the poems in this collection; but in many instances the hope is unaccompanied by any certainty of faith which a woman of McCord's full life and wide experience must have developed at the time this collection was published. A few of the poems are narrative myths, <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of her classic temperament. They suggest early Greek myths, and meet the reader with such titles as [...] "The Daughters of Hope," [...] who are cleverly personified as Fancy and Happiness, and, Happiness being lost in Life's confusion, Fancy assists her mother, Hope, to chase Happiness through all time. Others included [...] "The Falling Star," [...] "Love, Wisdom, Folly," [...] "The Comet," [...] "The Star That Followed Me," [...] "Conduct of the Sources of Good and Evil," [...] "The Home of Hope" [...] and [...] "The Voice of a Star."

40|$|A common view on {{language}} acquisition {{assumes that the}} LAD attains the core grammar of a specific language by fixing parameters of UG {{in a relatively short}} time and without support of negative evidence. The high demands of relatively short time and no negative evidence come in reach by a mediating principle, the Subset Principle. This principle protects the LAD against the wide arrays of options that are necessarily opened by the UG parameters. If we look at the acquisition facts, though, {{it is not possible to}} accept the Subset Principle. Child language is characterized by parameter options that are not supported by the adult input and that fade out slowly.

If the relation between the applicative semantics and its syntactic form is as direct as I have assumed, then we might be able to decide this question on the basis of what linguists can tell us about natural grammars.

40|$|Goethe had {{a complex}} and {{evolving}} relationship with the nobility, for reasons which can in part be inferred from his biography. This thesis, however, is primarily concerned with examination of relevant texts, and is largely confined to the years before the journey to Italy in 1786. The first three chapters cover the period before his arrival in Weimar. This is followed by {{an account of the}} relevant works from the first Weimar decade (1775 - 1786), with some biographical detail. The main weight has fallen on Wilhelm Meisters theatralische Sendung, a text which is still sometimes undervalued, and has a rather limited bibliography. It is naturally <b>a</b> more <b>direct</b> <b>reflection</b> of his social attitudes than the three major plays associated with the decade, which however have been given separate, more cursory treatments in the three final chapters. General themes include the emergence of Goethe from immature, or at least inherited, stereotypes of the nobility, first towards an attempted alliance between it and the ‘Genie’ of the Sturm und Drang, and then to a more detailed critique made possible by personal experience. The final phase (final, that is, within the limited time frame) was the formation and development of an internal ideal of nobility with an increasingly tenuous relationship with social and political reality. Goethe’s picture of nobility as performance and presentation of self is considered, and its links, for the non-noble author, with theatre and theatrical role performance. Other recurring themes include court manners and their value, both inherently and as an analogue of the heightening which for Goethe was essential to art, court life as a paradigm of social life in general, and the related subject of flight from society...|$|R
