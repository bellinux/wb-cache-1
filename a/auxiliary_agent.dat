The water being treated flows through the resin container until the resin is considered exhausted and water is purified to a desired level. Resin is then regenerated by sequentially backwashing the resin bed to remove accumulated solids, flushing removed ions from the resin with a concentrated solution of replacement ions, and rinsing the flushing solution from the resin. After treatment, ion-exchange resin beads saturated with calcium and magnesium ions from the treated water, are regenerated by soaking in brine containing 6-12% NaCl.

40|$|The {{complexation}} of piroxicam and 2 -hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin {{by means}} of supercritical CO 2 has been investigated. The experiments were carried out by varying the temperature, pressure and contact time and introducing two different auxiliary agents: polyvinyl pyrrolidone orl-lysine. Cyclodextrins, which are widely used to solubilize a large variety of poorly soluble drugs, are often used in combination with some <b>auxiliary</b> <b>agents</b> to enhance the complexation efficiency of the conventional techniques.

The corresponding low cost and non-toxic chlorides instead of the well established but more expensive and deleterious alkoxyprecursors were used as starting materials. Hydrolysis of the precursors led to wet gels. The strong exothermic reaction in case of TiCl 4 or SiCl 4 as gelprecursor can be controlled by both cooling and immersing the needle of the syringe in the aqueous solution. Under optimal conditions a rapid formation of sil-ica- and zirconia based hydrogels could be achieved even without additional amounts of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>agent.</b> It is shown that in all other cases the hydrolysis reaction and gel formation can be controlled by adding agents with crosslinking properties like propylene oxide, dilution with alcohols or starting from water glass.

The increase of the drug dissolution rate was investigated performing in vitro release tests in aqueous solutions. The results showed that the supercritical treatment can be an efficient method to obtain inclusion complexes with enhanced release kinetics. The operating methods of the release tests, that is, the “tablet method” or the “dispersed amount method,” affected both the dissolution rate and its dependence on the drug amount in the samples. On the contrary, the variation of the pH of the dissolution medium did not show any effect on the release rate of the supercritical complexes...|$|R
40|$|DE 102005026223 A 1 UPAB: 20070119 NOVELTY - Preparation of {{a stable}} and non-cross linked {{hemicellulose}} paste comprises: alkaline extraction of hemicellulose from hemicellulose containing material, where the hemicellulose is free of cross-linking component; treatment of hemicellulose in alkaline medium with an oxidizing agent; reduction of the pH value and separation of the surplus liquid until {{the formation of a}} homogeneous and stable paste. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a stable paste comprising at least a non-cross linked hemicellulose, obtained through the alkaline extraction of a hemicellulose containing material and at least a liquid dispersion medium, where the hemicellulose is non-cross linked. USE - The paste is useful as cosmetic product, pharmaceutical product and food and/or food <b>auxiliary</b> <b>agents</b> (claimed). The paste is useful to promote health characteristics, e. g. lowering of the cholesterol level and stabilization of the blood sugar and insulin. ADVANTAGE - The hemicellulose paste is stable and non-cross linked paste (claimed). The oxidizing agent is used instead of enzyme, thus the process is economical...|$|R
