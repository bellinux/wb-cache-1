50|$|One of the {{proprietary}} layers {{was called}} <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Routing.</b> The <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Routing</b> system implemented two powerful features. One {{is that the}} network operated entirely in a self-discovery mode. When a new switch {{was added to the}} network by connecting it to a neighbor via a leased telephone circuit, the new switch was discovered and absorbed into the network without explicit configuration. To change the network configuration, all that was needed was to add or remove connections, and the network would automatically reconfigure. The second feature implemented by <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Routing</b> was often talked about in network engineering circles, but was implemented only by CNS - establishing connection paths on the basis of real-time performance measurements. As one circuit became busy, traffic was diverted to alternative paths to prevent overloading and poor performance for users.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical {{evaluation of the}} performance of <b>adaptive</b> wormhole <b>routing</b> in a two-dimensional torus. Our analysis focuses on minimal and fully <b>adaptive</b> wormhole <b>routing</b> that allows a message to use any shortest path between source and destination. A validation of the analysis through simulation is presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained results. Finally, we remark that no theoretical limitation prevents the extension of our analytical approach to the evaluation {{of the performance of}} <b>adaptive</b> wormhole <b>routing</b> in hypercubes or other symmetric topologies with wrap-around connections.

5000|$|Adaptive QoS routing is a cross-layer {{optimization}} <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing</b> mechanism. The cross-layer mechanism provides up-to-date local QoS {{information for}} the <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm, by considering the impacts of node mobility and lower-layer link performance. The multiple QoS requirements are satisfied by adaptively using forward error correction and multipath routing mechanisms, based on the current network status. The complete routing mechanism includes three parts: (1) a modified dynamic source routing algorithm that handles route discovery and the collection of QoS related parameters; (2) a local statistical computation and link monitoring function located in each node; and (3) an integrateddecision-making system to calculate the number of routing paths, coding parity length, and traffic distribution rates.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of routing {{connectionless}} trafc in an ATM network and propose an <b>adaptive</b> multipath <b>routing</b> scheme that enhances the routing methods employed at the Inter{Working Units (IWUs). We present a scheme that distributes packets among multiple Virtual Paths (VPs) according to the utilization of the links of these VPs. The utilization of the VPs is determined byafeedback mechanism. We present simulation studies to show the e ectiveness of the proposed <b>adaptive</b> multipath <b>routing</b> scheme. ...|$|R
40|$|A load-balancing scheme has a {{significant}} effect on the performance of the <b>adaptive</b> zone <b>routing</b> protocol, especially in an ad hoc network environment. In order to analyze the effect on the distribution of input traffic among global paths in AZRP (<b>Adaptive</b> Zone <b>Routing</b> Protocol), the routing process is evaluated in terms of two additional local history tables to be maintained in each node: One for the forward error-control (FEC) code rate and a second one for the required information rate with the neighboring nodes. Then the local routing process can then be simplified by creating an efficient load balancing rule. We then considered the load balancing as an optimization problem by using congestion parameter (CP). The solution to the optimization problem is interestingly in accordance to CP. Our simulation results show that AZRP with load balancing (B-AZRP) is so effective that the number of throughputs is increased significantly while the network resource can be utilized more efficiently than that in AZRP (<b>Adaptive</b> Zone <b>Routing</b> Protocol). We propose a load balancing for hybrid routing protocol as its name indicates: B-AZRP as an extended from <b>Adaptive</b> Zone <b>Routing</b> Protocol (ZRP) in [1, 2, and 3]. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general scheme for {{deadlock}} recovery based <b>adaptive</b> wormhole <b>routing</b> by considering a minimal set of additional buffers called recovery buffers. This scheme is then applied to deadlock recovery. When deadlock occurs in <b>adaptive</b> wormhole <b>routing,</b> the scheme routes the deadlocked message through a special recovery network, constructed from a sub {{set of the}} available network resources. Safe recovery is performed without loosing the adaptivity in routing. Simulation study revealed that the proposed scheme performs well under high network load...|$|R

This paper describes an <b>adaptive</b> swarm-based <b>routing</b> algorithm that increases convergence speed, reduces routing instabilities and oscillations by using a novel variation of reinforcement learning and a technique called momentum.

The utilization of the VPs is determined by a periodic feedback mechanism. Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the proposed <b>adaptive</b> multipath <b>routing</b> scheme...|$|R
30|$|The work {{presented}} in this article builds upon this observation to motivate and investigate the feasibility of an <b>adaptive</b> multi-mode <b>routing</b> protocol framework that has multiple compatible modes of operation, where each mode can be designed to operate as efficiently as possible in a given networking context. Based on this framework, an <b>adaptive</b> multi-mode <b>routing</b> protocol is implemented offering three different modes of operations. Nodes can adapt their mode of operation at any moment, while a consistent state of the routing tables is maintained and without impacting on-going connections. To the best of authors' knowledge, this goes beyond current research into <b>adaptive</b> ad hoc <b>routing</b> protocols, since no adaptive protocol described in literature has the ability to let individual nodes change their routing technique while an overall consistent state of the routing tables is maintained.|$|R
50|$|Routers {{that use}} other {{adaptive}} protocols, such as grouped <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing,</b> find {{a group of}} *all* the links {{that could be used}} to get the packet one hop closer to its final destination.The router sends the packet out any link of that group which is idle.The link aggregation of that group of links effectively becomes a single high-bandwidth connection.|$|E
50|$|Additional I/O links were added, {{with two}} {{dedicated}} to I/O and sixteen for interconnects, allowing {{for up to}} 65,536 CPUs in the hypercube. The channels operated at 100 Mbit/s, due to use of 2-bit parallel lines, instead of the serial lines used previously. The nCUBE-3 also added fault-tolerant <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing</b> support, in addition to fixed routing, although in retrospect it's not entirely clear why.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} Con dence-based Dual Reinforcement Q-Routing algorithm (CDRQ-Routing) for <b>adaptive</b> packet <b>routing</b> in communication networks. CDRQ-Routing {{is based on}} an application of the Q-learning framework to network routing, as first proposed by Littman and Boyan (1993). The main contribution of CDRQ-routing is an increased quantity and an improved quality of exploration. Compared to Q-Routing, the state-of-the-art <b>adaptive</b> Bellman-Ford <b>Routing</b> algorithm, and the non-adaptive shortest path method, CDRQ-Routing learns superior policies significantly faster. Moreover, the overhead due to exploration is shown to be insignificant compared to the improvements achieved, which makes CDRQ-Routing a practical method for real communication networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” This letter {{presents}} a generic <b>adaptive</b> multipath <b>routing</b> solution. The method, called Core-State-Limited Load Sharing (CSLLS), has two parameters. One determines the adaptation time to load {{changes and the}} other one controls how long the path of a flow is unchanged. With these two parameters CSLLS is capable of modelling previous multipath routing concepts like ECMP, OMP and QoSPF. CSLLS overcomes the limitations of earlier approaches by being adaptive (opposed to ECMP), by ensuring path integrity for a flow (opposed to OMP), and by relying on only a few stored states in core routers (opposed to QoSPF).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a graph-partitioning generic methodology for developing deadlock-free wormhole routing in an arbitrary network. Further extension allows partial cyclic dependencies among virtual channels. A novel fully <b>adaptive</b> nonminimal deadlock-free <b>routing</b> algorithm {{has been developed}} for k-ary n-cube torus network. Since our technique is based on decomposing a network into several subdigraphs, it simplifies and generalizes the development of both static and <b>adaptive</b> deadlock-free <b>routing</b> algorithms for arbitrary network topologies. We show that our methodology {{can be applied to}} store-and-forward and virtual cut-through routings as well. ...|$|R
50|$|In some networks, {{multiple}} links will {{connect to}} the same STC104 or processor endpoint, or {{to a set of}} equivalent devices. In this circumstance, the STC104 provides a mechanism for grouped <b>adaptive</b> <b>routing,</b> where bundles of links can share the same interval and a link is chosen adaptively from a bundle based on its availability. This mechanism makes efficient use of the available link bandwidth by ensuring a packet does not wait for a link while another equivalent one is available.|$|E
50|$|The {{major issue}} with both fixed path routing and fixed {{alternate}} routing {{is that neither}} algorithm {{takes into account the}} current state of the network. If the predetermined paths are not available, the connection request will become blocked even though other paths may exist. Fixed Path Routing and Fixed Alternate Routing are both not quality aware. For these reasons, most of the research in RWA is currently taking place in Adaptive algorithms. Five examples of <b>Adaptive</b> <b>Routing</b> are LORA, PABR, IA-BF, IA-FF, and AQoS.|$|E
