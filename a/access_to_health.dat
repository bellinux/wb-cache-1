50|$|Finally, {{the book}} Criminalizing the Seriously Mentally Ill: The Abuse of Jails As Mental Hospitals {{points out that}} 20% of jails have no mental health {{resources}}. In addition, small jails are less likely <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> resources {{and are more likely}} to hold individuals with mental illnesses without charges brought against them. Jails in richer areas are more likely <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> resources, and jails with more <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> resources also dealt less with medication refusal.|$|R
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million new cases of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, particularly those of lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|Globally, women's <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>health</b> care {{remains a}} challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated {{by the fact that}} women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to the financial burden in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E

40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> {{care service}} remains {{a major problem}} globally, but more obvious in {{developing}} countries including the Gambia. In general, mental illnesses even though are acknowledged as great contributors to the global burden of disease, they receive little attention at global, regional and local levels compared to other illnesses such as communicable diseases. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care in the Gambia deserves urgent attention. Whereas no recent study is done to examine the prevalent rate and treatment gap, the available data shows that 90 % of mentally ill patients who require treatment do not receive it. The {{aim of this study}} was to contribute to the improvement of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care service by exploring factors that influence <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care service in the Gambia using a qualitative research design. In-depth interviews with 15 mentally ill patients using the community mental health services and 5 focus group discussions with the general population in the same health region were conducted. The findings of this study highlight many factors that could influence <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care service among people with mental illness in the Gambia. The most important of these factors that shed light on <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care service include; perception of and believed causes of mental illness, the scarcity of biomedical service for most of the population, resulting in patients and their families using what is available and long distance <b>to</b> <b>access</b> services. The lack of satisfaction from these services also leads to syncretic use of different treatment systems, coupled with high cost of treatment (traditional system) and antipsychotic medicine. The findings further show that the patient’s family shoulder the responsibility of providing the required financial resources for treatment and medication, but also decide where treatment is sort from. Efforts <b>to</b> improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> services should be approached holistically, as it is influenced by social, family and health system factors. This study however provides a base for action <b>to</b> address <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> care service. Collaboration with traditional healers, provision of mental health services through the community mental health team and long term plan to address poverty can improve <b>access</b> <b>to</b> mental <b>health</b> service in Gambia...|$|R
