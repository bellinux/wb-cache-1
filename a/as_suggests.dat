60|$|In {{the popular}} {{imagination}} she lives chiefly as a terrific poisoner, an appalling artist in venenation. It is remarkable that this should be the case, for not even the scandal of her day so much <b>as</b> <b>suggests</b> that she was connected--directly or even indirectly--with a single case of poisoning.

The ape-man moved rapidly, but cautiously forward.
