40|$|The {{going concern}} warning and its {{consequences}} for auditors and companies have been studied from many different angles. However, the results are conflicting. <b>A</b> going <b>concern</b> warning is issued by an auditor when there is substantial doubt on the company’s ability to continue as <b>a</b> going <b>concern.</b> Studies have shown that most companies survive despite <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning. There are also signs of short-term consequences for the companies. How the consequences unfold {{in the long run}} for companies that have received <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning is not well studied. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how companies are affected in the long run by the consequences that can arise due to <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning. For this study, a quantitative method has been used. Legitimacy theory, Interest theory and Institutional theory, have the common factor that they all explain how organizations survive in the long run. The theories, together with scientific articles and other relevant literature, have been used to develop the hypotheses. Companies with <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning have been compared with companies that have not received <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning. Empirical data have been collected for 2010 - 2015 and by using multiple linear regressions the hypotheses of the study have been tested. The result of the study showed that <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning did not adversely affect the company on a long-term basis. On the contrary, the study indicates that companies with <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning improve compared to equivalent companies which did not receive <b>a</b> going <b>concern</b> warning. ...|$|R
