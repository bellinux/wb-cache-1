5000|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> (Chloroscombrus chrysurus) is a {{game fish}} in the family, Carangidae. It was first {{described}} by the [...] "father of modern taxonomy", Carl Linnaeus in the book, Systema Naturae. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> are known to eat smaller fish, cephalopods, and zooplankton.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> is best {{recognized}} by its profile, the bottom being much more curved than the top. Also, the lateral line is arched near the head. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> are generally described as silver to golden colored, with golden yellow on the anal and caudal fins, which have 3 spines, 25-28 rays and 9 spines, 25-28 rays, respectively. There {{is an obvious}} black saddle-shaped blotch on the caudal peduncle and a similar patch {{near the edge of}} the opercle.|$|E
50|$|Atlantic tripletails are {{opportunistic}} eaters; {{they feed}} {{on a variety}} of foods, mostly small finfish such as gulf menhaden, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumpers,</b> and anchovies. They also feed on invertebrates such as blue crabs and brown shrimp, as well as other benthic crustaceans.|$|R
40|$|A general {{overview}} of the 1970 hurricane season in the North Atlantic is presented together with detailed accounts of all named tropical cyclones and certain subtropical or hybrid storms. 1. GENERAL SUMMARY The 1970 hurricane season, in some respects {{similar to that of}} 1968, produced very few named storms in the <b>Atlantic</b> but a <b>bumper</b> crop in the eastern Pacific. However, the opportunity for tropical storm development {{in terms of the number}} of seedling disturbances that crossed the tropical Atlantic differed little over the past 3 yr. In 1969, it will be rec,alled, there was an abundance of hurricanes in the Atlantic but fewer than normal in the eastern Pacific. Of the seven named Atlantic storms of 1970, only three reached hurricane intensity; and only Celia brough...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the western}} Atlantic, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> is found from Massachusetts, south to Florida. They {{are known to}} be found off Bermuda, in the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. Their range {{continues}} south to the coast of Uruguay. In the eastern Atlantic, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> are known from the coast of Mauritania to Angola. They are not found in the eastern Pacific because they replaced by another species, Chloroscombrus orqueta, or the Pacific bumper. However little is known about how these two species relate to each other, and they may represent only one species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> {{is found}} in {{subtropical}} waters up to 55 m in depth. They usually dwell near soft bottoms of the continental shelf, but have been observed schooling near the surface. While it is primarily a salt water fish, juveniles {{have been found in}} brackish estuaries.|$|E

Young spider crabs, Libinia ferreirae and Libinia spinosa, use {{the inside of}} the bell as a nursery where they are safe from predation.|$|E
40|$|We {{present data}} on ichthyoplankton distribution, abundance, and {{seasonality}} and supporting environmental information for four species of coastal pelagics {{from the family}} Carangidae: blue runner Caranx crysos, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> Chloroscombrus chrysurus, round scad Decapterus punctatus, and rough scad Trachurus lathami. Data are from 1982 and 1983 cruises off Louisiana sponsored by the Southeastern Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). Bioprofiles on reproductive biology, early life history, meristics, adult distribution, and fisheries characteristics are also presented for these species. Maximum abundances of larval blue runner, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper,</b> and round scad were found in July inside the 4 O-m isobath, although {{during the rest of}} the cruises these species were rarely found together. Larval <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> were captured in June and July only; blue runner in May, June, and July; and round scad in all seasons. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> larvae, concentrated mostly off western Louisiana, were by far the most abundant carangid in 1982 and 1983. Larval blue runner were the second most abundant summer-spawned carangid in 1982 and 1983, but their abundance and depth distribution varied considerably between years. Relative abundance of larval round scad off Louisiana was low, and they were captured only west of the Mississippi River delta, although they are reported to dominate carangid populations in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Rough scad were primarily winter/spring and outer-shelf (40 - 182 m) spawners. They ranked third in overall abundance, but were the most abundant target carangid on the outer shelf. Ecological parameters such as surface salinity, temperature, and station depth are presented from capture sites for recently hatched larvae < 2. 5 mm notochord length, except round scad) as well as for all sizes of fish below 14 mm standard length.

40|$|Extensive {{plankton}} collections {{were taken}} during seven September cruises (1990 – 93) along the {{inner continental shelf}} of the northcentral Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Despite the high productivity and availability of food during these cruises, significant small-scale spatial variability was found in larval growth rates for both <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> (Chloroscombrus chrysurus, Carangidae) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens, Lutjanidae). The observed variability in larval growth rates was not correlated with changes in water temperature or associated with conspicuous hydrographic features and suggested the existence of less-recognizable regions where conditions for growth vary. Cruise estimates of mortality coefficients (Z) for larval <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> (n= 32, 241 larvae from six cruises) and vermilion snapper (n= 2581 larvae from four cruises) ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 37 and 0. 19 to 0. 29, respectively. Even in a subtropical climate like the GOM, where larval-stage durations may be as short as two weeks, observed variability in growth rates, particularly when combined with small changes in mortality rates, can cause order-of-magnitude differences in cumulative larval survival. To what extent the observed differences in growth rates at small spatial scales are fine-scale “noise” that ultimately is smoothed by larger-scale processes is not known. Future {{research is needed to}} further characterize the small-scale variability in growth rates of larvae, particularly with regard to microzooplankton patchiness and the temporal and spatial pattern of potential predators. Small-scale spatial variability in larval growth rates may in fact be the norm, and understanding the implications of this subtle mosaic may help us to better evaluate our ability to partition the causes of recruitment variability...|$|E
40|$|Adjuevan, a {{traditional}} Ivorian naturally fermented fish prepared from the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>bumper</b> Chloroscombrus chrysurus, was assessed for its proximate and lactic acid microflora compositions {{in order to}} establish its nutritive and technological usefulness. Significant differences were observed between the fresh and the fermented fish for all the chemical substance analyzed except for the lipid content. Adjuevan contained between 69. 65 and 71. 25 % moisture, 12. 16 and 12. 36 % lipid, 21. 21 and 26. 81 % protein. The mean value for the ash, Ca, P, Na and K content of the adjuevan were 10. 5 %, 4. 16 mg/g, 3. 82 mg/g, 0. 72 mg/g and 0. 67 mg/g respectively. There {{were no significant differences between}} samples from the different processors. The genera and species of lactic acid bacteria isolated and identified from the fresh fish and the adjeuvan samples were Leuconostoc lactis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus sp., Streptococcus sp. The highest load was obtained with Lactobacillus fermentum, 9. 4 x 10 3 to 3. 7 x 10 4 cfu/g. The fermentation does not adversely affect the composition of Chloroscombrus chrysurus. Lactic acid bacteria found could participate in the technological processing and contribute to keeping the quality of the adjuevan...|$|E
