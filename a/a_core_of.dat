5|$|Holby City {{follows the}} {{professional}} and personal lives of medical and ancillary staff at Holby General. It features an ensemble cast of main and recurring characters. New main characters have been both written {{in and out of}} the series regularly since it started, the show contains <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> 10 to 20 main characters on the show at any given time.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Mitchell took {{a leading}} role in the Halo Trust (the {{hazardous}} areas life-support organization). This non-profit making organization undertook de-mining operations in former war zones. It employed <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> (mostly British and Commonwealth) de-mining experts and a large number of locally recruited and trained personnel. Most of the Halo personnel were former servicemen.|$|E
5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly Carboniferous {{limestone}} uplands in Britain. They are composed of three major anticlinal structures, each with <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. Sand, gravel and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
50|$|In most {{original}} CSAs, <b>a</b> <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members existed. This <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members {{helped to}} make decisions about and run the CSA including marketing, distribution, administrative, and community organization functions. CSAs with <b>a</b> <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members are most profitable and successful. However, in 1999, 72 percent of CSAs did not have <b>a</b> <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members. CSAs with <b>a</b> <b>core</b> group <b>of</b> members operate more successfully as a farmer-shareholder cooperative and CSAs without <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> <b>core</b> members rely much more on subscriptions and run most prominently as shareholder/subscriber CSAs.|$|R

5|$|Thyroid follicles {{are small}} spherical groupings of cells 0.02–0.9mm in {{diameter}} that play the main role in thyroid function. They {{consist of a}} rim that has a rich blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> colloid that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin, an iodinated glycoprotein.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{chemical}} compounds are known to exhibit one or several liquid crystalline phases. Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotics, bowlics and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a bowlic is not flat but like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object). This allows for two dimensional columnar ordering, for both discotics and bowlics. Rod-shaped molecules have an elongated, anisotropic geometry which allows for preferential alignment along one spatial direction.|$|E
5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, similar to one that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. <b>A</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5000|$|... mTOR {{links with}} other {{proteins}} {{and serves as}} <b>a</b> <b>core</b> component <b>of</b> two distinct protein complexes, mTOR complex 1 and mTOR complex 2, which regulate different cellular processes. In particular, as <b>a</b> <b>core</b> component <b>of</b> both complexes, mTOR functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility, cell survival, protein synthesis, autophagy, and transcription. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>core</b> component <b>of</b> mTORC2, mTOR also functions as a tyrosine protein kinase that promotes the activation of insulin receptors and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} receptors. mTORC2 has also been implicated in the control and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton.|$|R

5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> battle-hardened and elite veterans. In a strange {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust. Water, the most abundant volatile in the Solar System, comprises Triton's mantle, enveloping <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> rock and metal. There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day. The heat may even be sufficient to maintain a global subsurface ocean similar to what is hypothesized to exist beneath the surface of Europa. If liquid water is present in Triton, it has been speculated that this could make it habitable for some form of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} {{of the history of the}} Moberly-Jourdain {{adventure}} and the extensive public reaction to it, Terry Castle noted with skepticism the claim that a shared delusion may have arisen out of a lesbian folie à deux between the two women. Castle concludes that, when all proposed explanations have been considered, <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> mystery remains as much in relation to the psychological dynamics of the pair as to any aspects of the paranormal associated with their story.|$|E

5|$|Led by Kent Nilsson's 49-goal, 131-point season, the Flames {{qualified}} for the playoffs in their first season in Calgary with a 39–27–14 record, good for third in the Patrick Division. The team found much greater playoff success in Calgary {{than it did in}} Atlanta, winning their first two playoff series over the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers before bowing out to the Minnesota North Stars in the semi-finals. This early success was not soon repeated. After a losing record in 1981–82, Fletcher jettisoned several holdovers from the Atlanta days who could not adjust to the higher-pressure hockey environment and rebuilt the roster. Over the next three seasons, he put together <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> players that would remain together through the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E
5|$|The Devils {{assembled}} <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> {{players that}} included John MacLean, Bruce Driver, Ken Daneyko, Kirk Muller and Pat Verbeek, with Resch as their goaltender. Their record improved each season between 1983–84 and 1986–87. However, {{they were unable}} to reach the playoffs. Despite their improvement, the Devils remained last in the Patrick Division in 1985–86 and 1986–87. McMullen hired Providence College athletic director Lou Lamoriello as team president in April 1987. To gain greater control over franchise operations, Lamoriello appointed himself general manager before the 1987–88 season.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} of IK Pegasi B may be composed wholly of carbon and oxygen; alternatively, if its progenitor underwent carbon burning, {{it may have}} <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> oxygen and neon, surrounded by a mantle enriched with carbon and oxygen. In either case, the exterior of IK Pegasi B is covered by an atmosphere of almost pure hydrogen, which gives this star its stellar classification of DA. Due to higher atomic mass, any helium in the envelope will have sunk beneath the hydrogen layer. The entire mass of the star is supported by electron degeneracy pressure—a quantum mechanical effect that limits the amount of matter that can be squeezed into a given volume.|$|E
5|$|The museum aims to {{illustrate}} the history, geology and community of Axbridge {{and the surrounding area}} (the area of the old Axbridge Rural District, which included many neighbouring villages such as Cheddar, Wedmore, Mark and Winscombe). There is <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> long-term and permanent exhibits, reviewed regularly for possible changes, updates, and revised displays and information, and there is a programme of temporary exhibitions to reflect many aspects of local life and heritage.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of the wall, and the sandstone along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around <b>a</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> four infantry battalions. Three {{of these were}} drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E
