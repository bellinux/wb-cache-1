Here, the efficacy of <b>artificial</b> <b>seeds</b> as a mechanism to deliver bioactive compounds to larvae of the bruchid beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, was {{compared to that of}} black-eyed beans that had been imbibed with the same bioactive compounds: malachite green or the methanolic extract of neem (Azadirachta indica). Females laid an equivalent number of eggs on control <b>artificial</b> <b>seeds</b> in comparison with black-eyed beans, although egg-to-adult survival on <b>artificial</b> <b>seeds</b> was reduced.

40|$|A {{protocol}} for cauliflower micro-propagule production {{was developed and}} optimised for both micropropagation and <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> production techniques using meristematic tissues from cauliflower curd. All steps in the protocol were empirically optimised including: blending, sieving, culture methods, liquid culture media composition and plant growth regulator combinations and concentrations. The cost of the micro-propagules could be reduced {{by as much as}} 50 % on the initial costings reported previously since treatments doubled the number of microshoots produced per culture unit. The research confirmed the suitability of cauliflower microshoots to be encapsulated as artificial seeds and an effective {{protocol for}} microshoot encapsulation was designed through the optimization of 1) the production of cauliflower microshoots suitable for encapsulation, 2) encapsulation procedures, 3) <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> artificial endosperm structure, 4) conversion materials. The possibility of culturing cauliflower artificial seeds in commercial substrates such as perlite, sand, vermiculite and compost was confirmed. The use of plant preservative mixture (PPM) for the control of contamination in cauliflower culture media and artificial seeds was optimised and the effect of this material on the development of plant material was assessed. It was confirmed that cauliflower <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> could be stored in a domestic refrigerator for up to 6 months which could have a great impact in cauliflower breeding programmes. The huge number of cauliflower microshoots that could be produced using this protocol and the homogeneity of the culture system, provided a tool for the molecular analysis of cauliflower microshoots (and <b>artificial</b> <b>seed)</b> abiotic stress tolerance analysis. Various treatments were conducted to improve microshoot cold tolerance and the up-regulation of the CBF/DREB 1 transcription factor including low temperature acclimation, mannitol, ABA (abscisic acid) and Mo (molybdenum). Microshoots were confirmed to acclimate successfully using low temperature. Mo was shown to improve the cold tolerance of cauliflower microshoots and to up-regulate CBF/DREB 1 in the absence of low temperature acclimation. Acclimation did not increase the accumulation of dehydrin proteins and it is concluded that dehydrins do not {{play a significant role in}} the cold tolerance of cauliflower microshoots.

40|$|International audienceIn solitary parasitoids, {{only one}} adult can {{emerge from a}} given host. In some of these species, when several eggs are laid on the same host, {{supernumerary}} individuals are eliminated by lethal larval fights. In the solitary parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae, {{the probability of a}} second larva winning the fight depends on the time elapsed since the first oviposition. The older the first egg is at the moment a second egg is laid, the less chance the second egg has of winning the competition. As a consequence, females of this species lay their eggs preferentially on recently parasitized hosts rather than on hosts parasitized by an egg about to hatch. Anisopteromalus calandrae females parasitize bruchid larvae located in cowpea seeds. In a series of choice test experiments using an <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> system, we demonstrated that the cue that allows parasitoid females to differentiate between hosts parasitized for different lengths of time comes from the host and not from the <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> or the previously laid egg. This cue is perceived at short range, indicating that the chemicals involved are probably partly volatile. Interestingly, although parasitism stops host development, cuticular profiles continue to evolve, but in a different way from those of unparasitized hosts. This difference in the host's cuticular profile after parasitism, therefore, probably underlies the parasitoid female's discrimination...|$|E
40|$|Asiatic dayflower is a {{difficult}} weed to control with glyphosate, {{and has become a}} problem in glyphosate-tolerant soybean and corn for some Iowa farmers. Asiatic dayflower is an annual plant that is widely distributed in the temperate zones of the world. Also, this weed produces aerial dimorphic seeds, a common feature in other weeds belonging to the Commelinaceae. Asiatic dayflower dimorphic seeds can be described as truncated at one end and the other type described as being concave (i. e. non-truncated). Research investigating the biological and ecological characteristics that gives Asiatic dayflower an ecological advantage in glyphosate tolerant crops is lacking. Additionally, the tolerance mechanism of this weed to glyphosate is not fully understood. Therefore, this thesis is composed of three major experiments aiming to address ecology, biology and physiology characteristics that have allowed Asiatic dayflower to adapt to Iowa crop systems. The first experiment was designed to study emergence patterns and seedling emergence depths in two agronomic environments. In addition, seedling emergence depth was characterized by seed type in 2009 and 2010 to determine if dimorphic seeds represent an ecological advantage for Asiatic dayflower in different environments. Asiatic dayflower time of emergence varied by location and by year; emergence began early in May at Osceola and Vinton and continued until late July and early August at Osceola and Vinton fields, respectively. The number of Asiatic dayflower plants from truncated seeds exceeded those that emerged from non-truncated seeds. However, no differences were detected between seed types when seedling median depth of emergence was compared. Median depth of emergence ranged from 0. 4 to 0. 8 cm at the Osceola fields, and 2. 2 to 2. 4 cm at the Vinton field. A second experiment was established to study Asiatic dayflower emergence patterns using <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks. <b>Artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks provided edaphic conditions that were similar to those found in agricultural fields but with known seed bank characteristics. Asiatic dayflower seeds were collected from natural infestations in fields near Osceola and Vinton, IA and seed collections were separated according to dimorphic seed type (i. e. truncated and non-truncated). Two <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> bank experiments were established at the Agronomy Farm and Curtiss Farm near Ames, IA during the fall 2009 and repeated fall 2010. <b>Artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks consisted of PVC pipes buried in the ground, subsequently filled with soil mixed with a known quantity of Asiatic dayflower seeds; treatments consisted of seed origin and dimorphic type. After emergence, seedlings were counted and removed. During 2010, Asiatic dayflower seedlings started to emerge in early-May and emergence continued until mid-July at the Agronomy Farm, and from mid-April until mid-June at the Curtiss Farm. During 2011, seedling emergence started in April and continued until early-July and late-June at the Agronomy Farm and Curtiss Farm, respectively. Not all seeds in the <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks germinated. At both locations and in both years, total emerged seedlings from Osceola and Vinton truncated seeds planted in the <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> bank ranged from 35 to 65 % and from 44 to 65 %, respectively. However the total emerged seedlings from Osceola and Vinton non-truncated seeds ranged from 27 to 80 % and 39 to 62 %, respectively. Asiatic dayflower seedling emergence in <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks was likely affected by environmental conditions each year and the seed lot age used in the experiment. The third experiment addressed glyphosate uptake and translocation in Asiatic dayflower as a mechanism that may contribute to the tolerance observed in fields. Two experiments to investigate glyphosate uptake and translocation in Asiatic dayflower as well as the glyphosate rate response were conducted in the greenhouse. The first study characterized 14 C-glyphosate uptake and translocation while the second study addressed the response of Asiatic dayflower to glyphosate dose. It was found that 14 C-glyphosate uptake increased with time; glyphosate was primarily found in the treated leaf and translocated into the roots. At 2 and 48 hours after treatment, absorbed 14 C-glyphosate in the treated leaf was 10 and 25 % of the total 14 C-glyphosate applied, respectively. Absorption of 14 C-glyphosate in the roots at 2 and 48 hours after treatment was 2 and 9 % of the total 14 C-glyphosate applied, respectively. Only small amounts of 14 C-glyphosate were found in other plant parts (i. e. tissue above and below the treated leaf). Asiatic dayflower response to glyphosate doses was measured as plant growth relative to the untreated control. Asiatic dayflower growth varied across the repeated experiments. Asiatic dayflower growth exceeded that of the untreated control plants by 31 and 74 % in the first and second experiments, respectively, when glyphosate was applied at 0. 63 kg a. e. ha- 1. Conversely, growth relative to the untreated control plants in the third experiment was lower for plants treated with 0. 63 kg a. e. ha- 1 of glyphosate when compared to the untreated control plants. The Brain-Cousens model best described the data for experiments 1 and 2 because it accounts for the hormetic effect caused by sub-lethal doses; the log-logistic model best described the data for the third trial where no hormesis was detected. The base dose (i. e. 1. 26 kg a. e. ha- 1) and higher doses decreased Asiatic dayflower growth relative to the untreated control...|$|E

Therefore, the patterns of genetic diversity seen within C. catla may also reflect both inbreeding and genetic drift type events (Nei et al. 1975; Wishard et al. 1984).|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{ornamental}} value, some Melocactus species (Cactaceae) {{are threatened}} by several factors and only sexual propagation is possible. Thus, <b>artificial</b> <b>seed</b> banks are an appropriate method for their ex situ conservation. Suitable methods to germinate and to monitor viability are necessary for the seeds of these species. This work explored the use of tetrazolium test for monitoring seed viability of two Melocactus species. There was a correlation between the percentage of stained embryos, considering different cover area or tone stain, and the germination percentage. Unviable embryos did not stain. The embryos curved shape can explain the partial stain on the most of cases...|$|E
40|$|Gamete {{release is}} an {{essential}} event in <b>artificial</b> <b>seeding</b> of the economic brown seaweed, Hizikia fusiforme. Mass egg release occurred in the dark, with few eggs being discharged in the light. Release of eggs was elicited with eight practical salinity units (one PSU = 1 g sea salts l(- 1)) and was inhibited by salinity levels > 32 PSU. Egg release was optimal at 23 degrees C, and was decreased by 72 % in agitated seawater compared to unstirred seawater. Inhibitors of photosynthesis and ions channels suppressed egg release, indicating that this process was physiologically associated with photosynthetic activity and ion transport...|$|R
40|$|Occurrences and {{associations}} of ferro-manganese deposits at relatively shallow depths in the Hawaiian Archipelago were revealed {{by a series}} of cruises on the R/V Teritu. The deposits are accreting principally on the three prominent terrace levels around all of the Islands-at 400 to 800 meters, 1200 to 1600 meters, and 2400 meters as crusts and pavements. In some instances, examples of deposits at low depth demonstrate the rapid growth of ferro-manganese oxides and the importance of seed material for manganese coating to grow on <b>artificial</b> <b>seeds.</b> A large number of iron and steel samples encrusted with ferromanganese deposits have been collected by divers during the past year off Oahu beaches...|$|R
40|$|Microparticle image {{velocimetry}} (μPIV) is {{an evolving}} quantitative methodology to closely and accurately monitor the cardiac flow dynamics and mechanotransduction during vascular morphogenesis. While PIV technique {{has a long}} history, contemporary developments in advanced microscopy have significantly expanded its power. This chapter includes three new methods for μPIV acquisition in selected embryonic structures achieved through advanced optical imaging: (1) high-speed confocal scanning of transgenic zebrafish embryos, where the transgenic erythrocytes act as the tracing particles; (2) microinjection of <b>artificial</b> <b>seeding</b> particles in chick embryos visualized with stereomicroscopy; and (3) real-time, time-resolved optical coherence tomography acquisition of vitelline vessel flow profiles in chick embryos, tracking the erythrocytes...|$|R
