40|$|Advanced process <b>control</b> (<b>APC)</b> {{techniques}} {{become more}} and more important as short innovation cycles in microelectronics and a highly competitive market requires cost-effective solutions in semiconductor manufacturing. APC marks a paradigm shift from statistically based techniques (SPC) using monitor wafers for sampling measurement data towards product wafer <b>control.</b> The <b>APC</b> functionalities including run-to-run control, fault detection, and fault analysis allow to detect process drifts and excursions at an early stage and to minimize the number of misprocessed wafers. APC is being established as part of factory control systems through the definition of an APC framework. A precondition for APC is the availability of sensors and measurement methods providing the necessary wafer data. This paper discusses integrated metrology as an enabler for APC and demonstrates practical implementations in semiconductor manufacturing...|$|R

In addition, the analysis results show that the majority of the burden in AD and incineration is associated with the treatment of by-products, namely wastewater and methane purification for AD, and Air Pollution <b>Control</b> (<b>APC)</b> for incineration.|$|R
50|$|A {{big change}} for 1982 was the {{introduction}} of Saab's Automatic Performance <b>Control</b> (<b>APC),</b> a.k.a. boost controller. The APC employed a knock sensor, allowing the engine to use different grades of gasoline without engine damage. Another new feature that year was {{the introduction of}} central locking doors (on the GLE and Turbo). Asbestos-free brakes were introduced in 1983, an industry first. A new model also appeared that year in Sweden—the GLi, which used the fuel injected engine.|$|R

Modeling human {{exposures}} to air pollution <b>control</b> (<b>APC)</b> residues released from landfills in England and Wales. Environment International, 32, (4), 500 - 509. Keywords: Air pollution control residues; Risk; Air quality impact; Landfill; HealthHuman {{exposures to}} air pollution <b>control</b> (<b>APC)</b> residues released from 6 landfills were modeled and assessed. Following a qualitative risk characterisation, {{direct and indirect}} exposures were quantified. Site-specific air dispersion modeling was conducted for PM 10, PCDDs/PCDFs, Pb, Cd, As and CrVI concentrations at the closest residential points of exposure for 4 landfill sites accepting, in total, 75 % w/w of the APC residues disposed of in 2000 ? 2001 (UK). Inhalation risks, assessed by reference to air quality standards at residential exposure points, were assessed as insignificant. Preliminary modeling suggested that indirect exposures from PCDDs/PCDFs at the 95 th percentile level for the site where APC deposition rates were highest could potentially exceed the tolerable daily soil intake (TDSI) but this warrants further study given the model limitations. These results offer an initial screen {{of the significance of}} potential risks from APC disposal, which is of value in addressing concerns about the uncertainty of potential risks to human health from bulk APC disposal at strategic locations.

This prevents the driver from powering into the tunnel with the pantograph raised. After coasting to a stand the driver lowers the pantograph and changes over to DC. On journeys from Moorgate traction power is maintained into Drayton Park for the rising gradient, since if the driver forgets to change to AC no damage will occur to the train. Once the train is at a stand the driver selects AC traction and raises the pantograph.|$|R

30|$|The SRG can be {{controlled}} through various parameters, such as the turn-on angle, the turn-off angle, the maximum allowable current, {{as well as the}} supply voltage. Consequently, several methods including angle position <b>control</b> (<b>APC),</b> current chopping <b>control</b> (CCC), chopped voltage control, as well as intelligent algorithms can be used to control the SRG [21, 22, 23]. Nowadays, the SRG has been applied to wind power generation to reduce the system cost [24]. Different control methods of SRGs for variable-speed wind energy applications have been investigated in [25, 26, 27]. These application examples have suggested the possibility of using SRG in wave power generation systems. Of course, specific features of a wave energy converter should be fully considered in attempting this integration.|$|R
