500|$|Leto {{personally}} {{interviewed the}} band's fans, termed as the Echelon, who shared {{stories about the}} importance of music in their lives, some personal struggles and their own dreams. In an interview with MTV News, the frontman explained that he was inspired by the will to document the personal changes experienced by the band and its audience. [...] "Most of the interviews", Leto explained, [...] "I did myself, so they're really intimate. It's me, it's them, and it's the camera. What I've found is, that if you talk to everybody long enough, you find an incredible story. Every single person has a moment in their life, something that they've found a solution for, a story to tell. Some are funny, some are really intriguing, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> the right questions, you get interesting answers." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

One can study and mimic dance moves and wear fancy costumes, but the hardest thing to convey and the real trick is to do what Stefania does naturally. When we brought Strip Strip Hooray to Australia, she came backstage and everyone was tripping over themselves to know who she was... she's just got IT. She's like a cross between Marilyn Monroe and baby Brigitte Nielson, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me, she's a national treasure in Australia." ...|$|E
6000|$|Queen Sophie was {{averse to}} salute these creatures; but the Czarina Catherine making {{reprisals}} upon our Margravines, and the King looking painfully earnest in it, she prevailed upon herself.

[...] "Several of these creatures [PRESQUE TOUTES, says the exaggerative Princess] had, in their arms, a baby in rich dress; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked,</b> 'Is that yours, then?' they answered, making salaams in Russian style, 'The Czar did me the honor (m'a fait l'honneur de me faire cet enfant [...] )!'"-- ...|$|R

2500|$|Mikhail Shishkin has {{frequently}} praised Goldstein's work and cited {{him as an}} inspiration. In an English-language talk at the Harriman Institute of Columbia University, Shishkin said:For me now, the top of Russian literature is Alexander Goldstein.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Australian ABC radio, he said he turned from law to writing due to his love of reading: [...] "I loved reading, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me why I {{decided to become a}} writer, that's the answer right there, because I was a reader and I was just so enthralled and thrilled by the stuff that I'd read that I just thought; what could be better? How could you possibly better spend your time than trying to recreate that feeling for other people". In the same interview he said that his first writing was poetry.|$|R

5000|$|The {{poet and}} essayist Alexei Tsvetkov remembered him with these words:...he had very few {{friends in the}} {{commonly}} accepted {{sense of the word}} - that is, people who could climb into each other's skin.

Yet at the same time, as strange as it might seem, it was easier to talk with him than with many in this traditional [...] "subcutaneous" [...] category.Mikhail Shishkin has frequently praised Goldstein's work and cited him as an inspiration.

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> how it {{happened}} that Charles ever put faith in such a wretch, I shall {{tell you that it}} was because the good old emperor, with all his faults, was a divine man, and believed in others out of the excellence of his own heart and truth.

6000|$|... "It {{seems that}} after he had done his {{thinking}} he made that Bun Hin's fellow go down and explain to them {{the only way they}} could get their money back. He told me afterwards that, all the coolies having worked in the same place and for the same length of time, he reckoned he would be doing the fair thing by them as near as possible if he shared all the cash we had picked up equally among the lot. You couldn't tell one man's dollars from another's, he said, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> each man how much money he brought on board he was afraid they would lie, and he would find himself a long way short. I think he was right there. As to giving up the money to any Chinese official he could scare up in Fu-chau, he said he might just as well put the lot in his own pocket at once for all the good it would be to them.

60|$|If anyone ask {{how this}} extreme and unmistakable {{subordination}} of the employed to the employers is brought about, {{we all know}} the answer. It is brought about by hunger and hardness of heart, accelerated by a certain kind of legislation, of which we have had a good deal lately in England, but which was almost invariably borrowed from Prussia. Mr. Herbert Samuel's suggestion that the poor should be able to put their money in little boxes {{and not be able to}} get it out again is a sort of standing symbol of all the rest. I have forgotten how the poor were going to benefit eventually by what is for them indistinguishable from dropping sixpence down a drain. Perhaps they were going to get it back some day; perhaps when they could produce a hundred coupons out of the Daily Citizen; perhaps when they got their hair cut; perhaps when they consented to be inoculated, or trepanned, or circumcised, or something. Germany is full of this sort of legislation; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> an innocent German, who honestly believed in it, what it was, he would answer that it was for the protection of workmen.|$|R
