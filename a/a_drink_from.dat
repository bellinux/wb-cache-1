25|$|When rain {{falls on}} the sukkah, one is not {{required}} to stay inside. The Mishna in Sukkah 28b compares rain falling on a sukkah to a master who receives <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> his servant and then throws it back in the servant's face. The analogy is that through the rainfall, God is showing displeasure with the performance of the mitzvah by not allowing the Jews to fulfill their obligation of sitting in the sukkah.|$|E
25|$|The {{drinking}} straw is a tube used for transferring a liquid to the mouth, usually <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> one location to another. The first crude forms of {{drinking straw}}s {{were made of}} dry, hollow, rye grass. Marvin Stone is {{the inventor of the}} drinking straw. Stone, who worked in a factory that made paper cigarette holders, did not like this design because it made beverages taste like grass. As an alternative, on January 3, 1888, Stone got a piece of paper from his factory and wrapped it around a pencil. By coating it with wax, his drinking straw became leak-proof so that it would not get waterlogged.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the rains}} comes, and the villagers {{celebrate}} with ancient rituals and dances. During this time, Karega starts a correspondence with the lawyer {{that he met}} in Nairobi, wishing to educate himself further. To celebrate the rain's coming, Nyakinyua brews <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the Thang'eta plant, which all of the villagers drink. Karega tells the story the love between him and Mukami, the older sister of Munira. Mukami's father looked down on Karega because of his brother's involvement with the Mau Mau. Forced to separate, Mariamu and Karega do not see each other again, and Mukami later commits suicide by jumping into a quarry. This {{is the first time}} Munira hears the story. Later, an unknown plane crashes in the village; the only victim is Abdulla's donkey. Wanja notices that there are several large groups of people who come to survey the wreckage, and suggests to Abdulla that they begin to sell the Thang'eta drink in Abdulla's bar. The drink attracts notoriety, and many people come to the bar in order to sample it. Out of fury for Karega's connection to his family and jealousy of his relationship with Wanja, Munira schemes to have Karega fired from his teaching post with the school. Karega then leaves Ilmorog.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Jim, an expert chauffeur, is discharged from a garage, for insobriety. Penniless and being unable to obtain a new situation, he takes to the road, a common tramp. At one house where he applies for food, he is harshly refused, {{and is about to}} turn away and try his luck elsewhere, when little Marie, the daughter of the house, comes to his assistance and orders the butler to at once give him the food he requires. She also picks a rose for him from the garden. Jim strolls into a nearby park and sits on a bench to enjoy his lunch. He is about to take <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the ever-present flask, which he takes from his pocket, when the sight of the rose, which the sweet-faced little girl gave him, inspires him with a desire to reform. He throws the flask from him, and refreshed by the lunch, he starts out with a new ambition to face the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Travelers on the Suspension Bridge {{witnessed}} several death-defying stunts performed {{across the}} Niagara Gorge. [...] On June 30, 1859, they saw Charles Blondin's feat {{of becoming the}} first man to cross the chasm on a tightrope. [...] In mid-crossing Blondin sat down on the rope and lowered a line to retrieve <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> the deck of the Maid of the Mist below. [...] In his later tightrope acts at the same spot, the acrobat would perform a different stunt on each occasion. [...] One time he cooked and ate an omelette in mid-crossing; another time he carried his manager Harry Colcord on his back. [...] While giving Colcord a piggyback ride, Blondin stopped five times on the tightrope to rest and recover his strength; each time Colcord gingerly got off Blondin's back and stood on the tightrope, climbing back on after the acrobat had enough rest. [...] Blondin's success inspired other acrobats, such as William Leonard Hunt ("The Great Farini"), Samuel Dixon, Clifford Calverly, and Signorina Maria Spelterini, to emulate and try to surpass his acts at the same spot. [...] The Signorina, the only woman to walk across the Niagara on a tightrope, once crossed while blindfolded and another time with her hands and legs in manacles.|$|E
500|$|Las Meninas {{is set in}} Velázquez's {{studio in}} PhilipIV's Alcázar palace in Madrid. The high-ceilinged room is presented, {{in the words of}} Silvio Gaggi, as [...] "a simple box that could be divided into a {{perspective}} grid with a single vanishing point". In the centre of the foreground stands the Infanta Margaret Theresa(1). The five-year-old infanta, who later married Holy Roman Emperor LeopoldI, was at this point Philip and Mariana's only surviving child. She is attended by two ladies-in-waiting, or meninas: doña Isabel de Velasco(2), who is poised to curtsy to the princess, and doña María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor(3), who kneels before Margaret Theresa, offering her <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>from</b> a red cup, or bucaro, that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: the achondroplastic German, Maribarbola (4) (Maria Barbola), and the Italian, Nicolas Pertusato(5), who playfully tries to rouse a sleepy mastiff with his foot. The dog is thought to be descended from two mastiffs from Lyme Hall in Cheshire, given to Phillip III in 1604 by James I of England. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa(6), the princess' chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to an unidentified bodyguard (or guardadamas)(7).|$|E
