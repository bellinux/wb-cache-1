40|$|Not {{all true}} beliefs count as knowledge; warrant is the {{technical}} {{term for the}} (possibly logically complex) property that gives you knowledge when you add it to true belief. Warrant {{is not necessarily the}} same as justification, or any other epistemological property; all that this stipulative definition seems to entail about warrant is something akin to the following pair of biconditionals: (1) <b>A</b> true <b>belief</b> counts as <b>a</b> piece of knowledge iff it is warranted. <b>A</b> warranted <b>belief</b> counts as <b>a</b> piece of knowledge iff it is true. What exactly warrant turns out to be depends upon the substantive theory of knowledge we adopt. It may involve <b>a</b> <b>belief’s</b> being justified and having an absence of genuine defeaters for that <b>belief,</b> <b>a</b> <b>belief’s</b> being formed through a reliable process, <b>a</b> <b>belief’s</b> being formed through the virtuous traits of an agent’s cognitive character, or some such. Some epistemologists, however, have attempted to theorize about warrant by offering “nonpartisan ” arguments, or in other words, arguments that do not depend upon any substantive theory of knowledge. For example, Merricks (1995, 1997) argues fo...|$|R

This study tested a core REBT hypothesis in an experimental design using multiple physiological as well as psychological measures. Ninety patients from a medical practice were placed in a real-life stressful situation while holding either a rational, an irrational, or <b>an</b> indifference <b>belief.</b> Those holding <b>a</b> rational <b>belief</b> reported the greatest increase in concern whereas those holding <b>an</b> irrational <b>belief</b> reported the greatest increase in anxiety. Of particular significance, those holding <b>a</b> rational <b>belief</b> showed <b>a</b> decrease in systolic blood pressure whereas those holding <b>an</b> irrational <b>belief</b> showed <b>an</b> increase (diastolic blood pressure increased in both conditions).
