Tekle Hawariat then moved to Aden, where in September 1937 he petitioned the colonial government in Kenya to resettle there.

According to Bahru Zewde, Haile Selassie's victorious return to Ethiopia found his one-time ambassador in Madagascar where he prolonged his exile until 1955/56, and upon returning to Ethiopia Tekle Hawariat [...] "retired to the obscurity of a gentleman-farmer's life in Hirna, Hararge."

40|$|This article clarifies {{the land}} status of {{agricultural}} concessions of the Mont-Ngafula council in Kinshasa. This council is particular {{given that it}} has a hybrid land status which is both urban and rural. This therefore entails the application of the two land tenure systems depending on whether the area concerned is urban or rural. The results of this analysis highlights that since the enactment of the 1973 Land Act, access to agricultural land in this region rarely comply with legal procedure; most land occupants rather transact with various individuals who have customary rights over lands (traditional chiefs and customary landowners) instead meeting the competent services. As a matter of fact, from a legal standpoint, most of the occupants simply limit themselves to awarding a provisional occupancy contract, which is just a preparatory step to <b>agricultural</b> <b>concession,</b> the issuance of which appears to be less strenuous as per common practice in the constituency. The fact that land owners limit themselves at the stage of the provisional contract, usually far beyond the officially prescribed deadline, without even launching the application for the concession contract justifies the lack and poor level of development of occupied lands. Meanwhile, the value of these lands increases. The great trust gained by owners from the land administration (through the holding of provisional occupancy contract) and the payment of customary rights enables him/her to keep the funds in serenity and to receive yearly appreciation without an actual agricultural production. Thus, lands status obtained {{on the basis of this}} double recognition ensures an apparent land tenure security but does not promote agricultural production. In addition, the Land Act does not include any incentive instruments in this domain, and closer still, mechanisms set out in the law pertaining to the fundamental principles relating to agriculture are not at the verge of being instituted soon, much less the land reform policy initiated by the Congolese Government these past years.

40|$|This paper studies if {{intensity}} and recentness of wartime violence {{is related to}} the trajectory of postconflict agricultural development. We consider the case of Mozambique, where the government has made <b>agricultural</b> <b>concessions</b> to corporations, as well as land grants to communities. These uses may stand in competition with one another, and we test if violence affects the awarding of concessions or land grants. We analyze district-level, GIS-generated data on concessions, grants, and civil war events. We find wartime violence intensity is associated with more concessions and fewer grants. We conversely find recentness of violence is associated with fewer concessions and more grants. Embedding our empirical analysis in a community resilience framework, we suggest the intensity of wartime violence may erode local institutions – be they traditional governance structures, or agricultural cooperatives seeking community lands – or limit their access to government bodies and local NGOs tasked with vetting, delimiting, and monitoring proposed concessions. Paradoxically, recentness violence may mobilize those same institutions...|$|R

In response, local groups have sought community land grants to protect livelihoods. We seek to understand whether the magnitude and recentness of violent events during Mozambique's 16 -year civil war determined the success of communities' efforts to secure lands. We hypothesize that violence weakens the ability of communities to protect their traditional land uses from concessions by lobbying for community land grants. This hypothesis - dubbed the "weak institutions hypothesis” - is contrasted with the idea that violence galvanizes political participation. We test the hypothesis using GIS-generated data at the district level on recognized community landholdings and civil war events. Controlling for factors such as market access, road distance to grain warehouses, and spatial auto-correlation, we find that more intense violence is possibly (but not significantly) associated with more land grants, and that districts experiencing more recent violence are actually more likely to lobby successfully for land grants - lending support to the idea that violence boosts community use of riskpooling institution...|$|R

The EU Council called for 'the establishment of a multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications for wines and spirits and additional protection for other products. Comment: The outcome of the June 26 th EU Agricultural Council meeting on the reform of the CAP will place a number of constraints on the Commission's room for manoeuvre on agricultural issues at the Cancun WTO Ministerial. The partial nature of the decoupling which has occurred {{as a result of the}} June 26 th EU Council agreement means that in the coming years a higher level of EU agricultural aid will remain coupled to production and subject to WTO disciplines than the Commission initially hoped. This means that the EU will have less flexibility in agreeing to reductions in domestic support than the Commission expected. The reduction of the extent of modulation will reduce the financial leeway the EU has to pursue further sectoral reforms (particularly in the sugar sector) and this will harm its ability to reduce export refunds in a multilateral framework. Similarly the failure to cut cereal prices by 5 % will reduce the ability of the EU to accept cuts in allowed export-refund expenditures. Agreement on dairy-sector reform will, however, provide the Commission with some scope for negotiations. In {{the conclusions of}} the EU Council on the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{forest cover}} {{dynamics}} {{is important for}} a nation’s environmental, social and political commitments. In the past decade, Myanmar had the highest deforestation rate, in mainland South East Asia (Hansen et al., 2013). Further, in 2009, Myanmar embarked on a landmark political change from military regime to democratic transition which significantly impacted its forest cover. Myanmar also ranks first with respect to forest fires in South/Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, forest cover loss and fire are intrinsically linked through the traditional taungya system of slash and burn. Thus, quantifying factors controlling forest fires in Myanmar is an important topic that needs attention. Although the Myanmar government established protected areas throughout the country to conserve forests, their effectiveness remains unevaluated. This dissertation aims to understand {{the current status of}} forest cover dynamics in Myanmar. The five chapters in this dissertation address the impact of the political transition on forest cover loss and fragmentation, fire disturbance in tropical evergreen and deciduous forests including the factors controlling vegetation fires in the protected and non-protected forests. The dissertation contributes to the existing knowledge in land cover and land use change science (LCLUC), ii especially the impact of institutional changes on forest cover in the tropics. The analysis of the relationship between forest loss, fire and effectiveness of the protected areas addressed in the study, contributes to regional knowledge on fire and conservation science respectively. The findings of this dissertation depict that in Myanmar, the political transition to democracy significantly influenced its forest cover. Our analysis showed that during 2001 - 2014, a total loss of 2, 030, 101 ha of forest occurred at the rate of 145, 007. 21 ha/year with a linear increase of 15, 359 (± 1793) ha/year. The observed increase in variance in between 2008 - 2011 coincides with political transition period which started with the formation of the new Constitution in 2008 and ended with the military government handing over power to the democratic government in 2011. Analysis of trend and variance patterns of two landscape fragmentation metrics (Number of Patches and Mean Patch Area) at the provincial level show the influence of the political transition on landscape fragmentation. The impact of political transition was more pronounced in provinces associated with plantations and urban areas. Among the rubber producing States, the border States, Shan, Kayah, and Kayin were more impacted compared to inland Mon. Tanintharyi and Bago Regions showed higher variance in residuals of both metrics before the transition occurred due to the military government supported oil palm and teak plantations. Fragmentation and the variance in fragmentation metrics in Kachin increased post 2008. Apart from plantation areas, urban areas like Yangon and Mandalay showed high fragmentation post 2009 period after the new government was formed. We attribute the forest loss and fragmentation to the economic and structural reforms of the democratic government, specifically to the increased granting of <b>agricultural</b> <b>concessions</b> and logging for plantations. iii A study of the fire regime from 2003 to 2012 using MODIS satellite data suggested March as the peak of the fire season with 12900 km 2 of Burned Area (BA) and 95000 fire counts. Forests accounted for majority (41. 3 %) of the total BA and most fires (89. 7 %) resulted in medium or high vegetation disturbance. A higher negative correlation between BA and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) was reported for deciduous forests than for evergreen forests (r= 0. 49 vs r = 0. 36, p ~ 0). A maximum decrease in 29 % of original GPP (2007 - 2012) was observed in the evergreen forest patches. The scale-dependent correlation analysis suggested significant BA-GPP correlation at 1 × 1 degree, as compared to finer resolutions. These results highlight the significance of fires impacting carbon cycle. An in-depth analysis of fire causative factors in Myanmar was studied. The mean fire density in non-protected areas was found to be two times more than in protected areas. Fire-land cover partition analysis suggested dominant fire occurrences in the savannas (protected areas) and woody savannas (non-protected areas). The five major fire causative factors in protected areas in descending order were found to be population density, land cover, tree cover percent, travel time from nearest city and temperature. The causative factors in non-protected areas were population density, tree cover percent, travel time from nearest city, temperature and elevation. The fire susceptibility analysis showed distinct spatial patterns with central Myanmar as a hot spot region of vegetation fires. Results from propensity score matching suggested that forests within protected areas have 11 % less fires than non-protected areas. These findings provide information to policy makers about the current forest loss, forest fragmentation and forest fire hotspots, status of forest conservation and can be used to inform, update or evaluate policies. These findings are timely and can guide policy makers to arrive at best management strategies as the new government is formulating policies and laws and amending old ones to aid forest conservation...|$|R
