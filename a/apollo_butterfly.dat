25|$|The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{has many}} {{subspecies}} around the world, and some European subspecies are showing an alarming decline in numbers. This is {{mainly caused by}} habitat destruction, air pollution affecting the insect's food plants, and butterfly collectors. The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> is also more vulnerable to predators as it spends two years as a caterpillar.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} of {{interest}} to entomologists due to the variety of subspecies, often only restricted to a specific valley in the Alps. The beautiful <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> has long been prized by collectors, who aim to possess {{as many of the}} variants as possible. While over-collecting is believed to have caused populations to decline in some areas, such as in Spain and Italy, habitat change is thought to be a far more significant threat to this species' survival. Plantations of conifers, the succession of suitable habitat to scrubland, agriculture, and urbanization have all reduced the habitat of the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly.</b> Climate change and acid rain have also been implicated in this species decline in Fennoscandia. In addition, motor vehicles have been cited as a cause of <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> mortalities; vehicles on a motorway system near Bolzano in South Tyrol, Italy, are said to have nearly wiped out a race of the Apollo.|$|E
25|$|However, {{these laws}} {{focus on the}} {{protection}} of individuals, rather than their habitat, and so may do little to mitigate the greatest threat that populations face. Fortunately, {{there are a number}} of projects specifically working to save this vulnerable insect. A conservation programme in Pieniny National Park saved a subspecies of the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> that had declined to just 20 individuals in the early 1990s, through a combination of captive breeding and habitat protection. In south-west Germany, conservationists are working with shepherds to ensure favourable conditions for the butterflies, which share their grassland habitat with sheep. For example, grazing periods have been shifted to avoid the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> larvae stage, which is vulnerable to being trampled.|$|E
50|$|Bhutanitis ludlowi, the Ludlow's Bhutan swallowtail, is {{a species}} of {{butterfly}} in the family Papilionidae, endemic to Bhutan and recently recorded in India. It belongs to the subfamily Parnassiinae subfamily which also contains the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterflies.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Apollo or {{mountain}} Apollo (Parnassius <b>apollo),</b> is a <b>butterfly</b> of the Papilionidae family.|$|R
25|$|This {{species has}} a single brood. Adult <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterflies</b> are seen on the wing from May to September, feeding on nectar {{produced}} by flowers. During mating males deposit on the female's abdomen a gelatinous secretion called sphragis, that prevents the female mating a second time. The females lay eggs, which over-winter and hatch in spring the following year. The Apollo caterpillar a velvety blue black with small orange spots. These caterpillars feed on stonecrop (Sedum species, mainly Sedum telephium, Sedum album, Sedum rupestre and Sedum ropsea), Hylotelephium caucasicum and houseleek (Sempervivum species). When the caterpillar is fully grown it will pupate on the ground, forming a loose cocoon from which the adult butterfly emerges following metamorphosis.|$|R
25|$|Laws {{exist to}} protect the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> in many countries. The Apollo is on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, in Appendix II in CITES, and is {{mentioned}} in annex IV of Habitats Directive. It is protected in other states: the Principality of Liechtenstein, Czech Republic (as critically threatened species in Czech code, Decree for implementation, No. 395/1992 Sb., and No. 175/2006 Sb.), Turkey and Poland.|$|E
25|$|The drastic {{climate change}} of the Pleistocene era forced a {{separation}} of the red <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> population. This in turn {{played a role in}} creating the distinct colour changes seen in the species. The Parnassius apollo became divided and isolated in the Eurasian region during the glacial period. The large glaciers created a physical barrier between the population, barring interaction between the groups. Still within these isolated populations the butterflies migrated westward into portions of southern Europe where they settled and reproduced. Within all of these particular isolated populations there is also variation in the wing colour allele.|$|E
2500|$|Parnassius apollo has a {{wingspan}} of [...] in males, of [...] in females. The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> shows a {{great deal}} of individual variation in the appearance, with an evident colour polymorphism. [...] These very very large, beautiful and conspicuous white butterflies are decorated with five large black eyespots on the forewing and two bright red or sometimes orange eyespots on the hindwing. These striking red eyespots can vary in size and form depending on the location of the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly,</b> and the bright red colour often fades in the sun, causing the eyespots of older individuals to appear more orange. The wings are shiny, with slightly transparent edges, and some individuals are darker (sphragismelanistic); a general phenomenon common in many butterflies. The caterpillars of this species are velvety black with orange-red spots along the sides.|$|E
5000|$|The Parnassiinae or snow Apollos are a {{subfamily}} of the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae. The subfamily includes about 50 medium-sized, {{white or}} yellow species. [...] The snow <b>Apollos</b> are high-altitude <b>butterflies</b> and are distributed across Asia, Europe and North America.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Apollo</b> jewel <b>{{butterfly}}</b> (Hypochrysops <b>apollo</b> apollo) lays its eggs on the plant, {{and because}} they smell like ant's eggs, the ants carry the eggs inside the plant, where they develop to the butterfly stage. Hypochrysops is a genus of [...] "blues", butterflies in the family Lycaenidae, which is notorious for its myrmecophily. Accordingly, {{it is likely that}} the larvae that hatch from the eggs feed either on food begged from the ants, or on ant larvae, or possibly both. In either event, the butterfly finally emerges and flies off.|$|R
50|$|Parnassius phoebus, {{known as}} the Phoebus Apollo or small <b>Apollo,</b> is a <b>butterfly</b> species {{of the family of}} {{swallowtail}} butterflies (Papilionidae) found in Eurasia and North America.P. phoebus is found in the Alps, Urals, Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Alaska and Canada south through the United States to Utah and New Mexico.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{shares a}} variety of {{defensive}} strategies with quite a few species of butterflies. [...] Even from a young age larva exhibit camouflage by being entirely black. [...] This solid colour helps them avoid detection even at a close distance. [...] However, as they mature, they lose this advantage by developing two rows of orange dots. [...] These dots greatly decrease the amount of crypsis. In addition to this larval camouflage, the larva also shares in a form of Müllerian mimicry with a type of millipede, Glomeris (Glomeris guttata). [...] Both insects share the characteristic orange spots and black body and a common habitat. The millipedes and caterpillars secrete a foul smelling odour to repel predators.|$|E
2500|$|Another form of defence is {{the taste}} of the butterfly. [...] Similar to the monarch butterfly, the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> {{produces}} a repulsive taste to its predator. [...] The butterfly seems to get this foul taste from its plant host, the Sedum stenopetalum. [...] There is a bitter tasting cyanoglucoside, sarmentonsin, which is found in both the butterfly and the plant. [...] There is a much higher concentration of sarmentonsin in the wings as opposed {{to the rest of the}} body. The high concentration in the wings indicates that the wings of the butterfly would taste much worse comparatively. [...] A common predator, nesting water pipits, have evolved a strategy to avoid the poor taste of the butterfly; the bird will remove the wings before consuming the body. In theory, this will get rid of the poor tasting elements of the butterfly, leaving only the nutritious body.|$|E

5000|$|This {{might be}} so, but raises some {{questions}} because most Lycaenidae have parasitic or mutualistic, often highly specific, relationships with various species of ants, and ants {{have been reported}} to carry the eggs of the <b>Apollo</b> jewel <b>butterfly</b> (Hypochrysops <b>apollo</b> apollo) into their colonies inside ant plants of the genus Myrmecodia. Myrmecodia species have certain superficial resemblances to [...] "mistletoes", but are epiphytic, not markedly parasitic, and are not in any parasitic plant family; they are in fact in the coffee family, Rubiaceae. It seems likely that Hypochrysops apollo apollo at least, might feed exclusively on ant food and ant larvae.|$|R
60|$|In birds {{there are}} {{a large number of}} {{peculiar}} genera of which we need mention {{only a few of the}} more important, as the grass-hopper warblers (Locustella) with seven species, the Accentors with twelve species, and about a dozen other genera of warblers, including the robins; the bearded titmouse and several allied genera; the long-tailed titmice forming the genus Acredula; the magpies, choughs, and nut-crackers; a host of finches, among which the bullfinches (Pyrrhula) and the buntings (Emberiza) are the {42} most important. The true pheasants (Phasianus) are wholly Palæarctic, except one species in Formosa, as are several genera of wading birds. Though the reptiles of cold countries are few as compared with those of the tropics, the Palæarctic region in its warmer portions has a considerable number, and among these are many which are peculiar to it. Such are four genera of snakes, seven of lizards, five of frogs and toads, and twelve of newts and salamanders; while of fresh-water fishes {{there are a}}bout twenty peculiar genera.[7] Among insects we may mention the elegant <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterflies</b> of the Alps as forming a peculiar genus (Parnassius), only found elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains of North America, while the beautiful genus Thais of the south of Europe and Sericinus of North China are equally remarkable. Among other insects we can only now refer to the great family of Carabidæ, or predaceous ground-beetles, which are immensely numerous in this region, there being about fifty peculiar genera; while the large and handsome genus Carabus, with its allies Procerus and Procrustes, containing nearly 300 species, is almost wholly confined to this region, and would alone serve to distinguish it zoologically from all other parts of the globe.|$|R

50|$|The Three Crowns was {{originally}} called simply Pieniny. In 1834 (during {{the reign of}} Austria-Hungary) a German name Kronenberg appeared in documents (translated into Polish as the Crown). The current name took hold at around 1860. The Three Crowns massif contains at least 7 species of rare plants which cannot be found anywhere else in Pieniny, including the endemic species of Pieniny dandelion (unfortunately, already extinct), and Złocień Zawadzkiego. Besides them, there are numerous and rare lime-loving species of rock plants including Rozchodnik wielki - a host for a caterpillar of rare Pieniny <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Parnassius <b>apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> is {{classified}} as a threatened species, having many disjointed populations in Western Palaearctic region. The population in the Mosel Valley of Germany has been genetically characterized, and has shown to have six long-term monomorphic microsatellites. Six microsatellites were examined looking at the current population in 2008 as well as museum samples from 1895 to 1989.

50|$|The {{terraces}} are, {{in addition}} to their agricultural engineering significance, examples of great cultural historical value, their organisation and often masterful architecture witnessing {{as far back as the}} Middle Ages. The small scale structure of the plots forms protective barriers against plant disease and provides habitats for a variety of warmth-loving flora and fauna. The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly,</b> the green lizard, the wallflower and rock bunting are only the best known representatives of the ecosystem of the Terraced Moselle that have been recorded in the case studies of small animals and plants of the region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{environment}} of Andorra was once heavily forested. One {{explanation for the}} name of the country is that it came from the Moorish word aldarra, meaning place thick with trees. Andorra’s mountainous environment attracts 12 million tourists each year. In recent decades, however, the forested area has been decreasing steadily. Overgrazing of mountain meadows by sheep, with consequent soil erosion, is another environmental problem. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), threatened species included 1 type of mammal: the common otter. The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> and the lesser horseshoe bat are vulnerable species.|$|E
50|$|Geographical {{isolation}} {{causes a}} divergence {{of a species}} into different morphs. A good example is the Indian white admiral Limenitis procris, which has five forms, each geographically separated from the other by large mountain ranges. An even more dramatic showcase of geographical polymorphism is the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Parnassius apollo). Because the Apollos live in small local populations, thus having no contact with each other, coupled with their strong stenotopic nature and weak migration ability, interbreeding between populations of one species practically does not occur; by this, they form over 600 different morphs, {{with the size of}} spots on the wings of which varies greatly.|$|E

50|$|The park {{contains}} one of {{the most}} biologically diverse areas of Europe. The climate is between that of the Mediterranean and that of the rest of continental Europe. The park contains more than two thousand plant species, some of which are found exclusively in this area, such as the Abruzzo Edelweiss. Many species of wildlife inhabit the park, including rare animals such as the Abruzzo chamois, as well as wolves, Marsican brown bear, roe deer, wildcats, wild boars, foxes and squirrels. Notable birds include the golden eagle, the white-backed woodpecker, the goshawk, the common buzzard and the peregrine falcon.

With the larger separated populations of butterflies these habitats are used to sustain populations with larger amount of resources. These larger populations are called metapopulations and with the smaller separated sub-populations they create a mainland-island system. The Parnassius apollo can migrate from habitats and thus create a variation seen in each isolated population.|$|E
40|$|The {{eye of the}} Glacial <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Parnassius glacialis, a ‘living fossil’ {{species of}} the family Papilionidae, {{contains}} three types of spectrally heterogeneous ommatidia. Electron microscopy reveals that the Apollo rhabdom is tiered. The distal tier is composed exclusively of photoreceptors expressing opsins of ultraviolet or blue-absorbing visual pigments, and the proximal tier consists of photoreceptors expressing opsins of green or red-absorbing visual pigments. This organization is unique because the distal tier of other known butterflies contains two green-sensitive photoreceptors, which probably function in improving spatial and/or motion vision. Interspecific comparison suggests that the Apollo rhabdom retains an ancestral tiered pattern with some modification to enhance its colour vision towards the long-wavelength region of the spectrum...|$|E
40|$|Population {{persistence}} {{depends in}} many cases on gene flow between local populations. Parnassius apollo nevadensis is an endemic subspecies of <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> in the Sierra Nevada (southern Spain), whose populations are distributed in discrete patches at altitudes between 1850 and 2700 m. In this paper, we use 13 microsatellite loci to examine the genetic structure of this P. apollo subspecies. We revealed both a strong pattern of isolation by distance (which was stronger when calculated with realistic travel distances that accounted for topography) and source–sink dynamics. The observed population genetic structure is consistent with strongly asymmetrical gene flow, leading to constant directional migration and differential connectivity among the populations. The apparently contradictory results from the clustering algorithms (Structure and Geneland) are also consistent with a recent (< 100 ya) reduction in the distribution range. The results point to global warming as a possible cause of this reduction, as in other populations of this species. We identify some natural and anthropogenic barriers to gene flow {{that may be the}} cause of the recent population structure and source–sink dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Variation {{partitioning}} and hierarchical partitioning are novel statistical {{approaches that}} provide {{deeper understanding of}} the importance of different explanatory variables for biodiversity patterns than traditional regression methods. Using these methods, the variation in occupancy and abundance of the clouded <b>apollo</b> <b>butterfly</b> (Parnassius mnemosyne L.) was decomposed into independent and joint effects of larval and adult food resources, microclimate and habitat quantity. The independent effect of habitat quantity variables (habitat area and connectivity) captured the largest fraction of the variation in the clouded apollo patterns, but habitat connectivity had a major contribution only for occupancy data. The independent effects of resources and microclimate were higher on butterfly abundance than on occupancy. However, a considerable amount of variation in the butterfly patterns was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of variables. Abundance of the butterfly in the surroundings of the focal grid cell had a significant effect in all analyses, independently of the effects of other predictors. Our results encourage wider applications of partitioning methods in biodiversity studies...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly,</b> Parnassius apollo, is {{categorized}} as Near Threatened (NT) in IUCN Red List. Today in Sweden {{it is found}} only in strongly fragmentized populations. In the county of Stockholm, P. apollo exists exclusively in some islands of the archipelago and with one mainland population in Stora Vika. This study has the purpose of expanding {{the knowledge of the}} local conditions for the butterfly in the south parts of the county of Stockholm and thereby contributes to a sustainable land management that can preserve the <b>Apollo</b> <b>butterfly.</b> A comparative study was done between areas where the butterfly today have: a stable population (Stora Vika, Utö and Ålö), has disappeared (Muskö and Yxlö) or is strongly declining (north part of Ornö). The investigation was based on factors that was considered be contributing to the species decline. Factors that was investigated was the general distribution of host-plant S. telephium, overgrowth in rocky outcrops, presence of nectar plants close to host-plants and if a large proportion of forest in the surroundings of the investigation sites could have a isolating impact on sites. The study was based on 10 sites where the butterfly exist, 7 sites where it has disappeared and 3 sites where it has declined. No significant differences could be found for any factor. On the contrary, the general presence of host-plants at rocky outcrops seems to be the same in areas where the butterfly has disappeared as in areas where it exist today. However caterpillars were only found at sites with a wide distribution of host-plants and also at sites with a large proportion of forest in the surroundings. This was speaking against the hypothesis that a large proportion of forest could have an isolating effect on sites and therefore a negative impact on the adult butterfly preferences. The result creates new questions and the conclusion is that more knowledge of the local conditions is needed to ensure good practice in land management. Sites which are today hosted by the caterpillar should be identified, investigated and protected. Furthermore should the dispersal of nectar plants be investigated and {{it would be interesting to}} study the effects of limestone by analyzing and compare Cd concentrations in S. telephium from Muskö with plants from Stora Vika, Utö and Ålö...|$|E
