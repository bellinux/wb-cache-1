Seventy-seven accounting recruiters, 78 faculty <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> 101 honours students were surveyed on the perceived benefits of accounting honours programmes.

Significant differences were found between <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> honours students on five of the seven common statements.

40|$|Critical {{questions}} in educational psychology research {{to be addressed}} in this paper concern the casual relationship between academic self-concept, <b>academic</b> motivation <b>and</b> its effect on academic achievement. Do changes in <b>academic</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> motivation lead to changes in subsequent academic achievement? Various studies have attempted to answer this question by examining the causal relations between <b>academic</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement as well as <b>academic</b> motivation <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. Less integral to research however has been the investigation of the relationship between both <b>academic</b> self-concept <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> motivation <b>and</b> their combined effects on academic achievement. For this reason, this paper aims to elucidate further the relationships among self-concept, motivation <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement by proposing a longitudinal design by which self-concept and motivation are measured from a multidimensional perspective. The theoretical and practical implications of this important question will be discussed. Self-concept, academic motivation, causal ordering, academic achievemen...|$|R

40|$|This year {{marks the}} {{midpoint}} of the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development but sustainability still remains a foreign concept in the New Zealand vocational and trade education curriculum. Thus research was conducted to gauge the existing perceptions of <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> industry and discover the reasons for the slow embedding of sustainability concepts in the curriculum. The research followed a qualitative research methodology using a case study as the method of inquiry which collected data through 8 in-depth interviews conducted with <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> industry personnel at a New Zealand vocational institute. The research found that there was no collaboration between <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> industry when it came to education for sustainability (EfS) with neither group taking responsibility for embedding the concepts into the curriculum. The overall awareness level on sustainability was very low between the two researched groups. <b>Academics</b> <b>and</b> Industry personnel alike saw no relevance of sustainability in vocational trade education. The slow progress of embedding sustainability concepts into the vocational education curriculum could be a result of this lack of collaboration between these two groups thus it is recommended that a professional development course be designed for vocational <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> industry personnel to increase awareness on sustainability concepts...|$|R
