Beyond running the school during the day his training continues on CMLL's shows where he uses his rudo role to help younger, inexperienced or lower ranked wrestlers gain more in ring experience and further their training. Some of the wrestlers he has a significant hand in training includes Mini-Estrellas <b>Acero,</b> Aéreo, Mercurio and Pentagoncito, female wrestlers Goya Kong, Lady Afrodita and Skadi. He also helped train several of the male wrestlers currently working for CMLL include Akuma, Blue Panther Jr., El Cuatrero, Disturbio, Flyer, Gran Guerrero, The Panther, Pólvora, Puma, Sanson, Soberano Jr., Star Jr. and Tiger.|$|E

25|$|Érik Morales {{was born}} in the Zona Norte section of Tijuana. Under the tutelage of his father, José Morales, a fighter himself, Érik started boxing at the age of 5 and amassed a very {{impressive}} amateur career that saw him fight 114 times (108–6) and win 11 major titles in Mexico. Morales made his professional debut at the age of 16, by knocking out Jose Orejel in two rounds. Between 1993 and 1997, he quickly climbed the ranks in the super bantamweight division, winning 26 fights, 20 by knockout, including wins against former champions Kenny Mitchell and Hector <b>Acero</b> Sánchez, before challenging for his first world title. It was during this time that he signed with promoter Bob Arum.|$|E

40|$|A {{re-examination}} of the holotype and mtDNA barcoding confirms Garzon-Ferreira and <b>Acero’s</b> {{separation of}} Coryphopterus tortugae from C. glaucofraenum. However, specimens matching the markings of their Santa Marta variant of C. tortugae comprise a distinct clade about 10 % sequence divergent from true C. tortugae and C. glaucofraenum. The variant is described {{here as a}} new species, the sand-canyon goby Coryphopterus bol, from specimens collected in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and the Atlantic coast of Panama. The new species is abundant and widespread {{in the region and}} has not been recognized as distinct from the bridled goby, C. glaucofraenum. C. bol can be distinguished from C. tortugae by markings: a dark oval spot on the lower third of the pectoral-fin base, a chain-link pattern of melanophores {{on the top of the}} head, and a thick C-shaped basicaudal mark and scale-edges outlined in lines of tiny melanophores on well-marked individuals. Putative bridled gobies from three different reef types were sampled: a wide and clearly-zoned shelf in the Greater Antilles (off La Parguera, Puerto Rico), a narrower mixed-zone island of the Lesser Antilles (St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands), and narrow fringing continental reefs in the Southern Caribbean (the Atlantic coast of Panama near Portobelo). In all three locations, C. bol was found in deeper and more offshore reef areas with strong currents, i. e. in the channels of the buttress-canyon zone just inshore of the drop-off in Puerto Rico, around exposed rocky points in St. Thomas, and on wave-swept reefs just offshore of the sediment-influenced coastline in Panama...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the high}} demand of Kenner's The Six Million Dollar Man action figure, CIPSA {{released}} {{his own version of}} the same TV character. Its creation was solely a local decision made after the real Six Million Dollar Man action figure, aka [...] "El Hombre Nuclear" [...] in Spanish, and made by Lili Ledy toy company in Mexico, was retired from the Latin American market due to licensing problems in an effort to capitalize the character's current popularity. On its initial run, Bionic Man was a stand alone action figure with no relation at all with any other CIPSA lines of toys. One year later, a sticker was added {{in the front of the}} box with the line [...] "a Kid <b>Acero's</b> friend!". Next year the box was retouched to present him as official part of LOBO. Bionic Man is a Big Jeff basic figure, but dressed in a silver jumper. He has a bionic arm, but instead of the Kung-Fu Grip which was one of the main characteristics of the Six Million Dollar Man action figures, Bionic Man had magnets on his right hand and in several accessories which represents heavy containers and pipe tubes. Using the magnets, Bionic Man carries or pushes away extremely heavy bulks. This action figure does not have a bionic eye with zoom-in features, but in the comic he has it. His most notorious characteristic is it has a translucent right arm, so you can see his internal metallic bones surrounded by cables and circuits.|$|R
25|$|The Santiago Metro {{currently}} operate 7 {{models of}} rolling stock: one model (the AS 2002) is steel-wheeled, {{while the others}} are all rubber-tyred. The NS 74 and NS 93 stock {{are based on the}} MP 73 and MP 89 stock of the Paris Metro respectively, while the NS 2007 stock is based off the NM-02 stock of the Mexico City Metro. All rubber-tyred stock are preceded with the acronym NS (for Neumático Santiago); likewise, all steel-wheeled stock are preceded with the acronym AS (for <b>Acero</b> Santiago). The number representing each type of rubber-tyred and steel-wheeled rolling stock is the year of design of a particular rolling stock, not year of first use, similar to the practice in the Mexico City Metro and Paris Métro. Also, most train types use forced-air circulation as they are not fitted with air-conditioning, unlike in many other metro systems.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, Unomásuno fired 70 employees, {{including}} {{four of its}} founders: Christa Cowrie, Jorge Reyes Estrada, Fernando Belmont <b>Acero,</b> and Patricia Cardona. Most of them accepted the 33% severance plan the newspaper offered; Editorial Uno {{did not have the}} financial support to pay them what was required by law. The founders and eleven more employees, however, sued Unomásuno and asked for the company to fully pay for their severance plan. The employees wrote a petition stating that they were fired because PRI politician Francisco Labastida Ochoa was not winning the 2000 presidential race. They said that the owners poured {{a lot of money in}} his campaign, including money that was to be used to pay its employees. Alonso Muñoz told the press that Unomásuno was going through financial difficulties and that he was thinking of selling the newspaper. The newspaper had MXN$85 million in debt and MXN$20 million in assets (totaling a negative net worth of MXN$65 million). Alonso Muñoz said he was considering partnering with Alonso Coratella's Mundo Ejecutivo media group and starting a new era for Unomásuno.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{match of}} the show was a best two-out-of-three-falls tag team match {{featuring}} four wrestlers from CMLL's Mini-Estrella division as the rudo team of Pierrothito and Universito 2000 faced off against the tecnico team of [...] Niño de <b>Acero</b> and Pequeño Ninja. The first two falls were split between the teams {{in less than five}} minutes, with the third and deciding fall lasting longer than the first two combinted. After 11 minutes, 32 second Pierrothito pinned Pequeño Ninja to win the match for his side. The second match of the night was the only Best two-out-of-three-falls six-man tag team match {{of the show}}, normally the most common match type in Lucha Libre. For the match Dragón Rojo Jr., El Satánico and Virus won the first fall when Los Bombardieros (Flash and Stuka Jr.) were forced to submit to Satánico and Virus. In the second fall the third tecnico, Mictlán, pinned Dragón Rojo Jr. to further the ongoing storyline between the two. In the third fall, the rudo team was by disqualification when Dragón Rojo Jr. intentionally unmasked his Mictlán in plain view of the referee. Unmasking an opponent during a match is an automatic disqualification in lucha libre.|$|E

2500|$|In 1946 Piazzolla formed his Orquesta Típica, which, {{although}} {{having a}} similar formation to other tango orchestras of the day, {{gave him his}} first opportunity to experiment with his own approach to the orchestration and musical content of tango.

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that the Canary Islands were known to the Phoenicians and Greeks, but the earliest written evidence is by the Roman writer Pliny The Elder, who quoted Juba II of Numidia, but Juba's writings were subsequently lost. The Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello reached the archipelago in 1312 and remained for two decades until expelled by a native uprising. In 1404 the Spaniards began the conquest of the islands. Though the first landing on La Palma was in 1405, it took until 1493 and several bloody battles until the last resistance of the natives was broken. The conqueror of La Palma was Alonso Fernández de Lugo, who defeated Tanausu, the last king on the island. [...] He ruled the area known as <b>Acero</b> (Caldera de Taburiente). Tanausu was ambushed after agreeing to a truce arranged by Fernández de Lugo and Juan de Palma, a Guanche who had converted to Christianity and who was a relative of Tanausu.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opening}} match second {{generation}} luchador Stigma. with his chest painted to resemble The Incredible Hulk, {{teamed up with}} the Distrito Federal Welterweight Championship Sensei {{to take on the}} rudo ("Bad guys") team of Bobby Zavala and Cholo. Stigma got the third and deciding fall for his team, in what was described as a [...] "memorable" [...] performance. The second match of the night was originally booked to have Mini-Estrella Astral team up Fantasy and Último Dragóncito, but on the prior Tuesday Astral got badly hurt during an Infierno en el Ring Steel cage match. Astral was the sixth person to exit the cage when he tried to perform a Moonsault of the top of the cage onto Mercurio, Aéreo and Fantasy who were on the floor. Due to the cage mesh breaking earlier in the match, Astral got caught up on the cage and landed awkwardly on the three men on the floor. The bad fall caused Astral to be rushed out of the arena for immediate attention and Mercurio had to be carried to the back as well due to the impact of Astral. Due to the injuries sustained he was replaced by <b>Acero.</b> The rudo team, , Pequeño Olímpico and Pierrothito, had all suffered various injuries during the same match but seemed to be okay on Friday night. The rudo trio consisted of the reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion (Olímpico), the reigning Mexican National Lightweight Champion (Pierrothito) {{and one of the most}} experienced Mini-Estrellas in the division, an advantage that was evident as the team won both the first and the last fall of the match, taking the last fall by submission as Pierrothito forced Dragoncito to give up. The Lightning Match (10 minute time limit and only one fall as opposed to the traditional three fall matches CMLL prefers) featured the experienced rudo Sangre Azteca take on the high flying Fuego, who was one half of the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship team with Stuka, Jr.. Neither wrestler dominated the match, but Sangre Azteca took the victory in five minutes, thirty seconds when he countered Fuego's move off the top rope with a dropkick followed by a pinfall. CMLL introduced Puma King as simply [...] "Puma" [...] during the fourth match, which may or may not be an indicator of a permanent name change. Puma teamed up with La Fievre Amarilla ("Yellow fever"), the team of Okumura and Namajague to take on Rey Cometa, Stuka, Jr. and Tritón. The match served as a continuation of the storyline between Puma and Rey Cometa, that had already seen Puma win a match to unmask Rey Cometa at the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show. The two kept the intensity up with Rey Cometa pinning Puma to win the first fall and Puma pinning Rey Cometa to win the second fall. In the third fall Okumura took advantage of a distracted referee to land an illegal low blow on Stuka, Jr. to get the third fall for his team The fifth match centered around the developing rivalry between experienced rudo Averno and the up-and-coming tecnico Titán that had started the previous week. For this match Averno teamed up with Niebla Roja and Pólvora while Titán was joined by Guerrero Maya, Jr. and La Sombra. The focus lay solidly on the feud between Averno and Titán throughout the match, especially as Averno began to tear at Titán's mask, ripping it open. Averno's team took the first fall, then Averno himself pinned Titán after he applied his signature [...] "Devil's Wings" [...] move (a Spinning lifting sitout double underhook facebuster). Following the match Averno challenged Titán to defend his Mexican National Welterweight Championship against Averno the following week, a challenge Titán accepted.|$|E
