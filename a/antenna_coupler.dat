50|$|An antenna tuner, a matchbox, transmatch, {{antenna tuning}} unit (ATU), or <b>antenna</b> <b>coupler</b> is a device {{connected}} between a radio transmitter or receiver and its antenna to improve power transfer between them by matching {{the impedance of}} the radio to the antenna's feedline.

A difference of field magnitudes on individual <b>coupler</b> <b>antennae</b> should not exceed 1 - 2 %, and a phase difference should not exceed 1 º [2].

40|$|Based on the {{waveguide}} mode (WGM) method, coupling {{interaction of}} electromagnetic wave in a groove doublet configuration is studied. The formulation obtained by WGM method {{for a single}} groove [Prog. Electromagn. Res. 18, 1 – 17 (1998) ] is extended to two grooves. By exploring the total scattered field of the configuration, coupling interaction ratios are defined to describe the interaction between grooves quantitatively. Since each groove in this groove doublet configuration {{is regarded as the}} basic unit, the effects of coupling interaction on the scattered fields of each groove can be investigated respectively. Numerical results show that an oscillatory behavior of coupling interaction is damped with increasing groove spacing. The incident and scattering angle dependence of coupling interaction is symmetrical when the two grooves are the same. For the case of two subwavelength grooves, the coupling interaction is not sensitive to the incident angle and scattering angle. Although the case of two grooves is discussed for simplicity, the formulation developed in this article can be generalized to arbitrary number of grooves. Moreover, our study offers a simple alternative to investigate and design metallic gratings, compact directional <b>antennas,</b> <b>couplers,</b> and other devices especially in low frequency regime such as THz and microwave domain...|$|R

During developmental testing, telemetry (TM) sections are integrated within an AUR missile. These test sets monitor TM unit performance while maintaining form, fit, and function; therefore, resulting in complete data confidence. Initiating TM functional tests permit a capability in verifying that TM sections have been integrated properly. Safety being a priority, in order to attenuate RF radiation leakage while providing repeatable test capabilities in the near-field, antenna couplers are fabricated as a shielding interface between the user and radiating source and a coupling interface between an AUR missile and the test set. Generally, antenna couplers are composed of metallic bodies which require machine shop fabrication. The process of getting machined parts can take up to several months which can delay delivery schedules. With the availability of 3 D printing capabilities and methods in metalizing various materials, a novel approach to fabricating antenna couplers has been explored. The use of modeling Software Packages (Computer Aided Design and Electromagnetic Solvers) and additive printing play key roles in reducing the development cycle time while saving costs, decreasing weight, and sustaining performance.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of air-filled rectangular metal-pipe waveguide using a lithographically-based technique {{has recently been}} reported. This type of waveguide, together with other passive components such as <b>antennas,</b> <b>couplers,</b> mixers and filters may offer a realistic route to terahertz frequency integrated circuits {{in view of the}} compatibility of the fabrication technique with those of standard semiconductor processing. In this contribution, we report the {{fabrication of}} a range of waveguide components for operation at frequencies of up to 300 GHz. These measurements represent the highest frequency characterisation study so far reported for a micromachined passive structure of this type and provide proof of TE 10 propagation with the expected cut-off frequency. Numerous measurements have been taken using G-band (WR- 5) guide which show an attenuation loss of approximately 0. 6 dB per guide wavelength at 200 GHz. This low value of attenuation shows that these micromachined waveguide are viable components for use in integrated circuits at terahertz frequencies.

40|$|An {{active antenna}} with {{simultaneous}} transmit and receive function is of increasing interest, as system designers require more complex functions {{to be implemented}} in reduced space. This chapter discusses the integration of active antennas by combining both transmit and receive functions into one single antenna. Four main components in the design are circular polarized microstrip patch antenna, rat race coupler, power divider and amplifiers. The simulation of the circuit is done using the Agilent ADS. Each individual components was designed using Agilent ADS, before the components were fabricated. The optimization and the analysis have been done using the software. The circular polarized antenna resonates at 2. 4 GHz. Two MESFET amplifiers {{have been used to}} transmit and receive the channel separately. The rat race coupler isolates the two channels and a Tee junction power divider is connected the two channels to the input and output port. The channels are of the same frequency. The simulation and measurement results of the microstrip patch antenna for S 11 are lower than - 10 dB at frequency of 2. 4 GHz. The antenna polarization is confirmed as a circular polarized, {{as can be seen in}} the radiation pattern from the measured and simulated results. The amplifier biasing circuit is supplied by two power sources; one is the drain voltage (Vds) which is positive and the other is the gate voltage (Vgs), which is negative. When Vgs is fixed at a certain value, the current (Ids) from drain to source will vary while tuning Vds and when Vds is fixed at certain values, Ids will also change, while tuning Vgs. After integrating all of the components such as <b>antenna,</b> <b>coupler,</b> amplifier and divider together, the antenna is measured and implemented for both transmit and receive...|$|E
40|$|Radio Frequency (RF) {{measurements}} are a fundamental {{stage in the}} design, testing and optimization of radio systems. Different parameters are evaluated {{in order to ensure}} fulfillment of given design specifications. In addition to these, it has become mandatory for every manufacturer of RF equipment to comply with a set of specifications devised by regulatory entities in order to guarantee that different RF products will work together in an environment where deleterious interference among them is minimized. Mobile phones have emerged as perhaps the most emblematic and mass-produced RF devices to date. Nokia Corporation has a portfolio of smart devices known as Lumia phones. This thesis is part of a project carried out in this company in order to evaluate the performance of different RF parameters on such phones. Manufactures of RF devices have recently begun to evaluate RF parameters in a radiated manner by using a fairly straightforward setup that includes a radio communication tester, an RF shield box and an <b>antenna</b> <b>coupler.</b> This thesis provides a study on radiated RF measurements performed on 4 G mobile terminals in the setup described above. Even though it may be presumed a similar study may already exist from other manufacturers, such information is rarely forthcoming due to confidentiality issues. Nokia Corporation has allowed the author to conduct such study in a way where the most fundamental principles of the measurement setup in question are highlighted and the RF performance of 4 G phones is evaluated in that setup. The results presented herein include those obtained from measurements made in both the reactive and radiating near-field regions. I will establish the legitimacy of the results obtained in both regions, provided the phone is placed at an appropriate position, termed sweet spot. I propound three criteria to find that sweet spot. In order to verify the validity of my measurements, a process capability analysis will be conducted to demonstrate the compliance of the results to given specifications.
