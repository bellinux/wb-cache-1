5|$|The {{original}} soundtrack {{was highly}} praised; reviewers noted {{it as one}} of the best video game soundtracks of the year, praising the originality of the compositions and the beauty of Emi Evans' vocal work.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s main {{competition}} in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise, which aired {{the same day as}} Starrcade 1987 in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event.

25|$|The {{industrialization}} {{drive was}} meant to be primarily a Peruvian process not totally excluding foreign investors but definitely not welcoming them warmly.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, {{construction}} finally recommenced on the coastal line south of Wharanui, but this soon stopped {{again when the}} Great Depression's effects began to be severely felt. Public pressure for a resumption of work was strong, and as the economy was starting to improve in 1936 the government issued orders for completion in four years. In 1939, the line beyond Parnassus was opened to Hundalee, but the outbreak of World War II created more delays and the goal of completion in four years was not achieved.
