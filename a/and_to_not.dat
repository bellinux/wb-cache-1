5|$|At E3 2003, Nintendo showcased two Zelda games {{which would}} {{make use of the}} Game Boy Advance connectivity, Four Swords and Tetra's Trackers. In December of the same year, it was {{announced}} that both games would be together in a single disc, Four Swords +, along with a third, Shadow Battle. Four Swords Adventures was released in Japan with Hyrule Adventure, Shadow Battle, and Navi's Trackers as three individual games bundled together. It was later announced on June 7, 2004, however, that Hyrule Adventures and Navi's Trackers would be sold as two separate titles in the United States, while the retail status of Shadow Battle was still unknown. This decision was later changed to bundle Hyrule Adventure with Shadow Battle, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> release Navi's Trackers in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her characterisation and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E

5|$|The {{season was}} {{affected}} by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which began on November 5, 2007 and ended on February 12, 2008. The season's show runners Tina Fey and Robert Carlock publicly committed to honor the strike themselves <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> ask their writers to do otherwise. As a result, only 15 episodes of the 22 episodes ordered could be produced.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{script was}} written by Naotaka Hayashi, a staff writer at 5pb. whose most notable work {{at the time was}} visual novel Steins;Gate. After playing through Steins;Gate on the {{recommendation}} of another staff member, Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story, and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default. Another reason Asano wanted Hayashi was due to the plot's heavy use of parallel worlds. Hayashi's work on the game involved creating the plot and character settings. While he wrote the majority of the game's dialogue, more detailed work was given to writers at Square Enix and Silicon Studio. One of the supplementary writers was Silicon Studio's Keiichi Ajiro, who wrote the contents of D's Notebook. Ajiro also created the initial story outline with Asano. The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased during the writing process. During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember during the writing process was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high leeway for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> overrun into multiple dialogue boxes.|$|E

A skilled rider can ride even a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{economists and}} {{consumer}} advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, {{but not for}} high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high deductibles <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from moral hazard.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Longo {{obtained}} {{as a gift}} {{a painting}} portraying Our Lady of the Rosary, with Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. Sister M. Concetta de Litala of the Monastery of the Rosary at Porta Medina had been holding it for the Dominican priest Alberto Radente. Radente had acquired it from a junk-shop dealer in Naples for a very small sum. The painting was in bad condition and Longo wrote of his immediate distaste of the poor artistic quality {{when he first saw}} it. However, he accepted the gift to conserve funds <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> insult the Sister Concetta. Longo raised funds to restore the image and placed it in the church in an effort to encourage pilgrimages.|$|E
25|$|Exercises {{that are}} used to enhance back {{strength}} may also be used to prevent back injuries. Back exercises include the prone press-ups, upper back extension, transverse abdominus bracing, and floor bridges. If pain is present in the back, it can mean that the stabilization muscles of the back are weak and a person needs to train the trunk musculature. Other preventative measures are to lose weight <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> work oneself past fatigue. Signs of fatigue include shaking, poor coordination, muscle burning and loss of the transverse abdominal brace. Heavy lifting should be done with the legs performing the work, and not the back.|$|E
