40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} high <b>and</b> low-density <b>residential</b> <b>and</b> functional environments {{through an}} assessment of the pleasure and arousal said environments elicit. The relationships between these affective dimensions and a measure of emotional well-being and personality traits are also explored. Two hundred thirty-eight university students assessed the degree of pleasure and arousal elicited by a series of images depicting high <b>and</b> low-density <b>residential</b> <b>and</b> functional environments. The findings clearly reveal that residential environments produce more pleasurable feelings than functional spaces, regardless of their density. However, as regards arousal, the feelings produced by <b>residential</b> <b>and</b> functional environments vary on depending on their density. It concludes that residential environments are more adaptable environments in terms of emotional well-being...|$|R
