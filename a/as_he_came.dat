5|$|A {{pre-season}} unofficial friendly match provided Tomkins {{his first}} experience against top-flight opposition <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{off the bench}} during Lee Briers' testimonial match in a 30–22 loss to Warrington. Noble followed this up by providing Tomkins, aged 19, with his first team début on 12 May against Whitehaven in a fifth round Challenge Cup match. Tomkins became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut, scoring his first three to complete a hat-trick within the first twelve minutes, as Wigan scored eighteen tries in total {{on the way to}} a 106–8 victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Hergé was {{diagnosed}} with osteomyelofibrosis, necessitating a complete blood transfusion. His need for blood transfusions had increased, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to require them every two weeks, and then every week. On 25 February 1983, Hergé entered cardiac arrest and was hospitalised in intensive care at Brussels' Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. He died there on 3 March. His death received front page coverage in numerous francophone newspapers, including Libération and Le Monde. In his will, he had left Fanny as his sole heir. In November 1986, Fanny closed Studios Hergé, replacing it with the Hergé Foundation. In 1988, Tintin magazine was discontinued.|$|E

5|$|Müller's role can be {{described}} as an attacking all-rounder, a player able to play in a variety of forward positions. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a midfielder, but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more forward roles. Both Bayern Munich and the Germany national team usually play a 4–2–3–1 formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central striker. He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The main {{villages that}} {{supported}} Shahin's government were Rayfoun, Ajaltoun, Ashqout, Qleiat and Mazraat Kfardebian. The representatives of these villages {{were able to}} gain the solidarity of other villages by persuading their inhabitants through both peaceful and coercive means that as Christians they were all a part of single community with a united purpose. The leaders of some villages, {{such as those of}} Ghosta, Aramoun, Ghazir and Ftuh opposed Shahin and his revolt. Shahin's popularity among the Christian peasants of Mount Lebanon grew <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to be viewed as their savior from both the Druze nobles and the traditional Maronite elites. This reputation was further solidified after Shahin's men backed Christian residents in a clash with Druze residents in the mixed village of Beit Meri in Matn in August 1859.|$|E
5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, was as close <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to full international honours.|$|E

5|$|After {{success in}} karting as a child, Schumacher won titles in Formula König and Formula Three before joining Mercedes in the World Sportscar Championship. In 1991, his Mercedes-funded race debut for the Jordan Formula One team {{resulted}} in Schumacher being signed by Benetton {{for the rest}} of that season. He finished third in 1992 and fourth in 1993, before becoming the first German World Drivers' Champion in 1994 by one point over Damon Hill. In 1995 he repeated the success, this time with a greater margin. In 1996, Schumacher moved to Ferrari, who had last won the Driver's Championship in 1979, and helped them transform into the most successful team in Formula One history, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> close to winning the 1997 and 1998 titles, before breaking his leg at the 1999 British Grand Prix, ending another title run.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{as one of}} {{the first}} European {{settlers}} in the Americas, he initially participated in, but eventually felt compelled to oppose the atrocities committed against the Native Americans by the Spanish colonists. In 1515, he reformed his views, gave up his Indian slaves and encomienda, and advocated, before King Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, on behalf of rights for the natives. In his early writings, he advocated the use of African slaves instead of Natives in the West-Indian colonies; consequently, criticisms have been leveled at him as being partly responsible for the beginning of the Transatlantic slave trade. Later in life, he retracted those early views <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to see all forms of slavery as equally wrong. In 1522, he attempted to launch a new kind of peaceful colonialism on the coast of Venezuela, but this venture failed, causing Las Casas to enter the Dominican Order and become a friar, leaving the public scene for a decade. He then traveled to Central America undertaking peaceful evangelization among the Maya of Guatemala and participated in debates among the Mexican churchmen about how best to bring the natives to the Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00 on {{the morning}} of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to {{complete}} a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the crowd <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out to bat in his final Test at Lord's.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} not a total disaster. Villanueva's play {{impressed}} both fans and former critics <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in second in NBA Rookie of the Year and recorded 48 points in an overtime loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997. Bosh was also named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game, becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo, the 2004–05 NBA Executive of the Year, the President and General Manager of the Raptors. Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending thumb injury. The Raptors lost ten in a row after Bosh's injury and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27–55) in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|Following Unforgiven, Triple H had {{a celebration}} thrown in his honor, {{complete}} with six women, confetti, streamers {{and a giant}} cake. Randy Orton, however, sought revenge, as he attacked all three Evolution members, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> out of the giant cake, which {{was placed in the}} center of the ring, and humiliated the group. Orton was however ineligible to face Triple H at Taboo Tuesday for the World Heavyweight Championship, as he was unable to win a match against Batista, which would have given Orton a championship match. On the October 4, 2004 edition of Raw, three candidates were named as potential contenders for Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship at Taboo Tuesday; Chris Benoit and Edge were revealed as two of the candidates. Shawn Michaels, however, competed in a qualifying match, which it saw him defeat Christian, to become the third candidate. On the October 18 edition of Raw, a Triple Threat match was scheduled between Michaels, Benoit and Edge, which Edge won after he pinned Benoit by using the ropes for leverage. During the match, Michaels injured his knee, and it was later revealed that he tore his meniscus. At Taboo Tuesday, Michaels won the fans vote and faced Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship, however, Michaels was unable to win the match after Edge interfered and speared Michaels, allowing Triple H to pin him.|$|E

5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Federer in 5 sets in 4 {{hours and}} 19 minutes, with the match finishing after midnight, {{to become the}} first Spaniard to win the Australian Open. The match was lauded {{as one of the greatest}} ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time, only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final. It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all-time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open-era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi (he would go on to achieve these in the near future). However, as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records, holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career. Not only that but he became the first man in the open-era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time. This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that. The defeat brought Federer to tears <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to terms with his loss.|$|E
