5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather {{almost certainly}} increased {{the size of the}} crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> attractive prospect.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} is <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> approachable bird than the Eurasian rock pipit. It is warier than its {{relative}} and if approached it flies some distance before landing again, whereas the rock pipit typically travels {{only a short}} distance, close to the ground, before it alights.|$|E
5|$|Coldwell {{suffered}} from a heart condition, and undertook <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> ambitious schedule than the major party leaders. The party leader left Ottawa for his riding, Rosetown—Biggar in Saskatchewan, on April 26, and remained there until May 10. He spent three days campaigning in Ontario, then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia, before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election. Other CCF leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the Maritimes.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Orfii {{used only}} the most common praenomina, {{including}} Gaius, Lucius, and Marcus. There are a few instances of other common praenomina, including Titus, Quintus, and Gnaeus, {{as well as one}} instance of Vibius, <b>an</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> common name, frequently associated with families of Sabine or Oscan origin.|$|R
50|$|Amanita pantherina {{contains}} the psychoactive compound muscimol, but {{is used as}} <b>an</b> entheogen <b>much</b> <b>less</b> often than its much more distinguishable relative Amanita muscaria.|$|R

5|$|Diamond Lake, {{formed by}} one of Thielsen's eruptions, lies {{to the west of}} Mount Thielsen and beyond lies Mount Bailey, <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> eroded and younger stratovolcano. Thielsen's sharp peak is a {{prominent}} feature of the skyline visible from Crater Lake National Park. All three volcanoes are part of the Oregon High Cascades, a range that sections off the stratovolcanoes of Oregon that are younger than 3.5million years. The High Cascades include Mount Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Broken Top, and other stratovolcanoes and remnants.|$|E
5|$|The entire cast {{from the}} {{previous}} games has been replaced with new characters. CO powers have been toned down, and no longer affect all units or the whole battle or the whole map. Tag powers from Dual Strike which allowed players to move twice in one turn have been removed. Players gain CO powers much later in the campaign than before, and they have <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> significant role in overall gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> urban society {{than either the}} Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the urbanisation of society.|$|E

5|$|This {{species at}} its {{breeding}} sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a tawny owl, and <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> frequent {{sound like the}} whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls {{are very similar to}} those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms madeira, feae and deserti all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.|$|E
5|$|In Switzerland, Constantine I and {{his family}} found {{themselves}} isolated and without an income. The Greek government under Venizelos did not pay pensions to former rulers and prohibited any contact between the exiles and King Alexander. Already in fragile health, the former king became gradually more depressed. The Russian Revolution and the National Schism deprived Olga of her immovable property and {{she was forced to}} live <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> lavish lifestyle than in the past. She did, however, enjoy spending more time with her sons and grandchildren, from whom she had been long separated by the war.|$|E
5|$|Music and minstrels {{were very}} popular at Edward's court, but hunting {{appears to have}} been <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> {{important}} activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events. Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court. There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enamelling at court, which would have been richly decorated. Edward kept a camel as a pet and, as a young man, took a lion with him on campaign to Scotland. The court could be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian snake-charmer in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.|$|E

5|$|Several factors, however, soon {{reduced the}} value of the treaty for Prussia. Treaty of Reichenbach of July 27, 1790, meant that Prussia was no longer {{considering}} a war with Austria; the Polish–Prussian alliance now had only an anti-Russian angle. Then, on September 9, the Great Sejm, despite some opposition, declared that Commonwealth territories could not be divided. As Prussia was expecting to receive Gdańsk and Toruń from the Commonwealth as a compensation in a subsequent treaty (with Commonwealth being compensated through territorial gains from another neighbor), the Sejm declaration that meant that no territory could be traded to another state made the Commonwealth <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> valuable party for Prussian long-term goals. Already in fall and winter of 1790, Prussian diplomacy begun negotiations with Russians, and hinting at its abandoning of Poland.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{church of}} St. James is also {{located near the}} centre of Taunton quite close to St. Mary Magdalene. The oldest parts of St. James Church are early 14th-century, and there are {{fragments}} of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St. Mary's {{it also has a}} sandstone tower but built to <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> impressive design. The tower was also, like St. Mary's, rebuilt in the 19th century– in this case thought to be due to building defects in the original tower. The church backs onto the County Ground and forms a familiar backdrop to the popular cricket ground.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{clinical}} forms of smallpox. Variola major was the severe and most common form, {{with a more}} extensive rash and higher fever. Variola minor was a less common presentation, and <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> severe disease, with historical death rates of 1 percent or less. Subclinical (asymptomatic) infections with variola virus were noted but were not common. In addition, a form called variola sine eruptione (smallpox without rash) was seen generally in vaccinated persons. This form was marked by a fever that occurred after the usual incubation period and could be confirmed only by antibody studies or, rarely, by virus isolation.|$|E

5|$|A few Macroolithus eggs {{preserve}} embryonic {{remains of}} oviraptorids inside. Two eggs containing embryos {{found in the}} Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near Ganzhou, Jiangxi were referred to M. yaotunensis in 2008. One of these embryos shows a much greater degree of bone development (ossification) than the other; it preserves ossified hind limbs and several vertebrae. The fact that the cervical vertebrae not only have ossified centra and neural arches, but also have ossified zygapophyses, led Cheng et al. to conclude that this embryo may in fact represent a hatchling, since in modern chickens and skuas these zygaphyses are cartilaginous until hatching. Also, the embryo's foot anatomy (specifically, the proportions of its metatarsals) resembles that of the oviraptorid Heyuannia huangi, indicating that these eggs belong to H. huangi or a similar species. The other egg has <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> developed embryo, with only the hind limbs preserved. While this does not permit comparison on the species level, the tibia (shinbone) confirms {{that it is an}} oviraptorosaur.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{attribute}} the Confederacy's weaknesses {{to the poor}} leadership of Davis. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, inability {{to get along with}} people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion all worked against him. Historians agree he was <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln. After Davis was captured in 1865, he was accused of treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, Robert E. Lee. Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot, and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South.|$|E

5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using <b>a</b> <b>much</b> <b>less</b> restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
