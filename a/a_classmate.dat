40|$|One’s {{own face}} {{possesses}} two properties {{that make it}} prone to grab attention: it is a face and, in addition, it is a self-referential stimulus. The {{question of whether the}} self-face is actually an especially attention grabbing stimulus was addressed by using a face-name interference paradigm. We investigated whether interference from a flanking self-face on the processing of <b>a</b> target <b>classmate’s</b> name was stronger than interference from <b>a</b> <b>classmate’s</b> flanking face on the processing of one’s own name as the target. In a control condition a third familiar face served as the flanker for both decisions from the participant’s own name and from the classmate’s name. The presentation of the self-face as a flanker produced significantly more interference on the identification of <b>a</b> <b>classmate’s</b> name than the presentation of that classmate’s face did on the identification of one’s own name. This result was due to the interfering power of the self-face and not to a particular resistance of one’s name to interfering facial stimuli. We argue that the emotional value or the high familiarity of one’s own face may explain its attention grabbing property. ...|$|R
