40|$|Purpose – As green {{buildings}} {{have become more}} widely accepted, constructors (general contractors, construction managers and subcontractors) have become more involved and are playing an increasing role {{in the success of}} these projects. As a result, constructors need and want a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) projects, while exploring ways to provide a “value‐added” service to the projects. Past research has identified “Innovation in Design (ID) ” credits as a potential “value‐added opportunity” for constructors to become preferred members of LEED project teams. Similar opportunities may also exist on Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) project teams. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology encompassed an overview of “Innovation Credits (IC) ” in LEED‐NC, BREEAM green building guidelines and an analysis of the ID category in LEED‐NC from a constructor's viewpoint in general, and electrical contractors in particular. Findings – The findings of this research have identified ID credits as a potential “value‐added opportunity” for constructors to become preferred members of the LEED project teams. In contrast to LEED, this research has identified that similar opportunities for constructors do not exist for ICs under BREEAM as past or current ICs are not available in the public domain unless accessed by a BREEAM Assessor or <b>Approved</b> <b>Person.</b> This lack of access to information could have a negative impact and stifle future innovations and is an area worthy of further research. Originality/value – This research provides an understanding of the constructor's role in the ID category and contributes to the broader literature related {{to the role of the}} construction industry in the green building movement. It is envisioned that the research output will serve as easy to use reference resources for the electrical contracting industry for proposing and achieving ID credits on LEED projects. It is also envisaged that this research will lead to recognition of the need for BREEAM ICs to be accessed within the public domain...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new {{password}} {{system is}} proposed that utilizes unconscious habits in typing the keyboard. Such password, named the Random Input Password (RIP, in short), is a random sequence of a fixed length generated by individual each time. In other words, this systems uses the human-generated random number as a password. This ID {{system does not}} require any specific codes to memorize, thus has a potential to flee us from the flood of increasing number of passwords. Although the RIP is different every time, it reflects peculiarities of individuals and distinguish each person to a certain degree. The identifier is constructed by using 6 parameters extracted from the pre-registered data for each individual. The average accuracy evaluated by using 9 individuals was that the Type-I error rate that disapproves the right person is 23 % and Type-II error rate that <b>approves</b> wrong <b>persons</b> is 19 % on the average. A possible refinement is discussed by reconsidering {{the effectiveness of the}} parameters...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{importance}} of social developmental expectations, assessed as emotional and cognitive evaluations regarding the timing and the gender-role conformity of normative developmental tasks, Two central questions were raised. First, to what degree do the timing and the gender-role conformity affect the adults' expectations? Second, how much does the adults' own gender-role orientation (GRO), classified as traditional vs, liberal, affect their expectations? A 4 (timing modus) x 2 (developmental task) x 2 (gender-role conformity) factorial design was administered to a sample of 140 adults of both sexes, 20 to 81 years old. Coping in time and with gender-role typical career received the most approval. Typical developmental tasks were more <b>approved</b> by <b>persons</b> with a traditional than with a liberal GRO. However, the evaluation of non-typical developmental tasks was not affected by the GRO. The possibility of a shift in normative expectations toward more liberal, diverse, and self-defined female gender-roles is discussed...|$|R
