5|$|Formerly {{the privately}} owned Macquarie Grove Aerodrome, Camden {{was a new}} air base, and the school's {{facilities}} cost £53,000 to construct. On establishment, its personnel numbered 470 officers and airmen, and its complement of aircraft included twenty-three Tiger Moths, nine CAC Wirraways, and fourteen Avro Ansons. Among the staff were former civil pilots and instructors, as well as career Air Force officers. Graduates from Camden included Bill Newton, later awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea, and Jerry Pentland, a World WarI fighter ace with twenty-three victories, {{who went on to}} become perhaps the oldest RAAF pilot on active duty. The outbreak of the Pacific War led to an influx of United States Army Air Forces units to Australian bases, including Camden. To make way, CFS moved to Tamworth, New South Wales, during March and April 1942. Tamworth was not considered a suitable airfield for the school's Wirraways, Ansons and Airspeed Oxfords, and a further relocation was deemed necessary, this time to RAAF Station Parkes, New South Wales, on 18January 1944. Later that year, CFS moved once more, returning on 19September to Point Cook. There it gained an <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> section, which in 1956 was detached to form the RAAF School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> (later the RAAF Institute of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine).</b> CFS remained at Point Cook {{for the rest of the}} war, by which time it had graduated some 3,600 instructors.|$|E

5|$|The {{first officer}} {{was using a}} {{medication}} against back pains which was not permitted while flying. However, these had been prescribed by a physician who had training in <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine.</b> No traces of the substance {{were found in the}} pilot's body after the accident. The crew had started duty at Bodø Airport at 13:30 (Central European Time, UTC+1) and were to make a round trip to Trondheim Airport, with intermediate stops at Sandnessjøen Airport, Mosjøen Airport, Brønnøysund Airport and Rørvik Airport as Flight 711. On the way down, the flight canceled its stop at Mosjøen because of bad weather. The aircraft landed at Trondheim Airport at 17:52. The return flight was to operate as Flight 744 from Trondheim via Namsos to Rørvik, where the plane and crew were to overnight.|$|E

5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon arc lamp while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine,</b> and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} period, the School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> was moved from Mitchel Field, New York, to Brooks. The flying {{school was a}} source for <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> {{research}} and, in turn, the School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> provided a means to screen, examine and upgrade the caliber of cadets being trained at Brooks. Both organizations were transferred to the newly constructed Randolph Field in October 1931.|$|E
25|$|PAs {{also serve}} in the Air Force and Navy as {{clinical}} practitioners and <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> specialists, {{as well as in}} the Coast Guard and Public Health Service. The skills required for these PAs are similar to that of their civilian colleagues, but additional training is provided in advanced casualty care, medical management of chemical injuries, <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine,</b> and military medicine. In addition, military PAs are also required to meet the officer commissioning requirements, and maintain the professional and physical readiness standards of their respective services.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Brooks Air Force Base {{parallels}} {{the history of}} military aviation and <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> in the United States. After the United States entered World War I, in April 1917, the U.S. Army recognized the need for trained flying instructors. San Antonio was chosen for a year-round training site due to its favorable climate, good water supply and convenient transportation facilities.|$|E
30|$|The {{commonly}} accepted neoliberal ideological discourse omits {{the fact}} that the success of certain private sector initiatives could also be regarded as a byproduct of central planning projects: space programs—for innovations in <b>aviation</b> and <b>medicine,</b> the military sector—for Internet, the road infrastructure in the United States, etc.|$|R
25|$|Also, {{the failure}} of certain {{components}} in the engine {{may result in a}} release of oil into bleed air that can cause an odor or oily mist in the cabin. This is known as a fume event. The dangers of fume events are the subject of debate in both <b>aviation</b> and <b>medicine.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the war, Gallet’s renewed {{worldwide}} {{popularity with}} civilians and {{professionals in the}} fields of <b>aviation,</b> sports, <b>medicine,</b> and technology eliminated the necessity to manufacture numerous secondary brands. With the exception of the few brand names that the company retained for its sports and industrial stopwatch lines, most of Gallet's previously held trademarks went back into circulation.|$|R
25|$|This effort {{resulted}} {{in the development of}} a monoplane with retractable landing gear, a metal propeller, and a streamlined engine design, the Verville R-3 Racer. Economy measures by the Air Service prevented the project from being fully completed, but contributed to a growing determination within the Air Service to set new aviation records for speed, altitude, distance, and endurance, which in turn contributed not only to technical improvements (and favorable publicity) but also advancements in <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{working in}} the Altitude Division of the RAF Institute of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine,</b> he worked on Partial-pressure suit assemblies. He was head of this {{division}} for twenty years from 1957 to 1977. However, the RAF never issued a partial-pressure suit, preferring instead to use anti-g trousers in conjunction with pressure jerkins. He was the aeromedical project officer {{for the development of}} the United Kingdom's versions of the Phantom, F-111, and Hercules. He later became chairman of the aeromedical and life support system working parties for the Tornado and Typhoon.|$|E
25|$|Some paramedics {{have begun}} to {{specialize}} their practice, frequently {{in association with the}} environment in which they will work. Some early examples of this involved <b>aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> and the use of helicopters, and the transfer of critical care patients between facilities. While some jurisdictions still use physicians, nurses, and technicians for transporting patients, increasingly this role falls to specialized senior and experienced paramedics. Other areas of specialization include such roles as tactical paramedics working in police units, marine paramedics, hazardous materials (Hazmat) teams, Heavy Urban Search and Rescue, and paramedics on offshore oil platforms, oil and mineral exploration teams, and in the military.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{excitement}} regarding advanced mechanosynthesis regards its potential use in assembly of molecular-scale devices. Such techniques appear to have many applications in <b>medicine,</b> <b>aviation,</b> resource extraction, manufacturing and warfare.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 {{he went to}} New York City under {{diplomatic}} {{cover as}} the deputy of the Rezident. Kvasnikov is noted for his high professional level, a fundamental understanding {{of the problems of}} scientific and technical intelligence. Under his management were obtained the most important materials on nuclear power and its use for military purposes, and also the information and equipment models on questions of <b>aviation,</b> chemistry, <b>medicine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Semyonov persuaded into {{collaboration}} a {{large group}} of young scientists and specialists, through whom was obtained a significant quantity of valuable materials on [...] "ENORMOZ" [...] (Manhattan Project), radio electronics, jet <b>aviation,</b> chemistry, <b>medicine.</b> Semyonov received from Bruno Pontecorvo in January 1943 an extensive report on the first nuclear chain reaction. Pontecorvo also relayed to Semyonov in early 1943 that [...] "Fermi was prepared to provide information".|$|R
25|$|On July 2, 1926, the Air Service {{was renamed}} the Air Corps by act of Congress and {{authorized}} two additional brigadier general positions as assistant chiefs of Air Corps. Lahm was advanced to brigadier general on July 17, 1926, for a four-year tour {{as an assistant}} chief, to be commander of the new Air Corps Training Center, established at San Antonio, Texas, on August 16, 1926. Command of the training center included the coordination and management of training at the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, the Advanced Flying School at Kelly Field, and the School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> at Brooks.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Brooks was {{transformed}} from a flying training center to a center for modern medical {{research and development and}} education. The transition started in the summer of 1959 when the School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> returned to Brooks from Randolph AFB. Brooks became the headquarters for the School of Aerospace Medicine (SAM). In 1957, SAM scientists moved into the newly completed center at Brooks AFB. SAM aided the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Project Mercury and served as a back-up site for lunar samples brought back to Earth on the Apollo missions between 1969–1972. The air evacuation program at Brooks AFB proved vital to the care of wounded personnel in the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1961, Air Training Command {{transferred}} {{jurisdiction of}} Brooks AFB to Air Force Systems Command (AFSC). This {{was all part}} of an Air Force plan to reorganize aerospace medical research. Along with the transfer of Brooks, ATC passed to AFSC (and its newly formed Aerospace Medical Division at Brooks) control of the USAF Aerospace Medical Center, the School of Aerospace Medicine, the USAF Hospital Lackland, and the 3790th Epidemiological Laboratory. (The School of <b>Aviation</b> <b>Medicine</b> had been re-designated as the School of Aerospace Medicine on 8 May 1961.) However, the Medical Service School at Gunter AFB, Alabama remained in the command, reassigned from the medical center to Headquarters ATC on 1 October.|$|E
50|$|A {{confidential}} {{incident reporting}} {{system is a}} mechanism which allows problems in safety-critical fields such as <b>aviation</b> and <b>medicine</b> to be reported in confidence.

40|$|The {{delegation}} of {{more and more}} soft regulatory powers to EU agencies occurs in {{an increasing number of}} policy areas, e. g. <b>aviation,</b> <b>medicines</b> and financial services. Although the growing scope of the {{delegation of}} public authority to agencies is said to be necessary to enhance the effectiveness of EU policies, it raises doubts concerning the legitimacy of agencies and their decisions at the same time. This article aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on EU agencies’ regulatory powers by uncovering the problematic aspects which the application and enforcement of soft law rules of EU agencies may induce at the national level. Furthermore, it adds new elements to the wider reflection on the function and status of soft law within the EU. Ultimately, it argues that further procedural and good governance guarantees are required in order to ensure both the legitimacy and effectiveness of the soft regulatory powers of EU agencies. It does so by taking one of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs), namely the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), as an illustrative example of how the establishing regulations of newer EU agencies proceed {{in the direction of the}} institutionalisation and proceduralisation of soft law rule-making...|$|R
500|$|A final {{alteration}} was to fit {{a simpler}} shutter (radiator vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend {{long periods of time}} in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached [...] McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia. High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. <b>Aviation</b> <b>medicine</b> was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.|$|E
