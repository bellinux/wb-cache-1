40|$|<b>Airport</b> <b>security</b> {{measures}} use {{very expensive}} equipment, and may keep passengers {{in line for}} several minutes. The time passengers spend in those lines can add up, and must be understood as time opportunity cost. In the 1970 s, several <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> measures were adopted to help stop aircraft hijackings. In 1978, William M. Landes wrote the paper "An Economic Study of the U. S. Aircraft Hijacking, 1961 - 1976 ", in which he analyzed the expenditures associated with <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> measures. He concluded {{that the costs of}} the adopted measures were very high. While Landes concentrated on the monetary costs of <b>airport</b> <b>security,</b> this thesis concentrates on the estimating the opportunity costs of <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> measures for passengers [...] their losses in terms of their time value. This thesis estimates that the hijacking-preventing impact of airport screening measures is insignificant, but the opportunity costs these measures impose on airline passengers are significant and greatly exceed the benefits produced.

40|$|The {{thought of}} being secure {{has been on the}} minds of people {{throughout}} history. Security is the protection against intended incidents. Intended incidents happen due to a result of a deliberate and planned act. Security systems are implemented in order to set up security precautions which have as main goal the protection of all assets present within the environment under supervision. In recent years security in aviation, and especially in the airport environment, is getting more and more important. The rising variety and growing number of threats upon the airport environment lead to the need for universal and rapid deployment of individual security systems. This caused a segregated way of working of the entire <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system. The hypothesis arises that this way of working is inefficient, and a performance increase can be achieved when the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system would be integrated. This research is aimed at analyzing a possible approach to integrate the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system and its influence on the performance indicators of the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system. Some performance indicators of the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system, such as level of security and level of service, are in conflict with each other. The agent-based modeling approach is used to properly represent the socio-technical nature of the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system. This way the individual agents can be modeled with their own set of rules, while addressing the relationships between agents in the airport environment as well. A specially designed security risk scenario, discussing the boundaries of the environment, the type of threats present and the type of threat sources and objects present, forms the basis of the input for the agent-based model. This exploratory graduation thesis provides a first attempt in proposing an approach to integrate the current <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system in order to increase performance in both the level of security and level of service. Three different configurations of an integrated <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system are proposed by means of decision data fusion. Findings of this thesis showed the greatest potential improvement of the level of security and the level of service when implementing an integrated adaptive configuration of the <b>airport</b> <b>security</b> system. <br/...|$|R

Screeners where overworked and received a minimum wage average salary. Many mistakes caused by inadequate employee security training created numerous security vulnerabilities throughout the aviation industry. After the 9 / 11 attack, a federal government controlled, stricter, and more sweeping passenger and baggage screening replaced this flawed system. With the aid of taxpayer funds, aviation security became part of one agency, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) (Conti, Shay & Hartzog, 2014) ...|$|R
