5|$|There {{were two}} {{separate}} {{versions of the}} game developed for the NES. The first port was handled and published by Jaleco only in Japan. Released on June 23, 1988, it featured characters redrawn in <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> art style and generally shrunken rooms.

5|$|Well {{received}} by English-language readers, several {{volumes of the}} manga series appeared in the Top 50 sales lists for graphic novels in their respective months of release. Critics praised the manga as <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> and entertaining series with free-flowing style and character designs. à la mode received praise as a good continuation of the series, but was also criticized for offering nothing new. The anime adaptation received high ratings while airing in Japan, resulting in numerous marketing tie-ins. Despite criticism for extensive editing that removed most of the Japanese elements, the Mew Mew Power dub became the highest rated 4Kids show during its broadcast. It was licensed for regional release in several other countries instead of the original Japanese series.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{the much}} darker tone of Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{compared}} to its predecessor, Kamikokuryo decided on surrealism {{as the main}} theme for the graphics. The works of Salvador Dalí and Giorgio de Chirico were used as visual references and helped Kamikokuryo {{strike a balance between}} photorealism and fantasy-like surrealism. Unlike Final Fantasy XIII, the game had a much tighter schedule allowing for little pre-production. Kamikokuryo hence used photographs instead of self-drawn pictures to explain his setting ideas to the other staff members. For example, a photograph of ruined buildings in the Cuban capital Havana inspired the look of Valhalla. Character design duties were split up: Nomura designed the faces of the new and returning main characters while their clothing was done by other artists. Kamikokuryo drew the final version of Lightning based on a silhouette sketch and suggestions by Nomura. Yusuke Naora took charge of Serah's, Noel's and Caius' costumes, while Hideo Minaba worked on Yeul, Alyssa and the adult version of Hope in the same capacity. Mog was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda after he had received a request for <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> and mascot-like Moogle character.|$|E

25|$|Bishōjo ("beautiful girl") {{is often}} mistakenly {{considered}} a parallel of bishōnen, {{because of the}} similar construction of the terms. There are major {{differences between the two}} aesthetics. The bishōjo aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in <b>a</b> <b>cute,</b> pretty style; and bishōnen is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common mistake is assuming that the female characters in bishōnen manga and anime are bishōjo. In truth, female characters in bishōnen manga are very different from those in bishōjo; bishōjo females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas bishōnen females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the bishōnen.|$|E

25|$|Cooking with Dogs {{creator and}} {{producer}} conceived {{of the idea}} for the show upon his return to Tokyo from Los Angeles, where he had graduated from film school and worked in film and television. Interested in continuing in the industry, but unable to find success on his own and lacking a significant budget, the producer approached Chef (whose identity is also undisclosed for privacy reasons) {{with the idea of a}} cooking show. Chef was known to the producer as a good cook, and agreed to the show concept: she would cook one dish while her toy poodle Francis would be dubbed to narrate. Francis, who lives with Chef, was included to make Chef feel more comfortable and at ease on camera, as she had no background with television. Additionally, the producer felt that including <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> dog would make the series stand out to viewers. The decision for Francis to narrate in Japanese-accented English was due to the producer's desire to promote Japanese culture through English-accessible content and widen the show's appeal. The show's producer does the voice acting for Francis.|$|E

25|$|A pre-match {{protest in}} the Curva Nord at the refereeing {{performances}} in Parma matches was {{the prelude to}} Fiorentina's re-arranged visit on Wednesday 7 March. Parma started well and dominated the game with the surprising inclusion of Jaime Valdés in central midfield not hindering them. After 28 minutes, Giovinco played through ball ahead of Stefano Okaka, whose shot was saved, but the Italian striker finished well on the rebound. On the hour mark, Fiorentina equalised after an excellent wide free-kick found Matija Nastasić, who nodded home from close range. Parma continued to have chances, but Fiorentina miraculously took the lead via <b>a</b> <b>cute</b> Alessio Cerci finish. Late on, Giovinco won a contentious penalty for a shirt tag and stepped up to score the penalty to level the scores at two each. Confusion reigned late on; {{it looked as though}} Valon Behrami had been sent off, but the red card was rescinded after discussions between the referee and the linesman. Andrea Lazzari should have won the game for Fiorentina in injury time, but fired just wide.|$|E

500|$|Coon {{suggested}} that Gerrold should {{wait until the}} following February {{to see if the}} show was renewed for a second season.

He had his best hopes on two treatments called [...] "Bandi" [...] and [...] "The Protracted Man", but decided to submit his fifth story despite Coon's earlier dismissal of the idea. It was called [...] "The Fuzzies". The idea was based on the introduction of rabbits in Australia in 1859, who reproduced at a vastly increased rate owing to the lack of predators.|$|E
