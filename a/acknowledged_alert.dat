40|$|Communication between clinicians, technologists, and radi ologists {{has become}} more complex, with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) now {{allowing}} the radiologist {{to be removed from}} the physical location of the patients and the site of imaging. With these changes, effective communication becomes an ongoing challenge. Efficient communication of study interpretations has also become a priority for radiologists as they struggle to maintain relevance and provide added value to patient care when clinicians have ready access to radiology images. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to share our experience in developing and implementing the Collaborative Notification System (CNS), a communication tool used to inform referring clinicians of urgent findings—a. k. a. “wet reads. ” The system utilizes a system of web pages integrated into PACS for the sending and receiving of succinct messages to provide clinical information at the point of need. A second system of pager alerts provides notification of the need for such communication through a relatively unintrusive, one-way, <b>acknowledged</b> <b>alert</b> system. The CNS provides asynchronous, integrated communication for the reporting of urgent and emergent radiology findings in a complex, geographically distributed medical environment...|$|E

We hypothesized that an electronic medical record (EMR) that facilitates the transmission and availability of critical imaging results through either automated notification (alerting) or {{direct access to the}} primary report would eliminate this problem. METHODS: We studied critical imaging alert notifications in the outpatient setting of a tertiary care Department of Veterans Affairs facility from November 2007 to June 2008. Tracking software determined whether the <b>alert</b> was <b>acknowledged</b> (ie, health care practitioner/provider [HCP] opened the message for viewing) within 2 weeks of transmission; <b>acknowledged</b> <b>alerts</b> were considered read. We reviewed medical records and contacted HCPs to determine timely follow-up actions (eg, ordering a follow-up test or consultation) within 4 weeks of transmission. Multivariable logistic regression models accounting for clustering effect by HCPs analyzed predictors for 2 outcomes: lack of acknowledgment and lack of timely follow-up. RESULTS: Of 123 638 studies (including radiographs, computed tomographic scans, ultrasonograms, magnetic resonance images, and mammograms), 1196 images (0. 97...|$|R
5000|$|The APT was {{designed}} for faster running than existing trains on the same track. At the APT's design speeds, {{it was not possible}} for the operator to read the speed limits on trackside signs in time to slow down if needed. Instead, a new system using a transponder-based cab display was introduced called [...] "C-APT". A radio signal from the train caused a track-mounted transponder to return the local speed limit. These sealed, unpowered transponders were placed at intervals of no more than 1 km. Approaching speed restrictions were provided at the appropriate distance, along with an audible alert; failure to <b>acknowledge</b> these <b>alerts</b> would result in an automatic brake application. C-APT was driven by a redundant onboard computer system using Intel 4004 microprocessors. The track units were essentially the same as the modern French Balise beacons.|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} is {{a classical}} {{area of study}} in robotics and extensive research works have been dedicated to investigate its broad applications. As the breath of robots applications requiring human interaction grow, {{it is important for}} robots to acquire sophisticated social skills such as empathy towards pain. However, it turns out that this is difficult to achieve without having an appropriate concept of pain that relies on robots being aware of their own body machinery aspects. This paper introduces the concept of pain, based on the ability to develop a state of awareness of robots own body {{and the use of the}} fault detection approach to generate artificial robot pain. Faults provide the stimulus and defines a classified magnitude value, which constitutes artificial pain generation, comprised of synthetic pain classes. Our experiment evaluates some of synthetic pain classes and the results show that the robot gains awareness of its internal state through its ability to predict its joint motion and generate appropriate artificial pain. The robot is also capable of alerting humans whenever a task will generate artificial pain, or whenever humans fails to <b>acknowledge</b> the <b>alert,</b> the robot can take a considerable preventive actions through joint stiffness adjustment...|$|R

Objective: The predictors of mortality {{and the differences}} between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with this disease remain unknown. Thus, {{the aim of this}} retrospective cohort study was to clarify these issues. Patients and methods: We enrolled all patients who were histologically diagnosed with CMV colitis between April 2002 and December 2016 in the Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Patients were divided into two groups: immunocompetent and immunocompromised, and the differences between them were analyzed to develop in-hospital mortality predictors. Results: A total of 69 patients (42, immunocompetent; 27, immunocompromised) were enrolled. The most common symptoms were melena in the immunocompetent group and diarrhea in the immunocompromised group. The in-hospital mortality rate showed no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} (26. 2 % vs 25. 9 %, P= 0. 981). Early diagnosis was the only significant independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1. 075, 95 % CI 1. 005 – 1. 149, P= 0. 035). The cutoff of diagnostic timing was 9  days from admission, derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve using the Youden index. Conclusion: CMV colitis in immunocompetent patients is markedly more common and fatal than has generally been <b>acknowledged.</b> Being <b>alert</b> to different ways in which this disease can present itself will enable early diagnosis and significantly reduce mortality.
