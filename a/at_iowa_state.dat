5|$|After Georgia's {{outstanding}} 1896 performance, Warner {{returned to}} his alma mater Cornell at twice his Georgia salary. While remaining head coach <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State,</b> he coached Cornell to records of 5–3–1 in 1897 and 10–2 in 1898; in the latter season, Cornell outscored its opponents 296–29. Despite its 1898 success, tension existed within the team, as its assistant coach (backed by {{a large proportion of}} the players) lobbied to replace Warner. Acknowledging an issue with his leadership, Warner resigned.|$|E
5|$|Spedding {{took up the}} {{position}} as assistant professor {{and head of the}} department of physical chemistry <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College in 1937.

White had a double-double in his second career game as well three nights later against Drake with 21 points and 14 rebounds. Then on November 25 against Providence, he recorded 16 rebounds. On December 3, against 15th-ranked Michigan he recorded a double-double with 22 points and 13 rebounds as well as 4 steals.|$|E
5|$|Bruce Oram Davidson (born December 31, 1949, in Rome, New York) is an American equestrian who competes in {{the sport}} of eventing. He {{grew up in a}} family uninterested in horses, but began to compete in Pony Club events after a family friend {{introduced}} him to riding. He began college <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University, but left in his third year to train full-time with the United States Equestrian Team. In 1974 he married, and his two children were born in 1976 and 1977. His son, Bruce Davidson, Jr., has followed in his footsteps to become a top eventing rider.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organize part of the Chemistry Division <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College, where he had colleagues who were willing to help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The intention was that staff at Ames would eventually move to Chicago when space became available, but this never happened. The success of the Ames Project ensured that it became a separate laboratory within the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Following the reconciliation, a USA Today story {{detailed}} White's situation. Although White endured 20 flights {{for travel}} during his season <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State,</b> the Rockets' NBA schedule called for 98 flights. White {{had attempted to}} cope with travel in college through use of Benadryl and Xanax, but found both reduced his energy level, although it never showed in his statistical output. White cited that his concern for the increased number of flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Davidson {{was born}} to Francis and Annette Davidson, the former a {{businessman}} and the latter a concert pianist. He was the third of four children, and had little opportunity to be around horses until {{his family moved to}} Westport, Massachusetts, when he was a child. A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University with a veterinary major, but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1895, Warner was asked for a {{reference}} to fill the vacant head coaching position <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University, in Ames, Iowa. Instead of giving a reference, Warner himself applied for the job and received an offer for $25 (approximately $670 in 2016) a week. At the same time, he decided to apply to other schools and received an offer of $34 (approximately $915 in 2016) per week from the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. Because Iowa State began its season in Augustalmost {{one and a half}} months prior to the beginning in Georgia, Warner was able to work out a deal. For $150 (Approximately $4,000 in 2016), he would coach in Iowa from August until the second week of September; and then head to Georgia and begin coaching there.|$|E
5|$|Mallinckrodt Incorporated in St. Louis, Missouri, {{took the}} raw ore and {{dissolved}} it in nitric acid to produce uranyl nitrate. Ether was then {{added in a}} liquid–liquid extraction process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form uranium trioxide, which was reduced to highly pure uranium dioxide. By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors Westinghouse and Metal Hydrides. Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College in Ames, Iowa, under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This {{became known as the}} Ames Project, and its Ames process became available in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Mikengreg is an {{independent}} video game development team of Mike Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. Their games include Solipskier, Gasketball, and TouchTone. The two met in a game development class <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University and later began to collaborate on the Adobe Flash game Dinowaurs. When the project was funded, they founded Intuition Games with other college friends in Ames, Iowa, where they worked on small Flash games such as Gray, Lifecraft, and Fig. 8 for Flash game sites such as Kongregate. Dinowaurs {{was one of the}} first games signed for the Kongregate platform. Their other games involved controlling the weather, influencing individuals in a riot, and riding a bicycle. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked on several additional games that were put on hiatus.|$|E

5|$|Due to lack {{of space}} at the University of Chicago, Spedding {{proposed}} to organise part of the Chemistry Division <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> College in Ames, where he had colleagues {{who were willing to}} help. It was agreed that Spedding would spend half of each week in Ames, and half in Chicago. The first problem on the agenda was to find uranium for the nuclear reactor that Enrico Fermi was proposing to build. The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced ingots the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments. With Westinghouse's process, it would have cost $200,000 and taken a year to produce.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States' {{entry into}} the Second World War, Cameron {{signed up for the}} Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service, a part of the United States Navy, in February 1943. Initially sent to a {{training}} camp <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> Teachers College in Cedar Falls, she was subsequently posted to Washington D.C., where she served as a cartographer for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In the course of these duties, she met U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in May 1943. She was reassigned to the Naval Photographic Unit in Anacostia, where she worked as a wardrobe mistress for propaganda documentaries, and during this period met various Hollywood stars. When her brother James returned to the U.S. injured from service overseas, she went AWOL and returned to Iowa to see him, as a result of which she was court–martialed and confined to barracks {{for the rest of the}} war. For reasons unknown to her, she received an honorable discharge from the military in 1945. To join her family, she traveled to Pasadena, California, where her father and brothers had found work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).|$|E
5|$|Wohlwend met Mike Boxleiter in an {{experimental}} video game development class they took together <b>at</b> <b>Iowa</b> <b>State</b> University. Wohlwend {{had attempted to}} help Boxleiter with a project, but quit after drawing a few aliens. They met again as coworkers at the university's Virtual Reality Application Center during Boxleiter's final year of college. Upon discovering their close interests, they began to work on an Adobe Flash game named Dinowaurs while they completed college. So as to make money while they worked on the game, they founded Intuition Games at the university's Research Park around May 2007. They decided to stay in Ames, Iowa due to its financial feasibility and local connections, but two other team members (friends from Iowa State) lived farther away. They saw Flash games as an easy entry point into full-time self-employment, but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as WiiWare.|$|E
