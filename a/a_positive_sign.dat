5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E

F is a Euclidean Lagrangian for the field H, {{the only difference between}} this and the quantum field theory of a scalar field being that all the derivative terms enter with <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign,</b> and there is no overall factor of i.|$|E
25|$|An earlier (non-European-based) neopagan wedding {{took place}} in modern Spanish territory. It was held in 2002 in Tenerife, Canary Islands, and carried out {{by members of the}} neopagan group Church of the Guanche People (named for the Guanches, ancient {{inhabitants}} of the Canary Islands before the conquest of the archipelago by Spain in the fifteenth century). This Canarian religious organisation is not officially recognized by Spanish authorities as such an institution, because it is linked to the independence movement in the islands. Nevertheless, the event was taken as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> by religious minorities in the Canaries and Spain.|$|E
25|$|The {{preservation}} of local varieties in Singapore {{has been of}} increasing concern in Singapore since the 2000s, especially among the younger generation of Chinese youths. This sudden revival of other varieties can mainly {{be attributed to a}} feeling of disconnection between the younger and the elder generations, as well as a sense of loss of identity from their own linguistic roots for many others. While more work has to be put in to revive these varieties, the recent 2014 Singapore Teochew Festival held in Ngee Ann City can be regarded as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> that more people are becoming more actively involved in reconnecting with their linguistic roots.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{keywords}} attribute, {{the description}} attribute {{is supported by}} most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect click-through rates. While clicks for a result can be <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> of effective title and description writing, Google does not recognize this meta element as a ranking factor, so using target keyword phrases in that element will not help a site rank better.

500|$|A strong {{believer in}} fate, Marlohe stated that she dreamt of acting {{alongside}} Javier Bardem {{six months before}} her Bond audition, and interpreted it as <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> that she would get the part.

500|$|Gold disliked other magazines' use of covers {{with what}} he {{described}} as [...] "shapely female endomorphs with bronze bras, embattled male mesomorphs clad in muscle, and frightful alien monsters in search of a human meal". The cover for the first issue was by David Stone, depicting a scene from Simak's Time Quarry. The image was muted, in contrast to the sensational art typically found on the covers of the sf pulps; the intention was that Galaxy should look like an sf magazine, but one [...] "that you were not embarrassed to hold", in the words of Mike Ashley. [...] The early artwork was generally unremarkable, though Ed Emshwiller's humorous cover for the June 1951 issue, his first professional sale as an artist, was <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign.</b> [...] "Emsh", as he was known to science fiction readers, soon became a regular contributor. The relatively expensive production processes that Gold had insisted on enabled more sophisticated internal artwork, which could be integrated with type in ways not possible with cheaper letterpress printing.|$|E

2500|$|Another feature {{thought to}} be {{important}} was that symptoms {{tended to be more}} severe on the non-dominant (usually left) side of the body. There {{have been a number of}} theories about this, such as the relative involvement of cerebral hemispheres in emotional processing, or more simply, that it was [...] "easier" [...] to live with a functional deficit on the non-dominant side. However, a literature review of 121 studies established that this was not true, with publication bias the most likely explanation for this commonly held view.

2500|$|In general, {{but with}} several exceptions, mathematicians and general relativists prefer spacelike vectors to yield <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign,</b> , while {{particle}} physicists tend to prefer timelike vectors to yield <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign,</b> [...] Authors covering several areas of physics, e.g. Steven Weinberg and Landau and Lifshitz ( [...] and [...] respectively) stick to one choice regardless of topic. Arguments for the former convention include [...] "continuity" [...] from the Euclidean case corresponding to the non-relativistic limit [...] Arguments for the latter include that minus signs, otherwise ubiquitous in particle physics, go away. Yet other authors, especially of introductory texts, e.g. , do not choose a signature at all, but instead opt to coordinatize spacetime such that the time coordinate (but not time itself!) is imaginary. This removes the need of the explicit introduction of a metric tensor (which may seem as an extra burden in an introductory course), and one needs not be concerned with covariant vectors and contravariant vectors (or raising and lowering indices) to be described below. The inner product is instead effected by a straightforward extension of the dot product in [...] to [...] This works in the flat spacetime of special relativity, {{but not in the}} curved spacetime of general relativity, see [...] (who, by the way use [...] ). MTW also argues that it hides the true indefinite nature of the metric and the true nature of Lorentz boosts, which aren't rotations.

2500|$|In the physical-space sign convention, {{positive}} {{shear stresses}} act on positive {{faces of the}} material element in the positive direction of an axis. Also, positive shear stresses act on negative faces of the material element in the negative direction of an axis. A positive face has its normal vector in the positive direction of an axis, and a negative face has its normal vector in the negative direction of an axis. For example, the shear stresses [...] and [...] are positive because they act on positive faces, and they act {{as well in the}} positive direction of the -axis and the -axis, respectively (Figure 3). Similarly, the respective opposite shear stresses [...] and [...] acting in the negative faces have <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign</b> because they act in the negative direction of the -axis and -axis, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The Greco-Etruscan {{form of the}} {{practice}} {{seems to be the}} most common in Europe, historically. But the rites of {{the practice}} varied widely even into the early Renaissance. In The Works of Rabelais, Book III (published in 1693), Sir Thomas Urquhart claimed that the ashes and soot must be allowed to rise naturally from the fire. The ashes were interpreted as they rose. Ashes which dispersed quickly were <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>sign,</b> but ashes which hung in the air were not. Another tradition indicates that spodomancy may also be practiced by writing a question or message {{on a piece of paper}} and then burning it. [...] The burned ashes and soot of the burned message were then examined for omens and interpretation. In Slavonia, only women were permitted to practice spodomancy. A woman would scratch in the ashes. An even number of scratches meant a positive outcome, while an odd number meant bad luck. In Poland, too, only women could practice the art. Ashes would be spread around the bed of a sick person, and the signs which appeared in the ashes were interpreted to indicate whether the person would become healthy again or not. The practice of spodomancy continues to evolve even today. For example, modern Wiccans argue that the fire used by the spodomancer must be a sacred one.|$|E
