What is the significance, if any, of the genetic connection between the donor and donor offspring? How do the various stakeholders perceive the significance and how does the variety of views influence legislation? Initially, donor insemination was an informal arrangement between doctor and patient in which the genetic connection with the donor was downplayed or even concealed. As the practice became formalised through specialist clinics, the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> was maintained. As donor-conceived children reached adulthood, however, some of them challenged the policy. The ensuing debate has resulted in significant legislative changes. Dr Anna Kalaitzidi...|$|E

40|$|In the February 2011 {{report on}} its {{inquiry into the}} past and present {{practices}} <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> conception in Australia, the Australian Senate Legal and Constitu- tional Affairs References Committee called for the introduction of legislation to regulate donor conception in all jurisdictions that do not have it in place “as a matter of priority”. It further called for the establishment, “as a matter of priority”, of a national register <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> to enable donor-conceived individuals to access identifying information about their donor. The Senate Committee left open the question as to whether the legislation and central register should have retrospective effect. This article focuses upon that question. It shows that arguments concerning the privacy, confidentiality and <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> some <b>donors</b> who may wish to remain anonymous are outweighed by the manifest injustice faced by donor-conceived individuals who are denied access to such information, as well as their families and donors who wish to exchange this information. 23 page(s...|$|R
50|$|For most sperm recipients, <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>donor</b> is not <b>of</b> major {{importance}} at the obtainment or tryer-stage. Anonymous sperm {{is often}} less expensive. Another reason that recipients choose anonymous donors is {{concern about the}} role that the donor or the child may want the donor to play in the child's life. Sperm recipients may prefer a non-anonymous donor if they anticipate disclosing donor conception to their child and anticipate the child's desire to seek more information about their donor in the future. A Dutch study found that lesbian couples are significantly more likely (98%) to choose non-anonymous donors than heterosexual couples (63%). Of the heterosexual couples that opted for anonymous donation, 83% intended never to inform their child of their conception via sperm donation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Anonymity</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> or {{recipients}} in living-donor transplantation is {{a complex}} issue and practice varies widely. There are compelling arguments for maintaining anonymity of both parties before unspecified donor transplantation and specified indirect transplantation. After transplantation, there are still good reasons to avoid disclosure of identities. Although anonymity could be lifted if both parties explicitly request it, there are significant, potentially negative consequences of such an approach. Both donor and recipient should be counseled regarding these, and transplant teams should consider the considerable financial and psychosocial costs if problems are encountered {{as a result of}} contact. Given the recent {{rise in the number of}} unspecified living-donor transplants and through paired exchange schemes, it is vital that data are collected regarding the effects of maintaining or revoking anonymity after transplantation...|$|E

50|$|During {{the course}} of the {{criminal}} investigation, another type of fraud came to light. For a variety of reasons, some patients had arranged to be artificially inseminated with sperm provided by screened, anonymous donors arranged by Jacobson. In order to preserve the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>donors,</b> Jacobson explained, he identified them in records using code numbers; only Jacobson was to know their true identities. Investigators found no evidence that any donor program actually existed. Some of Jacobson's patients who had conceived through donor insemination agreed to genetic testing. At least seven instances were identified in which Jacobson was the biological father of the patients' children, including one patient who {{was supposed to have been}} inseminated with sperm provided by her husband. DNA tests linked Jacobson to at least 15 such children, and it has been suspected that he fathered as many as 75 children by impregnating patients with his own sperm.|$|R
40|$|Taking {{into account}} a recent decree {{enacted by the}} Catalan {{government}} stipulating the procedure to provide information on a persons biological roots, {{this article examines the}} tension between the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the gamete <b>donor</b> and the childs right to know their origin. The analysis of legal systems that recognise this right for children conceived through donated gametes spurs us to further examine the hypotheses, quite widespread today, which consider traditional arguments for secrecy outdated. In this regard, the article also challenges the different treatment granted to adopted children and donor gamete children by legal systems such as Spains. Beyond the possible conflicting rights <b>of</b> children, <b>donors</b> and parents, arguments provided by anonymity supporters, such as the moral damage resulting from disclosure or the possible link between disclosure and a decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>donors,</b> should be also taken into account. However, these arguments require absolute empirical evidence, which is not currently conclusive. Alternatively, disclosure of the donors identity is consistent with the needs <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> families and with a major trend in family law supporting the right to know ones genetic origin, dissociated from biological and legal parentage...|$|R

The <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> many <b>donors,</b> however, make the existing means of donation inappropriate for them. In this paper we investigate the business need for an internet charity donation scheme, identify the security requirements such a scheme should fulfill, and propose a scheme that uses an anonymous electronic cash technique to make donations, and that employs smart cards for donation distribution. Finally, we analyse how the proposed scheme matches the identified security requirements. Keywords: charity, e-commerce security, payment systems, anonymity, smart cards...|$|R
40|$|In 2004 a law was {{introduced}} in The Netherlands, which gives offspring conceived by semen or oocyte donation {{the right to know}} the identity <b>of</b> the <b>donor.</b> The law also regulates the provision of other information concerning the donor to the offspring, their parents or their general practitioner. With the introduction of this law, a choice has been made in which the wish of offspring prevails above others involved. Donors can no longer claim absolute anonymity; they are anonymous at the time of donation, but if a child aged >= 16 years requests information the donor may now be traced. During 15 years of debate on the abolition <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> <b>anonymity</b> the number <b>of</b> <b>donors</b> decreased by > 70 % and the number of semen banks by 50 %.

40|$|Background. In the Netherlands, <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> organ donation, {{which is}} {{currently}} protected by legislation, has come under discussion. In the Dutch society, a tendency to allow direct contact between transplant recipients and their donor's family is noticeable. As {{little is known about}} the opinion of Dutch liver transplant recipients on <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> organ donation and direct contact with the donor's family, this study examines their opinions. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 244 liver transplant recipients. Their opinions were examined in relation to demographic, transplant-related and emotional variables. Data were collected by questionnaire. Transplant-related variables were retrieved from the hospital's liver transplant database. Results. Fifty-three percent of the respondents (n = 177) agreed with <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> organ donation, mainly out of respect for the donor. Living situation, age, and level of positive affect influenced this opinion. The majority of the respondents (65 %) indicated that they would like to receive some information about their donor, like age, sex, and health status. Only 19 % of the respondents favored direct contact with the donor's family, mainly to express their gratitude personally. Respondents transplanted for alcoholic cirrhosis were less in favor of direct contact. Respondents with feelings of guilt doubted more about direct contact. Conclusion. There is no need to change the current legislation on <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> organ donation. However, most liver transplant recipients would like to receive some general information about their donor. Therefore, clear guidelines on the sharing <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> data with recipients need to be established...|$|R
40|$|In {{anonymous}} communication networking, entropy is {{a popular}} metric for measuring the average-case difficulty of linking two communicating parties. This paper proposes an alternate view <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> rooted in the observation that global measures <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> do not necessarily provide accurate information about the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> an individual user. Such differences can arise due to the characteristics of user needs and local network conditions.

Based on this idea, we propose a relay selection algorithm in Tor, introduce a metric for computing the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> individual relays, and discuss the choice of parameters, possible attacks, and defence strategies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Anonymity {{has been}} {{regarded}} mainly as <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> {{the person who}} did something. We believe that the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the subject {{may not be a}} primary concern and the more important part would be the fact that the subject did some deed. We focus on the relationship of the subject and the deed. Another argument we raise here is the need of quantitative measures for the anonymity. Anonymity has been dealt only as a quality, but we need to quantise the quality to measure and compare anonymising mechanisms. We provide a metric, we call it anonymity metric, in order to measure the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> mechanisms. As a typical example for anonymising mechanisms, we consider electronic voting schemes. Secret ballot definitely needs not to expose relationship between voter and his ballot. On this basis, most electronic voting schemes have been designed to keep <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> voters and nontraceability of ballots. We apply the anonymity metric to anonymous mechanisms in voting schemes and present metric computations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. According to {{international}} law, <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the voter {{is a fundamental}} precondition for democratic elections. In electronic voting, several aspects <b>of</b> voter <b>anonymity</b> have been identified. In this paper, we re-examine anonymity with respect to voting, and generalise existing notions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in e-voting. First, we identify and categorise the types of attack {{that can be a}} threat to <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the voter, including different types of vote buying and coercion. This analysis leads to a categorisation <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in voting in terms of a) the strength <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity</b> achieved and b) the extent of interaction between voter and attacker. Some of the combinations, including weak and strong receipt-freeness, are formalised in epistemic logic. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anonymity</b> <b>of</b> identity-based {{encryption}} (IBE) {{means that}} given a ciphertext, one cannot distinguish the target identity from a random identity. In this paper, we thoroughly discuss the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> IBE systems. We {{found that the}} current definition <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> is obscure to describe some IBE systems, such as Gentry IBE system. Furthermore, current definition cannot express the degree <b>of</b> <b>anonymity.</b> So we divide the degree <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> into weak anonymity and strong anonymity based on indistinguishability between different games. For weakly anonymous IBE systems, the target identity in a ciphertext cannot be distinguished from a random identity. For strongly anonymous IBE systems, the whole ciphertext cannot be distinguished from a random tuple. We also discuss the type <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and divide it into two types. Type 1 means that a random tuple {{can be seen as}} a valid ciphertext, while type 2 cannot. Based on our new definitions, we show that three famous IBE systems, Gentry IBE system, Boyen-Waters IBE system, and Lewko IBE system, have strong but different types <b>of</b> <b>anonymity...</b>|$|R
