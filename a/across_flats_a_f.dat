50|$|The Missa Scala Aretina, {{so called}} because {{it uses a}} scale-based cantus firmus (prominently audible in the Kyrie), caused a major musical {{controversy}} between 1715 and 1720, initiated by a pamphlet against Valls by the organist and theatre composer Joaquín Martínez de la Roca. Pro and anti groups were roughly equal, the famous composer Alessandro Scarlatti had given an opinion, mildly opposed to Valls' ideas. In the Qui tollis at bar 120 (López-Calo edition) the second soprano enters on an unprepared 9th chord causing a gratuitous semitonal dissonance with <b>a</b> b <b>flat,</b> <b>a,</b> <b>f,</b> d and low g sounding simultaneously on the words miserere nobis. The unpreparedness of the entry rather than the discord is the problem. It is doubtful whether such a chord would have raised eyebrows in England where the dissonant music of Henry Purcell or William Lawes had been admired at court and church. Many of Valls' other works, however, use harmony which was highly unconventional at the time (see below).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is classically {{known that}} {{complete}} flat (that is, zero Gaussian curvature) surfaces in Euclidean 3 -space R 3 are cylinders over space curves. This {{implies that the}} study of global behaviour of flat surfaces requires the study of singular points as well. If <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> surface <b>f</b> admits singularities but its Gauss map ν is globally defined on the surface and can be smoothly extended across the singular set, <b>f</b> is called <b>a</b> frontal. In addition, if the pair (<b>f,</b> ν) defines <b>an</b> immersion into R 3 × S 2, <b>f</b> is called <b>a</b> front. <b>A</b> front <b>f</b> is called flat if the Gauss map degenerates everywhere. The parallel surfaces and the caustic (i. e. focal surface) of <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> front <b>f</b> are also flat fronts. In this paper, we generalize the classical notion of completeness to flat fronts, and give a representation formula for <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> front which has a non-empty compact singular set and whose ends are all immersed and complete. As an application, we show that such <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> front has properly embedded ends if and only if its Gauss map image is a convex curve. Moreover, we show the existence of at least four singular points other than cuspidal edges on such <b>a</b> <b>flat</b> front with embedded ends, which is a variant of the classical four vertex theorem for convex plane curves...|$|R
