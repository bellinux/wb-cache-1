5|$|Lisa {{locates the}} elderly man and confronts him; however, he injects {{her with the}} {{chemical}} after explaining that Lisa {{will be responsible for}} the coming future. Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunged the world into chaos. Jason lunges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man bursts into flames, and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{has been}} used as a {{location}} for a number of feature films. The Ashaig aerodrome was used for the opening scenes of the 1980 film Flash Gordon. Stardust, released in 2007 and starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, featured scenes near Uig, Loch Coruisk and the Quiraing. Another 2007 film, , was shot almost entirely in various locations on the island. Some of the opening scenes in Ridley Scott's 2012 feature film Prometheus were shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> of Storr. In 1973 The Highlands and Islands - a Royal Tour, a documentary about Prince Charles's visit to the Highlands and Islands, directed by Oscar Marzaroli, was shot partly on Skye.|$|E
25|$|The higher {{northern}} part of the Coniston range can be likened to an inverted 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. To the north are Swirl How, Great Carrs and Grey Friar, south east is the short spur terminating <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> of Coniston and to the south west the range continues over Dow Crag to the lower hills beyond.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Peste!' laughed {{the officer}} grimly, {{as he looked}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men</b> one after <b>the</b> other {{in the face and}} added with cool {{deliberate}} cruelty: 'Asleep on duty! Is this the manner of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Guard? No wonder, then, a Waterloo!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> sunrise <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{returned}} and asked after the sick man.|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> first <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> put him {{off with}} short answers, but the Fiddler was a master-hand at finding out {{anything}} he wanted to know. He dinned and drummed and worried until flesh and blood could stand it no longer. So <b>at</b> last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{said that he would}} show him the treasure-house where all his wealth came from, and <b>at</b> that <b>the</b> Fiddler was tickled beyond measure.|$|R
60|$|Nell looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> who {{nodded to}} her to retire, and kissed her cheek.|$|E
60|$|Miss Burroughs looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> with {{a puzzled}} air, but {{she asked him}} no questions.|$|E
60|$|The detective {{rose and}} stood before him, looking not <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{but at the}} young girl--Mary Louise.|$|E
60|$|Then, with a contemptuous glance <b>at</b> Jacob, <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{turned and}} glided {{back into the}} {{darkness}} out {{of which he had}} appeared.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{for a few}} moments, {{there was}} silence, while Dot and Tot stared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hairy <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and he stared at them.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>at</b> last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{laid down}} <b>the</b> dessert spoon {{which he used}} {{in place of a}} knife and fork, he looked again at George's plate, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Note 2. Author's note.--"Redclyffe {{must look}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> quietly and dreamily, and without surprise, {{for a long}} while." ...|$|E
60|$|David looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> curiously. Then he dismounted, {{and with}} his arm through the reins, leaned against the paling.|$|E
6000|$|Joan's sobs {{began to}} diminish, and she {{presently}} looked up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> through her tears, and said, in her simple way: ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} there was silence. Thacher stared <b>at</b> Erickson. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>man</b> was {{leaning back in his}} chair, sipping a little of his drink. Mara and Jan were silent.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the {{attention}} of Mohegan was attracted to the sounds; but, notwithstanding the youth was both silent and attentive, he could hear nothing but the lowing of some cattle from the western hills. He looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>men,</b> Natty sitting with {{his hand to his}} ear, like a trumpet, and Mohegan bending forward, with an arm raised to a level with his face, holding the forefinger elevated as a signal for attention, and laughed aloud at what he deemed to be imaginary sounds.|$|R
60|$|So {{he waited}} all day below the window, growing more hungry all <b>the</b> time. But <b>at</b> night <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man,</b> having {{returned}} from the village club, threw out both Mother and Child.|$|R
60|$|The crowd drew a long, quavering breath, staring {{alternately}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> {{still at}} attention, and ragged Kim against the purple twilight.|$|E
60|$|Had they glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{during this}} colloquy, {{they would have}} seen a blanched face, drawn with inward fear and rage.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean the}} man who came here yesterday?" [...] the widow asked, while Teddy and Sam gazed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> in {{open-mouthed}} astonishment.|$|E
60|$|I gazed so wildly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> good <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> I believe, {{that even}} his {{simplicity}} could not avoid seeing the immense {{difference between the}} real and the supposititious case.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's done! It's done! Go {{away with}} it! Go," [...] said the girovago, pushing <b>the</b> <b>old</b> roaster with his hand. And <b>at</b> last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> consented to depart, holding the kid like a banner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{dinner of}} an emperor!' when {{all sorts of}} food dishes appeared. <b>At</b> first <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> ate quite greedily, and said nothing; but, after his hunger was satisfied, he turned to Jack and said: ...|$|R
60|$|She thought suddenly: 'It's {{no longer}} mine; I {{must begin to}} be careful,' but she felt ashamed when she looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. George, returning, folds his arms, {{and looking}} down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> sliding every moment {{lower and lower}} in his chair, says quietly, [...] "Now for it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Uncle Jaw {{opened his}} eyes with amazement, and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> his mouth {{gradually}} expanding wider and wider, as if he hoped, in time, to swallow the idea.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> {{people looked}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little <b>old</b> <b>man</b> in amazement. [...] "Men of Manator," [...] he cackled in his thin, shrill voice, [...] "wouldst be {{ruled by a}} coward and a liar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>At</b> last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> {{turned and}} lifted his bloodshot eyes and uttered in a husky whisper, a few words which changed Primeau's whole expression. He drew back. [...] "Come away!" [...] he said to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{might be}} too late to see Lize. Lee's voice showed great anxiety. She may be on her death-bed. No; you'd better go down with me to-day," [...] he urged. And <b>at</b> last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> consented.|$|R
60|$|Slowly {{and with}} downcast face Bill Dangler crawled {{from the small}} cellar and pulled himself up {{to the floor of}} the cabin. He gazed reproachfully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> who was again trembling.|$|E
60|$|Mr List's squint {{assumed a}} portentous character, {{which seemed to}} {{threaten}} a prolongation of this controversy, when his companion, who had been looking sharply <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> put a timely stop to it.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} in the outer court, the knight said to the Jew, [...] "Isaac of York, dost thou not know me?" [...] and threw back his hood, and looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
60|$|He glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>man.</b> <b>The</b> latter's {{eyes were}} half-closed and his pose was slack, {{as if he}} were languidly enjoying the warmth, but Jim thought he had been listening. Then he {{wondered}} why the other's short description had given him so distinct a picture; he could see the rugged blue hills in the background and the river winding among the sands. After all, his father had not talked about Langrigg often; in fact, only once or twice, when he was ill. Moreover, Jim reflected that he himself had used no Western colloquialisms; he had talked to the strangers like an Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I slept thirty {{hours after}} I got back here. And now I am slowly digesting these experiences. Most of our fellows are. My mind and nerves have been rather bumped and bruised by the shelling, {{but not so}} much as you might think. I feel as though I'd {{presently}} not think very much of it. Some of our men have got the stun of it a lot more than I have. It gets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>men</b> more. Everybody says that. The men of over thirty-five don't recover from a shelling for weeks. They go about--sort of hesitatingly....|$|R
60|$|The outlaw was {{speaking}} to his captains in council; <b>at</b> his side <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> of Torn.|$|R
