500|$|Miller {{explained}} {{the lack of}} critical attention he received as follows: [...] "Guys who do what I am doing are viewed as passé." [...] He also contrasted his own approach with that of performers who produced [...] "interview music": [...] "something that's obviously different, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> interviews and {{a certain amount of}} attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and Hubert Selby, Jr., saw no reason the content in their works couldn't translate well to rock and roll music. An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious". [...] "That's the kind of stuff you might read. Why wouldn't you listen to it? You have the fun of reading that, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> fun of rock on top of it." ...|$|E
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E

500|$|Christman {{contacted}} the Scientology critics based in Clearwater, and arranged flight transportation to Florida. She {{arrived at the}} airport in California to find that her flight was cancelled. Her former supervisor, Janet Weiland, was waiting for her close to the ticket counter, and tried to convince her to remain in the organization. Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun. [...] If I can have that experience in any genre, I'd take it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author and journalist, Peter Sacks, narrows the {{argument}} by suggesting a direct {{correlation between the}} wealth of school and its rank. He suggests that [...] "the ranking amounts {{to little more than}} a pseudo-scientific and yet popularly legitimate tool for perpetuating inequality between educational haves and have nots -- the rich families from the poor ones, and the well-endowed schools from the poorly endowed ones. Toss in the most heavily weighted factor in the U.S. News survey, the assessment of deans, college presidents, admissions officials and others regarding their peer institutions (a beauty contest that constitutes a full 25 percent of the U.S. News ranking), <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> perfect recipe for a self-perpetuating, class-based rankings system driven by brand names, marketing hype, and prestige." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{as simple}} as A B C," [...] he continued. [...] "You point the short hand at the sun, then you bisect the segment between the short hand and <b>the</b> twelve, <b>and</b> thus <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> north." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As we do here. It's in {{your blood}} and our blood. It's the {{instinct}} of the English and the Irish anyhow to suspect government and take the risks of the chancy way.... And manifestly the Russians, if you read their novelists, have the same twist in them.... When we get this young Prussian here, he's a marvel to us. He really believes in Law. He likes to obey. That seems a sort of joke to us. It's curious how foreign these Germans are--to {{all the rest of}} the world. Because of their docility. Scratch the Russian <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Tartar. Educate the Russian or the American or the Englishman or the Irishman or Frenchman or any real northern European except the German, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Anarchist, that is to say the man who dreams of order without organisation--of something beyond organisation....|$|E
6000|$|... "There a won't be any need," [...] {{the other}} replied. [...] "One hears {{a great deal}} of rot talked about these affairs, but so far as I know, nothing very much out of the way goes on.

60|$|I {{can show}} you how in this {{shepherd}} boy it was very wonderful indeed, if you will walk for five minutes back into the church with me, and up into the chapel {{at the end of}} the south transept,--at least if the day is bright, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Sacristan to undraw the window-curtain in the transept itself. For then the light of it will be enough to show you the entirely authentic and most renowned work of Giotto's master; and you will see through what schooling the lad had gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Playing {{minstrel}} {{shows in}} it yet, I suppose. Well, girls, {{if you say}} Sicily, Sicily it is. All I'm after is {{to give you a}} good time, <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> volcano habit it isn't my fault." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'The poetry prize system,' said he--it is {{astonishing}} what nonsense a man, ordinarily intelligent, will talk after dinner--'is on {{exactly the same}} principle as those penny-in-the-slot machines that you see at stations. You insert your penny. You set your prize subject. In the former case you hope for wax vestas, and you get butterscotch. In the latter, you hope for something at least readable, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> most complete, terrible, uninspired twaddle that was ever written on paper.

Now they tell me that they serve Welsh rabbits on Surf Avenue, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right change back in the movin'-picture joints.|$|E
60|$|It cuts both ways. Assert sex as the {{predominant}} fulfillment, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> collapse of living purpose in man. You get anarchy. Assert purposiveness {{as the one}} supreme and pure activity of life, and you drift into barren sterility, like our business life of to-day, and our political life. You become sterile, you make anarchy inevitable. And so there you are. You have got to base your great purposive activity upon the intense sexual fulfillment of all your individuals. That was how Egypt endured. But {{you have got to}} keep your sexual fulfillment even then subordinate, just subordinate to the great passion of purpose: subordinate by a hair's breadth only: but still, by that hair's breadth, subordinate.|$|E
5000|$|Channel 4 said of Good Screenings,“that's {{the beauty}} of the system - you screen the film, raise {{awareness}} of the key issues, help the film-makers earn a living to go on to make their next film for good, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> cash <b>you</b> make on the night.” ...|$|R

60|$|These {{nightmare}} {{images are}} very frequently purely mechanical: as of falling terribly downwards, or being enclosed in vaults. And such images are pure physical transcripts. The image of falling, of flying, {{of trying to}} run {{and not being able}} to lift the feet, of having to creep through terribly small passages, these are direct transcripts from the physical phenomena of circulation and digestion. It is the directly transcribed image of the heart which, impeded in its action by the gases of indigestion, is switched out of its established circuit of earth-polarity, and is as if suspended over a void, or plunging into a void: step by step, falling downstairs, maybe, according to the strangulation of the heart beats. The same paralytic inability to lift the feet when one needs to run, in a dream, comes directly from the same impeded action of the heart, which is thrown off its balance by some material obstruction. Now the heart swings left and right in the pure circuit of the earth's polarity. Hinder this swing, force the heart over to the left, by inflation of gas from the stomach or by dead pressure upon the blood and nerves from any obstruction, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sensation of being unable to lift the feet from earth: a gasping sensation. Or force the heart to over-balance towards the right, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> sensation of flying or of falling. The heart telegraphs its distress to the mind, and wakes us. The wakeful soul at once begins to deal with the obstruction, which was too much for the mechanical night-circuits. The same holds good of dreams of imprisonment, or of creeping through narrow passages. They are direct transfers from the squeezing of the blood through constricted arteries or heart chambers.|$|E
6000|$|What ails you, miserable man, to talk {{of saving}} material?
