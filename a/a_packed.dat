5|$|At a hotel, Borat, {{just out}} of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch booklet. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.|$|E
5|$|Exact {{details of}} her death {{eventually}} came to light; she boarded <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> boat with 70 other people {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mediterranean Sea and reach Italy. The boat soon ran out of petrol and was adrift off the coast of Libya. When an Italian Navy vessel arrived to offer assistance, it threw ropes over the side to the refugees. In the chaos that ensued as people attempting to grab the ropes, Omar was knocked into the sea, where witnesses saw her treading water for a while, but eventually drowned.|$|E
5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts}} of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally {{be put on the}} king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E

5|$|During the {{build-up}} to the 1978 FIFA World Cup, MacLeod fuelled {{the hopes}} of the nation by stating that Scotland would come home with a medal. As the squad left for the finals in Argentina, they were given an enthusiastic send-off as they were paraded around <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> Hampden Park. Thousands more fans lined the route to Prestwick Airport as the team set off for South America. Scotland's first game was against Peru in Córdoba. Two spectacular goals by Teófilo Cubillas meant that {{the result was a}} 3–1 loss. The second game was a very disappointing 1–1 draw against Iran. The disconsolate mood of the nation was reflected by footage of Ally MacLeod in the dugout with his head in his hands.|$|E
5|$|In early December 2014 it was {{announced}} that the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai would host the final of the Indian Super League. It was also announced that tickets for the final would be available online from 8 December 2014. On 18 December 2014, one day after the semi-finals had concluded, it was reported that <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> crowd was expected for the final. According to the owner of the DY Patil Stadium, Vijay Patil, the stands during the Indian Super League final will be just as full as they were during the 2008 Indian Premier League Final.|$|E

50|$|Aristotle {{claimed that}} tetrahedra could fill space completely. In 2006, Conway and Torquato showed that <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> {{fraction}} about 72% {{can be obtained}} by constructing <b>a</b> non-Bravais lattice <b>packing</b> of tetrahedra (with multiple particles with generally different orientations per repeating unit), and thus they showed that the best tetrahedron <b>packing</b> cannot be <b>a</b> lattice <b>packing</b> (with one particle per repeating unit such that each particle has a common orientation). These packing constructions almost doubled the optimal Bravais-lattice-packing fraction 36.73% obtained by Hoylman. In 2007 and 2010, Chaikin and coworkers experimentally showed that tetrahedron-like dice can randomly <b>pack</b> in <b>a</b> finite container up to <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction between 75% and 76%. In 2008, Chen was the first to propose <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> of hard, regular tetrahedra that packed more densely than spheres, demonstrating numerically <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 77.86%. A further improvement was made in 2009 by Torquato and Jiao, who compressed Chen's structure using a computer algorithm to <b>a</b> <b>packing</b> fraction of 78.2021%.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if she goes to the police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to <b>a</b> <b>packed</b> house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

5000|$|The modern word is French, {{deriving}} from Middle French where it {{referred to a}} court official charged with transportation of supplies. [...] This {{use of the term}} dates to <b>a</b> period when <b>pack</b> animals would be used to transport supplies. The Middle French probably finds its origin in Old Provençal where a saumalier was <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> animal driver. Sauma referred to <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> animal or the load of <b>a</b> <b>pack</b> animal. In Late Latin, sagma referred to a packsaddle.|$|R
