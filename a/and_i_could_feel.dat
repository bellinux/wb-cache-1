2500|$|Dallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: [...] "Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they {{injected}} {{me for a}} cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's what he told me, Ruby did. I {{said you}} don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [...] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{a piece of paper}} in his palm… [...] {{he said it was a}} conspiracy and he said … if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
60|$|She sobbed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the tremor {{run through}} the pelican.|$|E
6000|$|... "That has eased her, a bit," [...] Fairclough said, when Hardy rejoined him. [...] "They {{helped to}} pin her down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> the difference, as each gun went overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|I only {{ventured to}} take one spoonful of it ("Sylvie's Summer-Soup," [...] Bruno said it was), and must candidly confess {{that it was not}} at all nice; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> {{surprised}} that so many of the guests had kept their mouths shut up tight.|$|R
60|$|What {{manner of}} thing was upon me I did not know, {{but that it}} was large and heavy <b>and</b> many-legged <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel.</b> My hands were at its throat before the fangs had a chance to bury {{themselves}} in my neck, <b>and</b> slowly <b>I</b> forced the hairy face from me and closed my fingers, vise-like, upon its windpipe.|$|R
60|$|I took Isobel's hand. It {{was cold}} as ice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{that she was}} {{trembling}} violently.|$|E
60|$|My eyes fluttered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{the blood}} warm in my face. It {{was not that}} he had caught me in my solicitude, but that I had caught myself, and in his presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's mumma's naughty boy {{doing out}} of bed? Shall I beat him?" [...] And {{the other hand}} was laid against my other cheek, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the soft curls {{mingling}} with my own.|$|E
6000|$|... "'The Baas Allan {{is going}} to fight a very great battle in which he may well fall, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> sorry here, which I can't, I should weep, O reverend sir, because I have died before that battle began and {{therefore}} cannot stand at his side in the battle and be killed {{for him as a}} servant should for his master!' ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its launch in October 2016, Michael wrote for Taykobon that [...] "I have already sampled the iOS app, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{definitely}} <b>feel</b> the appeal of a service that offers weekly updates to licensed translations...There's a palpable excitement in the fandom already at the prospect of a light novel streaming service, and hopefully J-Novel Club will be able to capitalize on it." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 434...I had {{a curious}} intuition...I seemed {{to sense that}} the ball would be a short-pitched one on the leg-stump, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> myself getting ready to make my shot before the ball was delivered. Sure enough, it pitched exactly where <b>I</b> had anticipated, <b>and,</b> hooking it to the square-leg boundary, I {{established}} the only record upon which I had set my heart.|$|R
60|$|Steele {{stood at}} our backs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his presence. He thrilled me. He {{had some kind}} of effect on the others, {{especially}} the dealer, who was honest enough while the Ranger looked on.|$|E
6000|$|... "My word!" [...] he said, {{between his}} gasps, [...] "that was touch and go. If I hadn't managed to catch that rock, and {{known how to}} swim, I should have been done. It runs like a mill-race, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> no bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|Once (once only) I went absent-mindedly {{into his}} shop {{in a pair}} of boots bought in an {{emergency}} at some large firm's. He took my order without showing me any leather, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his eyes penetrating the inferior integument of my foot. At last he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`I {{have left}} it,' he said very sadly. `It {{was not the}} house that grew dull, but I that grew dull in it. My wife was better than all women, <b>and</b> yet <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Happy--" [...] thought Hepzibah, bitterly conscious, at the word, of her {{dull and}} heavy heart, with the frozen pain in it,--"happy. He is mad already; <b>and,</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> once <b>feel</b> myself broad awake, I should go mad too!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The lamps {{could not}} have been lighted yet in the street outside. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see nothing against the {{darkness}} but the shining shop-window. There were no sounds of steps or voices in the street; I might have strayed into some new and sunless world. But something had cut the chords of common sense, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> even surprise except sleepily. Something made me say, [...] "You look ill, Father Christmas." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} {{for a time}} looking down at me <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel,</b> perplexed by me, but I {{wanted to go on}} with my thinking, and so I did not look up, and presently she stooped to my forehead and kissed me and went rustling softly to her room.|$|E
60|$|When having, as I have said, come to {{the rear}} of Master Lord's house and I had knelt down to raise the turf, which was much like unto a lid, Seth Jepson's small remnant of courage fled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the scoundrel sink beneath my hand as if his life had {{suddenly}} taken flight.|$|E
60|$|It was horrible. I was {{trembling}} all over, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the shivers {{running up and}} down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead. Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was exactly}} as Cheeko would have spoken, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>feel</b> {{sorry for him}} {{even though he had}} insulted me. He {{stood at the edge of}} the thorn bushes a minute, {{twisting}} and turning his tail as if he wanted to attract the attention of every member of the club to his folly, and then out he went, running the best he knew how across the open space at the foot of the tree.|$|R
60|$|I {{began my}} discourses with Walkirk with much less {{confidence}} and pleasurable anticipation than I had felt {{with regard to}} the quiet, unassuming elderly person who had been my first listener, <b>and</b> whom <b>I</b> had supposed to be a very model of receptivity. The new man I feared would demand more,--if not by word, at least by manner. He would be more like an audience; I should find myself striving to please him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> careless whether he liked what I said or not.|$|R
60|$|I {{tried to}} speak {{cautiously}} about him again to Jessie, as Owen had advised me; but I am so old and feeble now that this ill-omened storm has upset me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> sure enough of my own self-control to venture on matching myself to-day against a light-hearted, lively girl, with all her wits about her. It is so important that I should not betray George--it would be so inexcusable on my part if his interests suffered, even accidentally, in my hands.|$|R
60|$|Then I rose, {{and going}} to the open window, drew up the blind and stood there staring at the sky, which grew pearl-hued with the first faint tinge of dawn. Leo came also and leant upon the window-sill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that his body was {{trembling}} as though with cold. Clearly he was much moved.|$|E
6000|$|A surging {{of the mob}} was {{sweeping}} our horses {{along and}} grinding our knees together. Some fanatic had fallen, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> my horse recoil and half rear as it tramped on him, and I could hear the man screaming and the snarling menace from all about rising to a roar. But my head was over my shoulder as I called back to Miriam: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a couple}} of minutes we ran softly {{alongside}} the bank, and the sail was silently lowered. The Chinese kept very quiet. Yellow Handkerchief sat down in the bottom alongside of me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him straining to repress his raspy, hacking cough. Possibly seven or eight minutes later I heard Charley's voice as the Reindeer went past the mouth of the slough.|$|E
60|$|There was an {{expression}} of ineffable sadness on {{her face as she}} spoke, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not but <b>feel</b> that she knew that I knew her secret, and that this was her way of transmitting to you a last tender message from a heart that might still enshrine your memory, though its possessor belonged to another.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>and</b> again <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{that one}} or other of us was forcing conversation, {{as if we were}} not sure of ourselves. The long wait was {{beginning}} to tell on our nerves. It was apparent to me that Mr. Trelawny had suffered in that strange trance more than we suspected, or than he cared to show. True, his will and his determination were as strong as ever; but the purely physical side of him had been weakened somewhat. It was indeed only natural that it should be. No man can go through a period of four days of absolute negation of life without being weakened by it somehow.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{such cases}} as this, it is, I believe, the {{established}} mode {{to express a}} sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> gratitude, <b>I</b> would now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation." ...|$|R
60|$|And all {{the while}} we sweltered in the terrible heat, for the sun pierced through the deck {{planking}} of the vessel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> by her lack of motion that we were becalmed and drifting. I stood up, and by resting my heels upon a rib {{of the ship and}} my back against her side, I found myself in a position whence I could see the feet of the passers-by on the deck above.|$|E
60|$|At a quarter-past {{three that}} {{afternoon}} I was ushered into {{the presence of}} the Duke of Rowchester. I had never seen him before, and his personality at once interested me. He was a small man, grey-haired, keen-eyed, clean shaven. He received me in a somewhat bare apartment, which he alluded to as his workroom, and I found him seated before a desk strewn with papers. He rose immediately at my entrance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that he was taking more than usual note of my appearance.|$|E
60|$|The {{difference}} was appreciable at once when that huge spread of canvas opposed the wind. The Elsinore fairly leaped and quivered as she sprang to it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> her eat to windward as she {{at the same}} time drove faster ahead. Also, in the rolls and gusts, she was forced down till her lee-rail buried and the sea foamed level across to her hatches. Mr. Pike watched her like a hawk, and like certain death he watched the Maltese Cockney and Tom Spink at the wheel.|$|E
60|$|But {{the woman}} from the woods still came nearer <b>and</b> nearer, until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> her hot breath on my face. Her eyes looked into mine, and fascinated them, as she held out her arms to embrace me. I touched her hand, and in an instant the touch ran through me like fire, from head to foot. Then, still looking intently on me with her wild bright eyes, she clasped her supple arms round my neck, and drew me a few paces away with her towards the wood.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 We waited patiently for {{darkness}} to fall. Huddled {{on the edge}} of the woods, we wore several layers of gray and black Hanes sweatshirts and sweatpants, each of which clung tightly to our small bodies. Dried leaves crinkled as we shifted our weight from one leg to the other. Burdock adhered itself to every piece of accessible <b>and</b> exposed fabric. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the debris of the woods; small sticks, dirt, stone and leaves inhabited my stringy dirty blonde hair. 2 ̆...|$|R
5000|$|Simpson and his wife, {{the former}} Lynne Alice Livingston left Laramie around 2011 {{to return to}} Cody. Their younger son, Peter K. Simpson, Jr. is an Obie Award- winning actor and long time performer, writer, {{director}} and trainer for Blue Man Group. In 2010, he appeared at UW as Prince Hamlet in a theatre production of the Shakespearean play, with Pete Simpson cast as the Ghost of Hamlet's father. The junior Simpson recalls, with [...] "the ghost <b>and</b> son scene, ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> an energy shift in the room. It {{was hard not to}} get misty eyed." ...|$|R
