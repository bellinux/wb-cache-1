5|$|The Delhi Metro uses cab {{signalling}} {{along with}} a centralised automatic train control system consisting of <b>automatic</b> <b>operation,</b> protection and signalling modules. A 380MHz digital trunked TETRA radio communication system from Motorola is used on all lines to carry both voice and data information. For Blue Line Siemens Transportation Systems has supplied the electronic interlocking Sicas, the operation control system Vicos OC 500 and the automation control system LZB 700 M. An integrated system comprising optical fibre cable, on-train radio, CCTV, and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies. For Red and Yellow lines ALSTOM has supplied signalling system and for Green and Violet lines Bombardier Transportation has supplied CITYFLO 350 signalling system.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the ballonet valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the ballonet before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the ballonet was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E

This line uses the U2 tunnel between Rathenauplatz and Rothenburger Straße and diverts north of Rathenauplatz to the {{northwest}} and south of Rothenburger Straße to the southwest of Nuremberg. The U3 line has fully <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> without drivers.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of delays, the final three-month test run was {{successfully}} completed on April 20, 2008, and the operating licence granted on April 30, 2008. A few days later the driverless trains started operating with passengers, first on Sundays and public holidays, then weekdays at peak hours, and finally after the morning rush hour which has a tight sequence of U2 trains. The official opening ceremony for the U3 line was held on June 14, 2008 {{in the presence of}} the Bavarian Prime Minister and Federal Minister of Transport, the regular operation began with the schedule change on 15 June 2008. The Nuremberg U-bahn plans to convert U2 to <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> in about a year.|$|E

25|$|Light rail is {{generally}} powered by electricity, usually {{by means of}} overhead wires, but sometimes by a live rail, also called third rail (a high voltage bar alongside the track), requiring safety measures and warnings to the public not to touch it. In some cases, particularly when initial funds are limited, diesel-powered versions have been used, {{but it is not}} a preferred option. Some systems, such as AirTrain JFK in New York City, are automatic, dispensing with the need for a driver; however, such systems are not what {{is generally}} thought of as light rail, crossing over into rapid transit. <b>Automatic</b> <b>operation</b> is more common in smaller people mover systems than in light rail systems, where the possibility of grade crossings and street running make driverless operation of the latter inappropriate.|$|E
25|$|Under <b>automatic</b> <b>operation,</b> the on-train {{computer}} instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track circuit system. The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E
25|$|On 7 July 2005 three bombs {{exploded}} on underground trains, {{two on the}} Circle line at Aldgate and Edgware Road and the third on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross and Russell Square. Later the same day a bomb {{exploded on}} a bus in Woburn Place. Four suicide bombers had killed themselves and fifty-two other people, and it took over a month before underground services had been restored. In 2007 the East London line, operated as an isolated shuttle since 1939, closed {{so that it could}} be converted into a London Overground line. In December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London {{on the north side of}} the River Thames to a spiral serving Hammersmith. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to all trains, in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013. The sub-surface (Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City) lines are being upgraded, with new air-conditioned S Stock in use on the Metropolitan and due to replace the current C and D stock trains on the other lines by 2017. Also, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are being upgraded in a programme designed to increase peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s.|$|E

500|$|Until 1961 the {{lighthouse}} was administered as a shore station, and subsequently (after the resident population of Stroma had left) {{as a rock}} station. An electric lamp with a maximum power of 1.1 million cp was installed in 1972, utilising a sealed beam optic mounted on a gearless revolving pedestal. By this time the keepers and their families {{were the only people}} living on Stroma. A helicopter pad was installed to enable supplies and personnel to be flown in. In 1997 the station was converted to <b>automatic</b> <b>operation,</b> utilising a 250 watt metal halide lamp which rotates on a gearless pedestal. A lens system from Sule Skerry lighthouse was refitted in the Stroma lighthouse. The old air-driven fog horn was removed and replaced by an electric fog signal which is installed on the balcony of {{the lighthouse}}.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the forming control using a forming process model of rheological food dough is pre-sented. Manipulative operations of rheological objects {{can be found in}} many industrial fields such as food industry and medical product industry. For example, <b>automatic</b> <b>operations</b> of rheological objects such as food dough are eagerly required in food industry. Since food dough deforms during operation processes, it is neces-sary to estimate their deformation for the <b>automatic</b> <b>operations.</b> We will propose a forming control of rheological food dough using a forming process model. First, an extensional forming system of food dough is develope-d. Second, we will examine the deformations of actual food dough. Third, we will propose a forming process model consisting of the expansion part and the residu-al part. Finally, we will propose forming control using forming process model and will demonstrate the valid-ity of the proposed forming control experimentally. ...|$|R

2500|$|For some lenses, {{including}} a few long telephotos, lenses mounted on bellows, and perspective-control and tilt/shift lenses, the mechanical linkage was impractical, and automatic aperture control was not provided. [...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working aperture and full aperture without looking at the aperture control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to full aperture for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than <b>automatic</b> <b>operation.</b> Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5. [...] The Nikon PC Micro-Nikkor 85mm 2.8D lens incorporates a mechanical pushbutton that sets working aperture when pressed and restores full aperture when pressed a second time.|$|E
2500|$|Trusts {{are usually}} {{created by a}} settlor, who gives assets {{to one or more}} {{trustees}} who undertake to use the assets for beneficiaries. Like in contract law no formality is required to make a trust, except where statute demands it (e.g. transfers of land, shares, for wills). To protect the settlor, English law demands a reasonable degree of certainty that a trust was intended. To be able to enforce the trust's terms, the courts also require reasonable certainty about which assets were entrusted, and which people were meant to be the trust's beneficiaries. Unlike some offshore tax havens and the United States, English law requires that a trust has at least one beneficiary if it is not charitable. The Charity Commission monitors how charity trustees perform their duties, and ensures charities serve the public interest. Pensions and investment trusts are closely regulated to protect people's savings and ensure that trustees or fund managers are accountable. Beyond these expressly created trusts, English law recognises [...] "resulting" [...] and [...] "constructive" [...] trusts that arise by <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> of law to prevent unjust enrichment, to correct wrongdoing or to create property rights where intentions are unclear. Although the word [...] "trust" [...] is used, resulting and constructive trusts are different because they mainly create property-based remedies to protect people's rights, and do not merely flow (like a contract or an express trust) from the consent of the parties. Generally speaking, however, trustees owe a range of duties to their beneficiaries. If a trust document is silent, trustees must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, manage the trust's affairs with reasonable care and skill, and only act for purposes consistent with the trust's terms. Some of these duties can be excluded, except where the statute makes duties compulsory, but all trustees must act in good faith {{in the best interests of}} the beneficiaries. If trustees breach their duties, the beneficiaries may make a claim for all property wrongfully paid away to be restored, and may trace and follow what was trust property and claim restitution from any third party who ought to have known of the breach of trust.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{resulting}} trusts, {{where the}} courts have presumed that the transferor would have intended the property return, there are resulting trusts which arise by <b>automatic</b> <b>operation</b> of the law. A key example is where property is transferred to a trustee, but too much is handed over. The surplus will be held by the recipient on a resulting trust. For example, in the Privy Council case of Air Jamaica Ltd v Charlton an airline's pension plan was overfunded, so that all employees could be paid the benefits that they were due under their employment contracts, but a surplus remained. The company argued that it should receive the money, because it had attempted to amend the scheme's terms, and the Jamaican government argued that it should receive the money, as bona vacantia because the scheme's original terms had stated money was not {{to return to the}} company, and the employees had all received their entitlements. However, the Privy Council advised both were wrong and the money should return to those who had made contributions to the fund: half the company and half the employees, on resulting trust. This was in response, according to Lord Millett, [...] "to the absence of any intention on his part to pass a beneficial interest to the recipient." [...] In a similar pattern, it was held in Vandervell v Inland Revenue Commissioners that an option to repurchase shares in a company was held on resulting trust for Mr Vandervell when he declared the option to be held by his family trustees, but did not say who he meant the option to be held on trust for. Mr Vandervell had been trying to make a gift of £250,000 to the Royal College of Surgeons without paying any transfer tax, and thought that he could do it if he transferred the College some shares in his company, let the company pay out enough dividends, and then bought the shares back. However, the Income Tax Act 1952 section 415(2), applied a tax to a settlor of a trust for any income made out of trusts, if the settlor retained any interest whatsoever. Because Mr Vandervell did not say who the option was meant to be for, the House of Lords concluded the option was held on trust for him, and therefore he was taxed. It has also been said, that trusts which arise when one person gives property to another for a reason, but then the reason fails, as in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd are resulting in nature. However, Lord Millett in his judgment in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley' ',(dissenting on the knowing receipt point, leading on the Quistclose point) recategorised the trust which arises as an immediate express trust {{for the benefit of the}} transferor, albeit with a mandate upon the recipient to apply the assets for a purpose stated in the contract.|$|E
