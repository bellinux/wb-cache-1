40|$|This issue {{marks the}} 75 th anniversary of Morton Prince's {{founding}} of the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, {{the first issue of}} which was released on April 1, 1906. The 50 th Anniversary issue in 1956 included Henry A. Murray's brief account of the life and work of Morton Prince and also commemorated the 100 th anniversary of the birth of Sigmund Freud. On this occasion of the 75 th anniversary it seems proper to present a brief account {{of the history of the}} Journal of Abnormal Psychology. Since Gordon W. Allport discussed the history of the Journal from 1906 to 1938 (Allport, 1938), the present account will emphasize the changes that have occurred during the last 4 decades. The Journal's original title was The Journal of Abnormal Psychology. On the masthead of the first issue, Prince stated that the Journal was "primarily intended for the publication of articles embodying clinical and laboratory researches in abnormal mental phenomena. " Thus then, as now, the province of the Journal was research in abnormal psychology. In the masthead statement, Prince defined the field of abnormal psychology as follows: "The field of investigation includes, for instance, such subjects as hysteria, hallucinations, delusions, amnesia, <b>abulias,</b> aphasias, fixed ideas, obsessions, deliria, perversions, emotions and their influence, exaltations, depressions, habit neuroses and psychoses, phenomena of hypnosis...|$|R

5000|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex (ACC) {{is involved}} in emotional drives, experience and integration. Associated cognitive functions include inhibition of inappropriate responses, decision making and motivated behaviours. Lesions in this area can lead to low drive states such as apathy, <b>abulia</b> or akinetic mutism and may also result in low drive states for such basic needs as food or drink and possibly decreased interest in social or vocational activities and sex.|$|E
50|$|In {{small vessel}} disease, the frontal lobes are often affected. Consequently, {{patients}} with vascular dementia tend to perform worse than their Alzheimer's disease counterparts in frontal lobe tasks, such as verbal fluency, and may present with frontal lobe problems: apathy, <b>abulia,</b> problems with attention, orientation, and urinary incontinence. They tend to exhibit more perseverative behavior. VaD patients may also present with general slowing of processing ability, difficulty shifting sets, and impairment in abstract thinking. Apathy {{early in the}} disease is more suggestive of vascular dementia.|$|E

A patient with aboulia is unable to act or make decisions independently. It may range in severity from subtle to overwhelming. It is also known as Blocq's disease (which also refers to abasia and astasia-abasia). Aboulia was originally considered to be a disorder of the will.|$|E

50|$|Dementia is {{predominantly}} frontal lobe {{in nature and}} of the subcortical type of dementia. It presents {{in the form of}} <b>abulia,</b> forgetfulness, inertia, inattention, decreased speed of complex information procession (also described as a dullness in thinking and actions), and disturbed manipulation of acquired knowledge, which is reflective of the loss of integrity of the frontal lobes. Memory problems are usually a component of the overall problem and have been predominant in some cases, which can lead to the misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, in NPH there may be an obvious discrepancy between (often severely) impaired recall and intact or much less impaired recognition. The dementia is thought to result from traction on frontal and limbic fibers that also run in the periventricular region.|$|E
50|$|Kesselring {{had already}} {{authorized}} General Hans Hube (in {{command of the}} 14th Panzerkorps), on orders from OKW, to organize the withdrawal of his four divisions from Sicily and its redeployment in Calabria, which Hube skillfully carried out on 17 August (Operation Lehrgang). The {{vast majority of the}} German troops in Sicily, after an effective fighting retreat, managed to cross the Straits of Messina and even to save a great part of the heavy equipment. In the following days Hube deployed the 14th Panzerkorps (16th Panzer Division, 15th Panzergrenadier Division, and Hermann Goring Division) in the area between Naples and Salerno, while the 1st Parachutist Division was sent to <b>Abulia</b> and General Herr with the 76th Panzerkorps assumed the defense of Calabria with part of the 26th Panzer Division and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division; his orders were to carry out delaying actions in case of Allied attack across the straits.|$|E
50|$|The 7th Italian Army of General Mario Arisio was {{stationed}} in Calabria, Basilicata and Abulia; German forces in these regions were scarce, and were being moved north. On 9 September, the 7th Army headquarters in Potenza were attacked by surprise and captured by German troops, but the overall weakness of the German forces and the swift intervention of the Allied forces helped the Italian units, the majority of whom maintained unit cohesion. The 9th Corps (General Roberto Lerici) held central and northern <b>Abulia,</b> despite {{the collapse of the}} 209th Coastal Division; General Nicola Bellomo held the harbour of Bari until Allied forces arrived, while more south the 51st Corps of General De Stefani held its positions between Grottaglie and Lecce with the 58th Infantry Division Legnano, the 152nd Infantry Division Piceno and the 210th Coastal Division. The situation of the 31st Corps (General Mercalli), stationed in Calabria with three coastal divisions and the 104th Motorised Division Mantova, was more difficult: it was attacked by the 76th Panzerkorps and sustained casualties, and part of the 185th Parachute Regiment decided to remain loyal to the previous alliance with Germany and joined the 1st German Parachute Division.|$|E
40|$|<b>Abulia</b> {{refers to}} an {{impairment}} of will, or the inability to initiate behaviour and action. There are reports of successful treatment of akinetic mutism, the most severe form of <b>abulia,</b> with bromocriptine. Four case studies are presented describing the successful treatment of <b>abulia</b> at a lesser severity than akinetic mutism with bromocriptine. <b>Abulia</b> was caused by brain damage due to alcohol in two cases, Wilson's disease and basal ganglia infarct in one each. Maximum bromocriptine dose varied from 25 - 70 mg. All improved considerably. Withdrawal or reduction of medication in three produced deterioration. The prescription of a neuroleptic drug had a similar effect in the fourth. One patient with a previous history developed a depressive relapse and so the drug was withdrawn and lisuride introduced. This produced a similar improvement. These cases highlight the value of identifying the syndrome of organic <b>abulia</b> and suggest that dopamine agonists may {{have a place in}} its treatment, though controlled studies are needed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abulia</b> is a {{clinical}} syndrome manifested {{by lack of}} spontaneity of action and speech, deficiency in initiation, apathy, inertia, mental and motor slowness, reduction in excur-sion of motion, poor attention, and easy distractibility. <b>Abulia</b> has been conceptualized as laying in a continuum of motivational and emotional deficit in which apathy is at one extreme and akinetic mutism at the other, more severe extreme. Lesions in the frontal lobes have been most often implicated in the causality of <b>abulia,</b> but other areas of involvement have also been described. Some authors have reported the beneficial effect of dopaminergic agents {{in the treatment of}} <b>abulia</b> and other related disorders. We report on four patients with various disorders of the CNS and abulic symptoms who had a ben-eficial response to administration of a carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) compound many months after the CNS insult responsible for the symptoms.

40|$|Background: Functional {{imaging and}} lesion studies have {{associated}} willed behavior with the {{anterior cingulate cortex}} (ACC). <b>Abulia</b> is a syndrome characterized by apathy and deficiency of motivated behavior. <b>Abulia</b> is most frequently associated with ACC damage, but also occurs following damage to subcortical nuclei (striatum, globus pallidus, thalamic nuclei). We present resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) data from an individual who suffered a stroke leading to <b>abulia.</b> We hypothesized that, although structural imaging revealed no damage to the patient's ACC, fcMRI would uncover aberrant function in this region and in the relevant cortical networks. Methods: Resting state correlations in the patient's gray matter were compared to those of age-matched controls. Using a novel method to identify abnormal patterns of functional connectivity in single subjects, we identified areas and networks with aberrant connectivity. Results: Networks associated with memory (default mode network) and executive function (cingulo-opercular network) were abnormal. The patient's anterior cingulate was among the areas showing aberrant functional connectivity. In a rescan 3  years later, deficits remained stable and fcMRI findings were replicated. Conclusions: These {{findings suggest that the}} aberrant functional connectivity mapping approach described may be useful for linking stroke symptoms to disrupted network connectivity...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Akinetic mutism (AKM) is an {{uncommon}} disorder with a complex neuropathology. There is no generally accepted treatment, {{and it is}} not known if late treatments are effective. The relationship between AKM and <b>abulia</b> is uncertain. Methods: The effects of dopaminergic treatment of a patient with chronic AKM after discrete bilateral infarctions of the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area and the lat-eral hypothalamus were studied with motor measures, the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and neuropsychological tests. Results: Treatment with a combination of carbidopa/levodopa and pergolide produced prompt amelioration of AKM with dra-matic and rapid improvement in FIM. An apathetic, amotivational state persisted de-spite resolution of akinesia and normal frontal executive functions. Conclusions: AKM may respond to dopaminergic treatment even after months of severe akinesia. The mechanism of <b>abulia</b> is more complex than simply a partial dopaminergic deficiency state and may persist even when AKM is treated and frontal cognitive functions ar...|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} case of a {{posterior}} fossa arterio-venous fistula (AVF) with bithalamic hyperintensity on MR images. The thalamic abnormality improved after surgery, suggesting reversible venous hypertension as the pathogen-esis of the finding, as opposed to infarction. This manifes-tation of a posterior fossa AVF should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bilateral thalamic disease. Bithalamic hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted MR im-ages has been reported with ‘‘top of the basilar’’ infarcts, deep venous thrombosis, and glial tumors (1). We report a case in which bithalamic hyper-intensity probably resulted from a dural arteriove-nous fistula (AVF) and subsequent venous hyper-tension.

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that the frontal lobes mediate complex human behavior and that damage to these regions can cause executive dysfunction, apathy, disinhibition and personality changes. However, it is less well known that subcortical structures such as the caudate and thalamus are part of functionally segregated fronto-subcortical circuits, that can also alter behavior after injury. Case presentation We present a 57 year old woman who suffered penetrating brain injury during endoscopic sinus surgery causing right basal ganglia injury which resulted in an abulic syndrome.

40|$|We {{propose that}} the basal ganglia support a basic attentional {{mechanism}} operating to bind input to output in the executive forebrain. Such focused attention provides the automatic link between voluntary effort, sensory input, and the calling up and operation of a sequence of motor programmes or thoughts. The physiological basis for this attentional mechanism {{may lie in the}} tendency of distributed, but related, cortical activities to synchronise in the gamma (30 to 50 Hz) band, as occurs in the visual cortex. Coherent and synchronised elements are more effective when convergence occurs during successive stages of processing, and in this way may come together to give the one gestalt or action. We suggest that the basal ganglia have a major role in facilitating this aspect of neuronal processing in the forebrain, and that loss of this function contributes to parkinsonism and <b>abulia...</b>|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{basal ganglia}} are {{interconnected}} with cortical areas involved in behavioural, cognitive and emotional processes, {{in addition to}} movement regulation. Little is known about which of these functions are associated with individual basal ganglia substructures. Methods: Pubmed was searched for literature related to behavioural, cognitive and emotional symptoms associated with focal lesions to basal ganglia structures in humans. Results: Six case-control studies and two case reports were identified as relevant. Lesion sites included the caudate nucleus, putamen and globus pallidus. These were associated with a spectrum of behavioural and cognitive symptoms, including <b>abulia,</b> poor working memory and deficits in emotional recognition. Discussion: It {{is often difficult to}} precisely map associations between cognitive, emotional or behavioural functions and particular basal ganglia substructures, due to the non-specific nature of the lesions. However, evidence from lesion studies shows that most symptoms correspond with established non-motor frontal-subcortical circuits...|$|E
40|$|A 36 {{year old}} man, who {{sustained}} a skull fracture in 1984, was unconscious for 24 hours, and developed signs of Parkinson's syndrome 6 {{weeks after the}} injury. When assessed in 1995, neuroimaging disclosed a cerebral infarction due to trauma involving the left caudate and lenticular nucleus. Parkinson's syndrome was predominantly right sided, slowly progressive, and unresponsive to levodopa therapy. Reaction time tests showed slowness of movement initiation and execution with both hands, particularly the right. Recording of movement related cortical potentials suggested bilateral deficits in movement preparation. Neuropsychological assessment disclosed no evidence of major deficits on tests assessing executive function or working memory, {{with the exception of}} selective impairments on the Stroop and on a test of self ordered random number sequences. There was evidence of <b>abulia.</b> The results are discussed in relation to previous literature on basal ganglia lesions and the effects of damage to different points of the frontostriatal circuits. ...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the complications of}} bilateral contemporaneous pallidotomy in Parkinson's disease. Background. Posteroventral pallidotomy is a recognized alternative {{in the management of}} severe Parkinson's disease with untreatable fluctuations. Methods. Four nondemented patients with advanced (Hoehn & Yahr stage 4) dopa-responsive Parkinson's disease with on-off fluctuations of the yoyoing type underwent contemporaneous bilateral ventral pallidotomy according to the technique described by Laitinen et al (1992). All patients had preoperative and postoperative careful evaluations according to the CAPIT protocol of assessment, except for PET scan, with additive neuropsychological testing, including personality and behavioral scales. Results. All patients had a more than 40 % improvement in the motor UPDRS score in both the best on and worst off states, and a mean 60 % improvement in the complication of treatment subscale with an almost complete but persistent disappearance of dyskinesia; however, there was a more than 60 % decrease in mean daily duration in off time. Activities of daily living (ADL) were improved by a mean of 30 %. One patient had a partially regressive corticobulbar syndrome with dysphagia and dysarthria and increased drooling without emotional lability, but also had a bilateral postoperative pretarsal blepharospasm interfering with walking, which was well responsive to botulinum toxin injections. No one had visual field loss or hemiparesis. Changes in personality and behavior were found in two patients. In spite of a 40 % improvement in motor and ADL, postoperative <b>abulia</b> was reported by the family of one patient who lost his preoperative aggressivity and drive in life; this patient also had loss of initiative in speech, business, family life, and hobbies, and more day sleepiness and fatigue. One patient reported postoperative mental automatisms (compulsive mental counting), as well as circular thoughts and reasoning in off phase, replacing preoperative depressive off mood. None of the patients reported these symptoms during microelectrode stimulation. Conclusions. This careful evaluation of a small sample of patients who underwent bilateral contemporaneous pallidotomy shows that subtle neuropsychological changes of opposite presentation, such as <b>abulia,</b> mental automatism, or obsessive compulsive behaviors, have to be looked for in the postoperative evaluation of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Social {{isolation}} is commonly reported in individuals with isolated cleft lip and palate (ICLP), {{and is often}} cited as due to secondary factors of living with a facial malformation. However, the data are mixed, and the literature is biased to self-report studies. This study aimed to go beyond self-report data, and various components of social functioning were examined {{in a group of}} males with and without ICLP. The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess and compare social motivation in ICLP, and to relate social adjustment to brain structure. It was predicted that males with ICLP would be more likely to be socially isolated; however, self-concept was predicted to be similar to the comparison group (NC). Additionally, males with ICLP were predicted to have reduced social motivation (i. e., social <b>abulia).</b> Finally, volumes of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the cerebellum were predicted to be related to social outcomes. The sample 2 ̆ 7 s age range was 13 - 25 years old, and 20 males with ICLP were compared to a group of 20 NC males. MRI scans were obtained from all the participants. As expected, males with ICLP were more likely to be socially isolated. Against predictions, they also had lower self-concept relative to the NC group. However, self-concept was not related to the extent of facial abnormality in the ICLP group. In line with predictions, the study did provide evidence for social <b>abulia</b> as a mechanism for social isolation, as males with ICLP had a more positive attitude after being socially excluded relative to excluded NC males. Unexpectedly however, the groups responded the same to social pressure, as all participants were more likely to take riskier turns in a driving simulator experiment when someone behind them was honking. Finally, social adjustment was significantly correlated with the volume of the mOFC, and posterior cerebellum white matter. Both correlations suggested that individuals with larger volumes were more likely to be better socially adjusted. In conclusion, the study provided evidence for a potentially different mechanism of social isolation in ICLP, and showed that brain morphology may at least partly underlie social dysfunction as well...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{interpret}} {{clinical features}} after unilateral lesions of the globus pallidus {{on the basis}} of physiology of the basal ganglia.  METHODS—Four patients with unilateral lesions in the globus pallidus (GP) were clinically examined and the literature on patients with pallidal lesions was reviewed.  RESULTS—Three patients presented with contralateral dystonia largely confined to one arm in one case and one leg in two cases. One patient had predominant contralateral hemiparkinsonism manifested mainly as micrographia and mild dystonia in one arm. The cause of the lesions was unknown in two patients. In the other two symptoms had developed after head trauma and after anoxia. All lesions involved the internal segment of the GP. Two patients, including the patient with hemiparkinsonism, had additional involvement of the external segment of the GP. In the literature reports on 26 patients with bilateral lesions restricted to the GP only two with unilateral lesions were found. The patients with bilateral pallidal lesions manifested with dystonia, parkinsonism, or <b>abulia.</b> One of the patients with unilateral GP lesions had contralateral hemidystonia, the other contralateral arm tremor.  CONCLUSION—These cases emphasise the importance of the GP, particularly its internal segment, in the pathophysiology of dystonia. ...|$|E
40|$|We studied 8 {{patients}} with frontal or temporolimbic neoplasms who had psychiatric presentations to clarify diagnostic criteria for distinguishing psychiatric disease from structural brain lesions {{and to examine}} brain-behavior relationships associated with cerebral neoplasms using modern neuroimaging techniques. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for evidence of neurobehavioral and neurologic manifestations, tumor histologic features, {{and the results of}} treatment. Clinical presentations were correlated with tumor location as determined by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with frontal lobe tumors presented with <b>abulia,</b> personality change, or depression, whereas those with temporolimbic tumors had auditory and visual hallucinations, mania, panic attacks, or amnesia. After treatment, neurobehavioral syndromes abated or resolved in 7 of 8 patients. We recommend that any patient 40 years of age or older with a change in mental state, cognitive or emotional, should have neuroimaging of the brain. Any patient with a psychiatric presentation who has specific neurobehavioral or neurologic findings or an unexpectedly poor response to psychopharmacologic treatment should also have brain imaging. These case reports extend and update observations on the importance of frontal and temporolimbic systems in the pathogenesis of neurobehavioral disorders. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the characteristic clinical features, radiologic findings, and precipitating and prognostic factors in the patients with breast cancer and with 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) -induced leukoencephalopathy. We reviewed the medical records of six breast cancer patients who developed leukoencephalopathy after chemotherapy which included 5 -FU and also evaluated thorough neurological examinations including mini-mental status examination, cerebrospinal fluid studies, brain images and brain biopsies. Six patients exhibited slowly progressing neurologic symptoms characterized by the impairment of cognitive function, <b>abulia,</b> ataxic gait, and/or akinetic mutism. None of the patients had any specific causes or etiologic factors for leukoencephalopathy. Brain MRI in all patients showed diffuse periventricular white matter changes in the T 2 -weighted MR image. Brain biopsy in Patient 1 showed fragmented axonal fiber and minimally deprived myelination with many scattered macrophages. Five patients who treated with steroids at the onset of neurological symptoms showed clinical improvement, regardless of their age, sex, the pathology and stage of breast cancer, or the total dosage of chemotherapeutic agents. We conclude that leukoencephalopathy in these cases could be attributable to 5 -FU neurotoxicity and suggest that the administration of steroids might be the treatment of choice...|$|E
