This study examines an innovative new market segment in the <b>music</b> recording industry: <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregation. <b>Digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregators are music distributors that directly connect artists, any creator of musical content, to <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> vendors, online music stores such as iTunes or <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> streaming services such as Spotify. <b>Digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregator companies offer services similar to major record labels, such as mass distribution, royalty collection, and intellectual property protection. <b>Digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregators provide services to artists at all levels of prestige and experience. Essentially any artist interested in publishing music can do so using <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregators. Despite their growing influence in the <b>music</b> recording industry, <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregators have been afforded little scholarly attention. This study responds to Galuszka's (2015) call for further research on aggregator market structure and competition, proposing the following research questions: 1) how is the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregator market structured? 2) What competitive strategies do <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> aggregators employ? This study is framed by the industrial organizational model of market structure (Bain, 1968) and Porter’s (1980) theories of competitive strategy. Six in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted for this study.

Currently, the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> duplication detection application can detect duplication of <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> records on the hard disk, but unfortunately, duplication still happened. Using these applications, the replicate <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> files can be searched and moved into other folders. The user needs to manually delete these files. This study presents a new approach called the Cognitive and Constructive Learning (CCL) approach to preventing duplication from occurring when a <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> file is inserted onto a personal device. This study reviews and adapts {{the requirements of the}} <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> technology, as well as the human recognition and learning concepts.

Two main research questions proposed were; “How is <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> distribution affecting the music industry? ” and “In what way does the piracy industry affect the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> industry? ” The methodology used for this research was performing case studies, researching prospective and retrospective data, and analyzing sales figures and graphs. Case studies were performed on one independent artist and two major artists whom changed the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> industry in different ways. Another pair of case studies were performed on an independent label and a major label on how changes of the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> industry effected their business model and how piracy effected those new business models as well.

I researched prospective data on how consumers adjusted to the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> advancements and how piracy industry has affected them.
