5|$|Tufaro criticized O'Malley's zero {{tolerance}} policy, suggesting {{it would lead}} to increased police brutality towards minorities.

5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. As {{there were not}} enough cars and coaches available to meet the massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E

5|$|In February 1970, {{the album}} was {{released}} by RCA Records. The cover art was completed by Dean Torrence, known for his teaming with Jan Berry to create {{the rock and roll}} duo Jan and Dean. Since Berry's near-fatal auto accident in 1966, Torrence had become a graphic artist; his sepia tone scene depicted Nilsson driving an old <b>American</b> <b>car</b> through the countryside with Newman in the back seat. The car is a 1938 Graham-Paige four-door sedan, rusty but working.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam Tiger is a {{high-performance}} V8 {{version of the}} British Rootes Group's Sunbeam Alpine roadster, designed in part by <b>American</b> <b>car</b> designer and racing driver Carroll Shelby and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the AC Cobra, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to Jensen at West Bromwich in England, and pay Shelby a royalty on every car produced.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{provided}} by a fleet of 108 carriages manufactured for the UERL in the United States by the <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> and Foundry Company and assembled in Manchester.

5|$|The Volt has won several awards, {{including}} the 2009 Green Car Vision Award, 2011 Green Car of the Year, 2011 North <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> of the Year, 2011 World Green Car, 2012 European Car of the Year, and 2016 Green Car of the Year. Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} {{provided}} by a fleet of carriages manufactured for the UERL by the <b>American</b> <b>Car</b> and Foundry Company and assembled at Trafford Park in Manchester. These carriages were built to the same design used for the BS and the GNP and operated as electric multiple unit trains {{without the need for}} separate locomotives. Passengers boarded the trains via folding lattice gates at each end of cars which were operated by Gate-men who rode on the outside platform and announced station names as trains arrived. The design became known on the Underground as the 1906 stock or Gate stock.|$|E
5|$|Houston pioneered <b>American</b> <b>car</b> {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} of inexpensive gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished at the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E
