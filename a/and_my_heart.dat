After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked {{on the details of}} what would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding more and more as I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E

He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall.
