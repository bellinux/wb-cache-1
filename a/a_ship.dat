5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or confuse an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> from view; deception, in which <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to confuse any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for relief workers to determine the needs of the affected residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent <b>a</b> <b>ship</b> and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra.|$|E
