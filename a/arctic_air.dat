5|$|January 24, 2003: A {{plume of}} <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> {{produces}} widespread record low temperatures and light snow flurries {{along the eastern}} coastline. The snow is described as ocean-effect snow, identical to lake effect snow in that it occurs due to very cold air passing over relatively warm water temperatures. The snow reaches {{as far south as}} Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke. These formations {{do not involve}} high wind speeds, only completing a few rotations per minute. Steam devils are very rare. They most often form from smoke issuing from a power plant's smokestack. Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold <b>arctic</b> <b>air</b> passes over relatively warm water.|$|E
5|$|The {{airport was}} {{originally}} planned as a conventional regional airport, but during its construction it was redesigned to accommodate larger jet aircraft. Originally owned by six local municipalities, {{it was taken}} over by the state in 1996. Norsk Air started operations in 1987, but terminated them the following year. Coast Air introduced state-subsidized services in 1990, and continued until the contract was won by Teddy Air in 1996. From 2000 the airport was served by Guard Air, but following their bankruptcy in 2001, services were taken over by Widerøe for six months, when <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> won a one-year contract. Coast Air resumed the service from 2003 to 2008, when they went bankrupt. Air Norway then operated services for one year, pending DOT LT's take over in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In October 2009 <b>Arctic</b> Circle <b>Air</b> was {{acquired}} by {{the parent company of}} Frontier Alaska. <b>Arctic</b> Circle <b>Air</b> was merged into the Era Alaska operation. Era Alaska is the renamed operation of Frontier Alaska now that it has been blended into the operating certificate of Era Aviation. In 2011 <b>Arctic</b> Circle <b>Air's</b> certificate was obtained by Marianas Harvests in Guam to provide service throughout the island areas of Guam, with no association with Era Alaska or Frontier Alaska.|$|R

5|$|The {{complex of}} {{refining}} and chemical companies is called Chemical Valley and located south of downtown Sarnia. While in 2011 {{the city had}} {{the highest level of}} particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, it has since dropped down to 30th. About 60 percent of the particulate matter, however, comes from the neighboring United States. Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia's humid continental climate, which makes temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls once over land.|$|E
5|$|Coast Air {{continued}} {{to provide a}} service until 1 August 1996, when Fagernes became a trial {{for the use of}} public service obligations for regional aviation in Norway. The first contract was won by Teddy Air, to serve both Oslo and Bergen. The contract agreed a subsidy of NOK 23.7 million for three years, 15% less than Coast Air had been receiving. Teddy Air operated until 1August 1999, when Widerøe took over using de Havilland Canada Dash 8-100 aircraft. At the same time, the route from Fagernes to Bergen was dropped from the schedule. Widerøe's contract lasted only eight months, until 1 April 2000, when Guard Air, who bid NOK 6.93 million per year, won the tender, and started flying with Dornier 228 aircraft. On 8October 2001, Guard Air filed for bankruptcy, and the ministry signed an intermediate contract with Widerøe to fly the route. The subsequent tender was won by <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air,</b> who continued operation until 31 March 2003, using Dornier 228 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Widerøe won {{back the}} Vardø {{contract}} in August 2002, thus curtailing <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> from operating the route. Also the Fagernes route was lost. However, <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> was experiencing record-high patronage on the Fagernes route, up eighteen {{percent from the}} previous year. Russian authorities decided in October 2002 that <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> would have to fly at a higher altitude than their aircraft without pressure cabins could withstand. Subsequently, <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> was forced to terminate its route from 25 October. <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> subsequently operated its last scheduled flight on 30 March 2003. The airline filed for bankruptcy in November 2003.|$|E

25|$|In 1999 {{the airline}} chose {{to bid for}} public service {{obligation}} contracts with the Ministry of Transport and Communications, bidding for the routes from Tromsø to Sørkjosen, from Tromsø to Hasvik and Hammerfest, {{as well as from}} Kirkenes to Vardø. The latter route was won in September, after <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> had bid 37 million kroner for the route. The incumbent, Widerøe, had bid 102 million. The contract, effective 1 April 2000 through 31 March 2003, was awarded in September. At the time the airline lacked suitable aircraft to operate the routes. <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> was met with local opposition. While flown by Widerøe, Vardø Airport, Svartnes had been connected to a network westwards as well as to Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. With <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> operating, only a feeder service would be provided. By December the population was generally satisfied with the thrice-daily service, and patronage had increased by fifteen percent since they had taken over.|$|E

25|$|<b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> was {{established}} by eleven businessmen in Kautokeino. It registered its two first aircraft, both Cessna 206s, in May 1996. The company began flying general aviation charter missions, with reindeer husbandry and the power company Statkraft as major customers. Operations were summer-only, and based out of various lakes in the municipality.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} air travel dropped in 2001, and only 85,000 {{passengers}} flew with Coast Air to Florø, {{instead of the}} estimated 100,000, making the entire operation a loss for the company. Despite this, Coast Air leased a third ATR 42 aircraft in February 2002. But cancellations continued to rise, and in November the company's subsidies from the ministry were reduced {{due to lack of}} performance. In December 2001, Guard Air was forced to terminate all operations, and a new PSO tender was made for the services to Fagernes. Along with <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air,</b> Widerøe and DAT, Coast Air made a bid. The contract was won by <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air.</b> With the next round of PSO contracts, valid from 1 April 2003 through 31 March 2006, Coast Air lost the Florø contract to DAT, but succeeded at winning the contract for Fagernes for NOK10 million per year.|$|E
25|$|These storms {{are known}} as Nor'easters and often bring widespread, heavy {{snowfall}} to New England.

25|$|Initially <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> {{operated}} two Cessna 206 seaplanes, {{mostly in}} Kautokeino. After unexpectedly winning the 2000 to 2003 PSO tender to link Kirkenes to Vardø, the airline leased its first Do 228. A year later services were also introduced to Alta, Lakselv as was an international route to Murmansk. From 2002 the airline won a PSO contract to link Fagernes to Oslo. After losing both contracts in the 2003 tender, {{the company was}} liquidated.|$|E
25|$|Itasca State Park lies in {{northern}} Minnesota; a location {{that can be}} affected by three major air masses. An <b>Arctic</b> <b>air</b> stream extends south from Canada during the winter months; Pacific air that follows strong west winds move over the area and during the summer month a tropical air stream flows north from the Gulf of Mexico. These various air masses have a strong effect on the climate of the area around Itasca State Park.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{started with}} two new {{commercial}} services from 2 April 2001, to better utilize their aircraft. The first was an onward connection from Vardø to Alta Airport, {{the second was}} an thrice-weekly international service from Kirkenes to Murmansk Airport. The route connected with flights at Kirkenes onwards to Tromsø, Alta and Oslo. From July Finnair started a thrice-weekly service from Helsinki via Rovaniemi to Lakselv. <b>Arctic</b> <b>Air</b> joined forces through establishing a feeder service to Lakselv Airport, Banak from Vardø, corresponding with the Finnair flights.|$|E
50|$|Decreased {{oxygen and}} low-pH during La Niña are {{processes}} that correlate with decreased primary production {{and a more}} pronounced poleward flow of ocean currents. It has been proposed that the mechanism of increased <b>Arctic</b> surface <b>air</b> temperature anomalies during La Niña periods of ENSO {{may be attributed to}} the tropically excited Arctic warming mechanism (TEAM), when Rossby waves propagate more poleward, leading to wave dynamics and an increase in downward infrared radiation.|$|R
