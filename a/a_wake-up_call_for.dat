25|$|Russia's February Revolution caught Pântea entrenched {{with his}} men {{somewhere near the}} town of Roman. The news, he later wrote, was <b>a</b> <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Bessarabian Romanians in foreign lands, since it offered the {{prospect}} of self-determination at home. As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, Pântea became President of the Ninth Army's Soviet, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some—Catelli, Anton Crihan, Constantin Osoianu, Ion Păscăluță, Andrei Scobioală—were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as Novorossiya (Elefterie Sinicliu) or Crimea (Grigore Turcuman).|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith said he {{considers}} [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] {{to be one}} of the band's strongest works, and called it [...] "the best pop song the Cure have ever done". Several high-profile fans have expressed their appreciation of the song. Musician Ben Folds told Blender [...] "everything about it—the songwriting, the music—is state of the art. It’s as good as it gets. Anytime I hear it on the radio or a mix tape, I jump around like a freak." [...] J Mascis said his band Dinosaur Jr.'s affection for the song inspired them to record a cover version that was released in 1989. On 16 July 2006, [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] was played as <b>a</b> <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the crew of Space Shuttle Discovery on their flight STS-121 at the request of astronaut Piers Sellers' family; Sellers told mission control center that the song reminded him of [...] "the wild, happy, beer-drinking years of my youth." ...|$|E
500|$|Mills left Forest {{shortly before}} the end of 1981–82 to join the Seattle Sounders of the North American Soccer League in March 1982. He made 31 appearances, scored five goals and {{recorded}} seven assists in the 1982 North American Soccer League season as Seattle finished first in the Western Division. He started for Seattle in Soccer Bowl '82 before being substituted for Roger Davies, and the match was won 1–0 by the New York Cosmos with a 31st-minute goal scored by Giorgio Chinaglia. Less than a month later he made a temporary return to England by signing for Forest's local rivals Derby County on loan on 13 October 1982. Mills made his debut three days later in a 1–1 away draw with Grimsby Town in the Second Division, before scoring his first goal with Derby's second in a 2–0 home win over Queens Park Rangers on 3 January 1983. His loan ended in April 1983, having made 23 appearances and scored two goals for Derby in 1982–83. Early in the 1983 North American Soccer League season he had his leg broken by David Watson and was kept out of action for a year. However, this acted as <b>a</b> <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> Mills, who said: [...] "It made me work really hard and that's what made me go on and play until I was 47. I never stopped working on my fitness".|$|E

50|$|The {{earthquake}} {{proved to}} be <b>a</b> major <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> Japanese disaster prevention authorities. Japan installed rubber blocks under bridges to absorb the shock and rebuilt buildings further apart to prevent collateral damage. The national government changed its disaster response policies {{in the wake of}} the earthquake, and its response to the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake was significantly faster and more effective. The Ground Self-Defense Forces were given automatic authority to respond to earthquakes over a certain magnitude, which allowed them to deploy to the Niigata region within minutes. Control over fire response was likewise handed over from local fire departments to a central command base in Tokyo and Kyoto.|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s, the Canadian {{government}} {{funded the}} establishment of secular, government-operated {{high schools in the}} Northwest Territories (including what is now Nunavut) and Inuit areas in Quebec and Labrador along with the residential school system. The Inuit population was not large enough to support a full high school in every community, so this meant only a few schools were built, and students from across the territories were boarded there. These schools, in Aklavik, Iqaluit, Yellowknife, Inuvik and Kuujjuaq, brought together young Inuit from across the Arctic in one place for the first time, and exposed them to the rhetoric of civil and human rights that prevailed in Canada in the 1960s. This was <b>a</b> real <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the Inuit, and it stimulated {{the emergence of a new}} generation of young Inuit activists in the late 1960s who came forward and pushed for respect for the Inuit and their territories.|$|R
2500|$|Martin Caballero of USA Today said, [...] "Mobb Deep {{return to}} the spirit of its {{breakthrough}} album The Infamous on its eighth LP. That record established the Queens duo's signature brand of nihilistic raps over intoxicatingly dark instrumentals, and now The Infamous Mobb Deep doesn't stray far from that successful formula." [...] Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX said, [...] "There are no fun and games here. Just business. Havoc and Prodigy are as dialed in as ever. The Infamous Mobb Deep is a {{return to the}} roots of their artistic consciousness, substantiated almost 20 years ago, and with fine precision. With an all-star cast of guest lyricists and a gang of producers, The Infamous Mobb Deep is <b>a</b> loud <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> Hip Hop. The Rap game is survival of the fittest, and Mobb Deep still roams among the strong." [...] Adam Wordkman of The National stated, [...] "While pairing classic with contemporary is risky, it’s an interesting demonstration of the development of Mobb Deep’s thuggish methodology.

2500|$|The {{lack of a}} State Government {{contingency}} plan was criticised by Robert Amin, Curtin University's chair of Petroleum Engineering {{and chair of the}} Woodside Research Foundation, who said the Government should have stored enough gas in underground reservoirs to power the state for at least one month, to mitigate a potential crisis. Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives. Federal Opposition spokesperson for trade, Ian Macfarlane, called for a national audit of all gas pipelines, and highlighted the vulnerability of the single pipeline that carries WA's gas from the North West Shelf. Macfarlane said, [...] "At the very least this event comes as <b>a</b> <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the construction of a second pipeline from the North West shelf to supply gas to industry especially in the south-western part of Western Australia." [...] Professor Dong-ke Zhang, Director of the Centre for Petroleum, Fuels and Energy at the University of Western Australia, said, [...] "I would have thought it was quite silly for a very advanced state like WA that we are not able to cope with an incident like this by not having the ability to divert gas from an LNG plant to the domestic pipeline. At a policy level, the infrastructure needs to be longer term and the Government should encourage major players like Woodside and Chevron to invest in the infrastructure and give the incentives for the industry to come to the party because they get much bigger margins by selling LNG overseas." ...|$|E
50|$|The first Union ship to {{be engaged}} by Virginia was the all-wood, sail-powered USS Cumberland, which was first {{crippled}} during a furious cannon exchange, and then rammed in her forward starboard bow by Virginia. As Cumberland began to sink, the port side half of Virginias iron ram was broken off, causing a bow leak in the ironclad. Seeing {{what had happened to}} Cumberland, the captain of USS Congress ordered his frigate into shallower water, where she soon grounded. Congress and Virginia traded cannon fire for an hour, after which the badly-damaged Congress finally surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery on the north shore opened fire on Virginia. Outraged at such a breach of war protocol, in retaliation Virginias now angry captain, Commodore Franklin Buchanan, gave the order to open fire with hot-shot on the surrendered Congress as he rushed to Virginias exposed upper casemate deck, where he was injured by enemy rifle fire. Congress, now set ablaze by the retaliatory shelling, burned for many hours into the night, a symbol of Confederate naval power and <b>a</b> costly <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> the all-wood Union blockading squadron.|$|R
40|$|What {{does that}} {{symbolic}} haven of civic and community memory, the local public library, {{have to do}} with global capital and the liberalization of world trade? Plenty, according to Ruth Rikowski. Written primarily for an international readership of library and information professionals, the book Globalisation, Information and Libraries comprises <b>a</b> timely <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> educators as well. It has been an ongoing source of some dismay to me that, despite substantial populist commentary and scholarly literature on the ramifications of multilateral treaties, so few in these two allied professions have examined the regulatory imperatives of global agencies and agreements. This eminently readable text redresses this longstanding neglect. US media critic, Herbert Schiller (1989, 1996), heralded the impending tsunami of change that was about to confront libraries. His political economic analyses affirmed the social value of libraries and forecast the erosion of civic and democratic participation from public expenditure cuts by the Reagan administration. Prior to this, commercial publishers had little interest in public information because government materials were neither copyrightable nor profitable. Schiller noted the marginal nature of public information publishing as nonprofit social service work, which he considered a by-product of the sexism that prevailed in and about librarianship. A legacy of the chauvinist and racist ideologies of Melvil Dewey, library work had developed as a feminized, poorly paid profession that was subject to ridicule in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{mortgage}} markets {{has traditionally been}} the domain of economists. During historic times of turmoil and change, however, social scientists of various stripes are {{often called upon to}} shape our understanding of ways mortgage markets function. We are presently experiencing an episode of severe turmoil and change. How did we get here? Subprime Cities: The Political Economy of Mortgage Markets presents a collection of works from social scientists that offer important insights into what is happening in today's mortgage market including the causes, effects, and aftermath of the "subprime" mortgage crisis. In addition to shedding light on how the current housing crisis has spread to other sectors of the economy, readings address the mortgage market itself and how problems have spread throughout mortgage and housing markets. Various chapters address changes that have resulted in the subprime mortgage crisis; others focus on the structural changes in the mortgage market, rather than on the crisis itself. Documentation of the geographical, social, and institutional inequalities associated with the crisis reveals how the recent mortgage boom created "subprime cities," and how the victims of the crisis are the product of deep structural inequalities. This book is <b>a</b> provocative <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> us to reconsider the structures of housing finance and housing policy if we are to avoid another crisis...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the time}} Constant Chaos was released, Jones had {{temporarily}} halted activity on his labels {{for almost a}} year. Still DJing as Cajmere he'd narrowed the Green Velvet persona down to live performances only, taking time out to re-group and work {{out what to do}} next. During 2000, Jones was briefly signed to Warner Bros. Records' short-lived F-111 imprint, where he released his second compilation album, the self-titled Green Velvet, which contained the double-A-sided single “Flash” backed with “Answering Machine.” During this time he gave Velvet a new hairstyle—from spiked, green foam nodules to yellow mohawk. Next, in 2001, he unleashed his second album, the dark Whatever, which was a step away from his Kraftwerk-inspired sound (although Sleepwalking had a similar style) to a darker, more political Punk-esque style. On the album he tackled such issues as racism (highlighted on the song When?), drug use (highlighted on Genedefekt and La La Land), alienation (highlighted on Sleepwalking), and being told what to wear and do by the system (highlighted on the heavily punk-inspired track Gat). The more punk-oriented songs on the album apparently came from hours spent listening to industrial bands such as Nitzer Ebb and Liaisons Dangereuses, and lots of [...] "underground American industrial stuff." [...] He released the single La La Land in 2001, originally designed as <b>a</b> <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> clubbers to the dangers of pill-taking it became one of his most popular tunes. This was followed by Genedefekt. His live act had now became more like a rock band also, with the Curtis playing a keytar, and two other musicians (aptly named Nazuk and Spaceboy) backing him, playing heavily distorted synths. Initially Jones, as both Cajmere and Green Velvet, was receiving more attention in Europe than he did in the USA, playing a Radio One live session on the Jo Whiley show and playing a host of festivals.|$|E

This was <b>a</b> real <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> Inuit, and it stimulated {{the emergence of a}} new generation of young Inuit activists in the late 1960s. They began networking with one another across the Northwest Territories, Quebec and Labrador and in 1982, the Tunngavik Federation of Nunavut, or [...] "TFN" [...] had been incorporated to take over the claim negotiation mandate from the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami. TFN worked for ten years and, in September 1992, came to a final agreement with the government of Canada. Then, in November 1992, the Nunavut Final Agreement was approved by nearly 85% of Nunavut Inuit. As the final step in this long process, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement was signed on May 25, 1993 in Iqaluit by the Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and by Paul Quassa, the president of Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, which replaced the TFN upon the ratification of the Nunavut Final Agreement. The Canadian Parliament passed the supporting legislation in June of the same year, enabling the eventual establishment of Nunavut as a territorial entity. The land claims agreement was the result of two decades of negotiations that, in the end, gave birth to the largest comprehensive land claims settlement in Canada.|$|R
