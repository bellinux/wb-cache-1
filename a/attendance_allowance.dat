25|$|Considerable {{support was}} {{provided}} for nursery school building, and a long-term capital investment programme in school building was launched. A Family Fund {{was set up}} to provide assistance to families with children who had congenital conditions, while new benefits were introduced benefiting hundreds of thousands of disabled persons whose disabilities had been caused neither by war nor by industrial injury. An <b>Attendance</b> <b>Allowance</b> was introduced for those needing care at home, together with Invalidity Benefit for the long-term sick, while a higher Child Allowance was made available where invalidity allowance was paid. Widow's Benefits were introduced for those aged between forty and fifty years of age, improved subsidies for slum clearance were made available, while Rent Allowances were introduced for private tenants. In April 1971, the right to education was given to all children with Down's syndrome for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|The widow's earning {{rule was}} also abolished, while {{a range of}} new social {{benefits}} was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who {{were considered to be}} unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a [...] "long term" [...] allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced. From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant <b>attendance</b> <b>allowance</b> which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant <b>attendance</b> <b>allowance</b> and who were exceptionally severely disabled.” Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity, unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968. From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, {{sources close}} to the prime {{minister}} told The Scotsman that [...] "a unified tax and benefit system {{is at the heart of}} a united country" [...] and that these powers could not be devolved to Scotland after the referendum, though Liberal Democrat Michael Moore said in August 2013 that devolution of parts of the welfare budget should be [...] "up for debate". Labour politician Jim Murphy, a former Secretary of State for Scotland, has argued that he is [...] "fiercely committed" [...] to devolving welfare powers to the Scottish Parliament, but also warned that independence would be disruptive and would not be beneficial. Scottish Labour's Devolution Commission recommended in March 2014 that some aspects of the welfare state, including housing benefit and <b>attendance</b> <b>allowance,</b> should be devolved.|$|E
25|$|Provision {{was made}} under the 1970 National Insurance (Old Persons' and Widows' Pensions and <b>Attendances</b> <b>Allowances)</b> Act for {{pensions}} {{to be paid}} to old people who had been excluded from the pre-1948 pension schemes and were accordingly excluded from the comprehensive scheme that was introduced in 1948. About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving Supplementary Benefit under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow's Pension scheme by introducing a scale that started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of £5 at the age of 50.|$|R
5000|$|More {{than fifty}} years later she {{disclosed}} {{that a couple of}} weeks before the party's exclusion from the Hamburg parliament Magda Kelms had collected from the city hall 2,000 Marks in <b>attendance</b> <b>allowances</b> for the Communist Party members, which would be used for the support of comrades continuing to work (now illegally) for the party. On 1 May 1933 a demonstration was organised locally, with red banners improvised from bedding hung from apartment windows, but the banners were hurriedly taken in when Nazi paramilitaries appeared on the scene. On 2 May 1933 the apartment she shared was [...] "occupied" [...] by fascists, but she was nevertheless able to continue with her party work till her arrest in May 1934. [...] She took a leading role in underground distribution of the [...] "Rote Fahne" [...] newspaper and other Communist publications in the Hamburg region.|$|R
50|$|Hacker {{is about}} to have a meeting with his constituency's councillors about the proposal, but Sir Humphrey is on his way. He bursts in to bring the Minister news of his new responsibilities, and Hacker is pleasantly surprised. However, he pauses for thought when Sir Humphrey reminds him of the {{implications}} regarding the football club. Hacker quickly concludes that the art gallery is worth saving after all, but the councillors are waiting outside. Bernard ushers them in and Hacker struggles to explain that he can no longer give his approval. The councillors are unimpressed and accuse him of going back on his word. However, Bernard saves the day by drawing the Minister's attention to the regulation he signed earlier regarding councillors' <b>attendance</b> <b>allowances.</b> Hacker tells them frankly that they must choose between one and the other. This now puts things in a different light, and the councillors come up with an alternative plan to raise the money by closing down a local school and selling the land, leaving the meeting happy at the outcome. After they leave, Sir Humphrey too makes his excuses: it is another gala performance. Now Hacker asks if he can come too, and the Permanent Secretary is delighted.|$|R
2500|$|Kohl's chancellorship {{presided over}} a number of {{innovative}} policy measures. Extensions in unemployment benefit for older claimants were introduced, while the benefit for the young unemployed was extended to age 21. In 1986, a child-rearing allowance was introduced to benefit parents when at least one was employed. Informal carers were offered an <b>attendance</b> <b>allowance</b> together with tax incentives, both of which were established with the tax reforms of 1990, and were also guaranteed up to 25 hours a month of professional support, which was supplemented by four weeks of annual holiday relief. In 1984, an early retirement scheme was introduced that offered incentives to employers to replace elderly workers with applicants off the unemployment register. In 1989 a partial retirement plan was introduced under which elderly employees could work half-time and receive 70% of their former salary [...] "and be credited with 90 per cent of the full social insurance entitlement." [...] In 1984, a Mother and Child Fund was established, providing discretionary grants [...] "to forestall abortions on grounds of material hardship," [...] and in 1986 a 10 Bn DM package of Erziehungsgeld (childcare allowance) was introduced, although according to various studies, this latter initiative was heavily counterbalanced by cuts. In 1989, special provisions were introduced for the older unemployed.|$|E

50|$|In housing policy, a {{shift of}} {{emphasis}} in housing policy towards rehabilitation {{was evident in the}} further {{increase in the number of}} General Improvement Areas and the number of Housing Action Areas declared. An Act of March 1977 makes provision, for a limited period, for benefits to be paid from the age of 64 to workers who agree to retire in order to free jobs for young unemployed people, in response to the rise of youth unemployment. A number of other improvements were introduced in 1977, with <b>Attendance</b> <b>Allowances</b> extended to cover handicapped foster children and non-contributory disablement pensions extended to married women whose invalidity prevented them from carrying out their household tasks. In January 1977, regulations were issued which brought about a change in the administration of legislation governing fire precautions at places of work. Under these regulations the Health and Safety Executive retained full responsibility for fire safety in certain 'special' premises such as nuclear installations, coalmines and chemical plants, whereas responsibility for general fire precautions at places of work was transferred to local fire authorities. In July 1977, an experimental Job Introduction Scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance enabling certain disabled people to undertake a trial period of employment with an employer, where there was reasonable doubt as to the person’s ability to perform a particular job. In July 1978, a revised and simplified scheme designed to assist severely disabled people with their travel-to-work costs was introduced.|$|R
50|$|In the {{standard}} model, workers receive two fairly large bonuses {{as well as}} their regular salary, one mid-year and the other at year's end. In 1988 workers in large companies received bonuses equivalent to their pay for 1.9 months while workers in the smallest firms gained bonuses equal to 1.2 months' pay. In addition to bonuses, Japanese workers received a number of fringe benefits, such as living allowances, incentive payments, remuneration for special job conditions, <b>allowances</b> for good <b>attendance,</b> and cost-of-living <b>allowances.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Englishman {{was hunting}} for {{the statue of}} a horse, a great horse hight Hunja, who was a steed of Irak, and a King's gift to Rao Omeda, one time monarch of Boondi. He {{found it in the}} city square as Tod had said; and it was an unlovely statue, carven after the dropsical fashion of later Hindu art. No one seemed to know {{anything}} about it. A little further on, one cried from a byway in rusty English: [...] "Come and see my Dispensary." [...] There are only two men in Boondi who speak English. One is the head, and the other the assistant, teacher of the English side of Boondi Free School. The third was, some twenty years ago, a pupil of the Lahore Medical College when that institution was young; and he only remembered a word here and there. He was head of the Charitable Dispensary; and insisted upon, then and there, organising a small levee and pulling out all his books. Escape was hopeless: nothing less than a formal inspection and introduction to all the native physicians would serve. There were sixteen beds in and about the courtyard, and between twenty and thirty out-patients stood in <b>attendance.</b> Making <b>allowances</b> for untouched Orientalism, the Dispensary is a good one, and must relieve a certain amount of human misery. There is no other in all Boondi. The operation-book, kept in English, showed the principal complaints of the country. They were: [...] "Asthama," [...] "Numonia," [...] "Skindiseas," [...] "Dabalaty" [...] and [...] "Loin-bite." [...] This last item occurred again and again--three and four cases per week--and {{it was not until the}} Doctor said [...] "Sher se mara" [...] that the Englishman read it aright. It was [...] "lion-bite," [...] or tiger, if you insist upon zoological accuracy. There was one incorrigible idiot, a handsome young man, naked as the day, who sat in the sunshine, shivering and pressing his hands to his head. [...] "I have given him blisters and setons--have tried native and English treatment for two years, but it is no use. He is always as you see him, and now he stays here by the favour of the Durbar, which is a very good and pitiful Durbar," [...] said the Doctor. There were many such pensioners of the Durbar--men afflicted with chronic [...] "asthama" [...] who stayed [...] "by favour," [...] and were kindly treated. They were resting in the sunshine their hands on their knees, sure that their daily dole of grain and tobacco and opium would be forthcoming. [...] "All folk, even little children, eat opium here," [...] said the Doctor, and the diet-book proved it. After laborious-investigation of everything, down to the last indent to Bombay for Europe medicines, the Englishman was suffered to depart. [...] "Sir, I thank ...," [...] began the Native Doctor, but the rest of the sentence stuck. Sixteen years in Boondi does not increase knowledge of English; and he went back to his patients, gravely conning over the name of the Principal of the Lahore Medical School--a College now--who had taught him all he knew, and to whom he intended to write. There was something pathetic in the man's catching at news from the outside world of men he had known as Assistant and House Surgeons who are now Rai Bahadurs, and his parade of the few shreds of English that still clung to him. May he treat [...] "loin-bites" [...] and [...] "catrack" [...] successfully for many years. In the happy, indolent fashion that must have merits which we cannot understand, he is doing a good work, and the Durbar allows his Dispensary as much as it wants.|$|R

50|$|Independently of the Dilnot proposals, the {{administration}} of <b>Attendance</b> <b>Allowance</b> will be transferred to Local Councils in 2020, meaning that assessment of care needs will be merged with assessment of funding eligibility, for those who qualify for <b>Attendance</b> <b>Allowance</b> (individuals who have reached State Pension Age). This will also allow the money to pass directly from central government to the council, without needing {{to pass through the}} care user's bank account in-between; personal budgets mean that the care user still has control of how the money is spent (though it will no longer be possible to spend it on frivolous things that do not contribute towards care).|$|E

50|$|<b>Attendance</b> <b>Allowance</b> is a {{non-contributory}} Social Security benefit paid to elderly {{disabled people}} in the United Kingdom.
