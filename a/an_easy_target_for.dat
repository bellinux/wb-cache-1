5|$|Due to its slow movements, the addax is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> predators such as lions, humans, African hunting dogs, cheetahs and leopards. Caracals, hyenas and servals attack calves. The addax are {{normally}} not aggressive, though individuals may charge {{if they are}} disturbed.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Cushing {{was dead}} in the water, <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> {{repeated}} enemy shelling. The results were disastrous and the order was given to abandon ship. Six officers and 53 men were lost. Of the survivors rescued, 56 had been wounded and ten of them suffered fatal injuries. The abandoned ship remained afloat until her magazines blew up. Cushing received three battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Star Wars workprint, {{the owner of the}} EliteTorrents domain name lived in the United States, which made the site <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> US authorities. However, the site's server was located in the Netherlands, and the other BitTorrent trackers located on that server continued to operate.|$|R
50|$|Blogging {{and social}} {{networking}} have become effective tools to register protest and grievances. Protests can express views, news and use viral networking {{to reach out}} to thousands of people. With protests on the rise from the election season of 2016 going into 2017, protestors became aware that using their social media during protest could make them <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> government surveillance.|$|R
40|$|The cryptoendolithic microoganisms {{that live}} inside {{rocks in the}} frigid Ross Desert of Antarctica {{can serve as a}} {{terrestrial}} model for what may have happened to life forms on Mars when the planet became dry and cold. Trace fossils of microbial rock colonization exist in Antarctica, and similar structures could have formed on Mars. In some respects, such trace fossils could be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> life-detection systems than fossils of cellular structures...|$|R
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber became <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as {{the epitome of}} morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely {{for the sins of}} his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
5000|$|Leaders of the {{eugenics}} movement such as Harry Hamilton Laughlin regarded Howe's eugenics {{campaign against}} blindness as an opening wedge for {{a far more}} ambitious eugenics agenda, {{paving the way for}} broader measures against the birth of other babies with inherited [...] "defects." [...] Howe and his eugenicist colleagues sought to craft legislation that would pass constitutional muster. They believed that blindness, as a hygienic trait, would be <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> eugenics legislation than such [...] "defective" [...] traits as [...] "feeblemindedness" [...] or a family history of poverty.|$|R
50|$|However, Zahn {{knew that}} Wilhelm Gustloff was rated at 16 knots top speed and was annoyed at Petersen's insistence for keeping {{at the lower}} speed limit of 12 knots, which made the ship <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> submarines. Another point of {{disagreement}} between the two captains was {{the shape of the}} route. Zahn supported a zigzag submarine avoidance path while Petersen proposed a linear path to minimise travel time. Petersen also proposed cruising in deep waters and with the lights on to avoid collision with minesweeping ships which were reported as being present in the area at the time.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether various hypotheses {{put forward}} {{to explain the}} downward trends in government capital spending are supported by the data. Using panel data for 22 OECD countries for 1980 - 1992, various hypotheses are tested in a model. The authors find support for three hypotheses: (1) capital spending is reduced during periods of fiscal stringency, since this category of government spending is politically <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> cuts than other spending categories; (2) myopic governments will cut investment spending more than governments which have a longer policy horizon; (3) private investment influences government investment spending, because both types of investment are complementary...|$|R

25|$|Lore was an {{independent}} thinker who {{was reluctant to}} take political orders, a personal characteristic which made him unsuited for the increasingly centralized Communist movement of the late 1920s. In addition, his well-known personal fondness for Leon Trotsky, established during Trotsky's time living in New York, during which he wrote for The Class Struggle, made Lore <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> factional opponents.|$|E
50|$|Her partner, she says, was a feminist, {{a hopeless}} businessman, a {{journalist}} who could not hold down a staff job, and a passionate fighter and investigator for social causes and against the Far Right. The memoir details how the couple met and their struggles together at Expo, the anti-fascist publication Larsson founded in 1995. Larsson's crusade against Sweden's right wing fascist movements put him in constant danger and Gabrielsson writes that neo-Nazis left death threats on the couple’s answering machine and sent bullets in the mail, and suggests {{that part of the}} reason the two of them never married was that it would have made Larsson <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> his opponents on the right.|$|R
5000|$|The Japanese tactic was to {{put their}} fastest ships in the vanguard to keep the Korean ships occupied, then move their larger ships rapidly to close in, grapple, and board the Korean ships. However, this tactic played right into Admiral Yi's plan, as the Japanese rowed deeper into the trap. The volume and range of Korean cannon fire {{prevented}} the Japanese from employing their favorite tactic and the two wings of the crane formation would envelop, surround and finally {{have the effect of}} [...] "crowding in" [...] the Japanese ships, making it difficult to maneuver or retreat and [...] "packing" [...] in the ships and present <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> Korean cannons.|$|R
50|$|Due to its remote {{location}} and prominence, the sculpture is <b>a</b> relatively <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> vandalism, although its popularity makes genuine vandalism rare. As noted above, the original Mr. Stringy was stolen at least once, {{and the current}} version has been modified {{in order to try}} to prevent further theft or damage.|$|R
25|$|Although often nesting {{close to}} human activity, some Swainson's hawks are very easily {{disturbed}} at the nest and often desert, especially {{early in the}} season. The bird is often quite tame and <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> shooters traveling isolated prairie roads. The species may also be affected in ways yet to be understood by some insecticides and herbicides, including those used on its wintering grounds.|$|E
25|$|As the Villista cavalry was {{charging}} {{towards the}} trenches, however, two searchlights illuminated the battlefield, making the horsemen <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> Calles' machine guns. The front trenches were manned by units led by another future president of Mexico, Col. Lázaro Cárdenas. Villa's horsemen were decimated by machine-gun fire and land mines. The few {{who managed to}} make it near the trenches encountered electrified barbed wire. The charge collapsed and the attack was a failure.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 2011 in Tokyo at REBELS 8 & It's Showtime Japan Countdown-1, Petrosyan {{dominated}} Hinata to {{a unanimous}} points victory, controlling the fight by slipping {{almost all of}} Hinata's punches, checking low kicks and catching body kicks to disrupt his opponent's rhythm. The Japanese fighter's lack of head movement also made him <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> Petrosyan's superior boxing. However, he broke his hand a fourth time in the match.|$|E
50|$|He {{stayed there}} with his battalions {{under the cover of}} two {{mountains}} to avoid IAF bombing for two days, the 6th and 7 June. Finally, he succeeded in making contact with the Egyptian command which ordered him to immediately retreat west of the Suez canal. He responded {{with one of the most}} difficult maneuvers executed in the history of the Egyptian/Israeli conflict , a night march(with mechanized units and tanks accompanying) in the desert and through enemy lines. Without any air support or intelligence, he succeeded in reaching the Suez canal with almost no losses where the crossing made his forces <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the IAF costing him 10-20% of his units. He was then the last military commander to pass from the east of the canal to the west.|$|R
5000|$|In 1850, {{the suburbs}} or Vorstädte (today the Districts II to IX) were {{incorporated}} into the municipality, which made the city walls an impediment to traffic. In 1857, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria issued the decree [...] "I have resolved to command" [...] (Es ist Mein Wille at Wikisource) ordering the demolition of the city walls and moats. In his decree, he laid out the exact size of the boulevard, {{as well as the}} geographical positions and functions of the new buildings. The Ringstraße and the planned buildings were intended to be a showcase for the grandeur and glory of the Habsburg Empire. On the practical level, Emperor Napoléon III of France's boulevard construction in Paris had already demonstrated how enlarging and widening the size of streets effectively made the erection of revolutionary barricades difficult and thus <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> artillery.|$|R
50|$|Poor rudder {{and lateral}} control made the Taube {{difficult}} and slow to turn. The aeroplane {{proved to be}} <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the faster and more mobile Allied fighters of World War I, and just six months into the war, the Taube {{had been removed from}} front line service to be used to train new pilots. Many future German aces would learn to fly in a Rumpler Taube.|$|R
25|$|The ladder was {{designed}} to use attraction water: fresh water flowing swiftly out {{the bottom of the}} fish ladder, in the direction opposite which anadromous fish migrate {{at the end of their}} lives. However, the attraction water from this first ladder was not effective. Instead, most salmon used the locks. This made them <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> predators; also, many were injured by hitting the walls and gates of the locks, or by hitting boat propellers.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{policies}} of Presiding Bishop Hines and the General Conventions of 1967 and 1969 {{led to a}} conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by John M. Allin, the bishop of Mississippi and a conservative.|$|E
25|$|In April, as the Allied forces {{advanced}} {{deeper into}} Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team {{to be moved}} by train into the town of Oberammergau in the Bavarian Alps where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if {{they were about to}} fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so {{that they would not be}} <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> U.S. bombers.|$|E
50|$|Now {{the undisputed}} ruler of Limbo, S'ym plots a new {{invasion}} of Earth. He plans on using the Nexus of All Realities to invade Earth, but is stopped by his former master Belasco, who manipulates Cable into confronting S'ym. Belasco reasserts his control over both S'ym and Limbo. The two are later defeated by Nightcrawler as his girlfriend, Amanda Sefton, takes over Limbo. S'ym turns to {{an alliance with}} the Archenemy, a powerful magical entity, and disguises himself as Duke Bleys, becoming one of Sefton's most trusted advisers. As Bleys, S'ym tricks Sefton into allying herself with many other demon lords and merging their various realms and dimensions into a single bastion against the Archenemy. S'ym then reveals his true identity and reveals that the single, united realm is <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the Archenemy than the countless dimensions he was fighting before. Nonetheless, Sefton and her army manage to slay the Archenemy and undo the merging of realms.|$|R
50|$|Parasites {{with complex}} life cycles often behave {{differently}} in their intermediate and definitive hosts. High virulence {{that results in}} the death of an intermediate host before it can be preyed upon by a definitive host is maladaptive. The parasite therefore needs to evolve different levels of virulence at different life stages in different hosts. Parasite increased trophic transmission often follows this trend, because the altering of host behavior is strongly affected by the requirements of the parasite. One example has been observed in the interactions of the parasitic tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus and its intermediate host (moose) and its definitive host (wolf). The tapeworm virulence is high in the moose but low in the wolf, because a strong effect that inhibits normal functions in the moose makes it <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the wolf. <b>A</b> high virulence in the wolf is unfavorable if it decreases predator abilities. Thus, the tapeworm’s fitness is increased by a high virulence in the moose and a benign relationship with the wolf.|$|R
50|$|Red-tailed amazons are <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> traffickers {{thanks to}} their vibrant colors and isolated breeding grounds. In fact, one study noted that of forty-seven nests monitored between 1990 and 1994, forty-one were robbed by humans. Rural, low income Brazilians are desperate for money and catch the birds for dealers. In turn, the dealers pay the locals $30 per bird and turn around and sell the birds for $2,500 a piece to buyers.|$|R
25|$|On 1 April, the British {{launched}} a major attack, pounding {{down on the}} town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on {{every part of the}} Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, discarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the enemy's guns. After Bandula's death, the Burmese evacuated Danubyu.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of widowhood, Maria Isabella was still young, with a will to live and a certain beauty, despite her {{increasing}} obesity. Surrounded by admirers, she had a weakness for handsome officials younger than her. According to court rumors, she took lovers. Her behavior made her <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> libels and exasperated Ferdinand II. Maria Isabella was kind to her daughter-in-law Maria Cristina of Savoy, who married Ferdinand II on 21 November 1832. The new queen achieved a reconciliation between mother and son.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{little is}} known about the G.I's service history. Idflieg records show only small numbers ever in service on the front at any one time (the most being five in October and six in December 1915). At this stage of the war, Type G {{aircraft}} were being used for a variety of duties, including defensive patrols, reconnaissance, and only rarely for bombing. By the time it reached the front, the Gotha G.I was already <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> faster and more maneuverable fighters, and the few pilot recollections that have survived are largely unfavourable to the type.|$|E
5000|$|Assembled CIL {{can also}} be {{disassembled}} into code again using the IL Disassembler (ILDASM). There are other tools such as [...]NET Reflector that can decompile CIL into a high-level language (e. g. C# or Visual Basic).

25|$|The purges {{affected}} {{the leadership of}} the VVS. In June 1941, 91 per cent of major formation leaders had been in place for just six months. With the exception of Major General Aleksandr Novikov, commanding the Leningrad District, most would fail in their posts and pay for that failure with their lives. A critical operational omission of the VVS was the failure to disperse its aircraft. Soviet aircraft was left closely ‘bunched’ into groups, and lined up on airfields, making <b>a</b> very <b>easy</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> the Germans.|$|R
40|$|Slicing is a {{technique}} for extracting parts of programs or specifications with respect to certain criteria of interest. The extraction is carried out {{in such a way}} that properties as described by the slicing criterion are preserved, i. e., they hold in the complete program if and only if they hold in the sliced program. During verification, slicing is often employed to reduce the state space of specifications to a size tractable by a model checker. The computation of specification slices relies on the construction of dependence graphs, reflecting (at least) control and data dependencies in specifications. The more dependencies the graph has, the less removal of parts is possible. In this paper we present {{a technique}} for optimizing the construction of the dependence graph by using deductive verification techniques. More precisely, we propose a technique for showing that certain control dependencies in the graph can be eliminated. The technique employs small deductive proofs of the enabledness of certain transitions. Thereby we obtain dependence graphs with less control dependencies and as a consequence smaller specification slices which are <b>an</b> <b>easier</b> <b>target</b> <b>for</b> model checking...|$|R
