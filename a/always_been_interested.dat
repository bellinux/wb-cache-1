5|$|Daniel Knauf {{conceived}} the initial script {{for the show}} between 1990 and 1992 when he was unsatisfied with {{his job as a}} Californian health insurance broker and hoped to become a screenwriter. He had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in carnivals and noted that this subject had rarely been dramatized on film. Knauf's experiences of growing up with a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human strongly informed the story and its treatment of freaks.|$|E
5|$|Only 48, he was {{not willing}} to retire. He had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in history and so he joined the Historic Sites Department of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. He became an area {{superintendent}} and served for five years. In December 1973 he experienced a sudden onset of headaches and complained of nausea. He was submitted to hospital but his health declined rapidly. Bob Braham died from a brain tumour on 7 February 1974 at the age of 53.|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in them, and now {{followed the}} example of a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

5|$|The son of William and Ida Steege, Gordon Henry Steege {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Chatswood on 31October 1917, and educated at North Sydney Boys High School. He {{recalled}} having <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in a military career, applying unsuccessfully to enter the Royal Australian Navy when he was twelve, and the Royal Military College, Duntroon, after he left school and started working with the Perpetual Trustee Company. On 21July 1937, he joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), undergoing flight instruction at No.1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria. He graduated with a distinguished pass on 23June 1938, and was commissioned a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, flying Hawker Demon biplane fighters. Steege and the squadron participated in several exercises with the Australian Army, undertaking reconnaissance, spotting for artillery, and practising ground-attack missions. He was promoted to flying officer in December 1938.|$|E

I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E
25|$|The duo have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in the artwork, {{design and}} {{photography}} {{of their own}} releases. Photographer Eric Watson helped shape the original image of Pet Shop Boys, creating many of their photographs and videos from 1984 to 1991. In design they have primarily worked with Mark Farrow, who designed the cover of their first Parlophone album release in 1986. The collaboration between Mark Farrow and Pet Shop Boys {{is comparable to the}} designer/band relationship of Peter Saville and New Order, Anton Corbijn and Depeche Mode, or the epic-length collaboration of Simon Halfon and Paul Weller. Their record sleeves are quite often very minimal and the attention to detail is obvious. In October 2006, British art publisher Thames & Hudson published a 336-page hardcover book titled Pet Shop Boys Catalogue, by Chris Heath and Philip Hoare, showcasing the group's accomplishments in artwork, design and music. A German-language edition was also published. An exhibition of photographs of Pet Shop Boys was organised at the National Portrait Gallery in London to coincide with the publication.|$|E

25|$|Born Sybille Overhoff on 3 July 1926 to Edith née Kloeppel, her German mother, and Julius Overhoff, her Austrian father, {{she was one}} of five {{siblings}} {{including her}} twin sister Elfriede Knauer, an archaeologist. She grew up in a cultured family in Berlin, Frankfurt and Austria but her schooling was interrupted by the Nazi regime. She had to join Nazi youth organisations and spent a year doing compulsory labour in harsh conditions. After the war things remained difficult for some time and she studied Chinese while waiting for Frankfurt University to reopen in 1947. However, she had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in the antiquities collected by her maternal great-grandfather, the sculptor and art historian , and had a long-standing wish to study classical archaeology, and in particular, Etruscology. Once at the Goethe University Frankfurt she studied classical archaeology, ancient history, art history and ethnology and found vacation work in museums in Paris, Rome, and London before graduating summa cum laude in December 1950. She went on to write a thesis on Etruscan bronze mirrors, supervised and encouraged by Guido von Kaschnitz.|$|E

Brown said he had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in curbing domestic violence, but his interest became personal after he discovered that his sister, Betty [...] "Boo" [...] McCann, had been a victim. In 2003, Patton renamed Kentucky Route 9 as the [...] "John Y. Brown Jr. AA Highway". The [...] "AA" [...] designation {{comes from the fact}} that the highway originally connected the cities of Alexandria and Ashland.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's most {{prominent}} recurring theme {{is the concept}} of time. The director has identified that all of his films [...] "have had some odd relationship with time, usually in just a structural sense, in that I have <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in the subjectivity of time." [...] Writing for Film Philosophy, Emma Bell points out that the characters in Inception do not literally time-travel, [...] "rather they escape time by being stricken in it – building the delusion that time has not passed, and is not passing now. They feel time grievously: willingly and knowingly destroying their experience by creating multiple simultaneous existences." ...|$|E

500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in cars, and I decided right then that was what I {{wanted to do with}} my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to {{purchase}} a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki based {{some of the}} {{buildings}} in the spirit world on {{the buildings}} in the real-life Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. He often visited the museum for inspiration while working on the film. Miyazaki had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in the Pseudo-Western style buildings from the Meiji period that were available there. The museum made Miyazaki feel nostalgic, [...] "especially when I stand here alone in the evening, near closing time, {{and the sun is}} setting– tears well up in my eyes." [...] Another major inspiration was the Notoyaryokan, a traditional Japanese inn located in Yamagata Prefecture, famous for its exquisite architecture and ornamental features. While some guidebooks and articles claim that the old gold town of Jiufen in Taiwan served as an inspirational model for the film, Miyazaki has denied this. The Dōgo Onsen is also often said to be a key inspiration for the Spirited Away onsen/bathhouse.|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{had already}} {{demonstrated}} {{his interest in}} World War II themes with the films 1941, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, and the Indiana Jones series. Spielberg later co-produced the World War II themed television miniseries Band of Brothers and its counterpart The Pacific with Tom Hanks. When asked about this by American Cinematographer, Spielberg said, [...] "I think that World War II {{is the most significant}} event of the last 100 years; the fate of the baby boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote Saving Private Ryan, I found it." ...|$|E

500|$|Frere {{was born}} in Malcolm Peth, Bombay on 25 September 1848. In later life she lived in Westbourne Terrace, London. The Cookery Book was not Frere's first publication; {{at the age of}} 20 she had {{illustrated}} her sister Mary's book, Old Deccan Days, Or, Hindoo Fairy Tales Current in Southern India, a compilation of folk tales; their father was at the time Governor of Bombay. The book was popular, going into four editions between first publication in 1868 and 1889. In the Preface to the Cookery Book she denies [...] "the special knowledge of cookery with which Sir John so kindly credits me", but admits she has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in the [...] "study", and that she had seen [...] "two other cookery books through the press for my friend the late Miss Hilda Duckett": these were Hilda's Where is it? of Recipes (1899) and Hilda's Diary of a Cape Housekeeper (1902), both published by Chapman and Hall; but Frere's name had not appeared on their title pages.|$|E
500|$|Producer Marc E. Platt {{contacted}} actor Ryan Gosling about Drive early on. Platt explained: [...] "I {{have this}} list that I've created of very talented individuals whose work inspire me [...] writers, directors, actors whom I {{have to work}} with before I go onto another career or do something else with my life." [...] Near the top of Platt's list was Gosling, who, despite having starred in several films of diverse genres, had never starred in anything like Drive. He had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in doing an action-oriented project. Gosling claimed that he was simply put off from the genre, believing that the action films of today focused more on stunts instead of characters. Despite this, Platt heard back from the actor around 48 hours later. Gosling has stated that his strong attraction to the plot led him to take on the leading role of the unnamed driver, saying that he was drawn to the [...] "very strong character" [...] at its core, as well as the [...] "powerful" [...] romance.|$|E
500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in {{creating}} open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom. They only make games that [...] " [...] love to play" [...] or games that [...] "can bring a smile to people's faces".|$|E

Señor Senior, Sr. and Señor Senior, Jr. are voiced by Ricardo Montalban and Nestor Carbonell, respectively. Friedle's Boy Meets World co-star Rider Strong voices Brick Flag, Bonnie's boyfriend. Ashley Tisdale of Disney Channel's High School Musical film series and sitcom The Suite Life of Zack and Cody was offered the role of Season 4 villain Camille Leon. Van der Pol would eventual voice a guest role in the series in the episode [...] "And The Mole Rat Will Be CGI" [...] as Heather, an actress hired to play Kim in a film adaptation of her life, serving as her first voice-acting role. Loter had <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in working with the cast of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer but this idea never came to fruition; one particularly famous actor refused a villainous guest role in Season 4 because he was insulted to {{have been asked to}} voice an animated character on a television series.|$|E
500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
