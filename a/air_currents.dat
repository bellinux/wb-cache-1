5|$|Wildfire {{intensity}} increases during daytime hours. For example, burn {{rates of}} smoldering logs {{are up to}} five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground {{during the day and}} causes <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.|$|E

5|$|Two {{antennae}} ("feelers") {{are attached}} to the head; these organs detect chemicals, <b>air</b> <b>currents,</b> and vibrations; they also are used to transmit and receive signals through touch. The head has two strong jaws, the mandibles, used to carry food, manipulate objects, construct nests, and for defence. In some species, a small pocket (infrabuccal chamber) inside the mouth stores food, so it may be passed to other ants or their larvae.|$|E

The extending axis connected with the fan axis by coupling connection. The spiral blade is fixed on the extending axis, is followed with rotation if the fan blades rotate. If the spiral blade is rotating, an interesting phenomenon will appear in CDRS of DCCP. The airflow passageway in CDRS is transformed to the cyclone passageway, named as a driven cyclone passageway. Secondly, the polluted <b>air</b> <b>current</b> in CDRS is constrained by the driven cyclone passageway, and the velocity components of <b>air</b> <b>current</b> has axial, radial and tangential, so the <b>air</b> <b>current</b> in CDRS is transformed to a spiral <b>air</b> <b>current.</b> Thirdly, the dust particles are separated from the polluted <b>air</b> <b>current</b> by centrifugal force, and are captured by water sink. Finally, the watering <b>air</b> <b>current</b> from CDRS, is dewatered by water baffles, and is handled into a purified <b>air</b> <b>current,</b> which is closer to non-dust and non-water.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Investigation of the {{jet stream}} {{mechanism}} during the high-speed passenger train flow around. On the basis of theoretical studies to determine the distribution of air flow velocity field, {{the pressure on the}} upper layer of the double layer <b>air</b> <b>current,</b> the pressure at the boundary of both layers of double-layer <b>air</b> <b>current.</b> Methodology. To solve the problem on the top layer of <b>air</b> <b>current</b> the Zhukovsky method and the method of theory of ideal incompressible fluid jets was applied. Then to solve the boundary layer equations the pressure at the boundary of both layers was determined, the Navier - Stokes equation, which takes into account the influence of the top layer on the bottom layer was set up. Airflow in the upper region is a potential, stationary; the air in the vicinity is considered as the compressible one. Findings. The distribution of the velocity field for both layers of <b>air</b> <b>current</b> was obtained. The pressure on the upper layer of the double layer air flow was defined. Originality. The problem of a double layer <b>air</b> <b>current</b> formed by the high-speed train movement consisting of the boundary layer above the car surfaces and the <b>air</b> <b>current</b> with no viscosity was studied for the first time.

In addition to being used for locomotion, the tarsus of leg I contains a unique sensory structure, Haller's organ, which can detect odors and chemicals emanating from the host, as well as sensing changes in temperature and <b>air</b> <b>currents.</b> When not being used for walking, the legs remain tightly folded against the body.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an {{important}} feature of Seattle's weather. In the convergence zone, air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south. Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle's west, then reunited to the east. When the <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> meet, they are forced upward, resulting in convection. Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur {{north and south of}} town, but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers. The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 North Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} mostly focused in the Bay of Bengal, where {{six of the}} seven {{depressions}} developed. The remaining system was a tropical cyclone that developed in the Arabian Sea in November, which was also the only system that did not affect land. There were three cyclonic storms, which is below the average of 5.4. Only one storm formed {{before the start of}} the monsoon season in June, although it was also the most notable. On May10, a depression formed in the central Bay of Bengal, and within a few days became a very severe cyclonic storm. After it stalled, it drew moisture from the southwest to produce severe flooding across Sri Lanka, killing 254people and becoming the worst floods there since 1947. Damage on the island totaled $135million (2003USD). The storm eventually made landfall in Myanmar on May19.

5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates have {{segmented}} {{bodies with}} jointed limbs, all {{covered in a}} cuticle made of chitin and proteins. The chelicerate bauplan consists of two tagmata, the prosoma and the opisthosoma, except that mites have lost a visible division between these sections. The chelicerae, which give the group its name, are the only appendages that appear before the mouth. In most sub-groups, they are modest pincers used to feed. However, spiders' chelicerae form fangs that most species use to inject venom into prey. The group has the open circulatory system typical of arthropods, in which a tube-like heart pumps blood through the hemocoel, which is the major body cavity. Marine chelicerates have gills, while the air-breathing forms generally have both book lungs and tracheae. In general, the ganglia of living chelicerates' central nervous systems fuse into large masses in the cephalothorax, but there are wide variations and this fusion is very limited in the Mesothelae, which are regarded as {{the oldest and most}} primitive group of spiders. Most chelicerates rely on modified bristles for touch and for information about vibrations, <b>air</b> <b>currents,</b> and chemical changes in their environment.

5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which <b>air</b> <b>currents</b> shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

Results from these experiments show that the increase of the silo air extraction rate reduces <b>air</b> <b>current</b> segregation. The dimensional analysis method has been applied to form dimensionless groups out of the significant parameters. Five dimensionless groups were obtained which is unwieldy. To reduce the number of dimensionless groups the physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity. This simplified approach gives three dimensionless groups. Initial experiments justify further research to establish weather the simplified approach can scale the dynamic of the flow and the degree of segregation from a small scale silo to industrial equipment...|$|R
