5|$|After the Battle of the Coral Sea {{frustrated}} the Japanese plan {{to capture}} Port Morseby via an amphibious landing, the Japanese attempted {{to capture the}} town by landing the South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range. The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance, opposed by an ill-prepared CMF brigade designated 'Maroubra Force'. This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force {{but was unable to}} halt it. Two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force on 26 August but the Japanese continued to make ground and reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby on 16 September. The South Seas Force was forced to withdraw back along the track on this day, however, as supply problems made any further advance impossible and an Allied counter-landing at Buna was feared. Australian forces pursued the Japanese along the Kokoda Track and forced them into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua in early November. The Allied operations on the Kokoda Track were made possible by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel. The RAAF and USAAF also played an important role throughout the campaign by attacking the Japanese force's supply lines and <b>airdropping</b> supplies to Australian Army units.|$|E
5|$|The {{flaw in the}} Chinese {{plan was}} a lack of {{accurate}} intelligence about the UN forces. Even though the US X Corps was stretched thin over northeast Korea, the slow Marine advance allowed the bulk of the US 1st Marine Division, including the 5th, 7th and 11th Marines, to be concentrated at Yudami-ni. Furthermore, the strategically important Hagaru-ri, which contained an airfield and a supply dump, was not a priority for the Chinese despite being lightly defended by the 1st and the 7th Marines. Only the Regimental Combat Team 31, an understrength and hastily formed regimental combat team of the US 7th Infantry Division, was thinly spread along the eastern bank of the reservoir. Those units would later take the brunt of the Chinese assaults. As for the UN forces, the 1st Marine Division had an effective strength of 25,473 men {{at the start of the}} battle, and it was further reinforced by the British 41 Royal Marine Commando. and the equivalent of two regiments from the 3rd and the 7th Army Infantry Divisions. The UN forces had a combined strength of about 30,000 men during the course of the battle. The UN forces at Chosin were also supported by one of the greatest concentrations of air power during the Korean War, since the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing stationed at Yonpo Airfield and five aircraft carriers from the US Navy Task Force 77 were able to launch 230 sorties daily to provide close air support during the battle, while the US Air Force Far East Combat Cargo Command in Japan reached the capacity of <b>airdropping</b> 250 tons of supplies per day to resupply the trapped UN forces.|$|E

The Royal Lao Air Force being incapable of air {{delivery of the}} civic action supplies, another carrier had to be found. The U.S. 483rd Troop Carrier Wing of C-119 Flying Boxcars was forwarded from Ashiya Air Base, Japan. The C-119s were augmented by two new C-130 Hercules detailed to the specific task of air-dropping a pair of bulldozers.

25|$|In July 1987, {{faced with}} growing anger among its own Tamils and {{a flood of}} refugees, India intervened {{directly}} in the conflict {{for the first time}} by initially <b>airdropping</b> food parcels into Jaffna. After negotiations, India and Sri Lanka entered into the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Though the conflict was between the Tamil and Sinhalese people, India and Sri Lanka signed the peace accord instead of India influencing both parties to sign a peace accord among themselves. The peace accord assigned a certain degree of regional autonomy in the Tamil areas, with Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) controlling the regional council and called for the Tamil militant groups to surrender. India was to send a peacekeeping force, named the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), part of the Indian Army, to Sri Lanka to enforce the disarmament and to watch over the regional council.|$|E
25|$|In {{the city}} of Harran, a mysterious viral {{outbreak}} has turned most of the population into hyper-aggressive zombie-like creatures, forcing Harran's Defence Ministry to quarantine the entire city. The Global Relief Effort (GRE) assists survivors still trapped in the city by regularly <b>airdropping</b> supplies. The GRE hires Kyle Crane (Roger Craig Smith) to infiltrate Harran in order to retrieve a sensitive file stolen from them by Kadir Suleiman (Jim Pirri), which he is using as leverage to blackmail them, {{with the threat of}} publicizing it if anything were to happen to him. Crane is airdropped into Harran, where he is ambushed by a gang of hostile bandits. As the infected attack, Crane is bitten and infected, but rescued by Jade Aldemir (Nazneen Contractor) and Amir Ghoreyshi (Roy Vongtama). Amir sacrifices himself to buy Jade and Crane time, and Jade takes him to a survivor sanctuary called the Tower. Crane wakes up and is introduced to Rahim Aldemir (Suraj Partha), Jade's brother. Rahim then teaches Crane parkour and sends him to Spike (Kevin Daniels), who gives him his first task as a Runner of the tower. Crane learns that the Tower, which seeks to help other survivors, is being harassed by a gang of bandits led by a warlord named Rais who steals and hoards the supplies from the GRE airdrops, including Antizin; a drug that suppresses symptoms of infection and slows down the process of turning. After Harris Brecken (Matthew Wolf), leader of the tower is nearly killed by a rival runner in a mission to retrieve an Antizin drop, need for the drug becomes immense. Crane volunteers and manages to reach an airdrop containing Antizin, but despite the dire need of the medicine by the survivors, Crane is instructed by the GRE to destroy the airdrop, instructing him to reach out to Rais in order to buy the drug and possibly confirm his identity. Crane reluctantly complies and lies to the Tower that the supplies have been looted.|$|E

40|$|The United States {{military}} {{has always had}} an increasing need for more accurate <b>airdrops,</b> whether the drops are being implemented for various special operations missions, or for basic humanitarian relief. Improving the delivery accuracy of <b>airdrops</b> will result in numerous benefits. In attempting to improve <b>airdrop</b> accuracy, {{it is helpful to}} know what errors will arise throughout the course of a drop. This information is effective in revealing to the <b>airdrop</b> personnel what steps can be taken to improve the <b>airdrop,</b> as well as what the expected landing accuracy of the <b>airdrop</b> will be. This research converges on tools to assist in the estimation and improvement of <b>airdrop</b> landing errors. Wind estimation was studied to better understand the landing errors that stem from different wind prediction methods, as well as from onboard wind measurement systems. Other uncertainties, throughout each phase of an <b>airdrop,</b> are also known to produce landing errors, such as uncertainties in release conditions and parachute dynamics. These errors were implemented in <b>airdrop</b> simulations, for both unguided air release planning systems and guided <b>airdrop</b> systems, {{to determine the effects of}} these uncertainties on landing error. Error in wind estimation was found to be the largest source of error in the <b>airdrop</b> simulations. Guided systems were hypothesized to have much smaller landing errors than the unguided systems, and that hypothesis was confirmed in this study. One major benefit of using guidance was the ability to implement onboard wind measurement systems. Using the data from the simulation results, this information was combined to produce an <b>airdrop</b> planning aid to assist <b>airdrop</b> personnel in their aerial deliveries. (cont.)

No.37 Squadron was strengthened to create a [...] "super squadron" [...] on 17November 2006, when its force of twelve C-130Js was augmented by No.36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, prior to the latter re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemasters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined DHC-4 Caribous from No.38 Squadron {{as part of the}} RAAF's initial contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007. No.37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js completed the detachment's 20,000th hour of flying operations. The squadron was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing on 1October 2010, as part of a restructure of Air Lift Group. It was presented with the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency in 2011 at a ceremony on 31May 2012. The C-130Hs were retired the same year, the last pair at Richmond on 30November.
