2500|$|For example, the Irish writer Brian O'Nolan, {{who lived}} from 1911 to 1966, wrote under many pen {{names such as}} Flann O'Brien and Myles na Gopaleen. Catalogers at the United States Library of Congress chose one form—"O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966"—as the {{official}} heading. [...] The example contains all three elements of a valid authority record: the first heading O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966 is {{the form of the}} name that the Library of Congress chose as authoritative. In theory, every record in the catalog that represents a work by this author should have this form of the name as its <b>author</b> <b>heading.</b> What follows immediately below the heading beginning with Na Gopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966 are the see references. These forms of the author's name will appear in the catalog, but only as transcriptions and not as headings. If a user queries the catalog under one of these variant forms of the author's name, he or she would receive the response: [...] "See O'Brien, Flann, 1911-1966." [...] There is an additional spelling variant of the Gopaleen name: [...] "Na gCopaleen, Myles, 1911-1966" [...] has an extra C inserted because the author also employed the non-anglicized Irish spelling of his pen-name, in which the capitalized C shows the correct root word while the preceding g indicates its pronunciation in context. So if a library user comes across this spelling variant, he or she will be led to the same author regardless. See also references, which point from one authorized heading to another authorized heading, are exceedingly rare for personal name authority records, although they often appear in name authority records for corporate bodies. The final four entries in this record beginning with His At Swim-Two-Birds ... 1939. constitute the justification for this particular form of the name: it appeared in this form on the 1939 edition of the author's novel At Swim-Two-Birds, whereas the author's other noms de plume appeared on later publications.|$|E

An abstract for an ASME pa-per {{should be less}} than 150 words and is normally in italics. Please use this template to test how your figures will look on the printed journal page of the Journal of Mechanical De-sign. The Journal will no longer publish papers that contain errors in figure resolution. These usually consist of unread-able or fuzzy text, and pixilation or rasterization of lines. This template identifies the specifications used by JMD {{some of which may}} not be easily duplicated; for example, ASME actually uses Helvetica Condensed Bold, but this is not gen-erally available so {{for the purpose of this}} exercise Helvetica is adequate. However, reproduction of the journal page is not the goal, instead this exercise is to verify the quality of your figures.
