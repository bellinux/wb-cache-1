50|$|Many historians {{make the}} {{assumption}} that the letter was sent directly to an unknown archbishop based on the mentions of the co-bishops, but the abbot could very well be the <b>actual</b> <b>recipient</b> of this letter. The letter belongs to the tradition of Anglo-Saxon humanism. The request {{at the end of the}} letter extends to monks as lower clerics. Luitpold Wallach argues that coincidental similarities with the Capitulare Francofurtense contained in this letter suggest 794 as the earliest possible year when this letter to Baugulf was written. The letter is also paralleled by a letter written by Alcuin to Fulda after 800. Because of Alcuin’s letter to Fulda from Tours at a later date, this would mean that De litteris colendis couldn’t not have been written at a time when Alcuin was already at St Martin’s at Tours. More specifically, the letter addressing Baugulf is most likely written between June of 794, the period between the Synod of Frankfurt, and 796, Alcuin’s arrival as abbot of St Martain at Tours. Another possible date of the Letter was as early as 784/5.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{impact of}} size {{matching}} between {{donor and recipient}} is unclear in lung transplantation. Therefore, we determined the relation of donor lung size to 1) posttransplant survival and 2) pulmonary function as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second. MethodsFrom 1990 to 2006, 469 adults underwent lung transplantation with lungs from donors aged 7 to 70 years. Donor and recipient total lung capacities were calculated using established formulae (predicted total lung capacity), and <b>actual</b> <b>recipient</b> lung size was measured in the pulmonary function laboratory. Disparity between donor and recipient lung size was expressed as a ratio of donor predicted total lung capacity to recipient predicted total lung capacity—the predicted total lung capacity ratio—and predicted donor total lung capacity to <b>actual</b> <b>recipient</b> total lung capacity—the actual total lung capacity ratio. Survival was measured by multiphase hazard methodology and repeated measures of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey–normalized forced expiratory volume in 1 second analyzed by temporal decomposition. ResultsPredicted total lung capacity ratio and actual total lung capacity ratio ranged widely, from 0. 55 to 1. 59 and 0. 52 to 4. 20, respectively. Overall survival was unaffected by predicted total lung capacity ratio (P =. 3) or actual total lung capacity ratio (P =. 5). Patients with emphysema and an actual total lung capacity ratio of 0. 67 or less or 1. 03 or greater had higher predicted mortality (P =. 01). During the first posttransplant year, forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased and then gradually declined. Predicted total lung capacity ratio and actual total lung capacity ratio had a small impact on forced expiratory volume in 1 second, primarily in the late phase after transplant in a disease-specific manner. ConclusionSize matching between donor and recipient using predicted total lung capacity ratio and actual total lung capacity ratio is an effective technique. Wide discrepancies in lung sizing do not affect overall posttransplant survival or pulmonary function. Therefore, {{a greater degree of}} lung size mismatch can likely be accepted, thereby improving patients' odds of undergoing transplantation...|$|E
40|$|With today 2 ̆ 7 s {{emphasis}} on excellence, accountability and effectiveness, {{there have been}} numerous studies, not only on how to excel but also on how to measure effectiveness. Education like other businesses has its fair share of criticism, and its scholars have sought the causes and made recommendations to improve the state of our schools today. Yet, there is one area where very little investigation has been done, and that is in acquiring formally the perceptions and opinions of the elementary and middle school students about effective teaching. The students, by being the <b>actual</b> <b>recipients</b> of classroom interaction, should be as able to perceive teacher effectiveness as outside observers, yet rarely are their assessments sought. A reason cited for this lack of involvement has been the reliability of students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. The thrust of this investigation was to address the accuracy of students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions on teacher effectiveness. Using an instrument entitled Our Class and Its Work, data were collected from 40 teachers, 7 principals, and 332 students, enrolled in public and private metropolitan Milwaukee schools from grades 3 through 8. To some extent the students population represented various race/ethnic groupings. The instrument measures teaching behaviors related to student learning. An extension to the instrument was made by the investigator to measure communication, content and the integrity of the teacher, aspects which Ernest Boyer (1985) projected as necessary for effective teaching. The results of the study yielded a significant difference in perceptions of students and those of teachers and principals on aspects of communication and teaching behaviors.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the way in}} which the common law determines whether a publication is defamatory. It also touches on some related matters, such as the assessment of damages for defamation. The law frames the test for defamation not in terms of the reactions to a publication of its <b>actual</b> <b>recipients,</b> but rather the imagined responses of a hypothetical audience, whose members the law often describes as &# 145;ordinary reasonable people&# 146;. Through an analysis of case law, the thesis concludes that the legal test for defamation is ambiguous, not least as to whether it should always reflect mainstream opinion, even when it is anticipated that most people would respond to a publication irrationally. In light of such uncertainties, the thesis explores the law&# 146;s practical application, reporting on interviews with eight judges and 28 defamation lawyers, assessing how they understand and apply the law. It concludes that the majority of lawyers understand the test for defamation as intended to reflect how most people think, both in terms of their values as well as how they interpret communications. With that in mind, the thesis presents empirical findings on whether defamation law achieves that end. By means of a phone survey of 3, 000 adults, selected to represent Australia&# 146;s resident population, as well as eight focus groups conducted among sections of the general community, plus student surveys, answers are sought as to how a number of potentially defamatory publications are received among the public. A disconnect emerges between, on the one hand, the outcome of defamation trials and the views of judges and lawyers as to what is defamatory and, on the other, {{the way in which}} people actually respond to publications. Through further empirical research, the thesis accounts for this disparity by reference to a phenomenon identified in communications studies as the &# 145;third-person effect&# 146;: the tendency for individuals to perceive the negative impact of media messages as greater on others than on themselves. The thesis concludes that the law&# 146;s reliance on imagined, as opposed to real responses to potentially defamatory material distorts defamation law, unfairly benefiting plaintiffs at the expense of defendants, thus exacerbating the law&# 146;s chilling effect on free speech...|$|R

30|$|To {{the extent}} that the {{building}} of imaginative borders depends upon such image schemata as in/out, paths, and up/down, their breaching does, too. For example, the ritual use of toran seems to presuppose the experience of the body actually moving through a gateway, even if such movement is not generally possible in Rathva rituals. But the breaching of the borders would also seem to trigger other cognitive mechanisms, rooted in some of our most basic experiences as social animals. In performing puja Rathvas offer highly valued food and drink: the liver of animals and mahua liquor. 27 They also offer gifts. To be meaningful, both acts require an intentional recipient, even if no <b>actual</b> <b>recipient</b> can be perceived by the senses. The same is true of reciting mantras and singing gayna for someone else’s entertainment. The means used to suggest crossing the border from the other side – human embodiment of the devs and devis – invoke different mechanisms.

When the badvo dhunes and begins to act in ways that we do not ordinarily associate with him, we may experience this as play acting, but we may also experience it as a different mind in control of the body and suggest that a temporary shift of identity has occurred.
