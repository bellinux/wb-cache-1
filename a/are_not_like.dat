They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.|$|E
25|$|In the Cairo museum may be {{seen the}} statue of {{a man from the}} period of the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{possibly}} 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent rock crystal forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The IV., V. and VI. dynasties cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> <b>like</b> mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification (Maspero). As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these Ka statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.|$|E

500|$|The body of an {{alligator}} gar is torpedo shaped, usually brown or olive fading to a lighter gray or yellow ventral surface. Their scales <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> {{the scales of}} other fishes; rather, they are ganoid scales which are bone-like, diamond-shaped scales, often with serrated edges, and covered by an enamel-like substance. Ganoid scales are nearly impenetrable and are excellent protection against predation. Unlike other gar species, the upper jaw of {{an alligator}} gar has a dual row of large sharp teeth which are used to impale and hold prey. [...] Alligator gar are stalking, ambush predators, primarily piscivores, but they will also ambush and eat water fowl and small mammals they find floating on the water's surface.|$|E

She also became more outspoken in her advocacy for Chinese American causes and for better film roles. In a 1933 interview for Film Weekly entitled [...] "I Protest", Wong criticized the negative stereotyping in Daughter of the Dragon, saying, [...] "Why {{is it that the}} screen Chinese is always the villain?

Pterosaur [...] "pelts" [...] found [...] "preserved in concentrated, dense mats of fibers, similar to those found surrounding fossilized mammals" [...] suggest coats with a thickness comparable to many Mesozoic mammals, at least on the parts of the pterosaur covered in pycnofibers. The coat thickness, and surface area covered, definitely varied by pterosaur species.|$|E

500|$|Alligator gar have gills, {{but unlike}} {{other species of}} fish, with few exceptions, {{they also have a}} highly vascularized swim bladder lung that {{supplements}} gill respiration. The bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air which is why they are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation. [...] The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months. [...] The scales of alligator gar <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.|$|E
500|$|Films such as The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), Shanghai Express (1932) and The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), {{explored}} the exoticism of the Far East — by using white actors, not Asians, {{in the lead}} roles. The white actors frequently looked absurd in yellow-face makeup next to genuine Asians, so the studios would cast all the Asian parts white. Generally, [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] stereotypes dominated the portrayal of Asian characters, who were almost always villains. The American scholar Huang Yunte wrote that the character of Charlie Chan, a Chinese-American detective aided by his bumbling, Americanized [...] "Number One Son" [...] were virtually the only positive examples of Asian characters in Hollywood in this period.
