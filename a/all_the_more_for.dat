500|$|Although Century 21 had {{constructed}} a life-size Dove capsule in Slough, {{it could not}} be used for filming at Pinewood Studios due to an arrangement with the National Association of Theatrical Television and Kine Employees (NATTKE) to build and use such props exclusively on-site. Once the original had been incinerated, carpenters at Pinewood re-built the prop, although Anderson remained disappointed with the finished product, which he considered inferior. Reviewing the scale models of Doppelgänger, Martin Anderson of the entertainment website Den of Geek describes the Phoenix command module as [...] "beautifully ergonomic without losing too much NASA-ness", and the Dove lander module as [...] "a beautiful fusion of JPL gloss with classic lines". He argues that the Phoenix launch sequence stood as the finest example of Meddings' work until his contributions to the 1979 James Bond film Moonraker, and praises his efforts <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> the absence of computer animation in the late 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|Makin, having {{established}} quite firmly {{through her}} catalogue of other learned ladies that educated {{women were not}} a new phenomenon nor a threat to society, goes on to relate a series of staged proofs and refutations. She takes on a syllogistic form, logically deconstructing over twelve different objections to women's learning. Within the logos of her argument, some of her chief refutations involve responses to the claims that women will abuse their educations and not obey their husbands. She responds that [...] "tis not knowing too much but too little that causes the irregularity" [...] (Makin 1673), i.e., [...] "More education, not less, {{is the way to}} prevent pride,” (Hamilton 2001:150), and educated women will be better companions to their husbands and more efficient members of their families. She also logically counters the objection that women are of low parts, weak and soft and therefore uneducable. Makin's syllogistic response is that such [...] "deficiencies" [...] demand <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> the education of women and women will, in their softness, be all the more easy to educate.|$|E

You can help by your sympathy and your pen, but not by {{organizing}} the Movement and certainly not by offering Satyagraha. If you refer to the Congress resolution of Nagpur, it calls upon the Hindu Members to remove the curse of untouchability. Untouchability is the sin of the Hindus. They must suffer for it; they must pay the debt they owe to their suppressed brothers and sisters. Theirs is the shame and theirs must be the glory when they have purged themselves of the black sin. The silent loving suffering of one pure Hindu as such {{will be enough to}} melt the hearts of millions of Hindus, but the sufferings of thousands of non-Hindus on behalf of the untouchables will leave the Hindus unmoved. Their blind eyes will not be opened by outside interference, however well intentioned and generous it may be, for it will not bring home to them their sense of guilt. On the contrary, they would probably hug the sin, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more,</b> <b>for</b> such interference. All reforms to be sincere and lasting must come from within." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{recounted in}} his 1952 memoir Witness, Whittaker Chambers {{came to know}} Lore because they both {{reported}} to rezident Markin: [...] He described him as follows: [...] Lore was an old Bolshevik. He had been a Socialist before the Russian Revolution. In those pre-revolutionary days, {{he had been the}} friend of Trotsky, then a New York Socialist journalist. After the Revolution, Lore had managed an American speaking trip for Alexandra Kollontai, the author of Red Love, later the Soviet ambassador to Sweden. [...] Bukharin, in his New York days, had eaten and slept in the apartment on 55th Street in Brooklyn, where Lore, his outspokenly anti-Communist wife and three wholly American sons still lived. [...] He describes the Lore family with some detail: [...] I was introduced to Lillian Lore, Ludwig's remarkable wife, who in large part provided those meals, and, by some economic miracle, had kept that amazing household together during the long, lean years, had fed the endless procession of guests. [...] "Die unvergessliche Lores-the unforgettable Lores," [...] a German friend had called them... I have seldom seen a happy family life so explicit in the characters of all who shared it... I soon came to regard the Lores' house as a kind of second home. [...] For Ludwig I developed an almost filial feeling as of a younger for an older revolutionist. [...] The kindness of all the Lores to me was personal, and in spite of politics, for all {{the other members of the}} family, except Ludwig, were outspoken in their detestation of the Communist Party. [...] Chambers also describes a defector's fear of retribution from the Soviet Underground, which Lore and he shared: [...] I did not know that at the very time I was visiting him most frequently, Lore was under surveillance. [...] He was being watched, not by the American authorities, but by the Russian secret police... I discovered that he was afraid to walk alone with me on the street at night and that he was terrified to get into an automobile alone with me. Then I knew that there was something seriously amiss. But I had been out of the Communist Party six or seven years, and Lore was dead, before I discovered that the old Bolshevik, in whom, as a younger man, I respected the older revolutionist, had denounced me (around 1941) to the F.B.I. I learned it not from the FBI, but from another security agency of the Government. [...] I respected Lore <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>for</b> that act. My feeling for him and for all the Lores remained unchanged.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of "seasonality " {{on the distribution}} of maxima of a hydroiogical variable has been studied theoretically and through examples relating to flood discharges of three Italian rivers. Results obtained lead to the conclusions that: (a) The shape of the distribution function of annual extremes is not related to that of the seasonal components which determine it. In particular it is not stable (extreme values asymptotic distribution) even if the components are stable. This property weakens <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>the</b> reasons <b>for</b> the preference usually given to these distributions.
