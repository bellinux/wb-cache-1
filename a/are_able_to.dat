5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> make measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts {{to ensure that the}} subject's head does not move off the plane of measurement. Because 3D articulographs <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|Because adult great spotted kiwis {{are large}} and powerful, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> fend off most predators that attack them, such as stoats, ferrets, weasels, pigs, brush possums and cats, {{all of which are}} {{invasive}} species in New Zealand. However, dogs <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> kill even adults. Stoats, ferrets, possums, cats and dogs will feed on the eggs and chicks, meaning most chicks die within their first five months of life. Before the arrival of mammalian predators, the great spotted kiwi's natural predators would have been birds of prey like the extinct Haast's eagle and Eyles' harrier and the extant Swamp harrier.|$|E
