40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Acemetacin</b> is {{regarded}} as a pro-drug of indomethacin and induces significantly less gastric damage but the reasons for this greater gastric safety of <b>acemetacin</b> are unclear. The anti-inflammatory effects of <b>acemetacin</b> have been attributed, at least in part, to its hepatic biotransformation to indomethacin. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of <b>acemetacin</b> and indomethacin in an in vivo model of acute inflammation and to examine the importance of biotransformation of <b>acemetacin</b> (to indomethacin) to its anti-inflammatory actions. Experimental approach: The zymosan airpouch model was used in rats. Indomethacin or <b>acemetacin</b> (2. 7 – 83. 8 mmol kg 1) were administered orally or directly into the pouch. Leukocyte infiltration, prostaglandin (PG) E 2 and leukotriene (LT) B 4 levels in exudates, and whole blood thromboxane (TX) B 2 synthesis were measured. Key results: <b>Acemetacin</b> was rapidly converted to indomethacin after its administration. Both <b>acemetacin</b> and indomethacin elicited comparable, dose-dependent reductions of leukocyte infiltration and of PGE 2 and TXB 2 synthesis. However, indomethacin induced more gastric damage than <b>acemetacin</b> and elevated LTB 4 production in the airpouch. Conclusions and implications: The similar effects of <b>acemetacin</b> and indomethacin on leukocyte infiltration and PG synthesis are consistent with rapid biotransformation of <b>acemetacin</b> to indomethacin. Some of this biotransformation may occur extra-hepatically, for instance in inflammatory exudates. <b>Acemetacin</b> probably exerts actions independent of conversion to indomethacin, given the different effects of these two drugs on LTB 4 production.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Acemetacin</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) licensed for use in rheumatic {{disease and}} other musculoskeletal disorders in the UK, and widely available in other countries worldwide. This review sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral <b>acemetacin</b> in acute postoperative pain, using clinical studies of patients with established pain, and with outcomes measured primarily over 6 hours using standard methods. This type of study {{has been used for}} many decades to establish that drugs have analgesic properties. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of single dose oral <b>acemetacin</b> in acute postoperative pain, and any associated adverse events. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 2, 2009), MEDLINE via Ovid (1966 to May 2009); EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to May 2009); the Oxford Pain Relief Database (1950 to 1994); and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of oral <b>acemetacin</b> for relief of acute postoperative pain in adults. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. The area under the "pain relief versus time" curve was used to derive the proportion of participants with <b>acemetacin</b> and placebo experiencing least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, using validated equations. The number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) was calculated using 95 % confidence intervals. The proportion of participants using rescue analgesia over a specified time period, and time to use of rescue analgesia, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals was also collected. MAIN RESULTS: No study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of randomised evidence of efficacy for oral <b>acemetacin</b> in acute postoperative pain, we cannot, at present, make any conclusions regarding its effectiveness. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully.

40|$|<b>Acemetacin</b> (ACM) is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), {{which causes}} reduced gastric damage compared with indomethacin. However, <b>acemetacin</b> {{has a tendency to}} form a less soluble hydrate in the aqueous medium. We noted difficulties in the preparation of cocrystals and salts of <b>acemetacin</b> by mechanochemical methods, because this drug tends to form a hydrate during any kind of solution-based processing. With the objective to discover a solid form of <b>acemetacin</b> that is stable in the aqueous medium, binary adducts were prepared by the melt method to avoid hydration. The coformers/salt formers reported are pyridine carboxamides [nicotinamide (NAM), isonicotinamide (INA), and picolinamide (PAM) ], caprolactam (CPR), p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), and piperazine (PPZ). The structures of an ACM–INA cocrystal and a binary adduct ACM–PABA were solved using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Other ACM cocrystals, ACM–PAM and ACM–CPR, and the piperazine salt ACM–PPZ were solved from high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction data. The ACM–INA cocrystal is sustained by the acid [...] . pyridine heterosynthon and N—H [...] . O catemer hydrogen bonds involving the amide group. The acid [...] . amide heterosynthon is present in the ACM–PAM cocrystal, while ACM–CPR contains carboxamide dimers of caprolactam along with acid–carbonyl (ACM) hydrogen bonds.

40|$|The {{effect of}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) on the phase transition and phase properties of 1, 2 -dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) {{has been investigated}} in both 2 D (monolayers at the air/water interface) and 3 D (multilayers in lipid/water dispersions) model systems. The 2 D membrane models have been characterized by means of pressure-area isotherms and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and simultaneous small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction have been applied to lipid aqueous dispersions. All NSAIDs studied altered the main transition temperature of the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition, with the arylacetic acid derivatives (<b>acemetacin</b> and indomethacin) showing the largest effects. A comparison of the results reveals distinct structural features of the membrane models after interaction with the NSAID. All drugs induced perturbations in the lipid liquid-crystalline phase, suggesting {{a major change in}} the hydration behavior of DPPC.

40|$|AbstractIsothermal {{titration}} calorimetry {{was used}} to characterize and quantify the partition of indomethacin and <b>acemetacin</b> between the bulk aqueous phase and the membrane of egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Significant electrostatic effects were observed due to binding of the charged drugs to the membrane, which implied {{the use of the}} Gouy-Chapman theory to calculate the interfacial concentrations. The binding/partition phenomenon was quantified in terms of the partition coefficient (Kp), and/or the equilibrium constant (Kb). Mathematical expressions were developed, either to encompass the electrostatic effects in the partition model, or to numerically relate partition coefficients and binding constants. Calorimetric titrations conducted under a lipid/drug ratio > 100 : 1 lead to a constant heat release and were used to directly calculate the enthalpy of the process, ΔH, and indirectly, ΔG and ΔS. As the lipid/drug ratio decreased, the constancy of reaction enthalpy was tested in the fitting process. Under low lipid/drug ratio conditions simple partition was no longer valid and the interaction phenomenon was interpreted in terms of binding isotherms. A mathematical expression was deduced for quantification of the binding constants and the number of lipid molecules associated with one drug molecule. The broad range of concentrations used stressed the biphasic nature of the interaction under study. As the lipid/drug ratio was varied, the results showed that the interaction of both drugs does not present a unique behavior in all studied regimes: the extent of the interaction, as well as the binding stoichiometry, is affected by the lipid/drug ratio. The change in these parameters reflects the biphasic behavior of the interaction—possibly the consequence of a modification of the membrane’s physical properties as it becomes saturated with the drug...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{cytotoxicity}} of combining {{a range of}} clinically important non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{with a variety of}} chemotherapeutic drugs was examined in the human lung cancer cell lines DLKP, A 549, COR L 23 P and COR L 23 R and in a human leukaemia line HL 60 /ADR. A specific group of NSAIDs (indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, <b>acemetacin,</b> zomepirac and mefenamic acid) all at non-toxic levels, significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin and epirubicin), as well as teniposide, VP- 16 and vincristine, but not the other vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinorelbine. A substantial number of other anticancer drugs, including methotrexate, 5 -fluorouracil, cytarabine, hydroxyurea, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, actinomycin D, bleomycin, paclitaxel and camptothecin, were also tested, but displayed no synergy in combination with the NSAIDs. The synergistic effect was concentration dependent. The effect appears to be independent of the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitory ability of the NSAIDs, as (i) the synergistic combination could not be reversed by the addition of prostaglandins D 2 or E 2; (ii) sulindac sulphone, a metabolite of sulindac that does not inhibit the cyclooxygenase enzyme, was positive in the combination assay: and (iii) many NSAIDs known to be cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, e. g. meclofenamic acid, diclofenac, naproxen, fenoprofen, phenylbutazone, flufenamic acid, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen and ketoprofen, were inactive in the combination assay. The enhancement of cytotoxicity was observed in a range of drug sensitive tumour cell lines, but did not occur in P- 170 -overexpressing multidrug resistant cell lines. However, in the HL 60 /ADR and COR L 23 R cell lines, in which multidrug resistance is due to overexpression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP, a significant increase in cytotoxicity was observed {{in the presence of the}} active NSAIDs. Subsequent Western blot analysis of the drug sensitive parental cell lines, DLKP and A 549, revealed that they also expressed MRP and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated that mRNA for MRP was present in both cell lines. It was found that the positive NSAIDs were among the more potent inhibitors of [3 H]-LTC 4 transport into inside-out plasma membrane vesicles prepared from MRP-expressing cells, of doxorubicin efflux from preloaded cells and of glutathione-S-transferase activity.

Inflammatory processes have been suspected in the pathogenesis of the disease. OBJECTIVES To review the efficacy and side effects of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD, compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 12 April 2011 using the terms: aspirin OR "cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor" OR aceclofenac OR <b>acemetacin</b> OR betamethasone OR celecoxib OR cortisone OR deflazacort OR dexamethasone OR dexibruprofen OR dexketoprofen OR diclofenac sodium OR diflunisal OR diflusinal OR etodolac OR etoricoxib OR fenbufen OR fenoprofen OR flurbiprofen OR hydrocortisone OR ibuprofen OR indometacin OR indomethacin OR ketoprofen OR lumiracoxib OR mefenamic OR meloxicam OR methylprednisolone OR nabumetone OR naproxen OR nimesulide OR "anti-inflammatory" OR prednisone OR piroxicam OR sulindac OR tenoxicam OR tiaprofenic acid OR triamcinolone OR NSAIDS OR NSAID. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmacuetical registries) and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in AD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author assessed risk of bias of each study and extracted data. A second author verified data selection. MAIN RESULTS Our search identified 604 potentially relevant studies. Of these, 14 studies (15 interventions) were RCTs and met our inclusion criteria. The numbers of participants were 352, 138 and 1745 for aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs groups, respectively. One selected study comprised two separate interventions. Interventions assessed in these studies were grouped into four categories: aspirin (three interventions), steroids (one intervention), traditional NSAIDs (six interventions), and selective cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitors (five interventions). All studies were evaluated for internal validity using a risk of bias assessment tool. The risk of bias was low for five studies, high for seven studies, and unclear for two studies. There was no significant improvement in cognitive decline for aspirin, steroid, traditional NSAIDs and selective COX- 2 inhibitors. Compared to controls, patients receiving aspirin experienced more bleeding while patients receiving steroid experienced more hyperglycaemia, abnormal lab results and face edema. Patients receiving NSAIDs experienced nausea, vomiting, elevated creatinine, elevated LFT and hypertension. A trend towards higher death rates was observed among patients treated with NSAIDS compared with placebo and this was somewhat higher for selective COX- 2 inhibitors than for traditional NSAIDs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the studies carried out so far, the efficacy of aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs (traditional NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors) is not proven.

40|$|Human organic anion-transporting {{polypeptide}} 1 B 1 (OATP 1 B 1) and OATP 1 B 3 {{are important}} hepatic uptake transporters. Early assessment of OATP 1 B 1 / 1 B 3 -mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is therefore important for successful drug development. A promising approach for early screening and prediction of DDIs is computational modeling. In {{this study we}} aimed to generate a rapid, single Bayesian prediction model for OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 and OATP 1 B 3 inhibition. Besides our previously generated HEK-OATP 1 B 1 and HEK-OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 cells, we now generated and characterized HEK-OATP 1 B 3 cells. Using these cell lines we investigated the inhibitory potential of 640 FDA-approved drugs from a commercial library (10 μM) on the uptake of [3 H]-estradiol- 17 β-d-glucuronide (1 μM) by OATP 1 B 1, OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15, and OATP 1 B 3. Using a cut-off of ≥ 60 % inhibition, 8 % and 7 % of the 640 drugs were potent OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibitors, respectively. Only 1 % of the tested drugs significantly inhibited OATP 1 B 3, which was not sufficient for Bayesian modeling. Modeling of OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 inhibition revealed that presence of conjugated systems and (hetero) cycles with acceptor/donor atoms in- or outside the ring enhance {{the probability of a}} molecule binding these transporters. The overall performance of the model for OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15 was ≥ 80 %, including evaluation with a true external test set. Our Bayesian classification model thus represents a fast, inexpensive and robust means of assessing potential binding of new chemical entities to OATP 1 B 1 and OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15. As such, this model may be used to rank compounds early in the drug development process, helping to avoid adverse effects in a later stage due to inhibition of OATP 1 B 1 and/or OATP 1 B 1 ∗ 15.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} {{of a specific}} group of chemotherapeutic drugs was demonstrated to be enhanced {{in the presence of}} non-toxic concentrations of a number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This was found to occur in the drug sensitive A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma and D L K P human lung squamous carcinoma cell lines. The chemotherapeutic drugs for which the toxicity enhancement effect was found to occur (adriamycin, daunorubicin, epirubicin, vincristine and VP- 16) share the property of being potential substrates for the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP). The {{toxicity of}} drugs which were not MRP-substrates, was unaffected by NSAID treatment. The toxicity of non-chemotherapeutic drug substrates for MRP, such as the heavy metal sodium arsenate was also found to be enhanced {{in the presence of a}} suitable NSAID. NSAIDs are believed to exert their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects in vivo as a result of their ability to inhibit the enzyme prostaglandin H 2 synthase (PGHS), which is also known as cyclooxygenase (COX). The only NSAIDs found to possess chemotherapeutic drug toxicity enhancing abilities were: indomethacin, sulindac, sulindac sulfide, sulindac sulfone, tolmetin, <b>acemetacin,</b> mefenamic acid and zomepirac. The mechanism by which these NSAIDs enhanced the toxicity of a suitable chemotherapeutic drug was demonstrated to be independent of any effects of NSAIDs on PGHS. This was conclusively demonstrated by the ability of sulindac sulfone (a metabolite of sulindac which is devoid of inhibitory effects on PGHS) to enhance chemotherapeutic drug toxicity to the same extent as achieved using sulindac sulfide (a metabolite of sulindac with potent inhibitory effects on PGHS). MRP protein was demonstrated by Western blotting to be present in low levels in DLKP plasma membrane-derived inside-out vesicles (10 Vs). The MRP in DLKP IOVs was demonstrated to actively transport the M R P substrate leukotriene C 4 (LtC 4). This transport was shown to be inhibited by NSAIDs with drug toxicity enhancing abilities such as indomethacin, but was unaffected by NSAIDs which were without influence on chemotherapeutic d m g toxicity. These results suggested that NSAID-mediated enhancement of chemotherapeutic drug toxicity was dependent on the ability of an NSAED to interfere with the drug efflux activity of MRP. The presence of M R P protein in 10 Vs facilitated investigation into the cytotoxic drug transporting characteristics of MRP. The LtC 4 transport activity of MRP in IOVs from the MRP-overexpressing cell line H L 6 0 - A D R was found to be significantly inhibited by vincristine (an MRP substrate) but not by Taxol or cisplatin (non-MRP substrates). This inhibition in LtC 4 transport with vincristine was synergistically enhanced in the presence of non-inhibitory concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH). These results suggested that M R P substrate drugs such as vincristine may be actively transported by M R P in the presence of GSH. Demonstration of the presence of active MRP protein in DLKP suggested that M R P may also have been present in resistant variants of DLKP. Active MRP protein was shown to be present in a variety of DLKP-related drug resistant cell lines namely DLKP-A 10, DLKPA 2 B, DLKPA 1 IB, DLKPA 6 B and DLKPA 5 F. Preliminary evidence suggested that MRP may be involved in certain aspects of the cytotoxic drug accumulation characteristics of these drug resistant variants of DLKP...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Thirty-five Cochrane Reviews of {{randomised}} trials {{testing the}} analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain have been published. This overview brings together {{the results of}} all those reviews and assesses the reliability of available data. OBJECTIVES: To summarise data from all Cochrane Reviews that have assessed the effects of pharmaceutical interventions for acute pain in adults with at least moderate pain following surgery, who {{have been given a}} single dose of oral analgesic taken alone. METHODS: We identified systematic reviews in The Cochrane Library through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single Review Group, had a standard title, and had as their primary outcome numbers of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. For individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat (NNT) for this outcome for each drug/dose combination, and also the percentage of participants achieving at least 50 % maximum pain relief, the mean of mean or median time to remedication, the percentage of participants remedicating by 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours, and results for participants experiencing at least one adverse event. MAIN RESULTS: The overview included 35 separate Cochrane Reviews with 38 analyses of single dose oral analgesics tested in acute postoperative pain models, with results from about 45, 000 participants studied in approximately 350 individual studies. The individual reviews included only high-quality trials of standardised design and outcome reporting. The reviews used standardised methods and reporting for both efficacy and harm. Event rates with placebo were consistent in larger data sets. No statistical comparison was undertaken. There were reviews but no trial data were available for <b>acemetacin,</b> meloxicam, nabumetone, nefopam, sulindac, tenoxicam, and tiaprofenic acid. Inadequate amounts of data were available for dexibuprofen, dextropropoxyphene 130 mg, diflunisal 125 mg, etoricoxib 60 mg, fenbufen, and indometacin. Where there was adequate information for drug/dose combinations (at least 200 participants, in at least two studies), we defined the addition of four comparisons of typical size (400 participants in total) with zero effect as making the result potentially subject to publication bias and therefore unreliable. Reliable results were obtained for 46 drug/dose combinations in all painful postsurgical conditions; 45 in dental pain and 14 in other painful conditions. NNTs varied from about 1. 5 to 20 for at least 50 % maximum pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. The proportion of participants achieving this level of benefit varied from about 30 % to over 70 %, and the time to remedication varied from two hours (placebo) to over 20 hours in the same pain condition. Participants reporting at least one adverse event were few and generally no different between active drug and placebo, with a few exceptions, principally for aspirin and opioids. Drug/dose combinations with good (low) NNTs were ibuprofen 400 mg (2. 5; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 4 to 2. 6), diclofenac 50 mg (2. 7; 95 % CI 2. 4 to 3. 0), etoricoxib 120 mg (1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 7 to 2. 1), codeine 60 mg + paracetamol 1000 mg (2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 8 to 2. 9), celecoxib 400 mg (2. 5; 95 % CI 2. 2 to 2. 9), and naproxen 500 / 550 mg (2. 7; 95 % CI 2. 3 to 3. 3). Long duration of action (≥ 8 hours) was found for etoricoxib 120 mg, diflunisal 500 mg, oxycodone 10 mg + paracetamol 650 mg, naproxen 500 / 550 mg, and celecoxib 400 mg. Not all participants had good pain relief and for many drug/dose combinations 50 % or more did not achieve at last 50 % maximum pain relief over four to six hours. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is a wealth of reliable evidence on the analgesic efficacy of single dose oral analgesics. There is also important information on drugs for which there are no data, inadequate data, or where results are unreliable due to susceptibility to publication bias.

40|$|Thirty-five Cochrane Reviews of {{randomised}} trials {{testing the}} analgesic efficacy of individual drug interventions in acute postoperative pain have been published. This overview brings together {{the results of}} all those reviews and assesses the reliability of available data. To summarise data from all Cochrane Reviews that have assessed the effects of pharmaceutical interventions for acute pain in adults with at least moderate pain following surgery, who {{have been given a}} single dose of oral analgesic taken alone. We identified systematic reviews in The Cochrane Library through a simple search strategy. All reviews were overseen by a single Review Group, had a standard title, and had as their primary outcome numbers of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over four to six hours compared with placebo. For individual reviews we extracted the number needed to treat (NNT) for this outcome for each drug/dose combination, and also the percentage of participants achieving at least 50 % maximum pain relief, the mean of mean or median time to remedication, the percentage of participants remedicating by 6, 8, 12, or 24 hours, and results for participants experiencing at least one adverse event. The overview included 35 separate Cochrane Reviews with 38 analyses of single dose oral analgesics tested in acute postoperative pain models, with results from about 45, 000 participants studied in approximately 350 individual studies. The individual reviews included only high-quality trials of standardised design and outcome reporting. The reviews used standardised methods and reporting for both efficacy and harm.

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of HPLC {{stationary}} phases available for reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and the in-depth studies using probes to highlight differences between them, there is very {{little in the way of}} stationary phases which offer selectivity that is substantially different from that offered by the very commonly used alkyl-silicas. Therefore, the primary aim of the research programme was to explore and try to exploit LC stationary phases which offered genuinely different selectivity to alkyl-silicas for typical drug applications. Chiral stationary phases (CSP) potentially had different selectivity and in this context a secondary aim was to explore aspects of the enantioselectivity of CSP as well as their chemical selectivity. Claims of orthogonal selectivity had been made for pentafluorophenyl (PFP) phases and phases exhibiting the hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode. However, the Ultra PFP phase was found to be very similar in selectivity to ACE 5 C 18 for both amitriptyline and <b>acemetacin</b> related compounds. The ZIC-HILIC phase was shown to behave as a reversed-phase material at high aqueous content in the mobile phase. There was some indication of selectivity orthogonal to that of ACE 5 C 18 with low aqueous content in the mobile phase but this occurred at low retention and with mobile phases unsuitable for use with C 18 phases in coupled (column or phase) systems. Nonetheless the work carried out shed more light on the mechanisms taking place in the HILIC mode which is currently attracting so much interest. Also it was possible to put ZIC-HILIC to good use for polar plant metabolites and other applications. Chiral stationary phases (CSP) also offered the prospect of selectivity orthogonal to that of C 18 phases. Given the proliferation of such phases though and the fact that it would be useful to use CSP that gave chiral separations for a broad spectrum of compound classes as well as giving orthogonal separations between different compounds, it was decided to carry out comparative studies of CSP classes in order to identify any redundancies and to seek out CSP that were complementary to one another. The Regis Whelk-O 1 CSP was shown to be much superior to other higher-generation Pirkle-concept CSP such as DACH-DNB and ULMO. Also it was shown to be complementary to the Chiralcel OD derivatised ii polysaccharide CSP and that both had something to offer alongside the widely used Chiralpak AD derivatised polysaccharide CSP. It was also found that a series of Chiralcel OD clones were virtually identical to Chiralcel OD and similarly for Chiralpak AD clones. Chiralpak IA, an immobilised version of Chiralpak AD, was not markedly less enantioselective than Chiralpak AD. Chiralcel OJ was less enantioselective than Chiralpak AD but the gap in performance was not as wide as between Whelk-O 1 and the other Pirkle-concept CSP. The information gathered during these studies should prove to be of enormous value for further work in chiral LC method development screening. Before embarking on applications work utilising the stationary phase selectivity that had been found, a study was carried out on the effectiveness of the high efficiencies obtainable with short run times through ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC). It was found that, for a range of pharmaceutical applications, that it was still necessary in each case to adjust selectivity before increasing speed through working at higher temperatures with faster flow rates. In the course of this work some exceptionally high speed separations for example for paroxetine and related substances, benzodiazepines and flurbiprofen and related substances, were developed. With respect to the evaluation of CSP as orthogonal phases to alkyl silicas under reversed-phase conditions, the Whelk-O 1 CSP showed promise. However on closer inspection it was found that the Whelk-O 1 CSP had very similar selectivity to the alkyl silica phase, ACE 5 C 18, and deviation from this only occurred in instances when there was interaction with the chiral recognition site to give a separation of enantiomers. This prompted the notion that, rather than using Whelk- O 1 in a coupled column system with ACE 5 C 18, it could be used on its own for the separation of both trace enantiomer and all other related substances. This was shown to be possible using (S) -naproxen, laevokalim and (S) -flurbiprofen as illustrative examples. The evaluation of the enantioselectivity of CSP led to an optimised resolution (suitable for scaling up for preparative work) of the enantiomers of the former ‘legal-high’ drug, mephedrone, on Whelk-O 1 under normal phase conditions. It was also shown that the infrequently used Chiralcel OJ derivatised polysaccharide iii CSP was ideal for developing an assay to determine trace amounts of (R) -nicotine in (S) -nicotine. Overall, the information obtained on stationary phase selectivity and retentivity through evaluation and application will be of great value in HPLC and UHPLC column selection and also selection of orthogonal phases for coupled column systems but, ultimately, moving forward, most value may be in aiding the design of two-dimensional LC systems for complex mixture analysis. This would particularly apply to the use of CSP with reversed-phase eluents in achiral-chiral systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
