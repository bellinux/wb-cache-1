Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. When we got back, Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|In the US and Canada, {{the cover}} {{did not have}} any logo, but in the European nations, they were sold with Madonna's name and album title on the cover. Heiden {{explained}} in an interview with Aperture magazine that they thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to use a shrink wrap on the US covers, so that when one took it off, there would only be the photo of Madonna. For the European nations, Warner felt that the name was needed on the cover, as {{they did not want to}} take chance with Madonna's popularity there. The back sleeve and the booklet inside featured the song titles in Heiden's own handwriting. About cropping the image for the cassette and the vinyl versions, Heiden said: [...] "I think the image became more interesting cropped into a square—and <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> always started with the album cover configuration. It was like she was floating—her clothing was not visible. She took on the appearance of a marble statue—Goddess like. In the vertical cropping you see her leather jacket and the wall, and it becomes more typical, editorial, earthly." ...|$|E
500|$|Forbidden Planet {{became an}} instant success, and roles in other MGM {{films such as}} Ransom! (1956), The Opposite Sex (1956) and Hot Summer Night (1957) followed. In 1957 he won the lead role {{opposite}} Debbie Reynolds in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor, which, as a Chicago Tribune critic wrote in 1998, made people consider Nielsen a dramatic actor and handsome romantic lead. However, dissatisfied with the films he was offered, calling the studios [...] "a Tiffany, which had forgotten how to make silver", Nielsen left MGM after auditioning for Messala in the 1959 Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd got the role. After leaving the studios, Nielsen landed the lead role in the Disney miniseries The Swamp Fox, as American Revolutionary War hero Francis Marion. In a 1988 interview he reflected on the series, saying, [...] "That was a great experience, because the Disney people didn't do their shows like everyone else, knocking out an episode a week. ... We only had to do an episode a month, and the budgets were extremely high for TV <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time.</b> <b>We</b> had location shooting rather than cheap studio backdrops, and very authentic costumes." [...] Eight episodes were produced and aired between 1959 and 1961.|$|E

2500|$|Childhood friends Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders {{were born}} and raised in Chicago, United States. At first, they formed a band called Quadraphonics in middle school, with Lewis on guitar, Sanders on drums, DJ Calvin on bass, and [...] "another friend named Edgwick" [...] on guitar. In high school, only Lewis and Sanders stuck together, a time when they {{acquired}} a drum machine, a Moog synthesizer and other equipment used by the burgeoning Chicago house scene. They had discovered house music at high school parties (like Mendel Catholic High School) and nightclubs such as Ron Hardy's Muzic Box, the Power Plant and The Warehouse; the duo also frequented nightclubs in Toronto, Canada. Sanders recalls: [...] "That was '80 or so, '81. We just started doing a bunch of music at home. <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> got a 4-track. So, that's what we would do, go to school, and we would hang out and do music... and go shoot some ball, then work some more music." ...|$|E
2500|$|A city-level {{official}} in Liaoning province {{was asked by}} investigators what direction Bo Xilai may have given regarding removing organs from Falun Gong prisoners.

Another phone call recipient was a medical doctor at a military hospital in Liaoning. When asked about whether Falun Gong practitioners’ organs were ever used in transplant operations at a nearby hospital, the official answered in the affirmative: “All that was processed through the court.” The doctor soon grew uncomfortable with the line of questioning and refused to discuss the issue further without clearance from the hospital’s political division.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. He remembered that after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him. [...] "I remember that conversation very well; {{in response to}} my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s {{what he said to}} me." [...] He then said [...] "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007." [...] " [...] Russia announced a withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, limiting military forces in [...] and the Caucasus." [...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that his first meeting with Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>we</b> already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E
