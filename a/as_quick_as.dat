5|$|The 2nd Infantry Brigade {{took over}} {{the vanguard of the}} advance on 2 September, tasked with {{clearing}} the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E

According to memoirs of nuclear {{strategist}} and theorist Munir Ahmad Khan, the hectic discussion took place every day between ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, in an amid fears that India might attack Pakistan who was en route to become subsequent nuclear power. Since 1981, the commanders of the Pakistan's unified armed forces were given the standing orders to mobilize their forces at once, from all directions, <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> it can to divert such attacks.|$|E

Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after the canyon resembled an armed camp.|$|E

One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E

25|$|Mansell {{took over}} the car Senna {{was brought in to}} drive {{toward the end of the}} 1994 campaign. Mansell was paid {{approximately}} £900,000 per race, compared to his teammate Hill being paid £300,000 for the entire season. Mansell's return was helped by Bernie Ecclestone helping unravel his contracts in the United States. It was important for F1 to have a world champion driving that season and with worldwide TV viewing figures starting to decline, they needed Mansell. The 40-year-old was not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> Damon Hill in race trim but signs that his speeds were coming back were evident in Japan during a fantastic battle with the Ferrari of Jean Alesi. Mansell took his final Grand Prix victory in Adelaide, the last race of the season, having out-qualified the two title contenders at the time, Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher, in the process (helped out by the second qualifying session being held on a wet track, with the times from the first session making up the grid). The plan initially was for Mansell to protect Hill from Schumacher, but both drivers passed him at the start and eventually collided (causing the retirement of both), handing Schumacher his first world title.|$|E

500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter.

500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy was primarily positive, with many video game commentators complimenting its visuals and appeal to girls.

However, Harris was more critical of the physics of the pinballs, describing the mechanics as [...] "a little on the floaty side" [...] and [...] "not <b>as</b> <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> the previous pinball incarnations". Frank Provo felt the game would be popular with a younger audience, and complimented the vibrant colors of the tables and recreation of the films' soundtracks. The minigames and tables' designs were praised by a writer from Spong.com, who felt the game was a [...] "polished, playable pinball title that deserves checking out". Brett Allan Weiss of AllGame thought the game's multiplayer tournaments and adjustable difficulties encouraged family members to play together.|$|E
