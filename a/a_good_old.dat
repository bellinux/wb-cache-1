500|$|The Nazi Party's rise {{to power}} {{provided}} Himmler and the SS an unfettered opportunity to thrive. By 1933, the SS numbered 52,000 members. Strict membership requirements ensured that all members were of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk ("Aryan master race"). Applicants were vetted for Nordic qualities—in Himmler's words, [...] "like a nursery gardener trying to reproduce <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> strain which has been adulterated and debased; we started from the principles of plant selection and then proceeded quite unashamedly to weed out the men whom we did not think we could use for the build-up of the SS." [...] Few dared mention that by his own standards, Himmler did not meet his own ideals.|$|E

Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of {{what it meant to be}} a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty.... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I'm sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> Wayne movie like, say, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon with The Green Berets. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.|$|E

500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash they all go back to C major on <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> 6/4".|$|E
500|$|As well {{as using}} {{existing}} music, {{such as the}} themes for the Daleks, Cybermen, and Rose, Murray Gold specially composed {{a piece of music}} for Rose's farewell entitled [...] "Doomsday", which featured vocal work from Melanie Pappenheim. Instead of using the swelling violins that Davies {{and the rest of the}} production team had expected, Gold took a minimalist approach. When pitching the track to the production team, Gold described the track as representing Rose's unbridled energy and determination as she searches for the Doctor. He later said, [...] "I wanted to get that kind of throbbing, sort of hurt sound of quite emotional rock, because I thought that's what Rose would do if she was hurting and ran up to her bedroom and locked herself in her room and had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> cry, really." [...] The piece uses the same vocal work from [...] "Rose", when Rose first enters the TARDIS, thus creating a bookend effect. It is a favourite among fans and of executive producer Julie Gardner, and is one of the reasons, along with Pappenheim's overall contribution and the [...] "Song for Ten" [...] from [...] "The Christmas Invasion", that the [...] was released several months later.|$|E

[...] Modern critical reception of the film has been generally positive.

[...] TV Guide gave the film a five out of five star rating terming it [...] "a haunting, suspenseful sequel". Critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars out of four and compared it to Dr. Mabuse The Gambler stating that it is [...] "less stylized but no less entertaining".

[...] This {{was one of the}} earliest known references to ragtime on sheet music and the composition itself is regarded as the first published rag.

He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>old</b> colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection he told me to pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God."

2500|$|Ragtime – also spelled rag-time or rag time – is {{a musical}} style that enjoyed its peak {{popularity}} between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or [...] "ragged", rhythm. The style has {{its origins in}} African-American communities {{in cities such as}} St. Louis. Ernest Hogan (1865–1909) was a pioneer of ragtime and was the first composer to have his ragtime pieces (or [...] "rags") published as sheet music, beginning with the song [...] "LA Pas Ma LA," [...] published in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term ragtime. The term is actually derived from his hometown [...] "Shake Rag" [...] in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, another Kentucky native, has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition, [...] "You've Been <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Old</b> Wagon But You Done Broke Down", helped popularize the style. The composition was published in 1895, a few months after Ernest Hogan's [...] "LA Pas Ma LA." [...] Ragtime was also a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. [...] Ragtime composer Scott Joplin (ca. 1868–1917) became famous through the publication of the [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as [...] "The Entertainer" [...] (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.|$|E
