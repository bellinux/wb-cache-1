5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|Following its ratings success, What Not to Wear was {{promoted}} from BBC Two to BBC One in 2004, and secured even larger audiences. The format was changed slightly, to a 60-minute show with two makeovers {{instead of a}} 30-minute show with only one makeover and also saw Constantine spending <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> one of her subjects. What Not to Wear soon gained her international fame when it was aired {{in countries such as}} Spain and Portugal {{as well as in the}} American continent.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the FDA {{approved}} a sustained-release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR, {{intended to be}} taken twice <b>a</b> <b>day</b> (<b>as</b> compared with {{three times a day}} for immediate-release Wellbutrin). In 2003, the FDA {{approved a}}nother sustained-release formulation called Wellbutrin XL, intended for once-daily dosing. Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada. In Canada, generic XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan. In 1997, bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban. In 2006, Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

Awaiting {{them on the}} dock were Armstrong, Hawaiian consul general Elisha Hunt Allen, Jr. and Claus Spreckels. New York was in mourning over the September 19 death of President Garfield. Out of respect to the solemnity of the tragedy, Kalākaua attended no public or private functions in the city. The royal party did, however, spend <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> private tourists at Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to downgrade Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>as</b> it tracked north-northwestward, eventually dissipating 70mi (110km) south-southwest of Bahía Asunción on July 26.|$|E
5|$|Hyde Park {{has been}} a major venue for several Royal jubilees and celebrations. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887, a party was {{organised}} on 22 June where around 26,000 school children were given a free meal as a gift. The Queen and the Prince of Wales made an unexpected appearance at the event. Victoria remained fond of Hyde Park in the final years of her life and often drove there twice <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>As</b> part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977, a Jubilee Exhibition was set up in Hyde Park, with the Queen and Prince Philip visiting on 30 June. In 2012, a major festival took place in the park as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. On 6 February, the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery fired a 41-gun Royal Salute at Hyde Park Corner.|$|E

5|$|Milton Hay desired {{that his}} nephew go to Washington as a {{qualified}} attorney, and John Hay {{was admitted to}} the bar in Illinois on February 4, 1861. On February 11, he embarked with President-elect Lincoln on a circuitous journey to Washington. By this time, several Southern states had seceded to form the Confederate States of America in reaction to the election of Lincoln, seen as an opponent of slavery. When Lincoln was sworn in on March 4, Hay and Nicolay moved into the White House, sharing a shabby bedroom. As there was only authority for payment of one presidential secretary (Nicolay), Hay was appointed to a post in the Interior Department at $1,600 per year, seconded to service at the White House. They were available to Lincoln 24 hours <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>As</b> Lincoln took no vacations as president and worked seven days a week, often until 11 pm (or later, during crucial battles) the burden on his secretaries was heavy.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of Shuffle! {{follows the}} life of Rin Tsuchimi, a normal seventeen-year-old second-year high school student who finds himself sought after {{by a variety of}} girls.
