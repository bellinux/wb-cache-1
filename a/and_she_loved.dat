25|$|In 1738, Montagu {{wrote to}} Harley {{explaining}} {{that she had}} no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible to love a man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> her child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.|$|E

The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if we wanted to go that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|Outhwaite {{had long}} {{been a fan of}} Inside No. 9 and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of Hotel Babylon. She was {{particularly}} pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene. Outhwaite, like some of the other performers, expressed her enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> her [...] "selfish, sad and manipulative" [...] character, Connie. The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite [...] "brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which [...] "a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing. The music was pumped up and we had a mini party, with mad dancing – that was a memorable scene to film." ...|$|E

500|$|Vig {{recalled}} that the title [...] "Not Your Kind of People" [...] {{came to him}} when he was stuck in a traffic jam in Los Angeles; he texted Manson the idea for a title <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> it. Manson wrote all the lyrics that night, and the next day the four of them gathered with acoustic guitars and wrote the music to the song in about half an hour. Manson explained that the album title Not Your Kind of People was [...] "a call to arms in a way to anyone who feels like we do about the world", saying that [...] "it can be great to be outsider." [...] She felt that this applied to them as the band [...] "never fit into a music scene" [...] and that [...] "in my life I've never been an insider." [...] Manson also described the title as [...] "a two-fingered salute to people who reject or criticize us", stating the band was [...] "only really interested in people who share our outlook" [...] as she considered that their fans were [...] "the people who connect with what you're saying and how you say it." ...|$|E

Musician said about the album: [...] "Loup Garou is subtle in nuance but staggering in scope, it connects the dots between all of the artist's sacrosanct influences, often {{within the framework of}} a single song... All of it is on the money, performed from the heart..." [...] Loup Garou featured a duet with Brenda Lee; DeVille said: [...] "She didn't know who the hell I was. I just called her up, played the song for her, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> it. She had her business people check me out, and they reported that I was big in Europe and had been recording for twenty years. So I flew to Nashville ...
