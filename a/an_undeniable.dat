25|$|With the sonatas of 1915–1917 {{there is}} a sudden shift in the style. These works recall Debussy's earlier music in part, but also look forward, with leaner, simpler structures.

This shift parallels the movement commonly known as neo-classicism, which became popular {{after his death in}} 1918. He planned a set of six sonatas, but had only completed three (cello, flute-viola-harp, and violin) before he died.|$|E

25|$|Ed Walters, a {{building}} contractor, in 1987 allegedly perpetrated a hoax in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Walters claimed at first having seen a small UFO flying {{near his home}} and took some photographs of the craft. Walters reported and documented a series of UFO sightings {{over a period of}} three weeks and took several photographs. These sightings became famous, and are collectively referred to as the Gulf Breeze UFO incident. Three years later, in 1990, after the Walters family had moved, the new residents discovered a model of a UFO poorly hidden in the attic that bore <b>an</b> <b>undeniable</b> resemblance to the craft in Walters' photographs. Most investigators, like the forensic photo expert William G. Hyzer, now consider the sightings to be a hoax.|$|E
25|$|While Dutch {{portrait}} painting {{avoids the}} swagger and excessive {{rhetoric of the}} aristocratic Baroque portraiture current {{in the rest of}} 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to <b>an</b> <b>undeniable</b> sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting en masse, as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.|$|E
25|$|He {{says that}} Dewey {{was wrong to}} treat his {{definition}} of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has <b>an</b> <b>undeniable</b> value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension {{of the concept of}} art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world".|$|E

The coating consists of a compact and thick layer of lead ditetradecanoate, which is formed upon immersion of a lead substrate in a melted sample of tetradecanoic acid at 60 °C. Coated lead samples were exposed either to an aqueous corrosive environment or to a closed chamber with high relative humidity and an oak corrosive atmosphere. The corrosion resistance of the coating was followed for 60 days by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.

40|$|Undeniable {{signatures}} are classic digital signatures {{which are}} not universally verifiable and can only be verified {{with the help of}} the signer. Its extended version, convertible undeniable signatures, equips the signer with the additional ability to make his undeniable signatures universally verifiable whenever required. <b>A</b> selectively-convertible <b>undeniable</b> signature scheme allows the signer to convert a single signature into a universally verifiable signature by releasing a selective proof in a later time, while “universally-convertible” refers to the case where the signer has the additional ability to generate a universal proof which can finally convert all his undeniable signatures into universally verifiable signatures. In this paper, we propose a generic construction for universally-convertible undeniable signatures. Our construction is based on three building blocks: a strongly unforgeable classic signature scheme, <b>a</b> selectively-convertible <b>undeniable</b> signature scheme and a collision-resistant hash function. Formal proofs guarantee that our construction has a tight security reduction to the underlying security assumptions. As one of the applications of our generic construction, one can obtain the first provable secure universally-convertible undeniable signature scheme in the standard model...|$|R
