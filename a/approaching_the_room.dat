60|$|What {{the doctor}} {{answered}} to this I cannot say. Just as the officer had done speaking, I heard footsteps <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in which I was listening. Was Screw looking for me? I instantly closed the peephole and got behind the door. It opened back upon me, and, sure enough, Screw entered cautiously.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a quick}} step {{along the}} {{corridor}} <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> The next moment the door flew open to the bounding step and laughing face of Barker. Whatever of thoughtfulness or despondency he had carried from the room with him was completely gone. With his amazing buoyancy and power of reaction he was there again in his usual frank, cheerful simplicity.|$|E

[...] "Now one word," [...] he continued hurriedly, as the footsteps halted at the door.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of Captain Dale with Stowell only whetted the curiosity of the assembled students, and from half-closed doors {{they watched the}} head of the school and <b>the</b> little sneak <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> door was left open, and a moment later out popped one mouse, quickly followed by another.|$|R
60|$|The {{sound of}} {{footsteps}} came to Mr. Scobell's ears as he <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> His Highness {{appeared to be}} pacing the floor like a caged animal at the luncheon hour.

60|$|Lucy {{pressed my}} hand, and {{appeared}} relieved from {{a load of}} intense anxiety by this seeming fortitude. She bade me remain where I was, until she had herself apprized Grace of my return from church. I {{could see through the}} open door that the negresses had been directed to retire, and presently I heard the footstep of Mr. Hardinge <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> adjoining that in which I then was, and which answered the purpose of a sort of ante-chamber for those who came to the sick-room from the more public side of the house. I met my excellent old guardian in that apartment, and Lucy was at my side at the next instant. One word from the last sufficed to keep us in this room while she returned to that of Grace.|$|E
50|$|Later, Noah Bennet and Matt Parkman {{come into}} the building. Molly tells Mohinder that Matt is there. Through the {{surveillance}} camera, they see Mr. Bennet and Parkman <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Bennet wants to kill Molly to protect Claire but Mohinder will not let him and holds a gun to Bennet, who is holding a gun to Molly. Matt Parkman ceases the potential gunfire and Mohinder escapes the building with Molly, Micah Sanders, Niki Sanders, and D.L. Hawkins.|$|E
50|$|Olivier's men fake {{an image}} of Paolo <b>approaching</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> on the {{security}} cameras, leading Warren to go outside to get him. Arnold realizes it's a trap, but gets over to Warren too late, who is captured. Arnold chases Olivier and Warren to Olivier's ship, which he also hopes to use to escape the asteroid after rescuing Warren. Warren, however, inspired {{by an act of}} Paolo's, sets off an explosion as a distraction to escape, also resulting in the ship being rendered unusable.|$|E

40|$|Oscar Thompson, a third-year {{medical student}} on {{a shift in}} the {{emergency}} department, is eager to participate in as many procedures as possible. According to the triage nurse's history, the next patient to be seen is a 58 -year-old man who has had fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Anticipating his first lumbar puncture, Oscar <b>approaches</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with enthusiasm. <b>The</b> nurse whispers that the patient is irritated and can't wait to see the doctor.

60|$|As they <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> ground floor, Iris stopped: {{her eyes}} {{rested on the}} doctor. Even to that coarse creature, the eloquent look spoke for her. Fanny noticed it, and {{suddenly}} turned her head aside. Over the maid's white face there passed darkly an expression of unutterable contempt. Her mistress's weakness had revealed itself--weakness {{for one of the}} betrayers of women; weakness for a man! In the meantime, Mr. Vimpany (having got the money) was ready to humour the enviable young lady with a well-filled purse.|$|R
60|$|Mary {{dropped back}} {{on to the}} sofa, and covered {{her eyes with her}} hand: then Constance, seeing Fan <b>approaching</b> her, left <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|Arriving at {{the upper}} flight of steps, I was startled by hearing a sudden cry from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> above.

5|$|Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn {{investigate}} a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake {{may have been}} captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a ventilation shaft. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes.

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{catch up}} with the truck, and while {{pursuing}} it encounter strange weather. The truck stalls, but when they head inside it they find both Druce and the E.B.E. have vanished. When they investigate the truck and the area, Mulder concludes that the encounter was a constructed hoax, intended to convince the duo to cease further pursuit. With help from MUFON and NICAP, Mulder tracks Druce and the E.B.E. to a power plant in Mattawa, Washington. With assistance from the Lone Gunmen, the agents are able to enter the plant with fake identification. Their unfamiliarity soon gives them away, but Mulder flees from the guards through a restricted area and is about to <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where <b>the</b> creature is held when armed guards stop him.|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{performance of}} two dimensional transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is {{strongly influenced by}} the amount of structural defects inside. In this work, we provide an optical spectroscopic characterization <b>approach</b> to correlate <b>the</b> amount of structural defects and the electrical performance of WSe 2 devices. Low temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of electron beam lithography (EBL) processed WSe 2 presents a clear defect-induced PL emission due to excitons bound to defects, which would strongly degrade the electrical performance. By adopting an e-beam-free transfer-electrode technique, we are able to prepare backgated WSe 2 device with limited amount of defects. A maximum hole-mobility of about 200 cm 2 /Vs was achieved due to reduced scattering sources, which is the highest reported value among its type. This work would not only provide a versatile and nondestructive method to monitor the defects in TMDs, but also a new route to <b>approach</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> temperature phonon-limited mobility in high performance TMDs devices.

40|$|An acid-induced cyclohexanone/tert-butylhydroperoxide {{initiation}} {{system for}} ambient temperature reversible addition–fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization of vinyl monomers is presented. The reaction system is optimized for {{the synthesis of}} poly(n-butyl acrylate) of various chain length. The polymerization shows typical living characteristics and polymers with dispersities close to 1. 1 are obtained. Analysis of the polymer end groups by means of soft ionization mass spectrometry reveals the typical distribution of polymer containing both R and Z RAFT end groups and a minor distribution of a RAFT polymer carrying a cyclohexanone end group in α position. This observation demonstrates that the polymerization is initiated solely by ketone radicals despite a relatively complex initiation mechanism that involves several intermediates. <b>The</b> <b>room</b> temperature-derived homopolymers are successfully chain extended with tert-butyl acrylate resulting in well-defined block copolymer structures. To demonstrate the versatility of <b>the</b> <b>approach,</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> temperature RAFT polymerization is also applied to synthesize styrene and N-isopropylacrylamide, yielding best results for polystyrene. Finally, also a bisperoxide structure is tested as an alternative for the ketone/peroxide mixture. Polymerization proceeds substantially faster {{in this case and}} successful controlled polymerization to full conversion is achieved even at 0 °C. In general <b>the</b> proposed <b>room</b> temperature RAFT technique is very easy to carry out, in principle easily up scalable, metal free and shows high potential toward the synthesis of well-defined temperature sensitive materials...|$|R

40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of Ti 2 AlC transport properties is investigated {{focusing on}} the Hall effect and resistivity vs temperature measurements performed on a highly (000 l) -oriented thin film and a bulk polycrystalline sample. Experimental data are interpreted {{on the basis of}} density functional theory calculations including transport coefficients obtained with the Boltzmann semiclassical transport equation in the isotropic relaxation time approximation. It is shown that the Hall constant is independent of the temperature and that the charge-carrier sign depends on the investigated crystallographic orientation. Charge carriers exhibit a holelike character along the basal plane of the Ti 2 AlC, whereas the bulk sample Hall constant is negative. The resistivity anisotropy is also evidenced: using an effective medium <b>approach,</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> temperature basal plane resistivity is shown to be more than one order of magnitude lower than that along the c axis. This very important anisotropy is shown to result from the anisotropy of the Fermi surface increased by electron-phonon interactions. These interactions are much more important along the c axis than within the basal plane, a situation opposite to that observed in literature for Ti 2 GeC where resistivity was reported to be isotropic...|$|R
