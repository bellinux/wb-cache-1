40|$|Lately, {{with the}} {{increasing}} use of <b>automated</b> <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions</b> (AMT) the engagement control of the dry clutch becomes more important. The engagement control plays a crucial role, since different and conflicting objectives have to be satisfied: preservation of driver comfort, fast engagement and small friction losses. In this paper two optimal control strategies for clutch engagement, based on hybrid control principles, are compared. For developing a useful clutch control scheme, the driveline is modelled as a piecewise linear system. The first control strategy is widely known as explicit MPC. However, it seems that it is not suitable (yet) for this type of problem. The second strategy is a piecewise LQ controller, based on piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Simulation results obtained with both strategies are presented and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|In <b>Automated</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>Transmissions</b> (AMTs) {{the clutch}} control {{strategies}} {{to manage the}} engagement operation and clutch vibrational behaviour are mutual interdependent and only an optimized mechatronic design could lead to an effective target from several points of view: passengers' comfort, fuel economy, system reliability, performance, driving feeling, etc. In fact, noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) phenomena are crucial subjects in the modern automotive industry. In passenger car equipped with automatic transmissions the electronic management of the coupling between engine and transmission couldn’t provide sensible improvement of comfort and overall vehicle performance during gearshifts without the availability of dependable models of the flywheel, clutch and driveline as powerful tools for vehicle design engineers. In this paper, simulations of driveline vibrational behaviour have been performed by implementing a high-order multi-body model for the dry clutch mechanism {{with the purpose of}} studying the excitation of torsional vibration caused by frictional actions during the slip phase of the clutch engagement in <b>manual</b> or <b>automated</b> <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The analysis aims at deepen about the coupling between pressure plate wobbling and torsional motions in order to improve the current understanding of the excitation mechanisms in the frequency region of the so-called “eek noise”, 250 - 500 Hz. The results of this work substantiate that enhancing of torsional motion in the characteristic frequency range of the eek effect occurs in vehicle launch and gear shifting operations regardless of the rigid wobbling motion of the pressure plate. Such outcomes underline the need to include the non-linear characteristic of the clutch cushion spring in the simulation frictional induced vibration originated at clutch level. Simulations of gear-shifting operations have been carried out by applying ramp profiles to the clutch throwout bearing according to the requirements of typical manoeuvres in passenger cars...|$|R

Such a system is widely spread as engagement device in <b>Automated</b> <b>Manual</b> <b>Transmissions</b> (AMTs) and Dual-Clutch Transmissions (DCT) to manage the energy flow from the engine to the vehicle wheels. These modern transmissions introduce improvements on shifting quality, fuel consumptions, pollutant emissions at relatively low-cost respect to other automatic transmissions.

Thus, a phenomenological approach to model the torque transmitted by the specific clutch architecture is a critical matter to design robust engagement control strategies. To this aim the controller performance of an actuated dry clutch by taking into account the uncertainty of the frictional phenomena on the clutch torque characteristic has been investigated in this work. The outcomes of this analysis prove the limits related to poor modelling of the influence of operating variables on the clutch torque, even when advanced control algorithms are implemented in the TCU...|$|R

40|$|Dry dual {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in <b>automated</b> <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In such systems the clutch engagement maneuvers require a precise knowledge of the characteristics that relate the frictional torque transmitted by the clutches with the corresponding actuators variables. In this paper a temperature and slip speed dependent model of the torque characteristic for dry dual clutches is proposed. Dynamic models of the temperature evolution are determined and linked to {{the characteristics of the}} mechanical components influencing the torque. The models, whose parameters are tuned with dedicated experiments and realistic data coming from an industrial automotive environment, show the temperature influence on the torque transmitted by the clutch. Real time simulation results, obtained through a detailed software in the loop driveline model, showthat, if not compensated, the temperature variation can determine critical degradations of the clutch engagement performances. It is shown how the use of the clutch temperature estimation in the torque transmissibility model allows to compensate for such negative effects. The torque model is also exploited for the realization of a decoupling clutch engagement controller. The corresponding closed loop results show the effectiveness of the proposed compensations for the dependencies of the clutch torque on temperature and slip speed...|$|R

Furthermore, sensitivity analyses on control schemes for this type of transmissions have shown that uncertainties on the prediction of the actual torque transmitted by the clutch can severely affect the engagement performance. In this paper a high order dynamic model of the powertrain system which includes the electro-hydraulic actuator dynamics has been analysed to design a feedback controller based on multiple Model Predictive Controller (MPC).

40|$|The main {{benefits}} of dual clutch transmissions (DCTs) are: (i) a {{higher energy efficiency}} than automatic transmission systems with torque converters; and (ii) the capability to fill the torque gap during gear shifts to allow seamless longitudinal acceleration profiles. Therefore, DCTs are viable alternatives to <b>automated</b> <b>manual</b> <b>transmissions</b> (AMTs). For vehicles equipped with engines that can generate considerable torque, large clutch-slip energy losses occur during power-on gear shifts and, as a result, DCTs need wet clutches for effective heat dissipation. This requirement substantially reduces DCT efficiency because of the churning and ancillary power dissipations associated with the wet clutch pack. To {{the knowledge of the}} authors, this study is the first to analyse the detailed power loss contributions of a DCT with wet clutches, and their relative significance along a set of driving cycles. Based on these results, a novel hybridised AMT (HAMT) with a single dry clutch and an electric motor is proposed for the same vehicle. The HAMT architecture combines the high mechanical efficiency typical of AMTs with a single dry clutch, with the torque-fill capability and operational flexibility allowed by the electric motor. The measured efficiency maps of a case study DCT and HAMT are compared. This is then complemented by the analysis of the respective fuel consumption along the driving cycles, which is simulated with an experimentally validated vehicle model. In its internal combustion engine mode, the HAMT reduces fuel consumption by > 9 % with respect to the DCT...|$|R

These studies address&# 61472;uphill acceleration and engine torque down control. The optimisation criterion used is minimum acceleration time.
