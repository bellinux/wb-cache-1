500|$|HMS Indomitable [...] was one {{of three}} s built for the Royal Navy before World War I and had an active career during the war. She tried to hunt down the German ships [...] and [...] in the Mediterranean when war broke out and bombarded Turkish fortifications {{protecting}} the Dardanelles even before the British declared war on Turkey. She helped to sink the German armoured cruiser [...] during the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and towed the damaged British battlecruiser [...] to safety after the battle. She damaged the German battlecruisers [...] and [...] during the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916 <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> sister ship [...] explode. Deemed obsolete after the war, she was sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{accompanied}} {{the family to}} Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers. Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry {{so as not to}} pass on the illness. By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in San Marcos. The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father. Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the lady of the house and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers. In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to Hawaii, where they met Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani and watched the ceremony that delivered Hawaii to the United States. The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship. Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she [...] "had an awful feeling". He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.|$|E
500|$|The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on Sunday, July 14 {{with the}} broad {{daylight}} abductions {{of two women}} from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah, [...] east of Seattle. Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as [...] "Ted," [...] he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him {{as far as his}} car, saw that there was no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that one was forced to watch as the other was murdered—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis {{on the eve of his}} execution.|$|E

500|$|Following the character's reinvention as the {{information}} broker Oracle, {{she has been}} regarded {{as a symbol of}} empowerment for disabled people. In Unleashing the Superhero in Us All (2008), author T. James Musler notes that [...] "or quite sometime, any handicap was considered insurmountable" [...] citing Franklin D. Roosevelt as an example, who was never photographed in a wheelchair to avoid a perception of weakness. In reference to Barbara Gordon, he states [...] "ather than quitting crime fighting, Barbara combines her intellect and computer skills to help the superhero community by gathering and passing along information." [...] Her character thus signifies that [...] "o longer is a handicap overwhelming, a person can live a strong good life, handicap or not." [...] In The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia Of Comic-Book Icons And Hollywood Heroes (2004), author Gina Renée Misiroglu observes that while disabled characters in comic books are typically utilized as gimmicks, or—as with Charles Xavier and Daredevil—are introduced with a pre-existing condition as part of their origin myth, [...] "s Oracle... Gordon stands tall as the most empowering disabled superhero. Readers witnessed her tragedy, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> rise above it." [...] James B. South's chapter [...] "Barbara Gordon and Moral Perfectionism" [...] in the 2004 book Superheroes and Philosophy analyzes how the changes in her life [...] "from librarian to Batgirl to Oracle" [...] drive her to pursue a higher self, illustrating the philosophical theory of moral perfectionism.|$|E

2500|$|Greenlings third war patrol {{took her}} off the Japanese home islands. Departing Midway 23 September, the {{submarine}} sank the cargo ship Kinkai Maru 3 October, and Setsuyo Maru the next day. She fired three torpedoes at cargo ship Takusei Maru 14 October, scored three hits, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> sink {{in the space of}} 6minutes. This attack brought a host of escort vessels to search for Greenling, but she evaded them and attacked a large freighter 18 October. One torpedo set the target aflame, but the second [...] "fish" [...] ran erratically, circled, and almost hit Greenling. The next ran true, however, and cargo ship Hakonesan Maru was sent to the bottom. After destroying a sampan in the Tokyo–Aleutian Islands shipping lanes 21 October, Greenling returned to Pearl Harbor 1 November. The attrition on Japanese shipping by submarines was already being felt and would be a major factor in their eventual defeat.|$|E
