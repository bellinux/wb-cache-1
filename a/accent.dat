5|$|The Westerosi {{characters}} of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently) with the <b>accent</b> of the English region {{corresponding to the}} character's Westerosi region; Eddard Stark (Warden of the North) speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern <b>accent,</b> and the southern lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a southern <b>accent,</b> while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish <b>accent.</b> Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British <b>accent.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} extract and {{classify}} focus <b>accents</b> has been developed. It works for German spontaneous speech. The method tries to distinguish 2 ̆ 7 normal 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 contrastive/emphatic 2 ̆ 7 focus <b>accents</b> using phrase boundaries. It {{was found that}} contrastive/emphatic <b>accents</b> tend to have greater distances to phrase boundaries than normal focus <b>accents.</b> Moreover, for contrastive/emphatic <b>accents</b> there was found a much steeper F_ 0 rise for <b>accents</b> with a rather high distance from the next phrase boundary...|$|R

Four conditions were tested: (i) prenuclear accents; (ii) final nuclear <b>accents</b> in broad focus sentences; (iii) final narrow focus; (iv) non-final narrow focus. The results are such that (i) prenuclear <b>accents</b> are signaled by a late rise (L*H), final nuclear <b>accents</b> by an early rise; (ii) peaks in prefinal nuclear <b>accents</b> are aligned earlier than prenuclear peaks, but later than final nuclear peaks, suggesting a boundary effect; (iii) no differences emerged between <b>accents</b> in sentences with broad and narrow focus...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} accents that are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally. The <b>accent</b> of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what {{is becoming more and}} more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an <b>accent</b> labelled Multicultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken <b>accent</b> is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this <b>accent</b> is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie <b>accent</b> very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role.

Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E

5|$|The Coatbridge <b>accent</b> {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge <b>accent</b> and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{considerable}} number of different <b>accents</b> within the regions of both the United States and Canada, originally deriving from the <b>accents</b> prevalent in different English, Scottish and Irish regions of the British Isles and corresponding to settlement patterns of these peoples in the colonies. These were developed and built upon as new waves of immigration, and migration across the North American continent, brought new <b>accents</b> and dialects to new areas, and as these ways of speaking merged and assimilated with the population. It is claimed that despite the centuries of linguistic changes there is still a resemblance between the English East Anglia <b>accents</b> which would have been used by early English settlers in New England (including the Pilgrims), and modern Northeastern United States <b>accents.</b> Similarly, the <b>accents</b> of Newfoundland have some similarities to the <b>accents</b> of Scotland and Ireland.|$|R
