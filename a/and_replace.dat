5|$|Everton {{opted to}} {{demolish}} the entire Park End stand in 1994 <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> {{it with a}} single-tier cantilever stand, {{with the assistance of}} a grant of £1.3 million from the Football Trust.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects of the march. Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> it with a more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> it with a new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
50|$|Khazar {{started the}} season under Mircea Rednic, {{but he was}} sacked <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> the next day by Cüneyt Biçer. Biçer was then sacked on 15 March 2012 <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> by Yunis Hüseynov.|$|R

He was cut {{late in the year}} <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> with John Carney. Finally, after {{promoting}} Mike Solari from offensive line coach to offensive coordinator in 2007, Edwards fired Solari <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> him with Chan Gailey in early 2008. He also fired his offensive line coach, receivers coach, and running backs coach.|$|R
5|$|In 1932 {{the line}} to Upminster was {{electrified}} and new vehicles were purchased. After the District Railway became part of London Underground, similar cars were ordered to allow the Metropolitan line be extended to Barking <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> some of the rapidly deteriorating original wooden trailers. The 1935–40 New Works Programme fitted electro-pneumatic brakes and air-operated doors {{to most of the}} District line stock and allowed the remaining wooden cars to be scrapped. A number of motor cars were not suitable for conversion and so some trains retained their hand-worked doors and these ran until 1957.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Capuano ran {{for mayor}} {{a third time}} in and won. Capuano served as mayor from 1990 to 1999, where he earned a {{reputation}} as a hands-on administrator. One of his priorities was to lower the city's population density, which at time was the highest of any New England municipality, by using state grants to demolish several buildings <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> them with playgrounds and parking spaces. As mayor, Capuano oversaw the reduction of school class sizes to a maximum of 19 students.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> it with more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E
50|$|ACT was {{scrapped}} from 6 April 1999, <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> by a {{tax credit}} on dividend income of 10%. From 6 April 2016, the tax credit was itself abolished <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> with a tax-free dividend allowance of £5,000.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old Kronan from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already begun {{in the winter of}} 1664–65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7–10 hectares (17–25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17thcentury, Robert Boyle proved that air is {{necessary}} for combustion. English chemist John Mayow (1641–1679) refined this work by showing that fire requires {{only a part of}} air that he called spiritus nitroaereus. In one experiment, he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> one-fourteenth of the air's volume before extinguishing the subjects. From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, the county began {{preparing}} for future renovations to Kayak Point County Park to support new developed areas <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> aging equipment. Proposals for the beachside area include additional camping areas, a community center, and environmental education exhibits; upland areas could receive new camping yurts, permanent cabins, and a ranger station.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and {{particularly with the}} idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> them with changelings.|$|E
5|$|New emojis {{have been}} added, {{as well as}} {{additional}} features related to emoji. Emojis appear 3x bigger if messages are sent with up to three emojis and no text, the keyboard can now predict emojis to use, and an emoji replacement feature attempts to match words in messages <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> them with emojis of the same meaning.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 2016, it was {{announced}} that the segment between Highway 407 and Stouffville Road would be widened from six to eight lanes, and that an HOV lane would be added in each direction.

50|$|The 2000 - 01 Calgary Flames {{season was}} the 21st National Hockey League season in Calgary.

The team also let head coach Brian Sutter go <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> him with rookie coach Don Hay. Hay would only last 68 games before being fired <b>and</b> <b>replaced</b> by Greg Gilbert.|$|R
5|$|One {{proposal}} considered was {{to merge}} JAL with ANA, which {{would create a}} single larger international airline <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> Japan Airlines International; however, media reports suggested that this proposal would be opposed by ANA given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier. The task force also examined possible partnerships with foreign carriers.|$|E
5|$|Sharp's {{role in the}} Relief Party's plan {{to abolish}} the old court <b>and</b> <b>replace</b> it with a new, more {{favorable}} court is not known. As he was the administration's chief legal counsel, historians believe he was closely involved. He {{is known to have}} issued the order for Old Court clerk Achilles Sneed to turn over his records to New Court clerk Francis P. Blair. By practicing as state attorney general before the New Court to the exclusion of the Old Court, Sharp provided it a measure of legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, the Progressive Conservative {{government}} have froze tuition fees at the province's public post-secondary institutions, the freeze {{has led to}} the province having the lowest tuition fees in the country.
