On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included <b>Artemisia,</b> catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within the beds, each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land and the banks of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus <b>Artemisia</b> in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E

The story of <b>Artemisia</b> formed an iconography for Catherine and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents Marie de' Medici (1610–20) and Anne of Austria (1643–60) revived this iconography in their own service.|$|E

5|$|The time-line for Salamis is {{difficult}} to establish with any certainty. Herodotus presents the battle as though it occurred directly after the capture of Athens, but nowhere explicitly states as much. If Thermopylae/Artemisium occurred in September, then {{this may be the}} case, but it is probably more likely that the Persians spent two or three weeks capturing Athens, refitting the fleet, and resupplying. Clearly though, at some point after capturing Athens, Xerxes held a council of war with the Persian fleet; Herodotus says this occurred at Phalerum. <b>Artemisia,</b> queen of Halicarnassus and commander of its naval squadron in Xerxes's fleet, tried to convince him to wait for the Allies to surrender believing that battle in the straits of Salamis was an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, Xerxes and his chief advisor Mardonius pressed for an attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>Artemisia</b> was {{surrounded}} mainly {{by the presence}} of males since the loss of her mother at age 12. When <b>Artemisia</b> was 17, Orazio rented the upstairs apartment of their home to a female tenant, Tuzia. <b>Artemisia</b> befriended Tuzia; however, Tuzia allowed Agostino Tassi and Cosimo Quorlis to accompany <b>Artemisia</b> in Artemisia's home on multiple occasions. The day the rape occurred, <b>Artemisia</b> cried for the help of Tuzia, but Tuzia simply ignored <b>Artemisia</b> and pretended she knew nothing of what happened. <b>Artemisia</b> felt betrayed by Tuzia, and because Tuzia was the only female figure in her life, Artemisia's works contained a strong sense of the importance of solidarity and unity between women.|$|E
25|$|While in Florence, <b>Artemisia</b> and Pierantonio had a {{daughter}} around 1618, Prudentia, but who was also known as Palmira, which has led some scholars to conclude erroneously that <b>Artemisia</b> had two children, not one. Prudentia was named after Artemisia's mother, who died when <b>Artemisia</b> was 12. It is noteworthy that her daughter was a painter, trained by her mother, although nothing is known of her work.|$|E

25|$|<b>Artemisia</b> {{arrived in}} Rome {{the same year}} her father Orazio {{departed}} for Genoa. While {{there is not enough}} evidence for this, some believe that <b>Artemisia</b> followed her father to Genoa, asserting that this time together would have accentuated the similarity of their styles, making it often difficult to determine which of the two painted certain works. Most of the evidence, however, supports the notion that <b>Artemisia</b> remained in Rome, trying to find a home and raise her child.|$|E
25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped <b>Artemisia.</b> Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, <b>Artemisia</b> continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry <b>Artemisia.</b> Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that <b>Artemisia</b> and Tassi were not going to be married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major issue of this trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If <b>Artemisia</b> had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, <b>Artemisia</b> was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using thumbscrews to verify her testimony. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of <b>Artemisia</b> Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E

40|$|Background Meat is an {{important}} source of several nutrients. The capability top of fresh meat to rot, causing the group of studies food science, biological and chemical stability meat consideration. Objectives This study was conducted to examine the inhibitory effect of <b>Artemisias</b> spicigera essential oil against fungal species isolated from minced meat. Materials and Methods Two types of media dichloran 18 % glycerol (DG 18) agar and dichloran rosebengal chloramphenicol (DRBC) agar were selected for the mycological analysis of the minced meat samples. To evaluate the antifungal activity of essential oils, the microdilution broth method based on the CLSI (M 27 A) guideline was used. Results <b>Artemisias</b> spicigera essential oil has an inhibitory effect on the growth of fungi found in samples of minced meat. Aspergillus, Penicillium and Cladosporium were the most common genera on both medium types. Average Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 50 = 1. 88 µL/mL and MIC 90 = 2 µL/mL were reported. The genus of Mucor with MIC = 1. 0 µL/mL was the most sensitive and Aspergilus versicolor was the most resistant species to the essential oil with MIC = 4 µL/mL. Conclusions The {{results of the present study}} show a favorable inhibitory effect of <b>Artemisias</b> spicigera essential oil on fungal growth, especially Aspergillus species. According to the results, antifungal components of <b>Artemisias</b> spicigera in different forms are used to prevent fungal pollution...|$|R
5000|$|It {{is assumed}} that the sitter in the {{painting}} is the patron that commissioned it, {{but there is no}} evidence to support any clear identification. <b>Artemisia's</b> pose has led art historians to see the painting as a direct challenge to a viewer. Mary Garrard has interpreted this in the context of <b>Artemisia's</b> gender, i.e. a challenge to male artists of the time. Locker continues the idea of the painting as a challenge, but situates it in the context of the literary and poetic culture of the times, where Gentileschi is challenging poets, [...] "whose spoken paintings ... cannot rival her painted poems." ...|$|R
40|$|Globodera millefolii and G. <b>artemisiae</b> are {{interesting}} because their type localities (Estonia and Russia, respectively) are geographically distant {{from those of}} the potato cyst nematodes and other Globodera species that seem to have originated in the Western world, and because the type host for each is a member of Compositae rather than Solanaceae. Sequence data for ITS 1, ITS 2, and 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) for G. millefolii and G. <b>artemisiae</b> were nearly identical to sequence data for Cactodera salina from the rhizosphere of the estuary plant Salicornia bigelovii in Sonora, Mexico. The ITS rDNA sequences of these three species were all about 94 % similar to those of two other Cactodera species for which ITS rDNA data were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that, based on the ITS rDNA data, G. millefolii and G. <b>artemisiae</b> are more closely related phylogenetically to the Cactodera species than to other nominal Globodera species. The molecular data further suggest that the genus Cactodera may comprise two or more morphologically similar but separate groups...|$|R
