25|$|In {{examining}} living organisms, biologists <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> diverse {{levels of}} complexity (e.g. chemical, physiological, psychological, social). They therefore investigate causal and functional relations {{within and between}} these levels. A biochemist might examine, for instance, the influence of social and ecological conditions on the release of certain neurotransmitters and hormones, {{and the effects of}} such releases on behaviour, e.g. stress during birth has a tocolytic (contraction-suppressing) effect.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans {{acquired}} some lexical and syntactical borrowings {{from other}} languages such as Malay, Khoisan languages, Portuguese, {{and of the}} Bantu languages, and Afrikaans has also been significantly influenced by South African English. Dutch speakers <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> fewer non-cognates when listening to Afrikaans {{than the other way}} round. Mutual intelligibility thus tends to be asymmetrical, as it is easier for Dutch speakers to understand Afrikaans than for Afrikaans speakers to understand Dutch.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{have pointed}} out that the story resembles the modern detective story genre.

Meir Sternberg notes that two genres merge in the story: A riddle and a test; The juridical dilemma, which is the riddle, also constitutes a test for the young king: If he will solve it he will be acknowledged to possess divine wisdom. Stuart Lasine classifies the story as a law-court riddle.|$|E
25|$|The entire losing team {{remains in}} the {{boardroom}} and <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> their loss.

Then, for the final stage of the boardroom meeting, the project manager is asked to select a certain number of teammates (typically two, but on occasion one or three) to bring back into the final-stage boardroom meeting. The remaining teammates return to the suite while the project manager and the selected teammates step out of the boardroom momentarily so the host can consult with his advisors.|$|E
25|$|The states secrets {{privilege}} is {{a common}} law privilege originating with the judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases {{going back to the}} 19th century but more recently highlighted in United States v. Reynolds. In the criminal area, the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) provides a relevant model for alternatives to full disclosure of classified information which allow a prosecution to continue while affording a defendant his or her due process rights. The time is now ripe for such legislation in the civil arena; litigants and their counsel are confused and unsure as to how to proceed in cases where the government raises the privilege; the courts themselves <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> precedent going in many different directions as to the scope of their authority and the requirements exercising it.|$|E

25|$|The Poles {{had already}} {{suffered}} from discrimination and numerous oppressive measures in Germany long before unification. These measures were intensified after the German Empire was formed and Bismarck {{was known to}} be particularly hostile towards the Poles. Christopher Clark argues that Prussian policy changed radically in the 1870s in the face of highly visible Polish support for France in the Franco-Prussian war. Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army — though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend our national interests and our language against such hostile actions. Therefore, in the Province of Posen the Kulturkampf took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} and his counterparts have been understood as purveyors and exponents of moft, a concept treasured by Caragiale. The word, meaning [...] "trifle" [...] or [...] "nonsense", refers to pretentious and often ridiculous expectations of people caricatured in his work, but is uttered by such characters {{in reference to}} each other (as their tendency to dismiss events they <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with,</b> no matter how important they may be). Moft was notably present in Caragiale's own satirical magazine, Moftul Român (which he issued at intervals in the 1890s and after 1900). Two mentions of, respectively, moft and the magazine itself are made in Tot Mitică (in reference to Petre P. Carp and to a woman courted by Mitică's friend Costică).|$|E

500|$|Readers of Candide often {{compare it}} with certain works of the modern genre the Theatre of the Absurd. Haydn Mason, a Voltaire scholar, sees in Candide a few {{similarities}} to this brand of literature. For instance, he notes commonalities of Candide and Waiting for Godot (1952). In both of these works, and in a similar manner, friendship provides emotional support for characters when they <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> harshness of their existences. However, Mason qualifies, [...] "the conte must {{not be seen as}} a forerunner of the 'absurd' in modern fiction. Candide's world has many ridiculous and meaningless elements, but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability to make sense out of it." [...] John Pilling, biographer of Beckett, does state that Candide was an early and powerful influence on Beckett's thinking.|$|E
500|$|Dopamine {{contributes}} to the action selection process {{in at least two}} important ways. First, it sets the [...] "threshold" [...] for initiating actions. The higher the level of dopamine activity, the lower the impetus required to evoke a given behavior. As a consequence, high levels of dopamine lead to high levels of motor activity and impulsive behavior; low levels of dopamine lead to torpor and slowed reactions. Parkinson's disease, in which dopamine levels in the substantia nigra circuit are greatly reduced, is characterized by stiffness and difficulty initiating movement—however, when people with the disease <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> strong stimuli such as a serious threat, their reactions can be as vigorous as those of a healthy person. In the opposite direction, drugs that increase dopamine release, such as cocaine or amphetamine, can produce heightened levels of activity, including at the extreme, psychomotor agitation and stereotyped movements.|$|E
500|$|Gasaway {{disagreed}} {{that the}} Whigs deceived the voters, [...] "The 'fable' of 1840 {{tells us that}} the Whigs triumphed over baffled and listless Democrats by convincing voters that Harrison lived in a log cabin and that he was a great war hero when, so the legend goes, neither claim was true. [...] Whigs did not say that Harrison lived in a log cabin and in fact went into great detail describing his actual house. The 'log cabin' was much more symbol than claim." [...] Gasaway suggested that the 1840 campaign gained a poor reputation because Harrison and the Whig Party soon vanished from the scene, and many of those who had supported both in 1840 saw the election as a squandered opportunity: [...] "Add to this the fact that the poor man died only thirty days into an administration launched by what was perhaps the most exciting election campaign in the nation's history up to that time and we <b>are</b> <b>confronted...</b> <b>with</b> an undeniable and almost irresistible touch of opera bouffé." ...|$|E

500|$|Bellman wrote a {{total of}} 82 Fredman's Epistles, {{starting}} in 1768. The overall theme of the Epistles is, on the surface, drinking, and its effects, but the Epistles are very far from being drinking songs. Instead, they are a diverse collection of songs, often telling stories. They are sometimes romantically pastoral, sometimes serious, even mournful, but always dramatic, full of life. Together, they [...] "paint in words and music a canvas of their age". They are populated by a lengthy cast of characters, and set firmly in Bellman's time and place, eighteenth century Stockholm, but are simultaneously decorated, for romantic or humorous effect, in Rococo style. As a result, listeners <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> both striking realism and classical imagery. Within these general themes, the Epistles follow no discernible pattern, and do not join together to tell any single story. Their tunes, too, are borrowed {{from a variety of}} sources, often French. The words that are fitted to the tunes are often in parodic contrast to their original themes, very likely achieving humorous effects on their eighteenth-century audiences. Fredman's Epistles are thus not easy to categorise, and the critic Johan Henric Kellgren stated that Bellman's songs [...] "had no model and can have no successors".|$|E
500|$|The main {{addition}} {{over the}} preceding game is the [...] "Zapping System", by which {{each of the}} two playable characters <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> different puzzles and storylines in their respective scenarios. After finishing the [...] "A" [...] scenario with one protagonist, a [...] "B" [...] scenario, in which the events are depicted from the other character's perspective, is unlocked. The player has the option of starting the [...] "A" [...] scenario with either of the two protagonists, resulting in a total of four different scenarios. Actions taken during the first playthrough affect the second. For example, the availability of certain items may be altered. After each game, the player receives a ranking based on the total time taken to complete the scenario, and on the number of saves and special healing items used. Depending on the player's accomplishments, bonus weapons and costumes may be unlocked as a reward. The original version of Resident Evil 2 contains two stand-alone minigames: [...] "The 4th Survivor" [...] and [...] "The To-fu Survivor". In both of these minigames, the player must reach the goal while fighting every enemy along the way with only the default item loadout. All the later versions (except the Nintendo 64 version) add a third minigame titled [...] "Extreme Battle", which consists of four playable characters and three stages.|$|E
500|$|Conceiving {{the initial}} script for Carnivàle between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a {{carnival}} {{environment in the}} 1930s Dust Bowl, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He {{had grown up with}} a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. Freaks of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a complex fictional universe based on a good versus evil theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to HBO, Knauf presented Carnivàle as a collection of media samples {{from the perspective of a}} fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major Carnivàle characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of Carnivàle began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only get to know the characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves <b>are</b> <b>confronted</b> <b>with</b> [...] "self-realization and becoming aware of these [...] powers and learning to harness them, and the implications of this battle between good and evil." [...] Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.|$|E
