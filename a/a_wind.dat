5|$|<b>A</b> <b>wind</b> farm is a {{group of}} wind {{turbines}} in the same location used for production of electric power. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. For example, Gansu Wind Farm, the largest wind farm in the world, has several thousand turbines. <b>A</b> <b>wind</b> farm may also be located offshore.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>wind</b> farm power {{generation}} of 39.2MW, operated near Dwarka by the AES Saurashtra Windfarms Pvt Ltd (ASW), is now run by Tata Power Renewable Energy Ltd (TPREL). Dwarka's industrial activity mainly centres around cement production.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine are not straightforward. The {{air flow}} at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
25|$|An {{accounting}} period ends {{and a new}} one begins with the commencement of <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> up. For this purpose <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> up is taken to commence on the passing of a resolution for the winding up of the company, or on the presentation of <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> up petition if no such resolution has previously been passed and <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> up order is made on the petition, or on the doing of any other act for a like purpose {{in the case of}} <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> up otherwise than under the Insolvency Act 1986.|$|R

5|$|The {{strength}} of wind varies, {{and an average}} value for a given location does not alone indicate {{the amount of energy}} <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine could produce there.|$|E
5|$|While <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> farm may cover a {{large area}} of land, many land uses such as {{agriculture}} are compatible with it, as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.|$|E
5|$|Wind turbine {{design is}} the process of {{defining}} the form and specifications of <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> turbine to extract energy from the wind. <b>A</b> <b>wind</b> turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind's energy, point the turbine into the wind, convert mechanical rotation into electrical power, and other systems to start, stop, and control the turbine.|$|E

50|$|Differential {{protection}} {{depends upon}} Kirchhoff's current law, {{which states that}} the sum of currents entering or leaving a circuit node must equal zero. Using this principle to implement differential protection, any section of a conductive path may be considered a node, The conductive path could be a transmission line, <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> of <b>a</b> transformer, <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> in <b>a</b> motor, or <b>a</b> <b>winding</b> in the stator of an alternator. This form of protection works best when {{both ends of the}} conductive path are physically close to each other. This scheme was invented in Great Britain by Charles Hesterman Merz and Bernard Price.|$|R
5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} wave, Claudette dropped torrential rainfall and brought strong winds {{to the island}} of Saint Lucia. The George F. L. Charles Airport in Castries reported <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> gust of , while {{other parts of the}} island experienced nearly horizontal rainfall from the gusts. On the northern and eastern portions of the island, the strong winds ripped off roofs and downed trees across roadways. Overall, damage was light, and amounted to $1.1million (2003USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> tunnel show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Cold fronts may feature narrow {{bands of}} {{thunderstorms}} and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front's passage.

5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in <b>a</b> <b>wind</b> than shield gas from a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E
