40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of {{bilingualism}} on cognitive development is reviewed, and two complementary models of bilingualism are developed to account for research results. It is suggested that research since 1960 shows a positive relationship between bilingualism and cognitive development, at least for some types of bilingualism. The advantage or disadvantage of becoming bilingual seems to depend on the way <b>a</b> subject becomes <b>bilingual</b> and the degree of language proficiency achieved. The "S-curve " model deals with the effects of the environment in the development of <b>a</b> <b>bilingual's</b> cognitive abilities. The second model, <b>a</b> <b>bilingual's</b> cognitive structure model, explains how different types of bilingualism are developed and why some types of bilingualism are expected to result in cognitive advantages.

5|$|In the 4th century, Coptic script—based on the Greek {{alphabet}} {{with additional}} characters from Egyptian demotic to reflect Egyptian phonology—is found in documents in several dialects, including Old Bohairic, Fayumic, Achmimic, and Sahidic.

From the 4th to 7th centuries, original works—including homilies, saints' lives, monastic rules, letters, and exhortations—were composed in Coptic, primarily in the Sahidic dialect. As a writing system, Coptic was used for everyday purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions, {{as well as for}} poetry.
