50|$|The Adélie penguin {{is known}} to feed mainly on Antarctic krill, ice krill, <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish,</b> sea krill and glacial squid (diet varies {{depending}} on geographic location) during the chick-rearing season. The stable isotope record of fossil eggshell accumulated in colonies over the last 38,000 years reveals a sudden change from a fish-based diet to krill that started two hundred years ago. This is most likely due to {{the decline of the}} Antarctic fur seal since the late 18th century and baleen whales in the 20th century. The reduction of competition from these predators has resulted in a surplus of krill, which the penguins now exploit as an easier source of food.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} many {{different}} animals {{that live in}} the sea water near polar regions. Squids are one animal that live in both Antarctica and the Arctic. They are the food source for other large animals such as the male sperm whale. There is also a wide variety of fish in the polar regions. Arctic cod is a major species in the Arctic. Halibut, cod, herring, and Alaska pollock (walleye pollock) are some other types of fish.

Unlike most other krill species, the eggs of E. crystallorophias are neutrally buoyant, meaning that the eggs do not sink, and the hatchling larvae do not have to swim back to the more productive, shallower waters; however, since this means both life stages inhabit the same depths, it is not known how the larvae avoid being eaten by the adults.|$|E
5000|$|Over the {{continental}} shelf, Antarctic toothfish feed on shrimp (Nauticaris spp.) and small fish, principally another neutrally buoyant nototheniid, the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> (Pleuragramma antarcticum).

[...] Therefore, competition for prey among toothfish and these other mesopredators (middle trophic level predators) could be very important. The large Antarctic toothfish are eaten by sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), killer whales (Orcinus orca), Weddell seals and possibly colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). Toothfish that are dwelling on the bottom, particularly those caught during the summer on {{the continental}} slope, eat mainly grenadiers (Macrouridae) but also feed on other smaller fish species and skates (Raja spp.).

5000|$|An {{independent}} study {{was reported to}} have detected the disappearance of large fish at the southern periphery of its range in the McMurdo Sound area and was postulated to be consistent with this apparent loss of large fish. However more recent work has shown this was not to be the case in 2014. Some studies have reported that the prevalence of fish-eating killer whales has been apparently decreasing in the southern Ross Sea, foraging efficiency of Weddell seals is decreasing, and numbers of Adélie penguins (competitors for silverfish) have been increasing. More recent studies have confirmed visual sightings of Weddell seals and Type-C killer whales holding and consuming large toothfish in the McMurdo Sound area and raise questions over the previously assumed importance of assumed dominance of <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> (Pleuragramma antarcticum) in the diet of Weddell seal and Type-C killer whales. [...] These reports highlight the importance of managing this fishery {{in the best interests of}} the ecosystem by continuing to collect information on both Antarctic toothfish life history and the interaction of that species with predators and prey. An important research programme in this regard is the annual 'Shelf' survey carried out annually since 2012 which is designed to monitor the abundance of subadult Antarctic toothfish in areas where subadult-sized fish have been regularly found (e.g., in the southern Ross Sea) has been designed provide data to better estimate recruitment variability and provide an important early-warning signal of changes in toothfish recruitment.

As part of a monitoring program aimed atunderstanding the geographic and temporal characteristics of this nursery ground, the present study reports on surveys carried out in the austral springs of 2005 and 2006 using a simple and effective method for sampling from the sea-ice.

40|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> Pleuragramma antarcticum is a {{keystone}} {{species in the}} Southern Ocean ecosystem, providing {{one of the major}} links between lower and higher trophic levels.

The first spawning area for the silverfish has been recently identified in the near-shore of Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea). Evidence indicates that spawning and embryo development occurs in the cryopelagic environment, below the seasonal pack-ice. In order to contribute to the knowledge of the life cycle of this very important Antarctic species, we carried out the first histological characterization on pre-hatching embryos and newly hatched larvae. Embryonated eggs and larvae of P. antarcticum were collected between late October and November 2005 at TNB through holes drilled into the sea ice.

40|$|<b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> Pleuragramma {{antarctica}} is a {{keystone species}} of the coastal ecosystems of the Sothern Ocean. This species is the most abundant pelagic fish in the coastal waters of Antarctica, where it plays {{a pivotal role in}} the trophic web as the major link between lower and higher trophic levels. Due to the ecological importance of this species, over the last decades many studies on biology and ecology of P. antarctica were carried out. Despite previous studies have provided an overall picture of the trophic ecology of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish,</b> important questions remain. Among them, the opportunistic versus selective feeding habit of the species wasn't still investigated, even if this information holds potential to highlight mechanisms and dynamics of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> relationship with the other components of its environment. The investigations on the capability of the species at using food resources can give information about its adaptability to ecological changes. Such a piece of information gains further value if contextualized in the frame of the environmental changes ongoing at a rapid pace in polar regions. The aim of my work is to improve present knowledge on the feeding ecology of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> highlighting its feeding habits to assess its possible ability to adapt to variations in the availability of prey caused by climate change or overfishing of krill. The research developed within my PhD program contributes to the PNRA (Italian National Program for Research in Antarctica) project RAISE (Integrate Research on <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Silverfish</b> Ecology in the Ross Sea). The study was divided in two parts, the first one was a purely ecological analysis based on the stomach contents of samples collected in different sectors of the Southern Ocean, the second one was an ecomorphological focus on traits involved in feeding activity of the species. In the ecological analysis, I detected evident differences in the diet of the specimens coming from three different zones (Ross Sea, Dumont d’Urville Sea, sea near Antarctic Peninsula). The diets were composed exclusively by planktonic organisms, which belong to different taxa depending on the area, mainly composed by copepods and euphausiids. Depending on the case, the range of prey items found was significantly broader or narrower. The observation of the condition of the different schools of fish and the investigation of selectivity versus generalism of the species let we deduce what item of the diet represented the preferential prey (through my results they appear to be the euphausiids) and if the species was able to adapt to situations of availability of prey different from the optimal ones. The ecomorphological study consisted in a depth study of the biomechanics of the buccal apparatus of P. antarctica. I measured some features of jaws, head and gill rakers and calculated significant index of jaws movements. The comparison of the values obtained with that of the same parameters found in other two {{species of the}} same family of nototheniids, Dissostichus mawsoni and Trematomus bernacchii, which live in different habitats and have different feeding habits, highlighted the adaptation to planktofagy and the feeding strategies of P. antarctica. It was relevant the confirmation of the capability of the species to feed on different planktonic items, having both structures to catch relatively large size zooplanktonic organisms and gill rakers conformation to particulate feeding. Both studies carried out lead us to the conclusion that P. antarctica is a plastic predator. Its preferential prey seem to be the euphausiids, towards which it performs a selective predation. In the case of paucity or absence of these organisms, it is able to vary its diet and feed on smaller zooplanktonic species, preyed by means of a less selective particulate feeding activity...|$|E

40|$|In {{the blood}} of Antarctic notothenioid and Arctic gadiform fishes, {{freezing}} is inhibited by antifreeze glycopeptide macromolecules (AFGP). These antifreeze molecules are built up of repeating tripeptide units (Ala-Ala-Thr) n, to which the disaccharide fl-D-galactosyl-(1 -> 3) a-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine is linked through the hydroxyl oxygen of the threonyl residue. Species of Liparididae, Zoarcidae, Cottidae and Pleuronectidae synthezise only unglycosylated antifreeze peptides (AFP).

Sequence analysis showed a remarkably high polymorphism, with 110 haplotypes over the 256 investigated specimens, and about 80 % of haplotypes occurring only once.

40|$|Despite the key {{importance}} of Nrf 2 -Keap 1 in regulating antioxidant system in vertebrates, {{this system is}} still poorly investigated in marine species. The present study focused on the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>silverfish</b> Pleuragramma antarctica which, during the final phases of embryo development in platelet ice, is challenged by a sudden enhancement of environmental oxidative conditions associated to ice melting. Partial coding sequences were identified for Nrf 2, it repressor Keap 1 and for typical Nrf 2 -target antioxidant genes, like catalase, glutathione peroxidase isoform 1 and Cu/Zn-dependent superoxide dismutase. Compared to temperate homologues, the protein sequences showed an elevated conservation of amino acids essential for catalytic functions, while a few specific substitutions in non-essential regions may represent a molecular adaptation to improve flexibility and accessibility to active site at cold temperatures. The role of the Nrf 2 -Keap 1 pathway in modulating the activation of antioxidant defences at both transcriptional and functional levels with a clear temporal increase of antioxidant protection in embryos before the hatching. Such findings confirm the {{importance of}} Nrf 2 and highlight regulation of antioxidants as an adaptive strategy and in P. antarctica to protect the early life stages toward the environmental changes of pro-oxidant pressure...|$|E
