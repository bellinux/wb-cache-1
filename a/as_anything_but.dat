5|$|Amelia is a {{domestic}} novel taking place largely in London during 1733. It describes the hardships suffered {{by a young}} couple newly married. Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews. During this time, it is revealed that Amelia was in a carriage accident and that her nose was ruined. Although this brings about jokes at Amelia's behalf, Booth refuses to regard her <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> beautiful.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some modern scholars {{that as well as}} being close friends Alexander and Hephaestion were also lovers despite the fact that hardly any of Alexander's extant ancient Greek or Roman biographers ever refers to Hephaestion <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> Alexander's friend, consistent with Hephaestion's epithet “Philalexandros” which was given to him by Alexander himself. The ancient sources generally name Hephaestion only as a good and loyal friend of Alexander's.|$|E

25|$|He is {{the almighty}} ruler of Avalon. He is never {{referred}} to <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> his Highness, the king, etc.. {{so it can}} be supposed that he doesn't have a name, just his royal title. The King has varying character traits; he can be annoying and comic at one moment then change to cunning and serious the next. He seems to have a pique interest in Fanta though it has not been fully disclosed as to what interests him so.|$|E
25|$|Puyi's {{first choice}} {{for his wife}} was Wenxiu, from the Erdet (鄂爾德特) clan. She married Puyi in 1922. Although she was Puyi's first choice, the Four Dowager Consorts felt that Wenxiu came from an {{unacceptable}} impoverished family and was not beautiful enough to be Empress, so they told the court officials to ask Puyi to choose again. The second time Puyi chose Wanrong, who became Empress, while Wenxiu was designated as Consort Shu (淑妃). Puyi and Wenxiu divorced in 1931. Puyi awarded her a house in Beijing and $300,000 in alimony, to be provided by the Japanese. In his autobiography, Puyi stated her reason for the divorce was the emptiness of life with him in exile, her desire for an ordinary family life, and his own inability to see women <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> slaves and tools of men. According to Puyi, {{she worked as a}} school teacher for some years after the divorce. She married Major Liu Zhendong in 1947.|$|E
25|$|The Vendée revolt {{became an}} {{immediate}} symbol of confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution, {{and a source}} of unexpurgated violence. The region, and its towns, were eliminated; even the department name of Vendée was renamed Venge. Towns and cities were also renamed, but at heart, in villages and farms, the old names remained the same. Beyond the controversial interpretations of genocide, other historians posit the insurrection as a revolt against conscription that cascaded to include other complaints. For a period of several months, control of the Vendée slipped from the hands of Parisian revolutionaries. They ascribed the revolt to the resurgence of royalist ideas: when faced with insurrection of the people against the Revolution of the People, they were unable to see it <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> an aristocratic plot. Mona Ozouf and François Furet maintain it was not. The entire territory, none of it unified under a single idea from the ancien regime, had never been a region morally at odds {{with the rest of the}} nation. It was not the fall of the old regime that aroused the population against the Revolution, but rather the construction of the new regime into locally unacceptable principles and forms: the new map of districts and departments, the administrative dictatorship, and above all the non-juring priests. Rebellion had first flared in August 1792, but had been immediately quelled. Even the regicide did not trigger insurrection. What did was the forced conscription. Although the Vendeans, to use the term loosely, wrote God and King large on their flags, they invested those symbols of their tradition with something other than regret for the lost regime.|$|E

500|$|The homoerotic {{overtones of}} Barton's {{relationship}} with Charlie are not unintentional. Although one detective demands {{to know if}} they had [...] "some sick sex thing", their intimacy is presented <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> deviant, and cloaked in conventions of mainstream sexuality. Charlie's first friendly overture toward his neighbor, for example, {{comes in the form of}} a standard pick-up line: [...] "I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink". The wrestling scene between Barton and Charlie is also cited as an example of homoerotic affection. [...] "We consider that a sex scene", Joel Coen said in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Etty {{felt that}} the work {{illustrated}} the moral that women are not chattels, and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights. He made little effort to explain this to his audience, and thus Candaules appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled Candaules was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty's death; Alexander Gilchrist's overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of Candaules that [...] "it is perhaps {{hard to see the}} painting <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise". Candaules was bought by wealthy collector Robert Vernon, who {{was in the process of}} building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty's most important customers.|$|E
500|$|In {{a feature}} for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were {{disappointed}} by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its [...] "awkward handling of its leading lady". Video game scholar Luke Arnott argued that players were dissatisfied with Other M {{because it did not}} consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like Other M create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity. Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans. Kotakus Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by [...] "many people" [...] for the game's story; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself. Nintendo Treehouse producer Nate Bihldorff stated that the scene depicting Samus' encounter with Ridley [...] "is not a sign of weakness, but of strength. People who call out that scene <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> empowering are kind of missing the point". He added that Samus' story [...] "has largely been a matter of individual perception, especially in the US, where people haven't read any of the official manga related to her childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|From its unveiling, Candaules was {{condemned}} {{by the press}} as a cynical combination of a pornographic picture and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and there was near-unanimous consensus that the picture was inappropriate for public exhibition. The Literary Gazette condemned the work as [...] "against decency and good taste", and Etty as tending in Candaules towards the type of [...] "debasing sensuality" [...] one would expect from a foreigner, not the [...] "purer" [...] British school of painting. The reviewer also criticised {{the theme of the}} painting, saying that [...] "as an academic study, the central figure of this group might be admissible; but, in [...] with the disgraceful story, it deserves to be warmly reprehended". La Belle Assemblée, one of Britain's most influential women's magazines, praised Etty's other exhibits at the Summer Exhibition but refused to review Candaules altogether, saying that [...] "to us the subject is so offensive that we pass it over". Even Alexander Gilchrist, generally one of Etty's strongest supporters, in his 1855 biography of Etty described Candaules as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while Sarah Burnage of the University of York says that [...] "it is perhaps hard to see the painting <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise".|$|E

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not something I could do." ...|$|E
