5|$|Outsourcing {{is among}} some of the many reasons for {{increased}} competition within developing countries. Aside from being a reason for competition, many First World countries see outsourcing, in particular offshore outsourcing, as an opportunity for increased income.

It is because of competition (including outsourcing) that Robert Feenstra and Gordon Hanson predict that there will be <b>a</b> <b>rise</b> <b>of</b> 15–33 percent in inequality amongst these countries.|$|E

5|$|Proto-globalization {{distinguished}} {{itself from}} modern globalization {{on the basis}} of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange.
