5|$|Among the {{folklore}} {{that has}} developed around the film over the years, there is a belief that Blade Runner cursed the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as product placement. While they were market leaders at the time, Atari, Bell, Cuisinart, and Pan <b>Am</b> <b>all</b> experienced setbacks after the film's release. The Coca-Cola Company suffered losses when it introduced New Coke in 1985, but soon regained market share.|$|E
5|$|At 7 am on 7 April, the Viet Cong massed {{for another}} ground assault {{from the north}} and west of Lộc Ninh, with support from heavy artillery, tanks and armored {{personnel}} carriers. As the Viet Cong closed in, Vinh and his bodyguards ran out the opened gate and surrendered. Several South Vietnamese soldiers also tried to surrender, but they all returned to their positions after Smith stopped a South Vietnamese officer from raising a white T-shirt up the flagpole. By 8 am, the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment was completely overwhelmed when the Viet Cong overran the southern compound with their superior numbers. At around 10 <b>am,</b> <b>all</b> tactical air support was called off in order to clear the way for B-52 strikes against Viet Cong formations west of Lộc Ninh. However, the B-52 strikes could not prevent the Viet Cong from overrunning Lộc Ninh. By 16:30, the Viet Cong were in complete control of Lộc Ninh District.|$|E

25|$|By May it {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{that there was no}} alternative but to revise fares to meet the increased cost of operation and particularly that of labour. The availability of workmen’s fares was altered to cease after 7 a.m., but the time had to be amended shortly afterwards to 7.30 <b>a.m.</b> <b>All</b> transfer facilities were abolished after 20 May; the half-fare limit for children was altered from under 15 to under 12, and other half-fare concessions were abolished, except those for wounded soldiers. Shortly afterwards, workmen’s return fares were also withdrawn. In September, lost property charges were introduced of 2d. for articles claimed within the month, plus 1d. for each additional month thereafter.|$|E

Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains.

25|$|Admiral Byng had {{commanded}} the British fleet sent to relieve Menorca in 1756, {{but after a}} brief and indecisive engagement, he drew off and allowed the island to fall to the French. Incensed, the British public demanded an investigation. Byng was arrested, and tried by court martial for having breached the Articles of War. Though Byng was acquitted of cowardice or disaffection, he {{was found guilty of}} failing to do his utmost, which carried a mandatory death sentence. Byng was brought aboard Monarch, which by then was anchored at Portsmouth under Captain John Montagu. Montagu recorded in the ship's log for 14 March 1757: These 24 hours very squally, with showers of wind and rain; Admiral Byng's Co. as before; at 7 A.M. his Coffin came on board; at 10 <b>A.M.</b> <b>all</b> the Ships' Boats, manned and armed, came to attend his Execution; hard gales, lowered down the lower yards: at noon all hands were called up to attend his execution; he was shot on the larboard side of the Quarter Deck by six Marines, attended by Lieut.

500|$|In 1804, Bonaparte was crowned the Emperor Napoleon after a {{plebiscite}} {{in which}} Lafayette did not participate. The retired general remained relatively quiet, although he made Bastille Day addresses. After the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson, by then president, {{asked if he}} would be interested in the governorship. Lafayette declined, citing personal problems and his desire to work for liberty in France. During a trip to Auvergne in 1807, Adrienne became ill, suffering from complications stemming from her time in prison. She became delirious but recovered enough on Christmas Eve to gather the family around her bed and to say to Lafayette: [...] "Je suis toute à vous" [...] ("I <b>am</b> <b>all</b> yours").

500|$|The Freemason Karl Leonhard Reinhold, in the 1780s, drew {{upon and}} {{modified}} Warburton's claims {{in an effort}} to reconcile Freemasonry's traditional origin story, which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian imagery. He claimed that the sentence [...] "I am that I am", spoken by the Jewish God in the Book of Exodus, had a pantheistic meaning. He compared it with an Egyptian inscription on a veiled statue of Isis recorded by the Roman-era authors Plutarch and Proclus, which said [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>all</b> that is, was, and shall be," [...] which led him to believe that Isis was a pantheistic personification of Nature. According to Reinhold, it was this pantheistic belief system that Moses imparted to the Israelites, so that Isis and the Jewish and Christian conception of God shared a common origin.|$|E

I <b>am</b> <b>all</b> about doing what I feel is right. It {{is not easy to}} pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." [...] Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it [...] "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner." [...] Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is [...] "cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her".|$|E
500|$|His {{birthday}} (14 December 1895) was the 34th {{anniversary of}} the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been [...] "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: [...] "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>all</b> impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good". Consequently, he was baptised [...] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" [...] at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later. Within the family, he was known informally as [...] "Bertie". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name [...] "may supplant the less favoured one". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.|$|E
