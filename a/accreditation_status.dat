25|$|Believing {{that the}} school needed {{the support of a}} larger community, the {{university}} moved in 1902 to Waxahachie, Texas. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the United Presbyterian Church. The Stock Market Crash of 1929, however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Trinity's <b>accreditation</b> <b>status</b> on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.|$|E

2500|$|Enfield High School is {{accredited}} by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1995, {{the school}} was placed on [...] "warning status" [...] due to inadequate facilities, poor condition of the sports complex, safety concerns, low teacher morale, and the vagueness of the school's mission statement.

In 2006, while Enfield High School passed accreditation, the New England Association of Schools and Colleges cited additional issues concerning insufficient storage space, improper balance and inadequate ventilation between rooms through the HVAC system, and poor condition of the school's science labs. If the school's <b>accreditation</b> <b>status</b> is lost, legitimate colleges generally will not accept students from an unaccredited high school.

40|$|This {{quantitative}} {{study examined the}} relationship between school climate, teacher self-efficacy, and teacher beliefs. Teachers at two middle schools in rural southern Virginia participated in the study. Middle school teachers were surveyed using the School Climate Index to collect information about teacher-perceived views on their school’s climate and the Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale to gather information about teacher self-efficacy. Pearson Product-Moment Correlations were used to measure the relationship between school climate and teacher self-efficacy as well as teacher self-efficacy and four teacher-perceived climate factors, including collegial leadership, teacher professionalism, academic press, and community engagement. Data analysis did not provide evidence of a significant relationship between school climate and teacher self-efficacy. A positive correlation, however, was found in the relationship between teacher self-efficacy and community engagement. Recommendations for future research include replicating this study in elementary and high schools as well as in schools with different demographics, populations, and <b>accreditation</b> <b>statuses</b> to determine generalizations about school climate and teacher self-efficacy...|$|R
