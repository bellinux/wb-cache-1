5|$|In November 2012 it was {{revealed}} that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. <b>A</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>scan</b> of the mummified body taken at the Cromwell Hospital in London showed that Gebelein Man had been aged about 18 to 20 {{at the time of his}} death and had been well muscled. Under his left shoulder blade the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon had been used with such force that it had slightly damaged the shoulder blade but had shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury had been caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12cm in length and 2cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the British Museum's expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, Dumas {{suffered}} {{what appeared}} to be a stinger while filming a fight scene for a role in the season finale of the television program Dark Angel. The rehearsal required that she practice the hurricanrana that would be used in the episode, however, the stunt double Dumas was working with dropped her as she swung through the move, causing her to land on her neck and shoulders. After she underwent <b>a</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>scan,</b> it was revealed that she had suffered three cracks in her vertebrae, necessitating surgery. On April 30, Dumas underwent neck surgery under Dr. Lloyd Youngblood, during which he used a section of her hip to fuse her C5 and C6 vertebrae together. She spent the subsequent year rehabilitating, making appearances on Sunday Night Heat as a color commentator, beginning in October 2002. On the April 21, 2003, episode of Raw, as part of a new storyline, she was fired from her position on commentary by General Manager Eric Bischoff after she rejected his advances and his request that she follow in the footsteps of SmackDown!s Torrie Wilson and pose for Playboy.|$|E
5|$|On the November 16 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Hardy and MVP dropped the WWE Tag Team Championship to John Morrison and The Miz. Despite {{the fact that}} Hardy was hurt, MVP {{immediately}} invoked the rematch clause. After the rematch, in which Hardy was forced to tap out, MVP attacked Hardy, repeatedly targeting his knee. It was later confirmed by WWE.com that Hardy had suffered an injury at his former partner's hands and {{that he might not}} be able to compete at Survivor Series. Despite his absence at the pay-per-view, his team was able to win the match. On November 21, WWE's official website reported that Hardy underwent an emergency appendectomy in Tampa, Florida. <b>A</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>scan</b> revealed an inflamed appendix after Hardy was feeling extreme pain. Later surgery revealed that his appendix had already burst. According to Hardy himself, on December 8 doctors back in North Carolina found an abscess of infection that had not been caught, and he had it drained, spending an additional several days in the hospital. Hardy made an appearance at the December 31 episode of Raw supporting his brother Jeff. To further Jeff's storyline with Randy Orton, however, Hardy was attacked by Orton. Hardy made his return at a live event in Muncie, Indiana on March 1, 2008.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. <b>A</b> <b>CAT</b> <b>scan</b> of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome.

As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy".

40|$|Summary. Introduction. Schilder’s disease, or diffuse myelinoclastic sclerosis, is an {{infrequent}} {{disease that}} presents clinically as a pseudotumoural demyelinating lesion, which makes its diagnosis more complicated {{as it can}} be mistaken for a tumour or an abscess. Case reports. We examine the case of a male who was healthy up to the age of 8 years, when symptoms of a left hemiparesis appeared with a subacute onset and which were associated to symptoms of intracranial hypertension. <b>A</b> brain <b>CAT</b> <b>scan</b> showed <b>a</b> hypodense lesion in the right temporoparietal region, and the hypothesis of a tumoural lesion (astrocytoma) was suggested. Treatment was started with dexamethasone and furosemide, and a complete regression of the symptoms and a considerable decrease in the cerebral lesion were observed. The second case is that of a female adolescent who, at the age of 11, developed a clinical picture of subacute onset of left hemiplegia. <b>A</b> brain <b>CAT</b> <b>scan</b> revealed hypodense lesions with ring-shaped contrast enhancement. In view of the histological diagnosis of an astrocytoma, radiotherapy and corticotherapy were started. After two months’ treatment, a sharp involution of the lesions was observed, which led to the acceptance of the diagnostic hypothesis of Schilder’s disease. Both children presented recurrence of the lesions three years and nine months, in the first and second case respectively, after the first episode. Treatment with corticoid therapy was started with good clinical and radiological responses. Conclusions. In the presence of a neurological deficit with a subacute onset, associated to a brain image showing a ‘tumoural’ lesion containing an important amount of oedema and little mass effect, diagnoses other than that of a brain tumour must be taken into account. It thus becomes possible to avoid invasive forms of treatment, such as surgical resection, which entail a number of sequelae...|$|R
