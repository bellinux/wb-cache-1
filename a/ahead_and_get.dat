2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses and I was going in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E

We found that: (i) agency {{was positively related to}} getting ahead performance, whereas affiliation was unrelated to getting ahead; (ii) agency had an inverted-U relationship with <b>getting</b> along performance; <b>and</b> (iii) there was a multiplicative effect of agency <b>and</b> affiliation on <b>getting</b> along.

60|$|THE {{first time}} I catched Tom private I {{asked him what}} was his idea, time of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb {{to the mouth of}} the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight {{procession}} and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we.

6000|$|The {{next day}} {{some of us}} {{gathered}} in Dickinson's office and decided that Grierson should go <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the options. This was done; not, of course, in Grierson's name. The next move, before {{the formation of the}} Riverside Company, was to [...] "see" [...] Mr. Judd Jason. The success or failure of the enterprise was in his hands. Mahomet must go to the mountain, and I went to Monahan's saloon, first having made an appointment. It {{was not the first time}} I had been there since I had made that first memorable visit, but I never quite got over the feeling of a neophyte before Buddha, though I did not go so far as to analyze the reason,--that in Mr. Jason I was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy I had adopted, the logical consequence of enlightened self-interest. If he had ever heard of it, he would have made no pretence of being anything else. Greatness, declares some modern philosopher, has no connection with virtue; it is the continued, strong and logical expression of some instinct; in Mr. Jason's case, the predatory instinct. And like a true artist, he loved his career for itself--not for what its fruits could buy. He might have built a palace on the Heights with the tolls he took from the disreputable houses of the city; he was contented with Monahan's saloon: nor did he seek to propitiate a possible God by endowing churches and hospitals with a portion of his income. Try though I might, I never could achieve the perfection of this man's contempt for all other philosophies. The very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place of his from out of the bright, respectable region in which I lived was in itself an acknowledgment of this. I thought him a thief--a necessary thief--and he knew it: he was indifferent to it; and it amused him, I think, to see clinging to me, when I entered his presence, shreds of that morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for the sake of decency.|$|E
60|$|After a time a row {{of lights}} twinkled <b>ahead</b> <b>and,</b> <b>getting</b> nearer, he saw chimneys, dark {{skeleton}} towers of timber, and jets of steam behind the houses. It was a colliery village, and when he passed the first lamps he vacantly noticed the ugliness of the place.

Presently, however, he came to a pretentious hotel, built of glaring red brick and ornamented with sooty paint. He wondered what accounted for its being planted there; but it offered shelter for the night and he went in.|$|R

40|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{maintains the}} assumption of a rational decision maker maximizing his utility subject to a budget constraint. Behavioral economics seeks to explain behavior more accurately by using non-standard utility functions, either by introducing non-standard elements of payoffs or non-standard functional forms, or by positing bounded rationality {{on the part of}} the decision maker, so that utility may not be maximizes. Each of the papers in this dissertation fills one of these categories. "The Good News-Bad News Effect'' supposes that beliefs, or self- image, enter into an individual's utility function directly, and therefore affect the reaction to and acquisition of new information. "Staying <b>Ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>Getting</b> Even'' maintains a utility function that is solely a function of monetary rewards, but finds evidence of behavior that is inconsistent with maximization of expected utility of total wealth. Finally, "Hypobolic Discounting and Willingness-to-Wait'' shows individuals responding on a choice task using a heuristic that generates choices intransitives, and is therefore incompatible with maximization of any utility functio...|$|R

40|$|The late eighties saw the {{emergence}} of a new genre of instructional media, “edutainment, ” which utilized the capabilities of multimedia personal computers to animate software designed to both educate and entertain young children. This paper describes the production, marketing, and play with edutainment software as a contemporary example of longstanding tensions between the cultural categories of education and entertainment, play and learning. Like prior efforts to wed learning and play, edutainment was founded on the ideal of broadening access to academic learning. Yet as it became a mainstream commercial enterprise, it was increasingly targeted toward accelerating the achievement of successful children. After first describing the industry and marketing context of edutainment, this paper describes cases of play with edutainment software in an afterschool computer club. The analysis utilizes the concepts of “multimedia genre ” and “participation genre ” to read across sites of production, distribution and consumption to examine how genres of entertainment, education, and edutainment are constituted through the circulation and play with media artifacts. As in the case of the industry and marketing context, instances of play with edutainment titles follow certain genre conventions for engagement. Titles that are based on academic content and modes of engagement, even with a wrapper of entertainment styles, invite a competitive orientation and interaction focused on fulfilling the minimal conditions for moving <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> credit for completion of a task. Unlike more exploratory or construction-oriented software titles, these genres of software are marketed and keyed to the social demands of middle-class achievement...|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. In {{a thermal}} power plant, the boiler is a portion {{responsible}} of converting incoming water into steam which {{is followed by}} various apparatus which turn it to super heated steam. This steam is supplied to steam turbines. The dryer the incoming steam greater is {{the efficiency of the}} turbines and greater is the electricity produced. The general issue with the incoming water to the boiler is it is filled dissolved gases, very tiny particles and other stuff that damage the boiler and the adjoining apparatus. The presence of these cause damage to the boiler and other devices on the longer run and reduce their lifestyle. Even a single replacement of the boiler coupled with other apparatus can cause exaggerating expenditure. In general, the apparatus attached with a boiler are super heaters, steam turbines and condensate pump. The dissolved gases present in water can react with the walls of these, form oxides, and corrode them. With time, the walls of these devices develop cracks and hence loose their working capability. This project comes up with a pre set apparatus before water is let to the boiler. This set up cleans the water of all visible impurities so that they are not deposited at any point in the whole process. Next, it goes <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> rid of most of the dissolved gases present that have chances of reacting with the boiler or other following apparatus following boiler. In this way, a sure and reliable set up can be installed to improve the lifetime of the apparatus used in the power plant. This will end up saving cost at a very high level. This project depicts and explains such a set up and uses SCADA to present its functioning. With the help of SCADA, this system becomes foolproof by installing artificial intelligence by the use of sensors and alarms. The alarms are set for critical and normal use values and it is also described in the project. The SCADA would be aimed at reading critical data like water analysis, system analysis, water flow, water levels etc. Electrical and Electronic Engineerin...|$|R
