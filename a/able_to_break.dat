5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's arm, at which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{discovered}} that Howard Cotterman boarded {{a flight to}} Mexico on April 9, 2007, with a final destination of Sydney, Australia. On April 11, 2007, Agent Owen was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the computer security and discovered 378 more images of child pornography. Cotterman was indicted on June 27, 2007 for several charges related to child pornography and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He was arrested by Australian law officials and delivered to the U.S. Marshals Service on March 31, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Accounting scandals have again {{focused on}} the fact that the Big 4 has a near {{monopoly}} on audits of public companies. [...] Networks are demanding regulations on auditing to require that auditors rotate and include the smaller networks in this rotation. The demands also request that mid-market firms be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> participate <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the monopoly of the Big 4.|$|R
25|$|In 1983, Labour MP John Golding {{talked for}} over 11 hours during an all-night {{sitting at the}} {{committee}} stage of the British Telecommunications Bill. However, as this was at a standing committee {{and not in the}} Commons chamber, he was also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take <b>breaks</b> <b>to</b> eat.|$|R

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point. At Gloucester Point the troops might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York. One wave of boats made it across but a squall hit {{when they returned to}} take more soldiers across, making the evacuation impossible.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is a {{radioactive}} actinide metal whose isotope, plutonium-239, {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two); plutonium-241 is also highly fissile. To be considered fissile, an isotope's atomic nucleus must be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} to {{overwhelm}} the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E

50|$|In {{the same}} year Anguilla had a major secession {{movement}} supported by St Kitts' political opposition party, The People's Action Movement (PAM). Both forces, working together, invaded the island from an Anguillian base in an attempted coup d'état. Anguilla was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> successfully <b>break</b> away from the union in 1971.|$|R
50|$|The use of blitzkrieg {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of France first demonstrated {{the power of}} speed and maneuverability over static artillery positions and trench defenses. Through the use of tanks, mechanized infantry, and close air support, the Germans were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> quickly <b>break</b> through linear defenses and capture the rear.|$|R
5|$|During his {{ministry}} in England, Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire. From 1786 to 1788, he was pastor {{of a church}} in Monton, and from 1787 to 1793, he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton. He soon had nearly 1,000 followers, Many of his followers supported the French Revolution, attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England. A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin's absence to threaten his house, necessitating his swift return to protect his family. Upon arriving, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up the mob via diplomacy alone.|$|E
5|$|The tail club of Ankylosaurus {{seems to}} have been an active {{defensive}} weapon, capable of producing enough of an impact to break the bones of an assailant. The tendons of the tail were partially ossified and were not very elastic, allowing great force to be transmitted to the club when it was used as a weapon. Coombs suggested in 1979 that several hindlimb muscles would have controlled the swinging of the tail, and that violent thrusts of the club would have been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the metatarsal bones of large theropods.|$|E
5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood {{that is highly}} resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes {{the addition of a}} hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
50|$|Comprehension {{is shared}} meaning between parties in a {{communication}} transaction. This {{is the first}} step in the listening process. The second step is being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take <b>breaks</b> between discernible words, or talking segmentation. This becomes significantly more difficult with an unfamiliar language because the speech sounds blend together into a continuous jumble.|$|R

5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> contact and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began its}} third {{possession}} of the game at the Tech 24-yard line after a short kick return. Running back Andre Kendrick ran for a short gain, but on the next play Vick was called for an intentional grounding penalty while attempting to avoid a sack. The Hokies were unable {{to make up the}} yardage lost by the penalty and punted after failing to gain a first down. Owing to the penalty, Tech punter Jimmy Kibble was forced to kick from his own end zone. Florida State was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the Tech offensive line during the punt and blocked the kick. The ball was picked up by Florida State defender Jeff Chaney, who dashed into the end zone for Florida State's second touchdown of the game. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 140 lead with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{is the son}} of Christian Gourcuff. In 2001, he {{followed}} in his father's footsteps and joined Rennes. After progressing through the youth ranks and making the senior team, Gourcuff quickly became a fan favorite among supporters and his individual achievements soon led to interest from clubs abroad, which resulted in a move to Italian club A.C. Milan. Gourcuff achieved many club honours despite not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into the starting eleven, which resulted in the player being sent on loan to Ligue 1 club Bordeaux in his home country of France. Following a successful season, in which Bordeaux captured the league and league cup double and Gourcuff attained several individuals honours, he signed with the club permanently. Gourcuff is a former winner of the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and, in December 2009, was named the French Player of the Year for the 2009 calendar year. In August 2010, he joined Olympique Lyonnais on a five-year contract.|$|E
50|$|ABS system {{electronics}} {{are also}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> detect <b>breaks</b> in the rail or improperly lined track switches (if the switch is {{established in the}} circuit), which result in an open circuit. These will also change the signal indication, preventing any trains from entering the block (if the signal system prevents it), and risking running through a switch, or a derailment.|$|R
50|$|Upon graduating, Pickens {{was drafted}} 19th {{overall in the}} 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Fire. He was not <b>able,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through a deep lineup of Fire goalkeepers, which {{initially}} included Henry Ring and D.J. Countess, and later Zach Thornton. He was loaned out {{for much of the}} year to the A-League Virginia Beach Mariners, where he played 290 minutes, conceding only 3 goals.|$|R

5|$|Halstead {{brought his}} prizes back to Britain, where both Argo and Mercury were {{purchased}} for service by the Royal Navy as HMS Janus and HMS Hermes respectively as {{both of the}} Batavian names were already in use by the Royal Navy. British losses in the engagement were one man killed and three wounded, all suffered on Phoenix during the engagement with Argo. Apart from the losses in that exchange, no other casualties, either British or Batavian were reported. The action was the only significant engagement fought off the Batavian coast during 1796 as Duncan's force kept the main Batavian fleet contained within its anchorage in the Texel. In October 1797 however the main Batavian fleet was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out and sail on a raiding cruise towards the English coast. Duncan intercepted the fleet on its return to the Texel and inflicted a decisive defeat on the Batavians on 11 October at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E
5|$|However, {{on the day}} of his arrival, the Red Army {{launched}} the Sinyavin Offensive. Originally planned as spoiling attack against Georg Lindemann's 18th Army in the narrow German salient west of Lake Ladoga, the offensive appeared <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the German lines, lifting the siege. Hitler, bypassing the usual chain of command, telephoned Manstein directly and ordered him to take offensive action in the area. After a series of heavy battles, he launched a counterattack on 21 September that cut off the two Soviet armies in the salient. Fighting continued throughout October. Although the Soviet offensive was fended off, the resulting attrition meant that the Wehrmacht could no longer execute a decisive assault on Leningrad, and Nordlicht was put on hold. The siege was finally lifted by the Soviet forces in January 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the United Nations (UN) forces' {{successful}} landing at Inchon and the subsequent destruction of the Korean People's Army (KPA) by mid-1950, the Eighth United States Army crossed the 38th parallel and advanced rapidly towards the Sino-Korean border. Alarmed by this development, China's Chairman Mao Zedong ordered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) to intervene in Korea and to launch the First Phase Campaign against the UN forces. Between October 25 and November 4, 1950, the PVA 13th Army surprised and defeated the Republic of Korea (ROK) II Corps and the US 1st Cavalry Division in a series of battles around Onjong and Unsan, destroying the right flank of the US Eighth Army while forcing the UN forces to retreat back to the Ch'ongch'on River. Although Chinese forces were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the UN line, logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to withdraw on November 5, 1950.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, O'Connor takes Gracie back to {{his church}} and baptizes her. Suddenly, she goes into labor and gives birth to live snakes. O'Connor goes to Mackey's church and {{attempts}} to kill him, but Mulder intervenes and saves Mackey. In the ambulance, Gracie tells Scully that Mackey was the real murderer, {{and the father of}} Gracie's baby. He killed everyone to keep {{the fact that he was}} the father a secret and in order to destroy O'Connor. Back at the church, Mulder realizes O'Connor was innocent all along, but Mackey summons snakes who promptly attack Mulder. Luckily, Scully is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> down the door and save Mulder. Mackey, unfortunately, disappears to Connecticut, changes his name to Reverend Wells, and starts another church. The episode ends with a snake coming out of Mackey's mouth and eating a mouse.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{advance to}} the {{southeast}} of Bautzen was successful. The Soviet 294th Rifle Division was encircled at Weißenberg by the Brandenburg Division. In its subsequent breakout on 24 April, {{large parts of the}} 294th Division were destroyed. At the same time at Bautzen the 20th Panzer Division was able to make contact with the trapped units in the town from the south. Bronikowski then lost no time and immediately ordered an attack into Bautzen. Coordinating with the trapped troops, he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into the town. A hastily assembled Polish counterattack was not successful and most of Bautzen was then recaptured after several days of bloody house-to-house combat. Several remaining pockets of resistance in the town were cleared during the next days. Outside the town the German advance stalled, as their troops were running low on fuel supplies. The recapture of Bautzen {{was one of the last}} successful German tactical victories on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, one of Rowley's ships, the 18-gun sloop , {{attacked}} a French brig at Rivière Noire District on Île deFrance. Although {{the attack was}} ultimately unsuccessful, Otters captain Nesbit Willoughby and his landing party were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> {{into and out of}} the harbour without severe difficulties. This prompted Rowley to consider a larger scale operation against a more heavily fortified French position. Two months earlier, in the Action of 31 May 1809, the French frigate Caroline had captured two East Indiamen, Streatham and Europe, in the Bay of Bengal. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Henri Feretier, led his prizes back to the French-held islands, arriving off Île de France on 22 July. Feretier was prevented from attempting to reach Port Louis by Rowley's blockading squadron and instead put his ships into Saint-Paul on Île Bonaparte to unload his captured vessels and replenish his supplies.|$|E
