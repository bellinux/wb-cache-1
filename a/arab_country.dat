In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language.

As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an <b>Arab</b> <b>country</b> and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E

Assessment of research activity from a particular country or region could be achieved through bibliometric analysis. This study was carried out to investigate research activity in “nutrition and dietetics” in <b>Arab</b> <b>countries.</b> Original and review articles published from <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> in “nutrition and dietetics” Web of Science category up until 2012 were retrieved and analyzed using the ISI Web of Science database. The total number of documents published in “nutrition and dietetics” category from <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> was 2062. This constitutes 1 % of worldwide research activity in the field. Annual research productivity showed a significant increase after 2005. Approximately 60 % of published documents originated from three <b>Arab</b> <b>countries,</b> particularly Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. However, Kuwait has the highest research productivity per million inhabitants. Main research areas of published documents were in “Food Science/Technology” and “Chemistry” which constituted 75 % of published documents compared with 25 % for worldwide documents in nutrition and dietetics. A total of 329 (15.96 %) nutrition - related diabetes or obesity or cancer documents were published from <b>Arab</b> <b>countries</b> compared with 21 % for worldwide published documents. Interest in nutrition and dietetics research is relatively recent in <b>Arab</b> <b>countries.</b> Focus of nutrition research is mainly toward food technology and chemistry with lesser activity toward nutrition-related health research. International cooperation in nutrition research will definitely help Arab researchers in implementing nutrition research that will lead to better national policies regarding nutrition.|$|R
