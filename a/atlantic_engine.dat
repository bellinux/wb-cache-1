For eighteen years he was a pharmacist in Long Branch, ultimately operating two pharmacies. In 1930 he changed careers {{and went into the}} real estate and insurance business. He was a volunteer firefighter with <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Engine</b> & Truck Co. No. 2, of the Long Branch Fire Department. Basil Bruno served {{as a member of the}} Long Branch Board of Health.|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional CAD {{models for}} the one-lunger Atlantic marine engine {{cylinder}} and manifold were developed from original engineering drawings, and the corresponding patterns and core molds for casting designed. The viability of CNC milled high-density foam for fabricating complex casting patterns and molds was demonstrated with the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>engine</b> cylinder and manifold. The modeling processes {{presented in this paper}} can be applied to other projects in documenting historical components and machinery, and the CNC fabrication techniques can be applied generally for rapid pattern and mold generation. From a historical perspective, the development of the models, patterns and physical castings presented in this paper are one step in restoring the heritage of the one-lunger marine engines and bringing life to the first <b>Atlantic</b> <b>engine</b> of the 2 1 st century. by Gordon Moseley P.

25|$|The RB-2 {{was based}} on the earlier RB-1 airliner, it had {{improved}} control surfaces and was powered by two 650hp Galloway <b>Atlantic</b> piston <b>engines.</b> It had a corrugated metal construction with a dural skin giving it an empty weight of 5 tons. The passenger cabin could be fitted with 25 seats or used for freight.|$|R
50|$|The first 15-inch steam locomotive, {{test run}} on the Eaton Hall Railway, in 1905 was Little Giant. Unlike other engines on the line it was a replica of main-line locos, built for a public {{miniature}} railway at Blackpool. It was a quarter scale 4-4-2 <b>Atlantic</b> tender <b>engine,</b> though not an exact copy of any particular prototype. This engine still exists in private ownership.|$|R
50|$|In {{her career}} Aurania was never very popular, {{she was known}} as a badly rolling ship. During her maiden voyage on 23 June 1883 she left Liverpool for Queenstown and finally for New York, but halfway through the <b>Atlantic</b> her <b>engine</b> failed due to overheating.

50|$|Whale's Experiment Class 4-6-0 were {{essentially}} an extended version built from 1905. An <b>Atlantic</b> tank <b>engine</b> version, Precursor Tank Class was also built from 1906. The Precursors {{were developed by}} Charles Bowen-Cooke into the superheated George the Fifth Class 4-4-0 (1910). The main visual difference was that the Precursors had separate splashers over each of the driving wheels while the Georges had combined splashers that covered both pairs.|$|R

50|$|As {{the pair}} are getting reacquainted, a woman {{claiming}} to be Anitra Cyon (Ann Bell) unexpectedly visits and tells Sebastian that his services are no longer required. Sebastian recognizes that this person is not Anitra Cyon, but rather a succubus sent to stop Sebastian from investigating the family. He defeats her using the Apocryphal Book of Tobit. He and Ham depart to the airport where they are flown by Mitri Cyon (John Hurt) to London. While over the <b>Atlantic</b> the <b>engines</b> of the plane fail, something that Sebastian claims {{is the result of}} supernatural intervention.|$|R
5000|$|The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR) Class 7 was a {{class of}} Atlantic {{passenger}} steam locomotives {{to the design of}} John Aspinall. Forty were built between 1899 and 1902. They were known as [...] "High-Flyers" [...] as a result of having a high-pitched boiler that was supposed to increase stability at speed. All passed into London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) ownership on the grouping of 1923, becoming the LMS's only <b>atlantic</b> tender <b>engine</b> class. The LMS gave them the power classification 2P. Withdrawals started in 1926, and the last was withdrawn in 1934. None was preserved.|$|R
5000|$|Ox {{teams were}} used to convey the engine to Baltimore, where it made a {{successful}} inaugural trip to Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, a distance of 13 mi. Nicknamed the 'Grasshopper' for its distinctive horizontal beam and long connecting rods, the locomotive carried [...] of steam and burned 1 ST of anthracite coal on a 40 mi trip from Baltimore. Satisfied with this locomotive's operations, the B&O built 20 more locomotives of a similar design at its Mt. Clare shops in Baltimore. Despite this success, the <b>Atlantic</b> prototype <b>engine</b> was scrapped in 1835 {{after the death of}} Phineas Davis. The reason was unclear.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> Marine <b>Engine,</b> {{designed}} and manufactured by Lunenburg Foundry of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, is a historically significant gasoline marine engine {{from the beginning}} of the 20 th century. The Atlantic and other similar engines transformed the American and Canadian fishing industries with their power and reliability. A project to recreate a historic J model, single cylinder, two-cycle "make and break" engine is ongoing at MIT's Pappalardo Laboratory by a number of students. This thesis will focus on making progress towards a completed engine with the design and fabrication of the engine base. The fabrication will continue to use a traditional sandcasting process, but will explore the viability of using computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) processes to make high quality patterns out of high-density polyurethane foam. by Kyle Joba-Woodruff.

25|$|Technologies {{that contributed}} to the {{collapse}} of <b>Atlantic</b> Cod include <b>engine</b> power vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine power vessels had larger nets, larger engines, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to catching and detecting fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom-trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic Cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{the train}} used <b>Atlantic</b> 4-4-2 steam <b>engines</b> and cars freed by the 1938 re-equipping of the Twin Cities Hiawathas, {{including}} the distinctive Beaver Tail parlor-observation cars. In 1940 the train covered 488 mi between Chicago and Omaha in 480 minutes. Unlike {{the competition between}} Chicago and the Missouri River, the Midwest Hiawatha was scheduled during daylight, which helped boost patronage. For most of its history, it carried coaches for both Omaha and Sioux Falls with tap-diners and parlor services generally run between Chicago and Sioux Falls. The two sections of the train split at Manilla, Iowa.|$|R
50|$|After {{becoming}} a chief test driver in 1908, {{he led the}} RR team in the Austrian Alpine Trial in 1913. During the First World War the company designed its first aero-engine, the Eagle, and Hives developed it successfully, by 1916 he was Head of the Experimental Department. In 1919 the Eagle powered the twin-engined Vickers Vimy bomber on the first direct flight across the <b>Atlantic.</b> Other notable <b>engines</b> were later developed under Hives’ lead. Of these the Buzzard was the most important, leading to the ‘R’ series, which powered the Supermarine S.6 seaplanes that won the Schneider Trophy in 1929 and 1931 for Rolls-Royce, and most importantly the famous Merlin engine.|$|R
5000|$|The ship carried 10,000 tons of {{explosives}} from Baltimore {{as part of}} a 107 ship convoy to the Mediterranean, where it suffered numerous [...] "wolf pack" [...] submarine attacks. While crossing the <b>Atlantic</b> the ship's <b>engines</b> ceased to function it drifted {{to the back of the}} convoy, where an escorting destroyer ordered it to [...] "get back in line" [...] and wished the crew luck. The ship was left as a [...] "sitting duck" [...] for the submarines following the convoy, but after two days drifting its engineers completed repairs and the ship met its convoy at the Straits of Gibraltar. The Samleyte unloaded in Alexandria, where it was converted to a troop carrier.|$|R
50|$|Tinney {{was born}} in Philadelphia the third of four {{children}} raised by Hugh Francis and Mary (née Carroll) Tinney, both first generation Irish-Americans. As a boy, Tinney would later say, he sang in the choir until they found out {{what was the matter}} with the choir. He did perform with his brother Joseph at church and social functions and briefly one summer made an appearance on a vaudeville stage in a child act. His parents had hoped he would pursue a career in medicine, but instead as a young man Tinney found work as a chief lifeguard at <b>Atlantic</b> City, fire <b>engine</b> driver and undertaker’s assistant. His antics in the latter profession eventually led to an offer to join a traveling minstrel show.|$|R
5000|$|Steamboats on the Mississippi {{benefited from}} {{technology}} and political changes. The US bought the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803. At the time, a semi-bankrupt Napoleon {{was attempting to}} extend his hegemony over Europe in {{what came to be}} known as the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, the US was then free to expand westward out of the Ohio valley and into the Great Plains and the Southwest.The success of the Charlotte Dundas in Scotland in 1801 and Robert Fulton's Clermont on the Hudson River in 1807 proved the concept of the steamboat. At this time, walking beam mill engines, of the Boulton and Watt variety, were dropped onto wood barges with paddles to create an instant powerboat. The overhead engines of the [...] "walking beam" [...] type became the standard <b>Atlantic</b> Seaboard paddle <b>engine</b> for the next 80 years. For smaller boats, Watt perfected the side-lever engine with the engine cut down using side bell-cranks to lower the center of gravity. Sidewheel paddlers were the first to enter the scene. In 1811 the steamer New Orleans was built in Pittsburgh for Fulton and Livingston. Fulton started steamboat service between Natchez and New Orleans.|$|R
5000|$|About 30 prototypes of the {{improved}} vehicle were built by Wolseley Motors Limited {{under the name}} [...] "Wolseley Mudlark", and after further refinement the design was formalised as FV1801(a). The Austin Motor Company was awarded the contract to produce 15,000 vehicles and a former aircraft factory at Cofton Hackett, {{on the edge of}} Austin's Longbridge complex in Birmingham, was fitted out for the work. The first production vehicle was completed on 1 September 1951. The formal title: [...] "Truck, 1/4 Ton, 4×4, CT, Austin Mk.1" [...] was assigned (CT being a contraction of CombaT, both a designation of function and also the title of a planned family of vehicles designed by FVRDE). The Rolls-Royce-designed B40 four-cylinder engine of 2838 cc was fitted, the smallest of the standardised B-Range engines. This military version was designated model WN1 by Austin. Approximately half of the contract were to be basic vehicles known as Cargo trucks and the remainder were to be fitted with high-output generators and additional batteries in order to power radio equipment. These were known as [...] "Fitted For Wireless" [...] (FFW) vehicles. Rolls-Royce Ltd built engines for the early production vehicles, but later ones were fitted with a virtually identical engine built under licence by Austin themselves.In order to obtain some commercial benefit from the contract, Austin were given permission to use the design for a simplified civilian version to be sold as the Austin Champ. This version, designated model WN3, was mostly fitted with a modified Austin A90 <b>Atlantic</b> 4 cyl <b>engine</b> as a cheaper option than the more complex B40 but the vehicle attracted few customers and only about 500 were built, the great majority of these being exported.|$|R
