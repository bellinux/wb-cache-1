5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that was so impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E
5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the {{population}} fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that remained of the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E

This study involved eleven pairs of mentors and mentees (n= 22) with audio-recorded interviews to explore their relationships, mentors’ support and mentors’ expectations for mentees’ involvement in the school. Findings suggested ways to build <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> mentoring relationships (e. g., professionalism, respect, and support). Indeed, support in providing information for planning, access to resources, two-way dialoguing with feedback and reflections, and establishing safe, risk-taking environments to trial and evaluate newly-learnt teaching practices were considered as a ways to build <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> relationships...|$|R

5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
