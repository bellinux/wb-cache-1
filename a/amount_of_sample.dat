It serves as a buffering agent, maintaining pH and preventing sample damage during electrophoresis. Glycine {{is also used to}} remove protein-labeling antibodies from Western blot membranes to enable the probing of numerous proteins of interest from SDS-PAGE gel. This allows more data to be drawn from the same specimen, increasing the reliability of the data, reducing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> processing, and number of samples required.

However, the predictive quality varied {{according to the}} specific range of each variable and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> available for calibration and validation. High predictive power, i.e. level A-B, was achieved for N, where a high number <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> was available for model development. Whereas the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> was also high for C, the specific value range was very restricted with 95 % of the measured C concentrations between 48.8 % and 49.3 % and {{a difference between the}} minimum and maximum C concentration of only 9 %.

2500|$|The {{schematic}} of an HPLC instrument typically {{includes a}} degasser, sampler, pumps, and a detector. The sampler brings the sample {{mixture into the}} mobile phase stream which carries it into the column. [...] The pumps deliver the desired flow and composition of the mobile phase through the column. [...] The detector generates a signal proportional to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> component emerging from the column, hence allowing for quantitative analysis of the sample components. [...] A digital microprocessor and user software control the HPLC instrument and provide data analysis. Some models of mechanical pumps in a HPLC instrument can mix multiple solvents together in ratios changing in time, generating a composition gradient in the mobile phase. [...] Various detectors are in common use, such as UV/Vis, photodiode array (PDA) or based on mass spectrometry. [...] Most HPLC instruments also have a column oven that allows for adjusting the temperature at which the separation is performed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper proposes and {{analyzes}} a bio-inspired {{scheme to}} field estimation using wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme exploits the temporal {{pattern of the}} sensed process {{to reduce the number}} <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> sent back by a sensor node to the sink and decrease the energy consumption in data transmission. The proposed scheme is orthogonal to the techniques that reduce the spatial density <b>of</b> collected <b>samples</b> deactivating nodes with similar measurements. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used along with these techniques. Results show that for very regular processes the scheme can reduce around 90 % the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> sent in the network and even for less regular processes the proposed scheme can reduce between 10 and 20 % the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> sent with small reconstruction errors.
