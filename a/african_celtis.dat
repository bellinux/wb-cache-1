40|$|Celtis L. (Celtidaceae, earlier {{part of the}} Ulmaceae) is a genus {{mainly of}} tree species, which has its natural {{distribution}} in Africa, the Mediterranean region, Asia, North and South America, and northern Australia. Outside this natural distribution various species are planted in temperate areas, but they occur in many different ecological habitats, tropical and temperate regions in all continents. Some species are ornamental; some are used for timber and reforestation. This thesis is focused on <b>African</b> <b>Celtis</b> with general objectives such as providing a phylogeny of the Celtidaceae, understanding the relationships of <b>African</b> <b>Celtis,</b> preparation of a revision of the <b>African</b> <b>Celtis</b> species, {{a study of the}} main morphological characters, and a conspectus containing all names and synonyms in the genus. This thesis provided results, such as: Ulmaceae s. l. is not monophyletic and we confirm that this family has to be split into two families, Ulmaceae s. s. and Celtidaceae; the Celtidaceae should merge with Cannabaceae; in general Celtis is monophyletic but for more support we need to add more markers and taxa. In the relationships of Celtis, a few clades can be seen especially for South American species, which have thorns and by this morphological character that clade is distinguished {{from the rest of the}} genus Celtis. African and Asian Celtis form a mixed clade, this clade could have been influenced by the dispersal of these species. In total 12 <b>African</b> <b>Celtis</b> are identified in Africa and Madagascar : Celtis adolfi-friderici, C. africana, C. australis, C. mildbraedii, C. gomphophylla, C. prantlii, C. tessmannii, C. toka, C. wightii, and C. zenkeri. On Madagascar there are two endemic species: C. bifida and the newly described species Celtis malagasica. For Australia a new species was separated from the " Celtis philippensis complex": Celtis australiensis. The main morphological characters in <b>African</b> <b>Celtis</b> instrumental for the distinction of species include leaf shape, venation, indumentum, stomata, inflorescences, flowers, pollen, fruits and their endocarps. Two pollen types could be distinguished based on the feature of the apertures, also two types of hairs are distinguished (glandular and non-glandular); stomata include three types: paracytic, cyclocytic and anisocytic; inflorescences are cymose and fruit shape are drupes, the endocarp of Celtis differs from globose ellipsoid to ovoid with different sizes, colours, and texture. The conspectus contains about 500 names of specific and infraspecific rank, many of which remain to be verified to complete publication and typification details. Generally for getting better relationship patterns of this genus revision of the Asian Celtis is recommended...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{characteristics}} of soil seed bank in two types of central <b>African</b> rainforests: <b>Celtis</b> forest on clay soils and Manilkara forest on sandy soils. In each study site, 30 samples were collected per soil layers (litter, 0 – 5 cm, 5 – 10 cm and 10 – 20 cm depth). The species diversity and abundance of the soil seed bank were estimated after soil samples were brought to germination. We globally observed 297 seedlings of 53 species for the Celtis forest and 222 seedlings of 39 species for the Manilkara forest. The total densities of germinated seeds were 330 seedlings m− 2 and 247 seedlings m− 2, respectively. Herbaceous species dominated with percentages of 41. 0 and 45. 3 %, respectively in the Manilkara forest and the Celtis forest. Both forest types displayed a regeneration potential through the soil seed bank. However, this potential seems higher in the Celtis forest. Pioneer taxa were more abundant in the soil seed bank of the Celtis forest (13 woody pioneer species) than the Manilkara forest (9 woody pioneer species). The values of Sorensen similarity index between the standing tree vegetation and the soil seed bank in each site were relatively low: 11. 0 % for the Celtis forest and 8. 8 % for the Manilkara forest. But these similarity values were higher when only the pioneer species were considered: 46. 8 % in the Celtis forest and 38. 9 % in the Manilkara forest. The highest species richness were obtained {{in the first two}} soil layers (0 – 10 cm depth) while 21. 8 % and 21. 4 % of the species were exclusively found in the deepest layer (10 – 20 cm) in the Celtis forest and the Manilkara forest, respectively. Among the timber species found in the forest, only three were observed in the soil seed bank of the two sites: Nauclea diderrichii, Erythrophleum suaveolens and Staudtia kamerunensis. N. diderrichii was particularly abundant in the soil seed stock of the two sites (14. 4 – 34. 4 seeds m− 2). Results suggested that to improve regeneration of timber species, planting in open forest habitats with seedlings coming from tree nursery should be more efficient. © 2017 Elsevier B. V.
