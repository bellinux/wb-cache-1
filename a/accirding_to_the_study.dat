40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Livestock Resaarch and Development Station Surezai Peshawar. Total 112 numbers of calves including 28 Nilli Ravi and 10 Azikheli buffalo, while cattle calves contained 31 achai and 41 crossed bred (HF and Sahiwal cross). Commercially available milk replacer was used for calves feeding in this experiment. After preparation milk replar was offer for calves feeding <b>accirding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daily requirtments. The birth weight was recorded soon after birth, weakly growth rate was recorded of all calves upto weaning weight. Effect of milk replacer on birth and weaning weight of different bovine breeds was significant (P < 0. 05). Average birth weight of Achai, Azikheli, Cross and Nili Ravi breed were 15. 23 ± 0. 49, 28. 70 ± 1. 00, 21. 92 ± 0. 70 and 31. 90 ± 1. 10 kg respectively. Total mortality percentage was 18. 75 % (21 Nos). Lowest percentage of mortality (0 %) was found in Achai breed calves, followed by Azikheli breed calves 14 %. The results showed that milk replacer is 117. 39 % less expensive than natural milk...|$|R
