5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E

5000|$|In Scotland it is Listed as vulnerable, {{the main}} threats to Osmia uncinata are the {{reduction}} of available habitat, {{the loss of the}} open areas within the forest and increased shading of the forage plants. Dead pine wood should be retained to provide nest sites, and the natural regeneration of the forest should be encouraged. As this species has a boreo-alpine distribution, the relict populations in Scotland <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be negatively affected by anthropogenic climate change. Measures taken to conserve other species found in Caledonian forest should benefit this species. Attempts to encourage them to use artificial nests in Scotland were unsuccessful but did find other rare species of arthropod such as Clubiona subsultans. [...] Osmia uncinata may be rare in Scotland due to a combination of the limited availability of the combination of old trees in sunny positions, beetle burrows (especially as Rhagium inquisitor is a scarce species in Scotland), and the availability of patches of bird’s-foot trefoil.|$|E
