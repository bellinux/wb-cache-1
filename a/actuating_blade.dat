The relative flow angle {{experienced by}} the blades as they rotate about the rotor varies substantially with advance ratio and rotor thrust. To operate most efficiently a blade pitch mechanism should adjust for these diverse flow angles. High rotational velocities {{makes it difficult to}} implement an actuator based mechanism, and it is challenging to design and construct a mechanical based device. While the pitching motions used in hover are not optimized for forward flight, in experimental evaluation they were found to provide efficient flight up to an advance ratio near one.|$|R
40|$|An {{actuation}} {{method for}} the experimental investigation of compressor rotor blade vibrations is demonstrated. Three blades of the first compressor stage in a two-stage low-speed axial-flow compressor have been equipped with piezo-electric actuators, i. e. macro fiber composites (MFC). For measuring the <b>actuated</b> <b>blade</b> vibrations, strain gages are used. The control system which has been developed within this project allows to pre-set a vibration amplitude of the blade tip. The transmission of the actuation voltage of up to 1000 V into the rotor is accomplished by a slip ring. A slip ring is also used for transmitting the strain gage signals. The tests in the rotating machine show that the forces induced by MFCs are large enough to cause sufficiently strong vibrations. The signal quality of the data transmission via slip ring is high enough to operate the control unit that allows <b>actuating</b> the rotor <b>blades</b> up to a pre-defined vibration amplitude when matching the lower eigen modes of the blades...|$|R

These tests were conducted to further investigate the feasibility of actively controlling the clearance between the rotor blade tips and the surrounding shroud seal in the high pressure turbine (HPT) section of a turbine engine. The test environment simulates {{the state of the}} back side of the HPT shroud seal with pressure differentials as high as 120 psig and temperatures up to 1000 F. As expected, static secondary seal leakage decreased with increasing temperature. At 1000 F, the test rig's calculated effective clearance (at 120 psig test pressure) was 0. 0003 in., well within the industry specified effective clearance goal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{behavior}} of underwater robotic vehicles can be {{greatly influenced by}} the nonlinear dynamics of the vehicle thrusters. In this way, {{the implementation of a}} good control strategy for the thruster subsystem is essential for the accurate control of the entire robotic vehicle. It was already shown in the literature that without compensation for thruster dynamics the closed-loop positioning system can exhibit limit cycles. This undesired behavior may compromise the overall system stability and performance. This work focuses on the problem of controlling electrically <b>actuated</b> <b>bladed</b> thrusters, that are commonly employed in the dynamically positioning of remotely operated underwater vehicles.

40|$|Solar sails enable or enhance {{exploration}} {{of a variety}} of destinations both within and without the solar system. The heliogyro solar sail architecture divides the sail into blades spun about a central hub and centrifugally stiffened. The resulting structural mass savings can often double acceleration verses kite-type square sails of the same mass. Pitching the blades collectively and cyclically, similar to a helicopter, creates attitude control moments and vectors thrust. The principal hurdle preventing heliogyros 2 ̆ 7 implementation is the uncertainty in their dynamics. This thesis investigates attitude, orbital and structural control using a combination of analytical studies and simulations. Furthermore, it quantifies the heliogyro 2 ̆ 7 s ability to create attitude control moments, change the thrust direction, and stably <b>actuate</b> <b>blade</b> pitch. This provides engineers a toolbox from which to estimate the heliogyro 2 ̆ 7 s performance and perform trades during preliminary mission design. It is shown that heliogyros can create an attitude control moment in any direction from any orientation. While their large angular momentum limits attitude slewing to only a few degrees per hour, cyclic blade pitching can slew the thrust vector within a few minutes. This approach is only 13...|$|R

In this application, blade twisting moment torque can be {{comparable to that of}} the main reduction gearbox output: precise pitch control, reliability and compactness are all at a premium. A key element in the design is a compact, high-ratio hybrid traction drive which offers low torque ripple and high torsional stiffness. The traction drive couples a high speed electric motor/alternator unit to a ball screw that <b>actuates</b> the <b>blade</b> control links. The technical merits of this arrangement and the performance characteristics of the traction drive are discussed. Comparisons are made to the more conventional pitch control mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this ongoing}} study is to develop and {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of a blade actuation system to dynamically change the twist, and/or the camber, of an airfoil section and, consequently, alter the in-flight aerodynamic loading on the blade for efficient flight control. The required analytical and finite element tools are under development to enable an accurate and comprehensive aeroelastic assessment of the current Full-Blade Warping and 3 D Warping Actuated Trailing Edge Flap concepts. The feasibility of the current concepts for swashplateless rotors and higher harmonic blade control is also being investigated. In particular, {{the aim is to}} complete the following objectives, some of which have been completed (as noted below) and others that are currently ongoing: i) Develop a Vlasov finite element model and validate against the ABAQUS shell models (completed). ii) Implement the 3 D warping actuation concept within the comprehensive analysis code DYMORE. iii) Perform preliminary aeroelastic simulations of blades using DYMORE with 3 D warping actuation: a) Investigate the blade behavior under 1 per/rev actuation. Determine whether sufficient twist can be generated and sustained to achieve primary blade control. b) Investigate the behavior of a trailing edge flap configuration under higher harmonic excitations. Determine how much twist can be obtained at the harmonics 2 - 5 per/rev. iv) Determine actuator specifications such as the power required, load and displacements, and identify the stress and strain distributions in the <b>actuated</b> <b>blades.</b> In general, the completion of Item ii) above will give an additional research capability in rotorcraft dynamics analyses, i. e., the capability to calculate the rotor blade twist due to warping, something that is not currently available in any of the existing comprehensive rotorcraft analyses...|$|R
40|$|Applying adaptronics to {{helicopters}} has a {{high potential}} to significantly suppress noise, reduce vibration and increase the overall aerodynamic efficiency. This paper presents recent investigations on a very promising specific concept described as Adaptive Blade Twist (ABT). This concept allows to directly control the twist of the helicopter blades by smart adaptive elements and through this to positively influence the main rotor area which is the primary source for helicopter noise and vibration. Since the interaction of non-stationary helicopter aerodynamics and elastomechanical structural characteristics of the helicopter blades causes flight envelope limitations, vibration and noise, a good comprehension of the aerodynamics {{is essential for the}} development of structural solutions to effectively influence the local airflow conditions and finally develop the structural concept. With respect to these considerations, the ABT concept will be presented. This concept bases on the actively controlled tension-torsion-coupling of the structure. For this, an actuator is integrated within a helicopter blade that is made of anisotropic material based on fiber composites. Driving the actuator results in a local twist of the blade tip, {{in such a way that}} the blade can be considered as a torsional actuator. Influencing the blade twist distribution finally results in a higher aerodynamic efficiency. The paper starts at giving a review on conventional concepts and potential adaptive solutions for shape control (2),(3),(9),(13) -(15). Hereafter, some calculations of the adaptive twist control concept are presented. These are based on a representive model in which the active part of the rotor blade is simplified with a thin-walled rectangular beam, that is structurally equivalent to a model rotor blade of the Bo 105 with a scaling factor 2, 54. The calculations are performed using an expanded Wlassow Theory. The results are valid for static and dynamic conditions. For the dynamic condition excessive deformations near the blade resonance frequency shall be utilised. Therefore, the <b>actuated</b> <b>blade</b> section has to be properly designed for this preconditions. This has been demonstrated and verified in experiments (7) which will not be discussed in this paper. For experimental investigations on the ABT concept the skin of the outer part of the model rotor blade was manufactured of fibre composite material using the above mentioned tension-torsion-coupling effect with an additional uncoupling layer between skin and spar. The experimental results have shown that near to the resonance frequency dynamic forces of 550 +_ 550 N are required for a deformation of 3 degrees at the blade tip...|$|R

50|$|The {{conversion}} cycle {{consists of}} several sequential steps or phases. The waste is first ground and pulverized to an unrecognizable mixture {{by a combination}} of fixed and <b>actuated</b> hardened steel <b>blades.</b> The mixture is then heated through the injection of steam and also by the heat generated by frictional forces of the grinding phase. The exact temperature required to pasteurize, and in the subsequent phase to sterilize the waste, is maintained for a time that allows for an 18 log 10 reduction in microorganisms. In order to eliminate the required amount of microorganisms required by government regulations, a complete saturation of waste matter with superheated steam is required for a minimum amount of time, also regulated by environmental agencies. The modern converter achieves saturation within 10-15 minutes due to the high degree of pulverization preceding the sterilization phase, whereas older models required up to several hours to saturate and sterilize the same load.|$|R
40|$|Active rotor {{technologies}} have labeled {{the evolution of}} rotary-wing aircraft {{over the last years}} or even decades. The advent of new materials which have not only incorporated the traditional structural function but also an actuation function in response to a stimulus, enabled major ad-vances by being inserted directly on the actuation surface. The present master thesis introduces a feasibility study to investigate the potential of an anhedraltip on a rotor <b>blade</b> <b>actuated</b> by one of the actuators available on the market. The study is based on a numerical study conducted by ONERA where an optimization of the rotor aerodynamic performance was achieved in terms of the Figure of Merit for an anhedral tip of 30 deg. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM) are the selected actuators after a careful revision of the a vantages and disadvantages of each considered actuator. A detailed characterization of the PAM is per-formed through (1) a free displacement test, (2) a blocked force test and (3) spring contraction tests. A Working Diagram is proposed for the selected PAM from the results of these tests. A _nal test is conducted on the laboratory to measure the displacement of the PAM when different constant masses (to which correspond different loads) are suspended on the PAM. The whirl tests are conducted in the rotor tower of DLR (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt) Braunschweig. A U-profile is used instead of a real blade allowing the permanent access to the arrangement.

40|$|As a {{helicopter}} transitions from hover to forward flight, the main rotor blades experience an asymmetry in flow field around the azimuth, with the blade section tangential velocities increasing on the advancing side and decreasing on the retreating side. To {{compensate for the}} reduced dynamic pressure on the retreating side, the blade pitch angles over {{this part of the}} rotor disk are increased. Eventually, a high enough forward speed is attained to produce compressibility effects on the advancing side of the rotor disk and stall on the retreating side. The onset of these two phenomena drastically increases the rotor vibratory loads and power requirements, thereby effectively establishing a limit on the maximum achievable forward speed. The alleviation of compressibility and stall (and the associated decrease in vibratory loads and power) would potentially result in an increased maximum forward speed. In the past, several methods have been examined and implemented to reduce the vibratory hub loads. Some of these methods are aimed specifically at alleviating vibration at very high flight speeds and increasing the maximum flight speed, while others focus on vibration reduction within the conventional flight envelope. Among the later are several types passive as well as active schemes. Passive schemes include a variety of vibration absorbers such as mechanical springs, pendulums, and bifilar absorbers. These mechanism are easy to design and maintain, but incur significant weight and drag penalties. Among the popular active control schemes in consideration are Higher Harmonic Control (HHC) and Individual Blade Control (IBC). HHC uses a conventional swash plate to generate a multi-cyclic pitch input to the blade. This requires actuators capable of sufficiently high power and bandwidth, increasing the cost and weight of the aircraft. IBC places actuators in the rotating reference frame, requiring the use of slip rings capable of transferring enough power to the actuators. Both schemes cause an increase in pitch link loads. Trailing Edge Flap (TEF) deployment can also used to generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments that counter the original vibratory loads, and thereby reduce rotor vibrations. While the vibrations absorbers, HHC, IBC, and TEF concepts discussed above attempt to reduce the vibratory loads, they do not specifically address the phenomena causing the vibrations at high advance ratios. One passive method that attempts to directly alleviate compressibility and stall, instead of reducing the ensuing vibrations, is the use of advanced tip designs. Taper, sweep, anhedral, and the manipulation of other geometric properties of the blade tips can reduce the severity of stall and compressibility effects, as well as reduce rotor power. A completely different approach to solve these problems is the tiltrotor configuration. As the forward velocity of the aircraft increases, the rotors, in this case, are tilted forward until they are perpendicular to the flow and act as propellers. This eliminates the edgewise flow encountered by conventional rotors and circumvents all the problems associated with flow asymmetry. However, the success involves a tremendous increase in cost and complexity of the aircraft. Another possible approach that has been proposed for the alleviation of vibratory loads at high forward flight speeds involves the use of controlled lead-lag motions to reduce the asymmetry in flow. A correctly phased 1 /rev controlled lag motion could be introduced such that it produces a backward velocity on the advancing side and a forward velocity on the retreating side, to delay compressibility effects and stall to a higher advance ratio. Using a large enough lead-lag amplitude, the tip velocities could be reduced to levels encountered in hover. This concept was examined by two groups in the 1950 's and early 1960 's. In the United States, the Research Labs Division of United Aircraft developed a large lead-lag motion rotor, meant to achieve lag motion amplitudes up to 45 degrees. In order to reduce the required actuation force, the blade hinges were moved to 40 % of the blade radius to increase the rotating lag frequency to approximately 1 /rev. The blade hinges were redesigned to produce a flap-lag coupling so the large flapwise aerodynamic loads could be exploited to <b>actuate</b> the <b>blades</b> in the lag direction. A wind tunnel test of this rotor concept revealed actuation and blade motion scheduling problems. The project was eventually discontinued due to these problems and high blade stresses. Around the same time, at Boelkow in Germany, a similar lead-lag rotor program was conducted under the leadership of Hans Derschmidt. Here, too, the blade hinges were moved outboard to 34 % radius to reduce the actuation loads. The main difference between this and the United Aircraft program was the use of a mechanical actuation scheme with maximum lead-lag motions of 400. This program was also discontinued for unclear reasons. The present study is directed toward conducting a comprehensive analytical examination {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} controlled lead-lag motions in reducing vibratory hub loads and increasing maximum flight speed. Since both previous studies on this subject were purely experimental, only a limited data set and physical understanding of the problem was obtained. With the currently available analytical models and computational resources, the present effort is geared toward developing an in-depth physical understanding of the precise underlying mechanisms by which vibration reduction may be achieved. Additionally, in recognition of the fact that large amplitude lead-lag motions would - (i) be difficult to implement, and (ii) produce very large blade stresses; the present study examines the potential of only moderate-to-small lead-lag motions for reduction of vibratory hub loads. Using such an approach, the emphasis is not on eliminating the periodic variations in tangential velocity at the blade tip, but at best reducing these variations slightly so that compressibility and stall are delayed to slightly higher advance ratios. This study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, a hingeless helicopter rotor was modeled using rigid blades undergoing flap-lag-torsion rotations about spring restrained hinges and bearings. This model was then modified by separating the lead-lag degree of freedom into two components, a free and a prescribed motion. Using this model, a parametric study of the effect of phase and amplitude of a prescribed lead-lag motion on hub vibration was conducted. The data gathered was analyzed to obtain an understanding of the basic physics of the problem and show the capability of this method to reduce vibration and expand the flight envelope. In the second half of the study, the similar analysis was conducted using an elastic blade model to confirm the effects predicted by the simpler model...|$|R
