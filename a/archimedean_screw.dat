5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for just about every possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

"It {{was at this}} {{juncture}} that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover to Weilburg in the balloon, [...] "Nassau," [...] occasioned so much excitement in 1837,) conceived the idea of employing {{the principle of the}} <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> for the purpose of propulsion through the air--rightly attributing the failure of Mr. Henson's scheme, and of Sir George Cayley's, to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes. He made the first public experiment at Willis's Rooms, but afterward removed his model to the Adelaide Gallery.|$|E

In March 2012 a new hydroelectric power plant was opened using the same but restored turbine house, which provides 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, using two <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws.</b>|$|R
25|$|He also {{described}} deep mining underground, and mentions {{the need to}} dewater the workings using reverse overshot water-wheels, and actual examples {{have been found in}} many Roman mines exposed during later mining attempts. The copper mines at Rio Tinto were one source of such artifacts, where a set of 16 was found in the 1920s. They also used <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws</b> to remove water in a similar way.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> is {{an ancient}} invention, {{attributed}} to Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 BC.), and commonly used to raise water from a watercourse for irrigation purposes. In 1819 the French engineer Claude Louis Marie Henri Navier (1785-1836) suggested using the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> {{as a type of}} water wheel. In 1916 William Moerscher applied for a U.S. patent on the hydrodynamic screw turbine.|$|E
60|$|First, far {{in advance}} of our prow, swam the helmeted Silver-heads; side by side, in uniform ranks, like an army. Then came the Boneetas, with their {{flashing}} blue flanks. Then, like a third distinct regiment, wormed and twisted through the water like <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws,</b> the quivering Wriggle-tails; followed in turn by {{the rank and file}} of the Trigger-fish--so called from their quaint dorsal fins being set in their backs with a comical curve, as if at half-cock. Far astern the rear was brought up by endless battalions of Yellow- backs, right martially vested in buff.|$|R
40|$|According to a proposal, basic x-ray {{lithography}} would {{be extended to}} incorporate a technique, called inverse tomography, that would enable the fabrication of microscopic three-dimensional (3 D) objects. The proposed inverse tomo-lithographic process would {{make it possible to}} produce complex shaped, submillimeter-sized parts that would be difficult or impossible to make in any other way. Examples of such shapes or parts include tapered helices, paraboloids with axes of different lengths, and even <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws</b> that could serve as rotors in microturbines. The proposed inverse tomo-lithographic process would be based partly on a prior microfabrication process known by the German acronym LIGA (lithographie, galvanoformung, abformung, which means lithography, electroforming, molding). In LIGA, one generates a precise, high-aspect ratio pattern by exposing a thick, x-ray-sensitive resist material to an x-ray beam through a mask that contains the pattern. One can electrodeposit metal into the developed resist pattern to form a precise metal part, then dissolve the resist to free the metal. Aspect ratios of 100 : 1 and patterns into resist thicknesses of several millimeters are possible...|$|R
50|$|The outflow was {{channelled}} into sluice boxes, and {{the heavier}} gold collected on rough pavements. They also developed many deep mines, {{such as those}} for copper at Rio Tinto, where Victorian mining developments exposed the much earlier workings. Dewatering machines, such as <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws</b> and reverse overshot water wheels, were found in situ, {{one of which is}} on show at the British Museum. Another fragmentary example was recovered from the Roman gold mine at Dolaucothi in west Wales, and is preserved at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. The army were at the forefront of development of gold mines, since the metal was imperial property, and developed the Dolaucothi mines from the outset by establishing a fort there that was known as Luentinum. They had the expertise to build the infrastructure of aqueducts and reservoirs, as well as control production.The period in which technological progress was fastest and greatest was during the 2nd century and 1st century BC, which was the period in which Roman political and economic power greatly increased. By the 2nd century, Roman technology appears to have peaked.|$|R
50|$|The coil pump {{was built}} as an {{alternative}} to the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw.</b> Unlike the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw,</b> it can run horizontally while the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> is tilted at about 30°. The coil pump, if fitted with a suitable rotating seal, can deliver water to a greater height, typically 5-10m, above their discharge opening. Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the coil pump remains an important tool as some of it other benefits are that they can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources as metal; which can be obtained and cast into the desired form easily.|$|E
50|$|In the Netherlands, the tjasker is a {{drainage}} mill {{with common}} sails connected to an <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw.</b> This {{is used for}} pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot. The <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> lifts water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.|$|E
50|$|The spiral pump is an {{alternative}} to the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> and {{it is based on the}} same principle as the Archimedes' screw, a rotating tube or plane (screw) to move a liquid.

The spiral pump, if fitted with a suitable rotating seal, can deliver water to a greater height, typically 5-10m, above their discharge opening. Despite the emergence of new pumps that operate on other principles, the spiral pump remains an important tool as it can be built and repaired easily at a very low cost. This is possible as all the components can be built from local resources such as sheet metal bent into the desired form with or without machine tools.|$|E
500|$|As {{with other}} {{games in the}} God of War franchise, God of War: Ghost of Sparta is set in an {{alternate}} version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. With the exception of flashbacks, the events are set between the games God of War (2005) and [...] (2007). Several locations are explored, including the fictional city of Atlantis (and later a sunken version). Atlantis is a mythical city erected by the Sea God Poseidon, and houses the Temple of Poseidon. Near the city is real-world location, the Methana Volcano, which is contained by the <b>archimedean</b> <b>screws</b> and is also the prison of the Titan Thera, who is guarded by automatons. On {{the outskirts of the}} city is the Temple of the god Thanatos, the location of Death's Gate and portal to the Domain of Death. Other locations include the Island of Crete and its capital city, Heraklion, the Mounts of Aroania, the ancient city of Sparta (also home to the Temple of Ares), the Mounts of Laconia, and a brief scene above the city of Athens featuring Suicide Bluffs, the highest cliff in the city overlooking the Aegean Sea and a recurring location during Kratos' adventures.|$|R
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screws</b> had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and his detractors, questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuous}} column crystalliser {{has been}} designed and built using a Schildknecht-type <b>Archimedean</b> transportation <b>screw</b> within a stainless steel jacket. Problems concerned with the surface finish on the inner walls of the jacket which affect crystal transportation have been investigated, leading to effective operation of the apparatus. The process of column crystallisation may {{be considered as a}} multistage separation and purification technique; it is applicable to both aqueous and organic systems. In the present work the examination has been undertaken by firstly continuously crystallising a flow of feed solution in the column. Thesecrystals are transported along the screw, melted and some of the melt liquid allowed to flow countercurrently to the crystals thus washing them by reflux. The remainder of the melt liquid is removed as pure product, the impure product provided by the now impure reflux liquid being removed from the opposite extremity of the column. Separations in aqueous solutions which have been investigated include the desalination of brine, concentration of metal salts, the extraction of deuteriai. moxide from a heavy water/water mixture and the concentration of ethanol in water. The purification of organic solvents included the removal of cyclohexane from benzene and the extraction of para-xylene from 0 -, m-, p-xylene and ethylbenzene. The unit operations involved in column crystallisation fall into the categories of heat transfer, mass transfer and mixing. In order to examine how dependent the efficient operation of the column is on these factors, the system has been optimised for organic, aqueous and mixed organic/aqueous cases. The variables studied including:- (a) the speed of rotation of the transportation screw (b) the length of the column (c) the attitude of the column (ie crystals transported upwards or downwards). (d) the position of the feed into the column (e) the ratio of the products removal rates (f) the rate of production of crystals Since the scale-up of equipment is an ultimate aim of the present investigation it is necessary to study the results mathematically. Where possible, this examination has been undertaken thus establishing the major factors involved in the separation and purification scheme. It should also be possible to determine whether absolute optimisation of operation is attainable - i. e. does separation increase as the crystal rate increases to infinity or is an optimum separation eventually attained...|$|R

50|$|The tjasker {{has only}} one wooden millshaft on which all {{machinery}} is carried. This shaft is inclined at an angle of approximately 30° and supported in a wooden frame. On the lower end it carries the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> which is partly submerged in water. The screw doesn't rotate in a pipe but has a fixed encasing which simplifies the design further. The top end of the shaft carries the Common sails with a span of approximately 5 to 6 meters. In some cases wooden slats are used instead of sail cloth. The mill can be stopped using a band brake on the brake disk which is fitted on the shaft behind the top bearing.|$|E
50|$|This process {{functions}} like a cutter suction dredger, but {{the cutting tool}} is a rotating <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw</b> set {{at right angles to}} the suction pipe.

Today, auger dredges are used for a wider variety of applications including river maintenance and sand mining.|$|E
50|$|Another device {{which was}} used widely was the <b>Archimedean</b> <b>screw,</b> and {{examples}} of such drainage machines have also been found in many old mines. Depictions show the screws being powered by a human treading on the outer casing to turn the entire apparatus as one piece.They were also used in series, so increasing the lift {{of water from the}} workings. However, they must have been more difficult to operate since the user had to stand on a slanting surface to turn the screw. The steeper the incline, the greater the risk of the user slipping {{from the top of the}} screw. No doubt the reverse water wheel was easier to use with a horizontal treading surface. On the other hand, the screw could be operated by a crank handle fitted to the central axle, but would be more tiring since the weight of the operator does not bear on the crank, as it does when trod from above.|$|E
