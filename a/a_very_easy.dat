25|$|The purges {{affected}} {{the leadership of}} the VVS. In June 1941, 91 per cent of major formation leaders had been in place for just six months. With the exception of Major General Aleksandr Novikov, commanding the Leningrad District, most would fail in their posts and pay for that failure with their lives. A critical operational omission of the VVS was the failure to disperse its aircraft. Soviet aircraft was left closely ‘bunched’ into groups, and lined up on airfields, making <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> target for the Germans.|$|E

Advanced programs could be written without resorting to non-structured programming or machine code (necessary with many competing computers).

The exp-function method is used to find the soliton solution of a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations with symbolic computation.

25|$|During the 19th century a {{national}} awakening occurred in Finland. It {{was supported by}} the Russian central administration for practical reasons, as a security measure to weaken Swedish influence in Finland. This trend was reinforced by the general wave of nationalism in Europe in the mid-19th century. As a result, {{under the influence of the}} German idea of one national language, a strong movement arose that promoted the use of the Finnish language in education, research and administration. Many influential Swedish-speaking families learned Finnish, fennicized their names and changed their everyday language to Finnish, sometimes not <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> task. This linguistic change had many similarities with the linguistic and cultural revival of 19th century Lithuania where many former Polish speakers expressed their affiliation with the Lithuanian nation by adopting Lithuanian as their spoken language. As the educated class in Finland was almost entirely Swedish-speaking, the first generation of the Finnish nationalists and Fennomans came predominantly from a Swedish-speaking background.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} and cryptography likewise uses group theory in many ways. Abelian varieties {{have been introduced}} above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures. The one-dimensional case, namely elliptic curves is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing. Very large groups of prime order constructed in elliptic curve cryptography serve for public-key cryptography. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from {{the flexibility of the}} geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the discrete logarithm very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, Caesar's cipher, may also be interpreted as <b>a</b> (<b>very</b> <b>easy)</b> group operation. In another direction, toric varieties are algebraic varieties acted on by a torus. Toroidal embeddings have recently led to advances in algebraic geometry, in particular resolution of singularities.|$|E

Powell was indeed happy with his strong performance, his fastest in three years and was full of confidence {{about the rest of the}} season and the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea in late August. Next up for Powell was the IAAF Diamond League Meeting in Birmingham, England on 10 July.

Later, in the final he eased to a 9.91s victory where compatriots Nesta Carter and Michael Frater finished second and third respectively. Powell was satisfied with both his races, stating that he took both the races easy due to very chilly and rainy conditions. Asafa seemed more and more confident heading into the World Championships in late August. Powell next competed on 30 July in Budapest at the Hungarian Grand Prix.

They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. [...] "We were pacifists before we were Quakers," [...] Franklin says, [...] "but it was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children."

500|$|Commentators mainly praised Hutton's {{concentration}} and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly {{when compared to}} Bradman's innings of 334, was excused {{on the grounds that}} the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of {{concentration and}} endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, [...] in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.|$|E

500|$|Pierce {{returned}} to the horror genre with the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on {{the true story of}} the Phantom Killer, an unidentified serial killer who murdered five people in Texarkana in 1946. Pierce remembered being scared by news stories about the killer during his youth in Hampton. He received some criticism for the graphic violence portrayed in the film, particularly one scene where the killer ties a woman to a tree, attaches a knife {{to the end of a}} trombone, then repeatedly stabs her while playing the instrument. Pierce said he purposely made the film violent because he felt the real-life situation was horrific and did not want to glaze over it. While filming horror scenes, he tried to create a suspenseful mood by clearing the set of only the essential cast and staff, then refusing to let them talk to each other as the scenes were shot. Pierce appeared in The Town That Dreaded Sundown as police Patrolman A.C. [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Benson, an idiotic comic relief character. The name [...] "Spark Plug" [...] was a real-life nickname given to the director due to his energy. Pierce described The Town That Dread Sundown as <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> and enjoyable shoot with no major problems on the set.|$|E

In January 2007, the band toured through Europe with Becoming the Archetype, and Shaped by Fate. By this time, yet another bass player had been recruitedJon [...] "KC Wolf" [...] Kindler. In April {{of the same}} year, after delays relating to lineup changes, their second album, The Fiancée, was released. [...] The record was produced by Matt Goldman. The writing and recording process had been driven by time constraints. [...] "It was actually <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> record to write," [...] said Scogin, [...] "It came more naturally to us." [...] However, Scogin waited until the music was written before writing lyrics, an exercise he vowed never to attempt again. Hayley Williams of Paramore made a guest performance on the track [...] "Then Came To Kill" [...] as did Aaron Weiss of mewithoutYou when he played the harmonica on [...] "Forgive Me Nashville"; Scogin had been friends with both artists for many years. The Fiancée broke the Billboard 200it debuted at No.169, selling 6,800 copies and was well received in the Christian and secular markets. The group played a release tour with Misery Signals, I Am Ghost, and I Hate Sally, and then made a short run on the Warped Tour in summer. Another leg of The Fiancée Tour extended into spring 2008 with LoveHateHero, Alesana, Our Last Night, and Sky Eats Airplane. The lineup underwent another drastic change in mid-2008, as Jake Ryan, Dan Eaton and Jon Terry all decided to step down. Ryan and Eaton went on to form the indie pop band Queens Club and were signed to Tooth & Nail Records.|$|E

Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy {{to keep up with}} active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. The Papillon can withstand heat but is more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.|$|E
