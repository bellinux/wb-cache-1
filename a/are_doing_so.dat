[...] A Dark Angel hero was leading his men aboard the invading space hulk, Sin of Damnation, when it vanished into the warp. [...] The first mission in the campaign sends the player's squad to investigate the Tolevi system for a distress call of Dark Angels' origin. [...] A nest of Genestealers is uncovered on the planet Ma'Caellia, and the player's forces are ordered to destroy the aliens' Hive Mind. [...] However, {{there are too many}} Genestealers, and the Marines are forced to withdraw. [...] Without any other options, the Marines destroy the infestation and all other life forms on the planet through exterminatus with virus bombsbiological weapons of mass destruction. [...] As they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so,</b> the Sin of Damnation re-enters the system, and the player receives orders to invade the hulk. [...] Aboard the vessel, the player's squads destroy the Genestealers' gene banks and their Patriarch.

2500|$|Although Hume leaves {{open the}} {{possibility}} for miracles to occur and be reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened in history: He points out that people often lie, and they have good reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> {{for the benefit of}} their religion or because of the fame that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are easily transmitted even where false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem to occur mostly in [...] "ignorant and barbarous nations" [...] and times, and the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Finally, the miracles of each religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the other less likely.|$|E
