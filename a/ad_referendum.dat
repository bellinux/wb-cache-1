60|$|Some {{will have}} it that the old city of Sorbiodunum or Salisbury stood here, and was {{afterwards}} (for I know not what reasons) removed to the low marshy grounds among the rivers, where it now stands. But as I see no authority for it other than mere tradition, I believe my share of it, and take it <b>ad</b> <b>referendum.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{title of}} Colchester {{is in the}} family of Earl Rivers, and the eldest son of that family is called Lord Colchester, though as I understand, the title is not settled by the {{creation}} to the eldest son till he enjoys the title of earl with it, but that the other is by the courtesy of England; however, this I take <b>ad</b> <b>referendum.</b>|$|E

50|$|Overall, Italians {{have been}} called on to decide on 72 {{national}} referendums: 67 popular referendums, 3 constitutional referendums, and the 2 <b>ad</b> hoc <b>referendums</b> described above. They approved 25 of them, rejected 18, and 28 were declared invalid because of low turnout.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{constitutional}} referendum of the Batavian Republic in 1805, only two referendums have been held. The {{first was the}} consultative, <b>ad</b> hoc <b>referendum</b> on the European Constitution in 2005. The second was the referendum on the ratification of the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement on 6 April 2016, {{which was the first}} referendum under the Advisory Referendum Act.|$|R

60|$|Mons. Buys {{seemed to}} know little of his masters' mind, and pretended he had no power to {{conclude}} upon any thing.[1] Her Majesty's minister proposed to him an alliance between the two nations, to subsist after a peace. To this he hearkened very readily, and offered to take the matter <b>ad</b> <b>referendum,</b> having authority to do no more. His intention was, that he might appear to negotiate, {{in order to gain}} time to pick out, if possible, the whole secret of the transactions between Britain and France; to disclose nothing himself, nor bind his masters to any conditions; to seek delays till the Parliament met, and then observe what turn it took, and what would be the issue of those frequent cabals between himself and some other foreign ministers, in conjunction with the chief leaders of the discontented faction.|$|E

50|$|The film stars Chloé Sainte-Marie as Yo-Yo and Louis-Philippe Davignon-Daigneault as Alphonse, a New Age cult priestess in Montreal and {{her faith}} healer nephew. Events {{are set in}} motion when Alphonse's father Aristide (François Léveillé) threatens to commit suicide by jumping off the Jacques Cartier Bridge, leading to an <b>ad</b> hoc {{neighbourhood}} <b>referendum</b> {{on whether or not}} he should jump. The film is in part a satire of the political and social rhetoric, {{on both sides of the}} issue, in the 1995 Quebec referendum; Carle was inspired by, and singled out for special oppobrium in his film, the notion offered by some of his sovereignist friends that Quebec independence would in and of itself solve the social problems of poverty, unemployment and homelessness.|$|R
40|$|A part of {{the modern}} Swiss {{judiciary}} and doctrine have proposed a solution giving a party of an <b>ad</b> <b>referendum</b> contract a direct claim to execute the final agreement. This new approach («Einstufentheorie») is controversial and stands {{in opposition to the}} traditional view («Zweistufentheorie»). However, the discussed idea simplifies the formation and execution of contracts there, where in both – precontracts and final contracts – there is an identity of the object and of the parties.
