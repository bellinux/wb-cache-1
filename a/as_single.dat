5|$|Bee-eaters may nest <b>as</b> <b>single</b> pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while {{medium-sized}} bee-eaters {{have small}} colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can {{number in the}} thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers, These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.|$|E

5|$|Both Bruce and Utsler began wrestling <b>as</b> <b>single</b> {{competitors}} in 1983 {{in their backyard}} wrestling promotion Tag Team Wrestling, later renamed National All-Star Wrestling. The two moved on to compete in various independent promotions in Michigan from 1990 to 1997 before making an appearance together in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as Insane Clown Posse. In 1998, the team had a three-month stint in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) where they wrestled alongside The Oddities and, later, The Headbangers.|$|E
5|$|Complex {{powers and}} {{logarithms}} are more naturally handled <b>as</b> <b>single</b> valued functions on a Riemann surface. Single valued versions {{are defined by}} choosing a sheet. The value has a discontinuity along a branch cut. Choosing one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous, and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or <b>as</b> <b>single</b> tanks.

5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, <b>as</b> <b>single</b> blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|As part of Virgin/Universal Music's reissue campaign, {{a special}} edition of the album was {{released}} on September 23, 2014. The release consists of the original album remastered and 91 bonus tracks of previously unreleased material, demos and alternate versions of Adore-era songs, and was released in five formats; the physical box set containing all 107 tracks, the digital deluxe edition containing 74 of the bonus tracks, as well <b>as</b> <b>single</b> disc CD and double-LP versions containing only the stereo remaster of the album. The digital version of the reissue was released on October 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. <b>As</b> <b>single</b> downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded during the first three months of 2006.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific conditions such <b>as</b> <b>single</b> gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur {{during the development}} of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built <b>as</b> <b>single</b> carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them <b>as</b> <b>single</b> entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a theological basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow <b>as</b> <b>single</b> cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually but not always with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value <b>as</b> <b>single</b> panels.|$|E
5|$|With {{the change}} of ownership, NSB also decided to replace the aging El 11 with El 17. The {{locomotives}} had been delivered in 1987 and were intended for express train service, but had been plagued with technical problems and were not considered reliable enough to operate <b>as</b> <b>single</b> locomotives. The six newest trains of the class were painted in a new green livery and branded as Flåmsbana rather than NSB. Older B3 carriages were renovated, given new panorama windows and painted in the same color scheme and taken into use on the line. In October 2000, NSB sold its shares in Flåm Utvikling to Aurland Ressursutvikling. The line received GSM-R from 1 May 2005. The same year, Nærøyfjord, the neighboring fjord to where Flåm is located, was inscribed as a World Heritage Site.|$|E
