40|$|Transport, translation, and <b>anchoring</b> <b>of</b> osk mRNA and {{proteins}} {{are essential}} for posterior patterning of Drosophila embryos. Here we show that Homer and Bifocal act redundantly to promote posterior <b>anchoring</b> <b>of</b> the osk gene products. Disruption of actin microfilaments, which causes delocalization of Bifocal but not Homer from the oocyte cortex, severely disrupts <b>anchoring</b> <b>of</b> osk gene products only when Homer (not Bifocal) is absent. Our data suggest that two processes, one requiring Bifocal and an intact F-actin cytoskeleton and a second requiring Homer but independent of intact F-actin, may act redundantly to mediate posterior <b>anchoring</b> <b>of</b> the osk gene products...|$|R

5|$|The Browns began play in 1946, and Rymkus {{soon became}} an <b>anchor</b> <b>of</b> the team's {{offensive}} and defensive lines. He solidified his reputation for toughness by playing more than 50 minutes per game that year despite a knee injury for which he needed surgery immediately after the season. On defense, Rymkus helped stop opponents' rushing attacks and disrupt the opposing quarterback. On offense, he helped protect quarterback Otto Graham and opened up running room for fullback Marion Motley. Graham led the AAFC in total passing yards over its four years of existence, while Motley {{led the league in}} rushing.|$|E

The Marines' defensive system stretched below the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from the coast, along Route 9, to Khe Sanh. During 1966 the regular Special Forces troops had moved off the plateau and built a smaller camp down Route 9 at Lang Vei, about half the distance to the Laotian border.|$|E

5|$|The studio {{initially}} {{imagined that}} the film would center around a clone of the character Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the <b>anchor</b> <b>of</b> the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script {{in a way that would}} bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the <b>anchor</b> <b>of</b> Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E
5|$|Madhavan has {{appeared}} as host for television programmes on Hindi channels, {{while he has}} also been a host at film award functions. During his television career in the 1990s, Madhavan first worked as a host on Tol Mol Ke Bol. He was announced as the host of Sony Entertainment Television's Deal Ya No Deal, the Indian version of the American game show Deal Or No Deal, in October 2005. However, Madhavan quit as the lead <b>anchor</b> <b>of</b> the show in January 2006 claiming he was unhappy with the way the shoot schedules were handled by the production house. According to the actor, when he took on the show, he had {{made it clear that he}} would continue with his South Indian film assignments, and as the show was being filmed in Mumbai, he had found it hard to keep travelling throughout India from Chennai to film the ten days a month he had signed up for. Madhavan added that he was restricted by the producers to spend one day rehearsing technically, which left him with fatigue. Mandira Bedi subsequently replaced Madhavan as the anchor in February for Series 2 of the game show. In June 2010, Madhavan made a comeback to the game show format by accepting a contract with Imagine TV's Big Money show, signing on to host a single season, and then hosted an episode of the crime show Savdhaan India in January 2016. Furthermore, he has been a guest judge in the Indian television show, Fame Gurukul. In 2016, Madhavan stated that he would only take part in television commitments for money, while he does not consider his payment when signing on to appear in films. Madhavan has also hosted live events, notably the National Film Awards in 2013 with Huma Qureshi. He was also the host of the 55th Filmfare Awards South in Chennai in 2008 and then also the Vijay Awards in 2013.|$|E

30|$|Longitudinal spacing <b>of</b> <b>anchors</b> or anchor {{groups may}} have two effects {{depending}} on the distance between centerlines <b>of</b> <b>anchors.</b> For anchors that have a large longitudinal spacing, the strains in the sheet behind the first row <b>of</b> <b>anchors</b> dropped significantly.
