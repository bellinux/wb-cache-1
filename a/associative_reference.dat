40|$|It is {{well-known}} that social influences affect consumption decisions. Although {{a number of}} different mechanisms have been hypothesized, a consumer’s tendency to purchase a product is influenced by the choices made by his <b>associative</b> <b>reference</b> group. Here, we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with social influence on a common consumer good: music. We restricted our study population to adolescents between the ages of 12 - 17 because music is a common purchase in this age group, and it is widely believed that adolescent behavior is particularly influenced by perceptions of popularity in their reference group. Using 15 -second clips of songs downloaded from MySpace, we obtained behavioral measures of preferences and neurobiological responses to the songs. The data were gathered with, and without, the popularity of the song revealed. The popularity had a significant effect on the participants ’ ratings of how much they liked the songs. The fMRI results showed a strong correlation between the participants ’ rating and activity in the caudate nucleus, a region previously implicated in reward-driven actions. The tendency to change one’s evaluation of a song was correlated with activation only in the anterior insula, a region associated with physiological arousal, particularly to negative affective states. Our results suggest that a principal mechanism whereby popularity ratings affect consumer choice is through the anxiety generated by the mismatch between one’s own preferences and others’. This mismatch anxiety motivates people to switch their choices {{in the direction of the}} consensus, suggesting that this is a major force behind conformity observed in music tastes in teenagers...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Very High Level Languages (VHLL) provide {{higher level}} abstractions and more {{powerful}} primitives than high level languages (HLL). A programmer uses these abstractions {{to solve a problem}} by specifying "what" is to be done rather than "how" it is to be done. This research work reports the design and development of Bagit, a new VHLL for application programminq. Bagit provides 1) an encapsulation mechanism (bag) and, 2) an information hiding mechanism (filter) which are used in a consistent manner to support data, type, control, functional, and access abstraction. A data abstraction (ADT) in Bagit is defined by a bag which encapsulates the representation and valid operations on a type, and a filter which defines the interface to the abstraction. A type abstraction is a data abstraction which has two or more filters, each filter defining a new type. A zero type is a type or data abstraction where all its attributes are of type function. Functional abstraction in Bagit is provided via functions which can return bags. Furthurmore, these functions mav be used in conjunction with loop constructs and bag expressions, providing control abstractions. In this case they are generators of bags. Finally, <b>associative</b> <b>referencing</b> is supported by labelled bags. By hiding the irrelevant information of how an object is accessed, and only specifying what the object is, access abstraction is achieved. The significant contributions to the field of programming languages are, 1) Realization of an information hiding mechanism as a language design principle in addition to an encapsulation mechanism, 2) Attemptinq to provide a bridae between the areas of programming lanauages and database systems, 3) Treating various forms of abstraction using a single abstraction mechanism in a consistent and uniform manner, 4) Solving the problems of zero types and more than one type, and 5) Improving functional and control abstraction...|$|R
40|$|The Song of the Vineyard, Isaiah 5 : 1 - 7, portrays YHWH as a vinedresser who has {{carefully}} prepared {{land and}} planted a choice vine, {{a symbol of}} the people whom the deity has chosen. When the reasonable expectation that the vine produce good fruit is thwarted, the vinedresser destroys the vineyard. YHWH, the vinedresser, may seem to be characterised by these actions as a demanding god who will swiftly and harshly recompense any failure to meet expectations. This thesis poses the hypothesis that although this brief song may at first seemingly present a monochromatic characterisation of YHWH, it may actually present a spectrum of characterisations when viewed through multiple interpretive lenses. Socio-rhetorical criticism is the methodology used to examine this hypothesis. This methodology, developed by Vernon K. Robbins, encompasses diverse interpretive approaches, examining five aspects, or “textures,” of the text to obtain a broad interpretive spectrum. In this thesis, three of the textures, innertexture, intertexture, and socio-cultural texture, are considered in separate chapters. The chapter on innertexture examines the world of the text itself, in particular its progressive nature and emotive content. The next chapter examines the intertextural relationship between this Isaian song and two other ancient songs (The Song of the Reed Sea and the Song of Moses), <b>associative</b> <b>references</b> to Sodom, and parallels with the Song of Solomon. The chapter on the socio-cultural texture examines the portrayal of YHWH in light of the socio-economics and socio-cultural values of the world of the story, eighth century B. C. E. Judah. Through this interpretive lense, YHWH is seen as a patron or benefactor who has been dishonoured by his people. In socio-rhetorical criticism, ideology is often presented as a separate texture; in this thesis, it is considered as part of the act of interpretation of all textures, since readers’ ideologies interact with the text. The sacred texture, the last of Robbins’ proposed textures, is presented as the conclusion, with a summary of the spectrum of characterisations of YHWH that the multi-lensed interpretive approach uncovers. The conclusion also includes suggested implications of these finds for the community of faith. Biblical and Ancient StudiesD. Litt. et Phil. (Biblical Studies...|$|R
40|$|Pattern completion, {{the ability}} to {{retrieve}} complete memories initiated by subsets of external cues, {{has been a major}} focus of many computation models. A previously study reports that such pattern completion requires NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. However, such a claim was derived from a non-inducible gene knockout experiment in which the NMDA receptors were absent throughout all stages of memory processes as well as animal’s adult life. This raises the critical question regarding whether the previously described results were truly resulting from the requirement of the NMDA receptors in retrieval. Here, we have examined the role of the NMDA receptors in pattern completion via inducible knockout of NMDA receptors limited to the memory retrieval stage. By using two independent mouse lines, we found that inducible knockout mice, lacking NMDA receptor in either forebrain or hippocampus CA 1 region at the time of memory retrieval, exhibited normal recall of <b>associative</b> spatial <b>reference</b> memory regardless of whether retrievals took place under full-cue or partial-cue conditions. Moreover, systemic antagonism of NMDA receptor during retention tests also had no effect on fullcue or partial-cue recall of spatial water maze memories. Thus, both genetic and pharmacological experiments collectively demonstrate that pattern completion during spatial associative memory recall does not require the NMDA receptor in th...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the theoretical basis and the hermeneutical processes which determine the appropriation of the metaphor in religious discourse. Throughout the twentieth century the influence of linguistic philosophy on language has been noted by various philosophers, linguists and theologians. Religious language of the twenty first century is furthermore intensely {{aware of the fact}} that linguistic utterances pertaining to God have no realistic external referent. This realisation foregrounds the importance of the metaphor and speaking about God by means of metaphorical language. Metaphors are sparks of imagination, transferring a word from its normal context to an estranged one. Meaning crystallises in the course of a dynamic interaction between two concepts that belong supposedly to unrelated, even hostile domains. Often the meaning of metaphors is uncertain because authors are not explicit about their thoughts. This is especially the case with regards to metaphors in the Bible, because the interpretation of metaphors is influenced by the reader's <b>associative</b> frame of <b>reference.</b> Both authors and readers from Biblical times had a context and a frame of reference vastly different from today. However, the meaning of metaphors is not fixed, on the contrary, numerous new meanings may be mobilised by different readers' <b>associative</b> frame of <b>reference.</b> Because metaphors have a history of human experience, these are living metaphors that make language new and exceed the limits of meaning and association. If conventional metaphors permeate all of human life, thought and action, theological discourse is metaphor par excellence. This article concludes with a challenge to Practical Theology, especially Homiletics, Liturgy and Narrative Pastoral Counselling to treat the metaphor with caution and with awe. A dynamic and interactive relationship between theory and praxis is necessary for the metaphor to function creatively and to induce change. Therefore theory needs to find its home in praxis...|$|R
40|$|Radomir Konstantinović’s Descartes’ Death has the {{characteristics}} of a novel, an autobiographical essay and a philosophical treatise. The protagonist of the novel, Father, professor of Civil Law, lives a life paved by the rules founded on Descartes’ rationality: for him, to serve the Law means to serve Order, perfect legality, repetition. Son admires his Father, {{but at the same time}} fears his infallibility and suffers from his tyranny of law, order and habit. In the Son’s eyes, Father is simultaneously almighty law and fear of law, as well as the law that terrorizes everyone around him. Everything changed in the 1990 s when chaos ruled the outside world, Serbia and Belgrade: Son endeavoured to establish with this man of form and order such intimate relationships that he could not have achieved during Father’s life, because the Father was Law itself and the Son always and only an imperfect(ed) Disciple. The image related to Father–Lawyer or rather to Law as the art of equilibrium, is the image of a bicycle with the front wheel turned to the left which frequently reappears in the novel. Both in this novel–treatise and in his earlier works, Konstantinović expressed familiarity with postmodern thinking and the philosophical concepts of Montaigne and Pascal; one of the founders of scepticism, Montaigne, witnessed the crisis of values and heralded the impossibility of reaching the truth and the absolutes, while Pascal was doubtful of the proof of bare evidence, placing belief in irrational sensations above the rational conviction. However, in the 1990 s one had to find a space also for Descartes, the author of the treatise on method, reason and the value of law. The Son now knows that Pascal’s world belongs to what is direct, to the market, „since directness kills: naivety has bloody hands“. He understands that Father’s world of rules is closer to him, that the world of dignity, rhetoric, equilibrium and law is closer than the law of directness and the world that lacks legal organization. In the overwhelming darkness the Son first repudiated Montaigne, then Pascal. Descartes remained. Father’s Descartes. When in 1989 Jacques Derrida thought for the first time of a parallel between literature, philosophy and law, he emphasized the precision of the English language in the definitions of the functioning of law: „to enforce the law“ reminds us that justice cannot be properly of the law or right in law if it does not possess force or refer to force from the start. At the beginning of justice there was logos, word or language, but this does not contradict another of Derrida’s statements: in the beginning there was force. And there, when discussing law and force, law as the force, Derrida brings from oblivion the philosophers most prominent in Konstantinović’s work: Descartes, Pascal and Montaigne. Not only with the first, but with the other two as well, Derrida finds the term: the mystical basis of authority, which refers to the authority produced by law and is the result of law. „Laws are not rightful in themselves, we do not respect them because they are rightful but because they possess authority. “We are faced with two beginner’s works: for the first time Derrida enters in deliberations about the relations between law, literature, philosophy and deconstructivism, while Konstantinović writes a novel–treatise, new in terms of structure and content (and still unperceived), where he explicates the ideas which Derrida deals with more densely and in a philosophical framework in his American Lectures. Derrida propagated the concepts which Konstantinović’s Son–narrator would present in his imaginary discussions with his Father and in his quotations from the thinkers quoted by Derrida. As if the author, Radomir Konstantinović, himself inclined to <b>associative</b> <b>references</b> and quotations applied as verifications of the narrative, believed that the crucial fact in his novel is that the main protagonist is a lawyer, the one who writes the law, defines legislations and deals with legal justice...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{acute stress}} {{can cause a}} myriad of {{cognitive}} impairments, but whether negative experiences continue to hinder individual as they age is not well understood. We determined how chronic unpredictable stress during adolescence affects multiple learning and memory processes in adulthood. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, we measured learning (both associative and reversal) and memory (both reference and working) starting 110 days after completion of the adolescent-stress treatment. We found that adolescent stress affected adult cognitive abilities in a context-dependent way. Compared to rats reared without stress, adolescent-stressed rats exhibited enhanced reversal learning, an indicator of behavioral flexibility, but showed no change in <b>associative</b> learning and <b>reference</b> memory abilities. Working memory, which in humans is thought to underpin reasoning, mathematical skills, and reading comprehension, may be enhanced by exposure to adolescent stress. However, when adolescent-stressed animals were tested after a novel disturbance, they exhibited a 5 -fold decrease in working memory performance while unstressed rats continued to exhibit a linear learning curve. These results emphasize the capacity for stress during adolescence to transform the cognitive abilities of adult animals, even after stress exposure has ceased and animals have resided in safe environments {{for the majority of}} their lifespans...|$|R
