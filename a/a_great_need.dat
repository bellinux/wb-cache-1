This authority {{is responsible for the}} ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European Union that aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, {{because of a lack of}} expertise and of a science-based management plan. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between and among parents, teachers, and administrators of elementary, junior and senior high school students regarding their perceptions of the difference between the present and desired applications of computer technology. The areas of computer technology were computer assisted instruction, computer managed instruction, and computer literacy. ^ The needs assessment survey, Applications of Computer Technology, was developed for the study. Respondents indicated to what extent they felt the school currently applied a particular area of computer technology and to what extent it should be applied. Responses were analyzed for each computer technology area by level (elementary, junior and senior high school) and sub-group (parents, teachers, and administrators). ^ The sample population was selected, through a random sampling technique, from parents, teachers, and administrators associated with the Lincoln Public Schools, Lincoln, Nebraska. ^ The following conclusions were drawn based on the perceptions of parents, teachers, and administrators surveyed: (1) Parents, teachers, and administrators perceived <b>a</b> <b>need</b> for <b>greater</b> implementation in all areas of computer technology. (2) Parents perceived <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer assisted instruction and computer literacy than did teachers and administrators. (3) Elementary school parents, teachers, and administrators perceived <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior high school parents, teachers, and administrators. (4) Parents of junior high school students perceived <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer assisted instruction than elementary school parents. (5) Elementary school teachers perceived <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for further implementation of computer managed instruction than junior and senior high school teachers. Elementary school teachers also perceived <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>need</b> for the implementation of computer literacy than senior high school teachers.

25|$|Deliveries of {{production}} P-63As began in October 1943. The USAAF concluded the Kingcobra was {{inferior to the}} Mustang, and declined to order larger quantities. American allies, particularly the Soviet Union, had <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for fighter aircraft, however, and the Soviets were already the largest users of the Airacobra. Therefore, the Kingcobra was ordered into production to be delivered under Lend-Lease. In February 1944, the Soviet government sent a highly experienced test pilot, Andrey G. Kochetkov, and an aviation engineer, Fyodor P. Suprun, to the Bell factories {{to participate in the}} development of the first production variant, the P-63A. Initially ignored by Bell engineers, Kochetkov's expert testing of the machine's spin characteristics (which led to airframe buckling) eventually led to a significant Soviet role in the development. After flat spin recovery proved impossible, and upon Kochetkov's making a final recommendation that pilots should bail out upon entering such a spin, he received a commendation from the Irving Parachute Company. The Kingcobra’s maximum aft CG was moved forward to facilitate recovery from spins.|$|E

2500|$|Achievement {{motivation}} was studied intensively by David C. McClelland, John W. Atkinson {{and their colleagues}} since the early 1950s. This type of motivation is a drive that is developed from an emotional state. One may feel the drive to achieve by striving for success and avoiding failure. In achievement motivation, one would hope that they excel in {{what they do and}} not think much about the failures or the negatives. [...] Their research showed that business managers who were successful demonstrated a high need to achieve no matter the culture. [...] There are three major characteristics of people who have <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> to achieve according to McClelland's research.|$|E
2500|$|In the UK, the BPS’s {{reconsideration}} {{of the role}} of the Medical Section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. Marie Johnston and John Weinman argued in a letter to the BPS Bulletin that there was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for a Health Psychology Section. In December 1986 the section was established at the BPS London Conference, with Marie Johnston as chair. At the Annual BPS Conference in 1993 a review of [...] "Current Trends in Health Psychology" [...] was organized, and a definition of health psychology as [...] "the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare" [...] was proposed.|$|E

Columbus Mayor Michael Coleman said of possible redevelopment for the property, [...] "I have many, many ideas, I want to see some retail back in it, offices as well.

In the last minutes before eviction was to take place, the city was able to negotiate a purchase agreement to buy the property from Simon and take over full control.|$|E

60|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{occasion}} {{when we first got}} on speaking terms on the road by the quarry, I had to admit that she presented some points of a problematic appearance. I don't know why I imagined Captain Anthony as the sort of man who would not be likely to take the initiative; not perhaps from indifference but from that peculiar timidity before women which often enough is found in conjunction with chivalrous instincts, with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> for affection and great stability of feelings. Such men are easily moved. At the least encouragement they go forward with the eagerness, with the recklessness of starvation. This accounted for the suddenness of the affair. No! With all her inexperience this girl could not have found any great difficulty in her conquering enterprise. She must have begun it. And yet there she was, patient, almost unmoved, almost pitiful, waiting outside like a beggar, without a right to anything but compassion, for a promised dole.|$|E
60|$|Presently Adam's {{thoughts}} recurred to what Mr. Craig {{had said}} about Arthur Donnithorne, and pictured his going away, and the changes that might take place before he came back; then they travelled back affectionately over the old scenes of boyish companionship, and dwelt on Arthur's good qualities, which Adam had a pride in, as we all have in {{the virtues of the}} superior who honours us. A nature like Adam's, with <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> of love and reverence in it, depends for so much of its happiness on what it can believe and feel about others! And he had no ideal world of dead heroes; he knew little of the life of men in the past; he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving admiration among those who came within speech of him. These pleasant thoughts about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual into his keen rough face: perhaps they were the reason why, when he opened the old green gate leading into the Grove, he paused to pat Gyp and say a kind word to him.|$|E
60|$|He never {{admitted}} {{that he was going}} to die. He knew it was so, he knew it was the end. Yet even to himself he did not admit it. He hated the fact, mortally. His will was rigid. He could not bear being overcome by death. For him, there was no death. And yet, at times, he felt <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>need</b> to cry out and to wail and complain. He would have liked to cry aloud to Gerald, so that his son should be horrified out of his composure. Gerald was instinctively aware of this, and he recoiled, to avoid any such thing. This uncleanness of death repelled him too much. One should die quickly, like the Romans, one should be master of one's fate in dying as in living. He was convulsed in the clasp of this death of his father's, as in the coils of the great serpent of Laocoon. The great serpent had got the father, and the son was dragged into the embrace of horrifying death along with him. He resisted always. And in some strange way, he was a tower of strength to his father.|$|E
