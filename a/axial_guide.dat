40|$|This paper employs an {{analytic}} reconnection {{model to}} investigate {{the conditions under which}} Hall currents can influence reconnection and Ohmic dissipation rates. It is first noted that time dependent magnetohydrodynamic systems can be analyzed by decomposing the magnetic and velocity fields into guide field and reconnecting field components. A formally exact solution shows that Hall currents can speed up or slow down the reconnection rate depending on the strength and orientation of the <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> field. In particular, merging solutions are developed in which the <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> field is the dominant driver of the reconnection. The extent to which Hall currents can alleviate the buildup of back pressures in flux pile-up reconnection models is also examined. The analysis shows that, although enhancements of the merging rate can be expected under certain conditions, it is unlikely that Hall currents can completely undo the fundamental pressure limitations associated with flux pile-up reconnection...|$|E
40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis of}} the collective Raman interaction in a Free-Electron Laser with combined planar wiggler and <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> magnetic fields is presented. The analysis involves a perturbation of the cold-fluid model of the interaction about the single particle trajectories in the combined external fields, and the complete dispersion equation for a monoenergetic beam is obtained. In contrast {{to the case of}} a helical wiggler field in which the interaction excites a right-hand circularly polarized wave, the interaction for a planar wiggler and an <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> field is with an elliptically polarized wave which contains both left-hand and right-hand circular components. However, the results indicate that many facets of the interaction are analogous to those found with a helical wiggler. In particular, both the transverse velocity and the growth rate of the instability tend to increase near the resonance at which the Larmor and wiggle periods coincide. In addition, a negative-mass regime is found in which the axial electron velocity increases with decreasing beam energy which drives the beam space-charge modes unstable. tPermanent Address: Science Applications International Corporation, McLean, VA 22102.

40|$|Traditional {{rotating}} drums are {{a popular}} type of tumbling mixer; however, they generally suffer from poor axial mixing with granular materials. To overcome this weakness, {{a system of}} alternately arranged baffles is presented, {{and its effect on}} particle mixing is numerically assessed using a GPU-based discrete element method. It is found that this arrangement of baffles displays better axial mixing performance than drums with (or without) traditional baffles, and that maximum mixing efficiency can be obtained through a suitable choice of baffle dimension and number. Essentially, this novel arrangement promotes the bulk movement of particles in the axial direction because of the combined radial scattering and <b>axial</b> <b>guiding</b> effects of the baffles. Together with the enhanced dispersive mixing, axial convective mixing serves to increase the axial mixing efficiency. Moreover, it is found that alternately arranged baffles produce good performance in various granular systems of rotating drums. Thus, the proposed system is a promising approach for industrial applications in more complicated mixers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Classic applications include, for example: manipulating single cells and their subcellular organelles, sorting cells in microfluidic channels and the cytoplasmic delivery of both genetic and non-genetic matter of varying sizes into mammalian cells. In this thesis several new findings specifically in the optical cell sorting {{as well as in}} the photo-transfection study fields are presented. In my optical cell sorting and guiding investigations, a new technique for enhancing the dielectric contrast of mammalian cells, which is a result of cells naturally engulfing polymer microspheres from their environment, is introduced. I explore how these intracellular dielectric tags influence the scattering and gradient forces upon these cells from an externally applied optical field. I show that intracellular polymer microspheres can serve as highly directional optical scatterers and that the scattering force can enable sorting through <b>axial</b> <b>guiding</b> onto laminin coated glass coverslips upon which the selected cells adhere. Following this, I report on transient photo-transfection of mammalian cells including neuroblastomas (rat/mouse and human), embryonic kidney, Chinese hamster ovary as well as pluripotent stem cells using a tightly focused titanium sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser beam spot. These investigations permitted advanced biological studies in femtosecond laser transfection: firstly, the influence of cell passage number on the transfection efficiency; secondly, the possibility to enhance the transfection efficiency via whole culture treatments of cells thereby, synchronizing them at the mitotic (M phase) as well as the synthesis phases (S phase) of the cell cycle; thirdly, this methodology can activate the up-regulation of the protective heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70). Finally, I show that this novel technology can also be used to transfect mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell colonies and the ability of differentiating these cells into the extraembryonic endoderm.

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} quantitatively, {{alveolar bone}} height and thickness {{in the central}} and lateral lower incisors and apical root resorption in all roots after using Herbst appliance. The sample comprised 23 patients (11 men, 12 women), mean ages 15. 76 ± 1. 75 years, presenting class II division 1, treated with Herbst appliance. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were obtained before and after Herbst treatment. The vertical alveolar bone level and the alveolar bone thickness of lower incisors were assessed. Vestibular (V), lingual (L) and total (T) bone thicknesses were assessed at the crestal (1), midroot (2) and apical (3) levels of the lower incisors. The apical root resorption was determined using <b>axial</b> <b>guided</b> navigation of CBCT images. The Student’s t-Test and Wilcoxon t-Test were used to compare dependent samples in parametric and non-parametric cases, respectively. The results were considered at a significance level of 5 %. The lower incisors showed no statistical significance for the vertical alveolar bone level. The alveolar bone thickness of lower incisors significantly reduced after the treatment at V 1, V 2, V 3, T 1 and significantly increased at L 2. Apical root resorption was detected by CBCT in 57. 96 % of 980 roots that underwent treatment. The CBCT, for allowing three-dimensional evaluation of dental roots, showed that Herbst appliance induces mild apical root resorption, mostly in the anchoring teeth, and the tooth movement induced by this appliance causes alveolar bone reduction on the vestibular side of lower incisors.

40|$|The {{onset of}} {{aerodynamic}} instabilities in {{proximity of the}} left margin of the operating curve {{represents one of the}} main limitations for centrifugal compressors in turbocharging applications. An anticipated stall/surge onset is indeed particularly detrimental at those high boost pressures that are typical of engine downsizing applications using a turbocharger. Several stabilization techniques have been investigated so far to increase the rangeability of the compressor without excessively reducing the efficiency. One of the most exploited solutions is represented by the use of upstream <b>axial</b> variable inlet <b>guide</b> vanes (VIGV) to impart a pre-whirl angle to the inlet flow. In the pre-design phase of a new stage or when selecting, for example, an existing unit from an industrial catalogue, it is however not easy to get a prompt estimation of the attended modifications induced by the VIGV on the performance map of the compressor. A simplified model to this end is presented in the study. Figuring out a typical industrial pre-design phase, the model assumes the availability of the original performance data of the compressor without pre-whirl and only very few geometrical parameters. Based on fluid dynamic considerations and some additional models and correlations, a procedure is defined to correct the attended stage pressure ratio and efficiency {{as a function of the}} pre-whirl angle imposed by the VIGV. The model has been successfully validated using an experimental literature case study and is thought to represent a new useful preliminary tool for turbocharger designers...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of using the guided wave non-destructive testing technique for power plant applications. Guided waves are already used extensively in the petrochemical industry, however the nature of pipework in a power station has meant that guided waves have not been studied for use in this environment. Power station pipework is more challenging to inspect than petrochemical pipework using guided waves because the pipelines tend to be shorter, and the feature density is much higher, with welds, hangers, supports and bends all contributing to make analysis of results more difficult. A particular focus of the study was detecting axially aligned defects in pipes, a problem that emerged in the UK coal power station fleet in 2006. Guided waves provided a desirable inspection technique because large volumes of pipework can be screened quickly, this being particularly advantageous due to the high volume of pipework that requires inspection. Two guided wave approaches to detecting axial cracks in pipes were pursued. Long- range guided waves were initially examined as they are able to examine large quantities of pipework in a short amount of time. Unfortunately, long-range guided waves are sensitive to the change in cross-sectional-area of a pipe, and axially aligned defects produce only a very small change in cross-section. Therefore long-range guided waves were not sensitive enough to detect a critically sized axial crack. The sensitivity of long- range guided waves was improved using a synthetic focusing algorithm, although this was still insufficient to detect a critically sized defect. The second guided wave approach was to utilise circumferential guided waves to detect axial cracks in pipes. Although many of the advantages of long-range guided waves are lost, using circumferential guided waves is much faster than an alternative manual ultrasonic inspection. The results of circumferential guided wave experiments suggest that they would be capable of detecting a critically sized axial crack in a pipe. Besides attempting to detect <b>axial</b> cracks <b>guided</b> waves have been tested on a small number of other power station pipework systems. These systems were tested as a way to examine the viability of using guided waves as a general inspection tool at a power station. Although guided waves are not suitable for every application, there are a good number of potential applications due to the wide variety of pipework systems at a power station.

The threshold value of the wiggler amplitude for the onset of chaos is estimated analytically and confirmed by computer simulation for spatial case where self-field effects are negligibly small. It is shown that the electron dynamic is nonintegrable. There is evidence for chaos from numerical calculations of Poincare maps and nonzero Lyaponov exponents using different approaches of Benetin's method which are described and compared.

40|$|Abstract Background Cholestatic {{jaundice}} as a presenting {{symptom of}} Precursor T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) /lymphoma (T-LBL) {{has never been}} reported in literature. Similarly, precursor T-ALL/T-LBL is characteristically negative for synaptophysin. We report the first case of a patient with precursor T-ALL/T-LBL who presented with cholestatic jaundice and aberrant tumor expression of synaptophysin. Case report 42 year old male presented with anorexia, nausea, jaundice, pale stools, dark urine and about 35 pound weight loss over the previous 3 weeks. The initial laboratory work was suggestive of cholestatic jaundice. Markedly elevated LDH (2025 U/L) and CA 19 - 9 (1778 u/ML) were also noticed. The CT scan of abdomen showed massive hepatomegaly with coarse echotexture with contracted gall bladder and normal sized common bile duct. Chest x-ray revealed a mediastinal mass with mediastinal widening. CT scan of the chest showed anterior mediastinal mass (16 cm × 10 cm). CT guided biopsy of the mass showed malignant lymphoma with diffuse proliferation of medium sized lymphoid cells. The neoplastic cells were positive for CD 1 a, CD 3, CD 4, CD 5, CD 8 and CD 43 with aberrant expression of synaptophysin. PET CT scan again showed a large anterior mediastinal mass with diffuse liver involvement and abnormal activity in <b>axial</b> bones. CT <b>guided</b> liver biopsy and bone marrow biopsy revealed the same morphology and immunohistochemistry. Bone marrow aspirate showed 85 % lymphoblasts. Thus, the diagnosis of precursor T-ALL/T-LBL was made and jaundice with elevated CA 19 - 9 were attributed to intrahepatic cholestasis. Conclusion Our case illustrates an unusual presentation of hematological malignancies as cholestatic jaundice. It also indicates the non-specific nature of CA 19 - 9 for pancreaticobiliary malignancies. It is the first case report of neoplastic precursor T cell lymphoblasts with unusual expression of synaptophysin.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} coupling {{between an}} exothermic chemical reaction and a nanowire or nanotube with large <b>axial</b> heat conduction <b>guides</b> a self-propagating thermal wave along the nano-conduit. The thermal conduit accelerates the wave by rapidly transporting energy to un-reacted fuel. The reaction wave induces what we term a thermopower wave, {{resulting in an}} electrical current in the same direction. At up to 7 W/g, peak power density is larger than that of many present micro-scale power sources (e. g. fuel cells, batteries) and even about seven times greater than commercial Li-ion batteries. Thermopower waves also tend to produce unipolar voltage pulses, although conventional thermoelectric theory predicts bipolar voltage. These waves also generate thermopower in excess of previous measurements in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and therefore could increase figures of merit {{in a variety of}} thermoelectric materials. In this thesis, I have developed the theoretical framework to describe the thermal and chemical profiles of propagating reaction waves, and their electrical properties. My analysis yielded a new analytical solution for one-dimensional reaction and thermal diffusion systems with nth order kinetics that obviates many approximate or numerical approaches from the past 80 years. A generalized logistic. function describes the temperature and concentration profiles within the solid fuel and provides a solution for the wave velocity {{for a wide range of}} conditions. This approach offers new insight into such problems spanning several fields in science and engineering, including propulsion and self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) of materials, as well as the dynamics of thermopower waves. Temperature and voltage measurements of thermopower waves on CNTs show that they can generate power as much as four times greater than predictions based on reference measurements of the Seebeck coefficient for static temperature gradients. We hypothesize that the excess thermopower stems from a chemical potential gradient across the CNTs. The fuel (e. g. picramide) adsorbs and dopes the CNTs ahead of the wave and desorbs and reacts behind the wave front. Furthermore, the excess thermopower depends on the mass of fuel added (relative to CNT mass), and the chemical potential difference matches the magnitude of the excess thermopower. Thus, a major conclusion of this thesis is that coupling to a chemical reaction can boost the performance of thermoelectric materials through differential doping. Thermopower waves can have well defined velocity oscillations for certain kinetic and thermal parameter values. Cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine (fuel) on multiwalled CNTs (conduit) system generates voltage oscillations of 400 to 5000 Hz. These frequencies agree with velocity oscillations predicted by my thermochemical model of the reaction wave, extended to include thermal transport within the conduits. Thermopower waves could thus find applications as new types of alternating current (AC) batteries and self-powered signal generators, which could easily be miniaturized. Microelectromechanical systems and sensors would benefit from thermopower wave generators to enable functions such as communications and acceleration that currently require large power packs. Additionally, the "self-discharge" rate of thermopower wave generators is extremely low in contrast to electrochemical storage, since their energy is stored in chemical bonds. Thermopower waves thus enable new energy storage devices and could exceed limitations of conventional thermoelectric devices. by Joel T. Abrahamson. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{development}} of a self-consistent kinetic description of helically distorted relativistic electron beam equilibria for free electron laser applications to include particular conditions of beam propaga-tion, not treated heretofore, which are of considerable practical interest. Radially confined equilibria are considered for a helically distorted electron beam propagating in the combined transverse wiggler and uniform <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> fields described by B 0 = Boi, + SB = Boi,- 6 Bcosk oze,- 6 Bsinkoze,, where Bo = const., 6 B = const., and ho = 27 r/ko = const. is the axial wavelength of the wiggler field. It is assumed that the beam density and current are sufficiently small that the equilibrium self fields can be neglected in comparison with B. In this context, it is found that there are three useful (and exact) invariants (CL, Ch, C 2) associated with single-particle motion in the equilibrium field Bo 0, + 6 B. These invariants are used to construct radially confined Vlasov equilibria Fb(CL, Ch, C 2) for an intense relativistic electron beam propagating in the z-direction. Examples of both solid and hollow beam equilibria are considered, and it is shown that the transverse wiggler field can have a large modulational influence on the beam envelope, {{depending on the size of}} SB/Bo and other parameters. In the present work, no a priori assumption is made that the gyrofrequency (we = eBo/-'bmc) of electron motion in the guide field and the frequency of axial electron motion (L = koVb...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of magnetic fields in closed regions of solar and stellar coronae are investigated with a reduced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) {{model in the}} framework of Parker scenario for coronal heating. A novel analysis of reduced MHD equilibria shows that their magnetic fields have an asymmetric structure in the axial direction with variation length-scale z_ℓ∼ℓ B_ 0 /b, where B_ 0 is the intensity of the strong <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> field, b that of the orthogonal magnetic field component, and ℓ the scale of b. Equilibria are then quasi-invariant along the axial direction for variation scales larger than approximatively the loop length z_ℓ≳ L_z, and increasingly more asymmetric for smaller variation scales z_ℓ≲ L_z. The critical length z_ℓ∼ L_z corresponds to the magnetic field intensity threshold b ∼ℓ B_ 0 /L_z. Magnetic fields stressed by photospheric motions cannot develop strong axial asymmetries. Therefore fields with intensities below such threshold evolve quasi-statically, readjusting to a nearby equilibrium, without developing nonlinear dynamics nor dissipating energy. But stronger fields cannot access their corresponding asymmetric equilibria, hence they are out-of-equilibrium and develop nonlinear dynamics. The subsequent formation of current sheets and energy dissipation is necessary for the magnetic field to relax to equilibrium, since dynamically accessible equilibria have variation scales larger than the loop length z_ℓ≳ L_z, with intensities smaller than the threshold b ≲ℓ B_ 0 /L_z. The dynamical implications for magnetic fields of interest to solar and stellar coronae are investigated numerically and the impact on coronal physics discussed.

40|$|A 1 D {{nonlinear}} {{theory of}} a free electron laser (FEL) with a helical wiggler and an <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> magnetic field is developed based on averaged equations of the electron motion. By averaging we separated two different cases of the e-beam/rf-wave interaction. The first one corresponds to the traditional wiggler synchronism (resonance) of rf wave with the electrons moving along stationary helical trajectories. The second one corresponds to combination resonances distinguishing by excitation of oscillation of the electrons near the stationary helical trajectory. Comparative analysis of the FEL operation in different regimes has been studied under the traditional wiggler synchronism condition. It was shown that FELs operated far from cyclotron resonance (including a reversed guide field orientation) possess low sensitivity to the initial velocity spread in the driving beam resulting in high electron efficiency. In contrast, under the weak guide field (the gyrofrequency {{is less than the}} bounce frequency) of a conventional orientation, the FEL efficiency is restricted by {{a significant increase in the}} transverse velocity of the electrons during the interaction with the rf wave that results in violation of the synchronism conditions and is accompanied by electron current losses. An additional mechanism of FEL efficiency enhancement under the conventional guide field orientation in the conditions when the gyrofrequency is higher than the bounce frequency, based on the dependence of the effective mass of the oscillating electrons on their energy, was demonstrated. Results of the theoretical analysis are compared with the results of experimental studies of FEL oscillators. The specific features of energy extraction from the electron beam under condition of an abnormal Doppler effect in the case of the combination resonance are described. This regime is beneficial to increase radiation frequency keeping wiggler period and electron energies...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the {{performance}} analysis of an annular diffuser is presented. In a typical industrial gas turbine diffuser, {{a certain number}} of structural members, called struts, serve both as load bearings support and as passages for cooling air and lubricant oil. Measurements were made in a 35 % scaled down model of a PGT 10 gas turbine exhaust diffuser with and without struts {{in order to determine the}} total and static pressure development and the effect of struts on both the local phenomena and the overall performance. More realistic flow conditions are made available by a ring of 24 <b>axial</b> <b>guide</b> vanes at inlet, which represent the last turbine rotor. The model has been tested on a wind tunnel facility developed at the University of Perugia with inlet speed around 80 m/s, allowing satisfactory accuracy for flow measurements and similarity with the PGT 10 diffuser in terms of Reynolds number. Static pressure taps located at various streamwise positions on the hub and the casing allowed the estimation of pressure recovery development. A Pitot tube and a hot split-film anemometer were used to determine static and total pressure inside the diffuser at different axial positions. The comparison between the two cases, with and without the struts, was made also by the use of global parameters, which correlate static and total pressure. In a previous paper, a detailed three-dimensional analysis of the flow path inside the diffuser was presented and the detrimental effect of the struts, in terms of flow separation and unsteadiness, was discussed. The stationary flow measurements and the investigation of the diffuser without the struts are presented in this paper. The whole research project represent a complete diffuser investigation available to develop an optimal design and to advance the computational and design tools for gas turbine exhaust diffusers...|$|E
