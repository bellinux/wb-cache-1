40|$|Objective To {{design a}} cadaveric model for AO type C 3 {{fracture}} of distal radius and {{to evaluate the}} <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> transmission pattern on the model fixed with dorsal plating. Methods A cadaveric model for biomechanical study on fixation methods for AO type C 3 fractures of distal radius was designed and produced, and its efficacy was assessed. Results 100 N <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> was found to produce only a 1 to 2 mm axial shortening in the intact specimen, and the deformation was elastic. The <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> transmission through intact radius was 83. 82 %of the total distal <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> A model of uniform AO type C 3 distal radius fracture was successfully created in seven cadaveric forearms. After fixation of the fracture with dorsal plating, <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> transmission through radius was 75. 64 %of the total distal <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> Conclusion A standardized AO type C 3 fracture of distal radius can be reproduced with good reproducibility of the setup and results of this model.

Most {{roller bearings}} only take radial or <b>axial</b> <b>loads,</b> but tapered roller bearings support both radial and <b>axial</b> <b>loads,</b> and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. Tapered roller bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, tapered roller bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the tapered roller is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|E

To this purpose, the behaviour of three identical specimens tested under different <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> values is analysed and compared in terms of ultimate capacity and deformation behaviour. Results show significant variations of the joint stiffness at increasing drift values and, moreover, that the main source of deformability moves from the beam to the joint panel when the <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> decreases.
