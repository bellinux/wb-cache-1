In this paper, we present a technique for managing replicated database involving numerical data such as quantity of items in stock control or reservation system. We classify such numerical data into two classes, indistinguishable and distinguishable object quantity. The main idea of our approach is to apply concept of quota assignment on replica usage to improve <b>availability</b> and <b>performance</b> while still maintaining acceptable consistency. With the concept of quota calculated by statistical analysis of replica usage and transactions in the system, our experiment shown that we can tradeoff between <b>performance,</b> <b>availability</b> and consistency...|$|R

50|$|MOE is {{a measure}} of Operator Performance only, {{regardless}} of the type of machine or the speed of the machine he is working on. MOE only measures the operator's ability to keep the machine running continuously (load and unload parts faster that the automatic cycle time of the machine). The MOE rating of an operator will travel with him as he moves from one machine to another. This is easily accomplished because the MOE rating is a universal calculation of time and not reliant on the complex OEE calculations of Loading, <b>Availability,</b> <b>Performance,</b> and quality.|$|E

30|$|The {{availability}} {{performances of}} both FSO links and RF links significantly depend on meteorological conditions. Low atmospheric visibility causes the deep attenuation of optical {{light on the}} FSO links while heavy rain events, snow events, and rain with snow events cause deep attenuation on the RF links. Therefore, fog events {{have a significant impact}} on the <b>availability</b> <b>performance</b> of FSO links while rain events {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>availability</b> <b>performance</b> of RF links. The concurrent occurrence of dense fog events and heavy rain events are seldom. Therefore, hybrid FSO/RF systems which consist of an FSO link backed up by an RF link can achieve higher link <b>availability</b> <b>performance</b> than a separate FSO or RF link due to the fact that the RF part of hybrid FSO/RF system may mitigate the influence of dense fog events and the FSO part can mitigate heavy rain events [18, 19].|$|E
