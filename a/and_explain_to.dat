5|$|The {{recruitment}} of Rookwood, Tresham and Digby {{coincided with a}} series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured. Fawkes would escape to the continent <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic powers what had happened in England.|$|E

The Mecha use David’s {{memories}} to reconstruct the Swinton home <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him that they cannot make him human. However, David insists that they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of hair. The Mecha warn David that the clone can only live for a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.|$|E
5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented expert report, and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him that she just does not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
25|$|In Buenos Aires and Salta {{electronic}} voting machines {{were used to}} print out a single unified ballot, with voters able to select different candidates and parties on a touch screen. Other municipalities such as Bariloche opted for a non-electronic single unified ballot. Opposition candidates, including Sergio Massa, Mauricio Macri and Margarita Stolbizer called for the nationwide implementation of a unified ballot and/or {{electronic voting}}, though Massa in particular was more cautious, saying it was more realistic for such a system to be implemented by 2017. The authority in charge of regulating elections rejected changing the system within 2015 since they claimed {{it would be too}} short term to implement the changes <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the public how the new system works.|$|E
25|$|During World War II and {{for many}} years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to {{hospitals}} to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them {{that the loss of}} a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his prosthetic leg his whole life. In 1946 Capp created a special full-color comic book, Al Capp by Li'l Abner, to be distributed by the Red Cross to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp was also involved with the Sister Kenny Foundation, which pioneered new treatments for polio in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fund-raising appeals, and entertained crippled and paraplegic children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories and sketches.|$|E

500|$|The plots for Bedsitcom were {{devised by}} a team of writers (led by Rob Gibbons, Neil Gibbons and {{producer}} Matt Crook) located in a garage {{on the ground floor of}} the apartment building that the contestants were staying in. The writers would often appear on screen <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the TV audience what their intention for each episode was. They communicated with Ash, Gibbon and Jones either by ringing them on their mobile phones, or by calling them downstairs to speak to them in person. They would occasionally change their plans for an episode—in [...] "Worst Case Scenario", for example, the writers altered their storyline from having Mel bring various animals into the flat to having the group kill Mel's goldfish after only one night.|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1947, Cameron {{travelled}} from New York to Paris aboard the SS America {{with the intention of}} studying art at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, which she hoped would admit her with a letter of recommendation from Pasadena's Art Center School. She also wanted to visit England and meet with Crowley <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him Parsons' Babalon Working. [...] Cameron learned upon her arrival in Paris that Crowley had died and that she had not been admitted to the college. She found post-war Paris [...] "extreme and bleak", befriended Juliette Gréco, and spent three weeks in Switzerland before returning home. When Cameron developed catalepsy, Parsons suggested that she read Sylvan Muldoon's books on astral projection and encouraged her to read James Frazer's The Golden Bough, Heinrich Zimmer's The King and the Corpse, and Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Although she still did not accept Thelema, she became increasingly interested in the occult, and in particular the use of the tarot.|$|E
500|$|The boys readily {{admit to}} the spray painting, <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> {{the city council}} that the word [...] "fag" [...] is not {{intended}} as an insult to homosexuals, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle, or [...] "an inconsiderate douchebag", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community (who realize that the boys weren't intending to insult them, but in fact, the bikers), results in a town ordinance declaring {{a change in the}} word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity {{from the rest of the}} nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as [...] "fags" [...] (one rider even assaulted a news reporter for calling him fag to his face three times). They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant [...] "an unpleasant old woman" [...] and a bundle of sticks.|$|E

500|$|Many {{instances}} in the episode were character-driven. The {{action of the}} Angel to torture Amy [...] "for fun" [...] was met with anger from the Doctor but also gave him courage to defeat the Angels and save Amy. Moffat stated that in the scene in which the Doctor must {{figure out how to}} save Amy {{in a matter of seconds}} he was [...] "very basic...very pure, simple Doctor" [...] and did not have time to comfort Amy because his compassion would get in the way of his thinking process. River was also meant to understand this <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> Amy that he needed to think. Moffat believed that Amy was [...] "passionate and a fighter and...also really smart" [...] which he showcased in the scene where Amy could not open her eyes for more than a second but was determined to do it for less than one. Moffat also believed that Amy's decision to attempt to seduce the Doctor was consistent with the character he had built up from her first episode. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment", although Moffat later admitted he regretted the way he wrote the scene, saying [...] "I played it for laughs, and it was so wrong". The Doctor's reaction was intended to be a reflection of how he often acted embarrassed and flustered when women behaved that way.|$|E
500|$|Votta {{criticized the}} show for the [...] "pointless adult love triangle" [...] {{involving}} Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins. VanDerWerff described Jones as [...] "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her [...] "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State". Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be about kids {{who are looking for}} approval and the various ways they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages. Chaney thought that Sue [...] "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that [...] "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly". This last point did not sit well with Berk, who wrote that the show resolved [...] "what was {{one of the more interesting}} subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have [...] "more with Burt". As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to [...] "leap through the television <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" [...] to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself [...] "sick" [...] of that plot thread, which he called [...] "just plain moronic".|$|E

In 1993, in order to defend <b>and</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> the population at large his free market reforms, he ran a testimonial presidential campaign as an independent.
