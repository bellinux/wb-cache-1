30|$|To {{reduce the}} high PAPR in OFDM, {{a number of}} {{approaches}} have been proposed. The existing solutions are broadly classified into two categories: receiver-dependent schemes and receiver-independent schemes. Receiver-dependent schemes transmit a PAPR reduction signal including <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> At the receiver side, the transmitted signal can be decoded using the <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> Typically, the tone reservation (TR) [3], selective mapping (SLM) [4], and partial transmit sequence (PTS) [5] are receiver-dependent schemes. However, the inclusion of <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> in receiver-dependent schemes will cause {{a reduction in the}} data rate. Furthermore, to enable the use of <b>additional</b> <b>information,</b> the receiver structure should be modified to restore the PAPR reduction signals.|$|R
