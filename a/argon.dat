5|$|<b>Argon</b> is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. <b>Argon</b> is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an <b>argon</b> atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. <b>Argon</b> is also used in incandescent, fluorescent lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. <b>Argon</b> makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. <b>Argon</b> is also used in fluorescent glow starters.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{constitutes}} 0.934% {{by volume}} and 1.288% by {{mass of the}} Earth's atmosphere, and air is the primary industrial source of purified <b>argon</b> products. <b>Argon</b> is isolated from air by fractionation, most commonly by cryogenic fractional distillation, a process that also produces purified nitrogen, oxygen, neon, krypton and xenon. The Earth's crust and seawater contain 1.2 ppm and 0.45 ppm of <b>argon,</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> has {{approximately}} the same solubility in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. <b>Argon</b> is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. <b>Argon</b> is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid {{air in a}} cryogenic air separation unit; a process that separates liquid nitrogen, which boils at 77.3K, from <b>argon,</b> which boils at 87.3K, and liquid oxygen, which boils at 90.2K. About 700,000 tonnes of <b>argon</b> are produced worldwide every year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is {{used for}} thermal {{insulation}} in energy-efficient windows. <b>Argon</b> is also used in technical scuba diving to inflate a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{is used in}} some {{high-temperature}} {{industrial processes}} where ordinarily non-reactive substances become reactive. For example, an <b>argon</b> atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, or as a means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. <b>Argon</b> is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, <b>argon</b> also enhances shelf life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{is used to}} {{displace}} oxygen- and moisture-containing air in packaging material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (<b>argon</b> has the European food additive code E938). Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade the products are retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in <b>argon.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. <b>Argon</b> is preferred for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. <b>Argon</b> gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{may be used}} as the {{inert gas}} within Schlenk lines and gloveboxes. <b>Argon</b> is {{preferred}} to less expensive nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Incandescent {{lights are}} filled with <b>argon,</b> to {{preserve}} the filaments at high temperature from oxidation. It {{is used for the}} specific way it ionizes and emits light, such as in plasma globes and calorimetry in experimental particle physics. Gas-discharge lamps filled with pure <b>argon</b> provide lilac/violet light; with <b>argon</b> and some mercury, blue light. <b>Argon</b> is also used for blue and green argon-ion lasers.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} <b>argon</b> in the Earth's {{atmosphere}} is radiogenic argon-40, derived from the decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust. In the universe, argon-36 {{is by far the}} most common <b>argon</b> isotope, being the preferred <b>argon</b> isotope produced by stellar nucleosynthesis in supernovas.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but <b>argon</b> {{is by far the}} cheapest. <b>Argon</b> is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but <b>argon</b> is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of <b>argon</b> applications arise simply because it is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> has {{electronic}} properties (ionization {{and/or the}} emission spectrum) desirable for some applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> has low thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolAr and atomic number18. It is in group 18 of {{the periodic table}} and is a noble gas. <b>Argon</b> is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It {{is more than twice}} as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv). <b>Argon</b> is the most abundant noble gas in Earth's crust, comprising 0.00015% of the crust.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is a {{chemically}} inert gas.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is {{sometimes}} used for extinguishing fires where valuable equipment may be damaged by water or foam.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is the {{cheapest}} alternative when nitrogen is not sufficiently inert.|$|E
5|$|Blue <b>argon</b> lasers {{are used}} in surgery to weld arteries, destroy tumors, and correct eye defects.|$|E
5|$|For some {{of these}} processes, the {{presence}} of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. <b>Argon</b> is used in some types of arc welding such as {{gas metal arc welding}} and gas tungsten arc welding, {{as well as in the}} processing of titanium and other reactive elements. An <b>argon</b> atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium.|$|E
5|$|In {{incandescent}} light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to <b>argon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with <b>argon</b> in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} <b>argon.</b> Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill incandescent lamps to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Suit {{inflation}} gas may {{be carried}} in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes <b>argon</b> is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may {{also need to be}} colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as <b>argon</b> is an asphyxiant.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>argon</b> is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of <b>argon</b> tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage and handling.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> {{has also}} been used {{experimentally}} to replace nitrogen in the breathing or decompression mix known as Argox, to speed the elimination of dissolved nitrogen from the blood.|$|E
5|$|<b>Argon</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as the}} propellant in aerosol cans for such products as varnish, polyurethane, and paint, and to displace air when preparing a container for storage after opening.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using <b>argon.</b> Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of <b>argon.</b> These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to <b>argon</b> to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|Diving gases, {{including}} compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and <b>argon,</b> are non-toxic, non flammable, {{and may be}} oxidizer or asphyxiant, and {{are rated}} in Transport category 3.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{the first}} comet where the noble gas <b>argon</b> was detected. Noble gases are {{chemically}} inert and highly volatile, and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures, {{they can be used}} for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices. Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16–20K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance, while <b>argon</b> with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance. Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale–Bopp has always been colder than 35–40K, but has at some point been warmer than 20K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in <b>argon</b> than generally believed, this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud.|$|E
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. <b>Argon</b> {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid <b>argon</b> is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in gas chromatography, as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and <b>argon</b> are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|In winemaking, <b>argon</b> {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of {{activities}} to provide a barrier against oxygen at the liquid surface, which can spoil wine by fueling both microbial metabolism (as with acetic acid bacteria) and standard redox chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Krypton atoms {{chemically}} {{bound to}} other nonmetals (hydrogen, chlorine, carbon) {{as well as}} some late transition metals (copper, silver, gold) have also been observed, but only either at low temperatures in noble gas matrices, or in supersonic noble gas jets. Similar conditions were used to obtain the first few compounds of <b>argon</b> in 2000, such as <b>argon</b> fluorohydride (HArF), and some bound to the late transition metals copper, silver, and gold. As of 2007, no stable neutral molecules involving covalently bound helium or neon are known.|$|E
5|$|Neon, <b>argon,</b> krypton, and xenon are {{obtained}} from air using {{the methods of}} liquefaction of gases, to convert elements to a liquid state, and fractional distillation, to separate mixtures into component parts. Helium is typically produced by separating it from natural gas, and radon is isolated from the radioactive decay of radium compounds. The prices of the noble gases are influenced by their natural abundance, with <b>argon</b> being the cheapest and xenon the most expensive. As an example, the adjacent table lists the 2004 prices in the United States for laboratory quantities of each gas.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases, having {{complete}} electron shells, defied reaction {{with other}} elements until 1962 when Neil Bartlett reported synthesis of xenon hexafluoroplatinate; xenon difluoride, tetrafluoride, hexafluoride, and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then. Among other noble gases, krypton forms a difluoride, and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be radon difluoride. Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable: <b>argon</b> and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give <b>argon</b> fluorohydride. Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides, and no neon fluoride {{has ever been}} observed; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.|$|E
