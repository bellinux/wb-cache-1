5|$|I’m single. For {{the first}} time in my life, I’m really {{experiencing}} what that’s like because I used to always feel the need to be in a relationship; I didn’t like being alone. But this time I’m realizing that people come into your life for a season, and my last relationship served its purpose. I can’t sit here and cry <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> it ended right where it should have. A lot of that stuff is on the album.|$|E
5|$|The first kingdom's {{government}} {{consisted of}} the king (styled Malikum) and the grand vizier, who headed a council of elders (Abbu) and the administration. The second kingdom was a monarchy, but little is known <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> {{of a lack of}} written records. The third kingdom was a city-state monarchy with reduced importance under the authority of Yamhad.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and economic integration with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that {{it could}} be in anywise {{necessary}} to consider <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,--"well--no.

25|$|The major {{ecosystems}} include mangrove and {{freshwater swamps}} and marshes, sedge prairie, pine savanna, and gallery forest. There is a diverse amount of flora, estimated at over 2,000 species of vascular plants, although {{little has been}} written <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> many species are new or undiscovered.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
25|$|During the Pyrrhic War (280–275 BC) the Lucanians and Bruttii {{sided with}} Pyrrhus and {{provided}} contingents which fought with his army. When Pyrrhus landed in Italy {{the people of}} Rhegion were worried about their safety and asked Rome for protection. The Romans sent soldiers from Campania to garrison the city. Coveting {{the wealth of the}} city, the soldiers killed its prominent men, sent away the rest and seized their property. The Romans could not do much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> they were engaged in the war. A few {{years after the end of}} the war, in 271 BC, the Romans retook the city, arrested the soldiers and took them to Rome, where they were executed. After Pyrrhus was defeated, to avoid Roman revenge, the Bruttii submitted willingly and gave up half of the Sila, a mountainous plateau which was valuable for its pitch and timber. The timber here was sold all over Italy and the resin of the area was of the highest quality.|$|E

500|$|Arguably the {{highlight}} of the year was the defeat of the Centre Praying Colonels by a score of 24 to 0. It was Centre's first loss to a southern team since 1916. A story goes that tackle Bill Fincher sought to knock Centre quarterback [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin out of the game, taking with him brass-knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> {{you are not going to}} be in there very longabout three minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|Then in August 2010, Moroccan {{producer}} RedOne {{was interviewed}} by the BBC. In the interview, he revealed {{he had been working}} on Scherzinger's album. [...] "I just finished her album. Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers, like fast food. One from McDonald's, one from Burger King, and so on. It tasted good, but it wasn't consistent. Her new record– people are really going to go crazy <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's the real her." [...] Scherzinger's boyfriend Lewis Hamilton selected [...] "Poison" [...] as the album's first single. It debuted on her official YouTube account on October 14, 2010.|$|E
500|$|McMillin {{also had}} his only loss {{to a team}} from the South, to Georgia Tech by a 20–0 score. Tech tackle Bill Fincher {{reportedly}} tried to knock McMillin {{out of the game}} with brass knuckles or [...] "something equally diabolical." [...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> {{you are not going to}} be in there very long—about three minutes." [...] The Atlanta Constitution reported, [...] "McMillin's forward passes outdid anything of the kind seen here in many years, but Tech seemed to know where they were going". According to one writer, [...] "Even the great [...] "Bo" [...] McMillin was powerless against the Tech players".|$|E
500|$|Dubbing [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of her career, singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as [...] "very exciting, a little terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming". On recording the song, Mollenhauer said, [...] "The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel. I get choked up every time I talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> I think it's such a beautiful moment." [...] Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses, it was mandatory that Mollenhauer's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore's husky speaking voice [...] "seamlessly." [...] Mollenhauer's performance of [...] "Someday" [...] is featured on the re-release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E

The music video was shot in [...] "guerrilla-style", utilizing hand-held cameras to shoot many of the scenes. Shakira talked about the video, saying [...] "I decided to just do something more spontaneous, and be myself and be free and feel free <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> that is what this song is about". The music video was released on 29 September 2010, and the Spanish and English versions of the video were individually released on iTunes on 11 October 2010, and 13 October 2010, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick Cotton, played by John Altman would return to EastEnders in Christmas 2008.

Introduced as a guest character by Santer she made her first appearance on 25 December 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} not about the real life [...] "Son of Sam", serial killer David Berkowitz. Smith explained, [...] "It's not about the serial killer. I'm not sure exactly what <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> just sort of like telling someone a dream you had last night. There are some {{destructive}} figures in it, 'Son of Sam', Shiva... but Shiva's also associated with creativity... I'm not sure... it's just an impressionistic song about destruction and creativity, I guess, if <b>it's</b> <b>about</b> anything." ...|$|R
60|$|They sat down, and Mr. Direck {{opened his}} case. He was shy and clumsy <b>about</b> opening <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> {{he had been}} {{thinking}} dreadfully hard <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and he hated to seem heavy or profound or anything but artless and spontaneous to Cecily. And he felt even when he did open his case {{that the effect of}} it was platitudinous and disappointing. Yet when he had thought it out it had seemed very profound and altogether living.|$|R
500|$|... "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)", is {{a remake}} of [...] "A Tout le Monde" [...] which {{originally}} appeared on the 1994 album Youthanasia. The song is a more uptempo version of the original song, and features Lacuna Coil vocalist Cristina Scabbia singing backing vocals. Scabbia stated she was [...] "really surprised <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> 'A Tout le Monde' is a song that I've always loved. It was a big surprise {{for me to get}} this invitation—I was really honored to be part of it." [...] Mustaine chose Scabbia over three other choices because of her [...] "reign in the heavy metal business". Mustaine later stated that he originally intended for the song to be a B-side for Japan, but the president of Roadrunner Records (Megadeth's label for this release) wanted [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)" [...] released as the album's first single.|$|E

A day later, Grande discussed the video's concept and said that it was [...] "the coolest concept ever and he killed it and it's very different. I'm very nervous <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's so unique and weird and I feel like brave and different, but it’s exciting".|$|E
