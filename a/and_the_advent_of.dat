5|$|Cheddar is {{recognised}} as a village. The adjacent {{settlement of}} Axbridge, although {{only about a}} third the population of Cheddar, is a town. This apparently illogical situation is explained by the relative importance of the two places in historic times. While Axbridge grew in importance as a centre for cloth manufacturing in the Tudor period and gained a charter from King John, Cheddar remained a more dispersed mining and dairy-farming village. Its population grew {{with the arrival of the}} railways in the Victorian era <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> tourism.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s, {{there has}} been a marked decline in crowd trouble at matches, as a result of stricter policing, CCTV in grounds <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> all-seater stadia. In 2007, the club {{launched}} the 'Back to the Shed' campaign to improve the atmosphere at home matches, with notable success. According to Home Office statistics, 126 Chelsea fans were arrested for football-related offences during the 2009â€“10 season, the third highest in the division, and 27 banning orders were issued, the fifth-highest in the division.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of lesser Hyksos kings in Egypt is currently debated. Ryholt {{has shown that}} a statement in Eusebius' epitome of the Aegyptiaca indicating that the Hyksos had vassals contains a corruption of Manetho's original text. Thus, he rejects {{the hypothesis that the}} 16th Dynasty comprised vassals of the Hyksos and maintains instead that it was a native Egyptian dynasty independently reigning over the Theban region between the fall of the 13th Dynasty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> the 17th Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The {{trading area}} is {{surrounded}} by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined {{the walls of the}} trading hall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> electronic trading resulted in computers being placed on desktops.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of templates into the C++ programming language, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> generic programming techniques pioneered by the Standard Template Library, {{the need for a}} mechanism for obtaining the type of an expression, commonly referred to as typeof, was recognized. In generic programming, it is often difficult or impossible to express types that depend on template parameters, in particular the return type of function template instantiations.|$|E
5|$|After {{requiring}} all Social Credit Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) to sign loyalty oaths to it, the Social Credit Board {{proceeded to}} recommend radical legislation regulating banking, taxing banks, and restricting {{freedom of the}} press and access to courts. Most of this legislation was either disallowed by the federal government or ruled ultra vires (beyond the powers of) the province by the Supreme Court of Canada; these defeats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> World War II made the Social Credit Board increasingly irrelevant. In its later years it became highly anti-Semitic, and it was dissolved by the government of Ernest Manning in 1948.|$|E

5|$|During World WarII, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{established}} several {{operational training}} units (OTUs) to convert recently graduated pilots from advanced trainers to combat aircraft, and to add fighting ability to the flying skills {{they had already}} learned. Post-war demobilisation saw the disbandment of these OTUs, and operational conversion of new pilots became the responsibility of front-line squadrons. This practice impacted upon the squadrons' standard duties, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War and introduction of jet aircraft further necessitated a more formal training system. The Air Force's initial move in this direction was to re-establish No.2 (Fighter) Operational Training Unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, in March 1952; it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit in September 1958.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Madsen's influential monograph, Allosauridae became the preferred family assignment, but it too was not strongly defined. Semi-technical works used Allosauridae {{for a variety of}} large theropods, usually those that were larger and better-known than megalosaurids. Typical theropods that were thought to be related to Allosaurus included Indosaurus, Piatnitzkysaurus, Piveteausaurus, Yangchuanosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Chilantaisaurus, Compsosuchus, Stokesosaurus, and Szechuanosaurus. Given modern knowledge of theropod diversity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> cladistic study of evolutionary relationships, none of these theropods is now recognized as an allosaurid, although several, like Acrocanthosaurus and Yangchuanosaurus, are members of closely related families.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} Wars of the Roses, a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the Wars of the Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> early modern Britain.|$|E

5|$|Belief in {{the medieval}} {{tradition}} of the Trojan War that followed Dictys and Dares survived the Revival of Learning in the Renaissance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> the first English translation of the Iliad {{in the form of}} Chapman's Homer. (Shakespeare used both Homer and Lefevre as sources for his Troilus.) However the two supposedly eye-witness accounts were finally discredited by Jacob Perizonius {{in the early years of}} the 18th century. With the chief source for his portrayal as one of the most active warriors of the Trojan War undermined, Troilus has become an optional character in modern Trojan fiction, except for those that retell the love story itself. Lindsay Clarke and Phillip Parotti, for example, omit Troilus altogether. Hilary Bailey includes a character of that name in Cassandra: Princess of Troy but little remains of the classical or medieval versions except that he fights Diomedes. However, some of the over sixty re-tellings of the Trojan War since 1916 do feature the character.|$|E
5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{at the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of overpopulation, land shortages and depleted soils. The Great Famine shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population. The agricultural sector shrank rapidly, with higher wages, lower prices and diminishing profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> the modern farming system centring on the charging of cash rents for lands. As returns on land fell, many estates, and in some cases entire settlements, were simply abandoned, and nearly 1,500 villages were deserted during this period. A new class of gentry emerged who rented farms from the major nobility. Unsuccessful government attempts were made to regulate wages and consumption, but these largely collapsed in the decades following the Peasants' Revolt of 1381.|$|E
5|$|Economic growth {{began to}} falter {{by the end}} of the 13th century, owing to a {{combination}} of over-population, land shortages and depleted soils. The loss of life in the Great Famine of 1315â€“17 shook the English economy severely and population growth ceased; the first outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 then killed around half the English population, with major implications for the post-plague economy. The agricultural sector shrank, with higher wages, lower prices and shrinking profits leading to the final demise of the old demesne system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>advent</b> <b>of</b> the modern farming system of cash rents for lands. The Peasants Revolt of 1381 shook the older feudal order and limited the levels of royal taxation considerably for a century to come. The 15th century saw the growth of the English cloth industry and the establishment of a new class of international English merchant, increasingly based in London and the South-West, prospering at the expense of the older, shrinking economy of the eastern towns. These new trading systems brought about the end of many of the international fairs and the rise of the chartered company. Together with improvements in metalworking and shipbuilding, this represents the end of the medieval economy, and the beginnings of the early modern period in English economics.|$|E
