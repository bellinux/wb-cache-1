40|$|Rural {{health and}} {{government}} bodies {{have identified the}} need for greater numbers of health professionals in rural and remote health care settings. Providing students {{with the opportunity to}} experience a rural clinical placement has been suggested as one strategy for future health professionals to gain familiarity with the rural workplace and an <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities available in these areas. Although substantial numbers of student nurses have participated in a rural undergraduate clinical placement program at Queensland University of Technology since 1996, available places remain unfilled. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing student nurses in their choice of a rural or metropolitan clinical placement. This study utilised a descriptive survey design to collect pre-test data. The study {{was part of a larger}} project using a quasi-experimental pre-post test design.

40|$|Moves {{towards the}} marketisation of higher {{education}} together with concerns over the challenges of graduate employment have led to an increased prioritisation of students undertaking relevant work experience while they study. Recognising a strong student demand for placements, universities are establishing employability initiatives including those designed to increase the availability of quality paid placements for students. To complement this activity, industry, sector-specific, regional placement projects such as e-Placement Scotland, take an employer-led approach to maximise opportunities for students across a number of universities. In spite of these initiatives, not every student will successfully obtain a placement, and so e-Placement Scotland aims to 'add value' for students in various other ways. Interventions such as industry tech talks and speed networking sessions have been deployed to develop <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employment</b> landscape and encourage students {{to start thinking about}} their self-identification, easing their transition into the workplace. Adopting the lens of identity theory, this study explores student and professional identity in order to recognise the transition from student to graduate, and to consider the role of placement and other value-adding activities in that transition. The study found that, while the incidence of students self-identifying as professionals increases in later years of their courses, placement preparation interventions did no...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the factors that contributed the greatest to a student's decision to select either the Machine Tool Operation or Tool & Die Making diploma programs at Waukesha County Technical College. The research questions were focused in three major areas: the impact of past participation in technical education courses in high school on degree selection; the influence a person or an event may have had on a student's decision to enroll; and how an <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employment</b> opportunities available for graduates affected a student's decision making process. The intent of this study was to discover the items that had the greatest influence on these students and their decision for electing to enroll into one of these two program areas. This study was conducted through the use of a 13 -question survey administered to twenty-one (2 1) first year, full-time students who were enrolled in either the Machine Tool Operation or Tool & Die Making diploma programs at Waukesha County Technical College. Nineteen (19) students responded to the survey. The results of this research study reflect that an awareness ofthe available employment opportunities for graduates from these program areas seemed to have had the greatest influence on a student's decision to enroll in either the Machine Tool Operation or Tool & Die Making diploma programs at Waukesha County Technical College.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to investigate the}} job perceptions of permanent full-time workers and contingent workers of an organization of a large, national telecommunications company. The Hackman and Oldham Job Characteristics survey instrument was used to assess the job perceptions of permanent and contingent workers across jobs in a particular organization, where contingent workers worked alongside permanent workers. The survey instrument has traditionally been used to calculate the 2 ̆ 2 motivating potential 2 ̆ 2 of jobs. If one or more job characteristics was found to be deficient, the instrument enabled the user to identify the appropriate area requiring improvement. Rather than use the results to improve jobs, this research was aimed at shedding some light on the similarities and differences in job perceptions of permanent and contingent workers. ^ The research compared the job characteristics survey scores of permanent workers and contingent workers and tested the results for statistically significant differences. Tests of significance were also conducted on the following categories of data collected for the two types of workers: (1) sex, (2) age, (3) attained educational level, (4) job type, (5) job responsibility, and (6) time spent on job. ^ Nine hypotheses were tested in this study. The basic premise of the hypotheses was that between permanent and contingent workers there would be no significant difference in any of the JDS subscales for any category being investigated. ^ The research results were tested for significance using Student t statistics. ^ Contrary to the hypotheses, levels of {{significant differences were found between}} permanent and contingent workers for each of the categories used to profile data. ^ The results of the study indicate that job enrichment efforts should include an <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employment</b> category of the intended worker and should include a program of implementation and performance monitoring for greater effectiveness. The results of this study seem to indicate that the special attention devoted to contingent workers has a positive effect on the way they view their jobs. A lesson inferred from this is that managers should provide the same level of attention for their permanent workers [...] this may be beneficial for the workers as well as the organization. ...|$|E
