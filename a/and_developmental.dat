40|$|The {{determination}} of effective educational-therapeutic approaches {{of work with}} persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities, especially with persons with severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities, is {{of the utmost importance}} in order to improve their quality of life. The master’s thesis titled “The Influence Of The Snoezelen Approach On Persons With Moderate, Severe <b>And</b> Profound <b>Developmental</b> Disabilities” defines on the basis of theoretical findings snoezelen as an important educational-therapeutic approach for persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities. The aim of the research was to examine the effectiveness of the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach in the population of persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities. Specifically, we were interested in: -	the influence of the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach on persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities, on individual physiological, psychological as well as social areas of functioning of persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities like breathing, degree of movement, communication level, level of communication with assistant and behaviour; -	observations of professional staff {{of the effects of the}} theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach on persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities. Data for the study of the impact of the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach were gathered on a dedicated sample of persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities, based on observations of professional staff and their evaluation, and assessed on a purpose designed rating scale. In the same manner data for the assessment of perception of professional staff were gathered. Data processing was conducted on the basis of frequency distributions of generalia, frequency distributions of individual rating categories, basic descriptive statistics and the verification of all hypotheses and research questions with the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for dependent samples. The evaluation of the conducted research is presented in the chapters "Analysis of the influence of theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach on persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities in the context of individual physiological, psychological, and social categories, and the analysis of influential differences regarding the level of <b>developmental</b> disabilities <b>and</b> the age of assessed persons" and "Analysis of the views of professional staff about the possibilities of the influence of the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach on persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities". Based on the evaluation it can be concluded that the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach − very independently of the level of disability and age of persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities − positively affect the functioning of the mentioned persons in a way that enables them to experience and feel psychological-physical serenity and thereby eliminate or reduce occurring inappropriate forms of behaviour, as well as improve the quality of sensory processing and sensorimotor learning. In this way the theoretical findings of the snoezelen approach enable persons with moderate, severe <b>and</b> profound <b>developmental</b> disabilities to acquire habits, skills and knowledge faster and easier, which in return enhance their quality of life, and which can be defined as an effective educational-therapeutic approach for them. ...|$|R
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan in the leaves and plant stems.|$|E

5|$|Gregarious German {{cockroaches}} show different behavior when {{reared in}} isolation from when reared in a group. In one study, isolated cockroaches {{were less likely to}} leave their shelters and explore, spent less time eating, interacted less with conspecifics when exposed to them, and took longer to recognize receptive females. Because these changes occurred in many contexts, the authors suggested them as constituting a behavioral syndrome. These effects might have been due either to reduced metabolic <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> rates in isolated individuals or the fact that the isolated individuals hadn't had a training period to learn about what others were like via their antennae.|$|E

5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting of a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E
5|$|Some Australian {{politicians}} and defense commentators proposed that Australia {{should attempt to}} purchase F-22s instead of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22's known capabilities and F-35's delays <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> uncertainties. However, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) determined that the F-22 was unable to perform the F-35's strike and close air support roles. The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22 for its Replacement-Fighter program. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22, thus reducing engineering and staffing costs. However, in 2009 {{it was reported that}} acquiring the F-22 would require increases to the defense budget beyond the historical 1 percent of GDP. With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011. Israel also expressed interest, but eventually chose the F-35 because of the F-22's price and unavailability.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are deuterostomes, closely related, {{together}} {{with all other}} echinoderms, to chordates, and are used in reproductive <b>and</b> <b>developmental</b> studies. Female starfishs produce large numbers of oocytes that are easily isolated; these {{can be stored in}} a pre-meiosis phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of 1-methyladenine. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. Asterina pectinifera, used as a model organism for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.|$|E
