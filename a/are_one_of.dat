They are especially well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst {{allows it to}} reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most common}} marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, {{as well as their}} elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E

5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population.

This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the few fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
