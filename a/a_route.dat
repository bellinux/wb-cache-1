5|$|Against this background, in 1768 a {{committee}} of men commissioned James Brindley to survey <b>a</b> <b>route,</b> {{in the form of}} a canal, between Taunton and Exeter; and the survey was duly carried out by Robert Whitworth in 1769. This was to have been called the Exeter to Uphill Canal; as it involved <b>a</b> <b>route</b> from Topsham or Exeter to Taunton, then the use of the River Tone and a second canal from Burrow Bridge, via Bridgwater, Glastonbury, Wells and Axbridge, to Uphill, near Weston-super-Mare. Nothing further came of the plan until the 1790s, when various canal engineers were consulted, and in 1794 John Rennie was asked by a different committee, the Grand Western Canal Committee, to make another survey, which was adopted, and formed the basis for a planned Act of Parliament. Opposition from the City of Exeter, who feared it would compete with the Exeter Canal for transportation of coal, was eventually softened; and the Act was passed on 24 March 1796.|$|E
5|$|Although the A303 as a {{whole is}} {{designed}} to be part of <b>a</b> <b>route</b> from London to Exeter, a popular alternative is to take the M4 motorway to Bristol, followed by the M5. Although this is a high-quality motorway route throughout, it is a considerably further distance.|$|E

50|$|YRT routes {{operated}} by the TTC on behalf of York Region allow passengers to board a TTC bus in York Region and disembark in Toronto and vice versa. Though considered <b>a</b> single <b>route</b> by both agencies, passengers crossing Steeles Avenue on a TTC bus must pay separate fares for the portion north of Steeles Avenue (where the bus is operated as <b>a</b> YRT <b>route)</b> and south of Steeles Avenue (where the bus operates as <b>a</b> TTC <b>route).</b> This means that passengers effectively transfer between <b>a</b> TTC <b>route</b> and <b>a</b> YRT <b>route</b> {{of the same name}} and number at Steeles Avenue.|$|R

5|$|From 1768 {{there were}} a number of grand schemes proposed, all with the aim of linking the Bristol Channel to the English Channel by a waterway, thereby {{avoiding}} the need to navigate by sea around Cornwall and Devon. James Brindley was the first to survey <b>a</b> <b>route,</b> which would have run from the Bristol Channel to Exeter, following the course of the River Tone for part of its route. In 1769, Robert Whitworth looked at a shorter route from Bridgwater Bay to Seaton, following the River Parrett and the River Axe. He was asked to reassess the route in the 1790s. William Jessop surveyed <b>a</b> <b>route</b> between Taunton and Exeter in 1794, while another group proposed a canal linking Bristol, Nailsea, Bridgwater and Taunton, which was surveyed by William White. Jessop's assistant, Josiah Easton, suggested <b>a</b> <b>route</b> from Uphill (on the Bristol Channel) to Seaton, again in 1794, and the previous two schemes sought parliamentary approval as the Grand Western Canal and the Bristol and Western Canal, respectively. Only the first was authorised, but the economic downturn caused by the Napoleonic Wars meant that construction did not begin immediately.|$|E
