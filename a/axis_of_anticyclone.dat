40|$|Marine animals, such as turtles, seabirds and pelagic fishes, are {{observed}} {{to travel and}} congregate around eddies in the open ocean. Mesoscale eddies, large swirling ocean vortices with radius scales of approximately 50 - 100 km, provide environmental variability that can structure these populations. In this study, we investigate the use of mesoscale eddies by 24 individual juvenile loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region. The influence of eddies on turtles is assessed by collocating the turtle trajectories to the tracks of mesoscale eddies identified in maps of sea level anomaly. Juvenile loggerhead sea turtles are {{significantly more likely to}} be located in the interiors <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones</b> in this region. The distribution of surface drifters in eddy interiors reveals no significant association with the interiors <b>of</b> cyclones or <b>anticyclones,</b> suggesting higher prevalence <b>of</b> turtles in <b>anticyclones</b> is a result of their behavior. In the southern portion of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence region, turtle swimming speed is significantly slower in the interiors <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> when compared to the periphery, suggesting that these turtles are possibly feeding on prey items associated with anomalously low near-surface chlorophyll concentrations observed in those features...|$|R

The geopotential height and zonal wind components of 1000, 500, 200, and 100 hPa in a 30 -year period (1971 – 2000) have been used to determine the spatial and temporal variations <b>of</b> the <b>anticyclone</b> centres, their monthly frequency and latitudinal axis variations during April–October.

In the lower levels, the Azores subtropical anticyclone is located at the east of North Atlantic. In the middle levels, the frequencies <b>of</b> <b>anticyclone</b> centre are concentrated over the northwest of Africa, Arabian Peninsula and Iranian Plateau.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of 3 point vortices, initially {{situated on the}} same circle of latitude {{on the surface of}} a rotating sphere, is studied under the assumption that the deviation in latitude is small. A linear stability analysis of the equilibrium motion is performed. The purpose of this work is to simulate and understand the motion <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones</b> and cyclones in the atmosphere: the results may help explain observed phenomena. Under certain boundary conditions a linear analysis shows that a ring of sub-tropical anti-cyclones is stable, however a ring of cyclones would be unstable. This result is due to the variation of Coriolis force with latitude over the surface of a sphere. The “p-plane” effect induces a rotation of a ring <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> but opposing the direction of rota-tion of a ring of cyclones. Unless the strength of the cyclonic vorticity is very strong, this effect causes instability in the system of cyclones. The arguments show that in the atmosphere an anticyclone system can exist at subtropical latitudes, whereas cyclonic vorticity will be confined to the polar regions. These results agree with the observed distribution of the major high and low pressure systems in the earth’s atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|Results from a {{new series}} of {{experiments}} on turbulent flows in a rotating circular container are presented. Electromagnetic forcing is applied to induce flow in a layer of fluid of constant depth. Continuously forced as well as decaying flows are investigated. Optical altimetry is used to measure the gradient of the surface elevation field and to obtain the velocity and vorticity fields with high temporal and spatial resolution. Spectral analysis of the flows demonstrates the formation of dual cascade with energy and enstrophy intervals although the corresponding spectral fluxes of energy and enstrophy are not uniform in these intervals. The energy interval is characterized by the slope of approximately - 5 / 3 in terms of wavenumber and is limited in extent by the finite radius of deformation effect. In the enstrophy range, the slope is steeper than - 3 due to the presence of long-lived coherent vortices. The spatial patterns of spectral fluxes in the flow indicate that inverse energy transfer and direct enstrophy transfer occur mainly in elongated vorticity patches. Cyclone/anticyclone asymmetry in favor <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones</b> is observed in our flows. Dominance <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones</b> is most clear during the decay phase <b>of</b> turbulence.

Calculations are also made to examine the regeneration, intrazonal and interscale interactions, and propagation rates of vortices. Vortex sets resembling the three main Jovian groups in scale, form, and number can be simultaneously generated and maintained in a steady configuration by a heating that produces stable westerly and weakly unstable easterly jets. The steady configuration occurs when an optimal number of vortices exists in a balance between a weak heating and a weak dissipation. Vortex behavior can be more complex in the heated system because the generation of new storms offsets the tendency to merge into fewer vortices. The solutions also show that intrazonal vortex interactions can lead, in some situations, to the destruction <b>of</b> <b>anticyclones</b> modeling the Great Red Spot. 1...|$|R
