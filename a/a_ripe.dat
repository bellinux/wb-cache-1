5|$|Ranulf of Chester {{remained}} {{upset over}} Stephen's {{gift of the}} north of England to Prince Henry. Ranulf devised a plan {{for dealing with the}} problem by ambushing Henry whilst the prince was travelling back from Stephen's court to Scotland after Christmas. Stephen responded to rumours of this plan by escorting Henry himself north, but this gesture proved the final straw for Ranulf. Ranulf had previously claimed that he had the rights to Lincoln Castle, held by Stephen, and under the guise of a social visit, Ranulf seized the fortification in a surprise attack. Stephen marched north to Lincoln and agreed to a truce with Ranulf, probably to keep him from joining the Empress's faction, under which Ranulf would be allowed to keep the castle. Stephen returned to London but received news that Ranulf, his brother and their family were relaxing in Lincoln Castle with a minimal guard force, <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> target for a surprise attack of his own. Abandoning the deal he had just made, Stephen gathered his army again and sped north, but not quite fast enough—Ranulf escaped Lincoln and declared his support for the Empress, and Stephen was forced to place the castle under siege.|$|E

25|$|Many famous {{artists have}} painted {{still life with}} peach fruits placed in prominence. Caravaggio, Vicenzo Campi, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Claude Monet, Édouard Manet, Henri Fantin-Latour, Severin Roesen, Peter Paul Rubens, Van Gogh are among the many {{influential}} artists who painted peaches and peach trees in various settings. Scholars suggest that many compositions are symbolic, some an effort to introduce realism. For example, Tresidder claims the artists of Renaissance symbolically used peach to represent heart, and a leaf attached to the fruit as the symbol for tongue, thereby implying speaking truth from one's heart; <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> peach was also a symbol to imply <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> state of good health. Caravaggio paintings introduce realism by painting peach leaves that are molted, discolored {{or in some cases}} have wormholes – conditions common in modern peach cultivation.|$|E

25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from <b>a</b> <b>ripe,</b> unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|Wometco {{founder and}} {{president}} Mitchell Wolfson died in 1983 and a long-rumored secret plan to run the company after his death was never found. Remaining Wolfson heirs {{had no desire to}} keep the company in the family, and it quickly unraveled, making it <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> takeover target. Investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. took over Wometco in 1984 in a $1 billion deal, the largest corporate buyout in history to that date. KKR sold most of Wometco's entertainment assets to the latter company's chief operating officer Arthur Hertz in 1985. With the cash from this sale, KKR then purchased Storer Broadcasting's station properties, shortly after the Federal Communications Commission raised the television station ownership limit from seven stations (with no more than five located on the VHF band) to twelve. KKR's intent was to sell the properties within a few years at a higher price.|$|E

It may be observed in our own climate at the present day in many women of fifty. It is a mistake to suppose that the difference between wisdom and folly has anything to do with the difference between physical age and physical youth. Some women are younger at seventy than most women at seventeen.|$|R
500|$|Fishers {{are one of}} the few predators {{that seek}} out and kill porcupines. There are stories in popular {{literature}} that fishers can flip a porcupine onto its back and [...] "scoop out its belly like <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> melon". This was identified as an exaggerated misconception as early as 1966. Observational studies show that fishers will make repeated biting attacks on the face of a porcupine and kill it after about 25–30 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Wallace {{described}} himself as being at first reluctant to try {{it because of the}} aroma, [...] "but in Borneo I found <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> fruit on the ground, and, eating it out of doors, I at once became a confirmed Durian eater." [...] He cited one traveller from 1599: [...] "it is of such an excellent taste that it surpasses in flavour all other fruits of the world, according to those who have tasted it." [...] He cites another writer: [...] "To those not used to it, it seems at first to smell like rotten onions, but immediately after they have tasted it they prefer it to all other food. The natives give it honourable titles, exalt it, and make verses on it." [...] Despite having tried many foods that are arguably more eccentric, Andrew Zimmern, host of Bizarre Foods, was unable to finish a durian upon sampling it, due to his intolerance of its strong taste.|$|E

[...] At times, when the tree bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies, emerald fruit beetles and cicadas in great numbers fly about, everything is immersed in pure blue. [...] Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the leaves take on violet tones something of the color of <b>a</b> <b>ripe</b> fig, and this violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon. [...] Sometimes, too, after a shower I've seen the whole sky pink and orange, which gave an exquisite value and coloring to the silvery gray-greens. [...] And among all this were women, also pink, who were gathering the fruit." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open at my feet like <b>a</b> <b>ripe,</b> juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, {{but he was already}} on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E
