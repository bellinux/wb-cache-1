40|$|Chronic <b>alcoholization</b> by alcohol {{inhalation}} {{was used}} to study the properties of magnesium, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, and CGP 39551, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on behavioural dependence as estimated by the free-choice paradigm [alcohol 10 % (v/v) vs. water), on the hypermotility after alcohol withdrawal, and finally on the cortical vascularization. The first experimental group received the drugs per os during the whole <b>alcoholization</b> period. Magnesium (20 mg/kg/day) decreased the alcohol dependence while CGP 39551 (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the dependence to alcohol. A second group of animals received the same drugs at the same dosages, not simultaneously during chronic <b>alcoholization,</b> but immediately after <b>alcoholization</b> in one shot i. p. injection. In this case, rats receiving 5 mg/kg CGP 39551 never showed any dependence towards alcohol, while 10 mg/kg CGP 39551 or 20 mg/kg magnesium prolonged {{the number of days}} of alcohol dependence. These results thus indicate the close interaction between NMDA receptor function and dependence for alcohol. Magnesium had no effects on hypermotility, while CGP 39551 -treated animals presented a decrease in the hypermotility observed after alcohol withdrawal.

40|$|Abstract — A {{growing number}} of studies have implicated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in acute and chronic <b>alcoholization</b> and in ethanol withdrawal. In order to study the ethanol/HPA axis {{interaction}} during alcohol withdrawal, we performed experiments using adrenalectomized (ADX) male rats alcoholized by a chronic pulmonary <b>alcoholization</b> procedure. Eight hours after the 3 weeks of the <b>alcoholization</b> procedure, the rats were evaluated for a tremor activity In order to reduce the great variability of the withdrawal tremors, we estimated the supersensitivity of the withdrawn rats to the tremorogenic compound harmine. We also studied the effect of a hydrocortisone treatment given in the drinking bottle during the <b>alcoholization</b> procedure on the harmine-induccd tremors of ADX and sham rats. Alcohol withdrawal resulted in increased tremor response to 10 mg/kg harmine, and a protective effect of adrenalectomy on this effect was observed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic ethanol {{administration}} {{results in}} neurobiological alterations {{similar to those}} observed after chronic cannabinoid exposure. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate alcohol drinking and the withdrawal responses after pulmonary chronic <b>alcoholization</b> with intraperitoneal or oral administration of a cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist. METHODS: The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716 A, 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally or orally, was administered to Wistar rats either during a 30 -day chronic ethanol exposure or at the cessation of this procedure. Motility was recorded during 18 hr after the cessation of chronic <b>alcoholization</b> just before the beginning of the free-choice paradigm (water versus alcohol 10 % v/v). RESULTS: A significant increase in ethanol preference was observed during the free-choice paradigm after chronic <b>alcoholization</b> with concurrent SR 141716 A administration (3 or 10 mg/kg/day). A significant decrease in withdrawal motility after administration of SR 141716 A was observed with only the highest dose (10 mg/kg/day). The administration of SR 141716 A, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day, after chronic pulmonary <b>alcoholization</b> significantly decreased the preference for alcohol. Finally, a significant decrease in ethanol preference was seen during the free-choice paradigm of nonalcoholized rats treated with SR 141716 A, 3 or 10 mg/kg/day, during 30 days before the free-choice paradigm. CONCLUSIONS: The concurrent administration of the CB 1 antagonist together with the chronic <b>alcoholization</b> increases the preference for ethanol. Also, the administration of the CB 1 antagonist after the chronic <b>alcoholization</b> or at the time of withdrawal drastically diminishes the ethanol preference...|$|E

It is shown that actomyosin K+-ATPase activity of skele­tal muscles increases from two months of ethanol use, but actomyosin Mg 2 +-ATPase activity decreases during 6 - 8 months of <b>alcoholization.</b> From two months of ethanol use the creatine kinase activity, as an enzyme marker of muscle tissue damage, statistically significantly increases during all {{the period of the}} animals <b>alcoholization.</b> The level of total lipid increases after two months of alcohol consumption (in blood plasma by 30 % and in erythrocyte mass by 65 %). For longer periods of <b>alcoholization</b> (4 - 8 months) the level of lipids remains almost the same, whereas in erythrocyte mass it does not differ from control values. The level of diene conjugates in the blood plasma reduces and the amount of ketone derivatives of fatty acid residues increases that points to the inhibition of some components of the antioxidant system that control detoxification of hydroperoxides of fatty acids and also to activation of free radical damage of tissues.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{analyze the}} {{efficacy}} of percutaneous transluminal septal <b>alcoholization</b> {{in the treatment of}} refractory obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HOC). METHODS: The patients were referred for <b>alcoholization</b> after Doppler echocardiography. Before and after <b>alcoholization,</b> the intraventricular pressure gradient was recorded. <b>Alcoholization</b> was performed with a 3 mL injection of absolute alcohol through a coronary angioplasty balloon catheter. The procedure was concluded after a significant reduction or abolition of the pressure gradient. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 18 (81. 8 %) successfully concluded the procedure with a reduction in intraventricular pressure gradient at baseline (from 67. 6 ± 24. 2 mmHg to 3. 8 ± 1. 9 mmHg, p< 0. 005) and after extrasystole (from 110. 4 ± 24. 2 mmHg to 9. 6 ± 2. 6 mm Hg, p< 0. 005). A significant reduction in mean interventricular septal thickness (from 2 ± 0. 3 mm to 1. 7 ± 0. 2 mm, p< 0. 005) and in peak pressure gradient (from 90. 7 ± 23. 5 mmHg to 6. 1 ± 1. 4 mmHg, p< 0. 005) was observed on Doppler echocardiography after 6 months, when all patients were in functional class I. The most frequent acute complication, present in 11 % of the patients, was the need for definitive pacing implantation. Relapse of the symptoms and reappearance of the pressure gradient occurred in 16. 6 % of the patients. One patient (5. 5 %) died probably due to a diffuse coronary spasm prior to the procedure, and another died suddenly on late follow-up.

40|$|Chronic alcohol {{exposure}} modifies endocannabinoid {{levels in}} different brain regions, while pharmacological targeting of the endocannabinoid {{system has been}} reported to influence ethanol intake in laboratory animals. The present study was aimed at evaluating the pattern of changes of endocannabinoids and their receptors, with emphasis on reward-related brain areas, in Wistar rats subjected to consecutive phases of <b>alcoholization,</b> alcohol deprivation (abstinence), and voluntary consumption of alcohol (relapse). We observed that, in the limbic forebrain, anandamide (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) contents increased after 7 days of <b>alcoholization,</b> then to dramatically decrease after 48 h of alcohol deprivation and, in the case of 2 -AG, to further decrease when rats were allowed to relapse to alcohol consumption. By contrast, in the midbrain, there was a marked reduction in AEA, but not 2 -AG, content, after <b>alcoholization.</b> This decrease was not affected during alcohol abstinence, but both AEA and 2 -AG contents were then significantly reduced when rats were allowed to relapse to alcohol consumption. Based on these data, we examined whether pharmacological activation/blockade of endocannabinoid transmission might influence ethanol intake in rats allowed to relapse to alcohol consumption after subsequent periods of <b>alcoholization</b> and alcohol deprivation. Treatment with either Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol or CP 55, 940, two cannabinoid agonists, reduced both total liquid and ethanol intake but did not affect ethanol preference. Treatment with SR 141716, a selective cannabinoid CB 1 receptor antagonist, also produced a significant reduction in both total liquid and ethanol intake without affecting ethanol preference. Accordingly, none of these effects on ethanol intake were accompanied by changes in dopamine and GABA in limbic structures. In summary, the levels of endocannabinoids underwent significant changes in reward-related areas during <b>alcoholization,</b> alcohol deprivation, and relapse, showing the lowest values in this latter phase. Treatment with cannabinoid agonists or a selective CB 1 receptor antagonist resulted in a reduction of ethanol intake by rats allowed to relapse to alcohol consumption after periods of <b>alcoholization</b> and alcohol deprivation, but these effects {{did not appear to be}} due to changes in neurobiological substrates currently involved in alcohol reinforcement/relapse...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The brain damage, {{which occurs}} after either chronic <b>alcoholization</b> or binge {{drinking}} regimes, shows distinct biochemical and neurotransmitter differences. An excessive amount of glutamate is released into specific brain regions during binge drinking (in excess of 4 - to 5 -fold {{of the normal}} basal concentration) that is not evident during periods of excessive alcohol consumption in chronic alcohol abusers. Increases in glutamate release are only observed during {{the initial stages of}} withdrawal from chronic alcoholism (∼ 2 -to 3 -fold) due to alterations in the sensitivities of the NMDA receptors. Such changes in either density or sensitivity of these receptors are reported to be unaltered by binge drinking. When such excesses of glutamate are released in these two different models of alcohol abuse, a wide range of biochemical changes occur, mediated in part by increased fluxes of calcium ions and/or activation of various G-protein-associated signalling pathways. Cellular studies of alveolar macrophages isolated from these two animal models of alcohol abuse showed enhanced (binge drinking) or reduced (chronic <b>alcoholization)</b> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated NO release. Such studies could suggest that neuroadaptation occurs with the development of tolerance to alcohol’s effects in both neurotransmitter function and cellular processes during chronic <b>alcoholization</b> that delay the occurrence of brain damage. In contrast, ‘binge drinking ’ induces immediate and toxic effects and {{there is no evidence of}} an increased preference for alcohol as seen after withdrawal from chronic <b>alcoholization...</b>|$|E

Surprisingly, in the <b>alcoholization</b> detection task we observed a somewhat equal distribution of task-specific information across all three states, resulting in constantly producing better results if more states are utilized...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{patients}} with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma were treated {{by means of}} percutaneous <b>alcoholization</b> of the malignancy (11 nodular lesions less than 5 cm O). Upon treatment completion they were all given intraarterial injection of lipiodol, which was followed, a week later, by a CT scan. At angiography, during the parenchymal phase, 7 of 11 nodules appeared as avascular areas, whereas in the remaining 4 cases an intense parenchymal effect was seen within the previously treated areas. Lipiodol CT scans revealed intense uptake of oily material in the 4 hypervascular lesions {{as well as in}} 1 of those with avascular appearance. In 4 lesions, pathology of bioptic specimens obtained from the areas with contrast pooling was consistent with the persistence of viable neoplastic tissue. In these patients <b>alcoholization</b> had therefore to be continued. Lipiodol accumulation within previously treated nodules has proved {{to be related to the}} presence of residual neoplasm. Moreover, in 2 cases, focal retention of lipiodol was very helpful for biopsy under CT guidance. According to our experience, we believe lipiodol administration followed by CT to be very useful in evaluating and staging HCCs. We nevertheless believe that the procedure should be performed only after <b>alcoholization</b> has been completed: this would inform us of treatment effectiveness and subsequently enable us to decide whether treatment can be discontinued...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{inversion}} of melatonin circadian rhythm secretion in some alcoholics during both intake and acute withdrawal {{has been widely}} reported. In the same way, what happens to this inversion when these patients are in long-term withdrawal is not known. To document this abnormality in alcoholics after withdrawal we investigated melatonin secretion observed during chronic <b>alcoholization</b> and after withdrawal. Methods: We measured the urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin (6 SM) (6 SM/creatinine ratio), main metabolite of the hormone, in two fractions, one diurnal and the other nocturnal, in seven alcohol-dependent patients presenting with this abnormality during <b>alcoholization</b> at two times: in acute withdrawal phase (under benzodiazepines) and 15 days after beginning of withdrawal (free of any psychotropic treatment). Results: Our results show that this reversed rhythm of melatonin secretion as seen by the diurnal excretion of 6 SM (6 SM/creatinine ratio) persists during acute withdrawal {{in more than half}} of the patients and is still present 15 days after withdrawal in three patients. Conclusion: It is remarkable that the {{inversion of}} the melatonin rhythms gets corrected in four out of seven patients after withdrawal. But, the circadian disorganization of melatonin secretion in three patients could underline a desynchronization in some alcoholic patients and may indicate more widespread circadian temporal structure disturbances in these patients...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} Acamprosate (the calcium salt of an acetylated form of homotaurine) and the benzodiazepine-receptor agonist Diazepam, were {{investigated}} on the alcohol-induced behavioural preference towards alcohol following chronic <b>alcoholization</b> by inhalation. We also {{examined the effects}} of Acamprosate and Diazepam on the blood alcohol level (BAL) and on the cortical microvascular network. Acamprosate (50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg daily per os during the <b>alcoholization</b> period) did not significantly reduce either BAL or alcohol-induced cortical hypervascularization. Increasing dosages of Acamprosate (i. e. 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day), however, progressively reduced preference for alcohol as expressed in a free choice beverage procedure, whereas 400 mg/kg/day of Acamprosate immediately stopped this behaviour. Acamprosate (50 mg/kg/day) also reduced the spontaneous activity of rats during the withdrawal syndrome. By contrast, Diazepam (5 mg/kg) induced inversion in the animals' choice (i. e. increased water consumption versus decreased alcohol intake) during the same experimental procedure, and potentiated the alcohol-induced hypermotility of the animals during the withdrawal syndrome without altering cortical hypervascularization. Taken together, our data provide evidence that both substances exert dose-dependent effects on preference towards alcohol, but display opposite profiles on spontaneous motor activity during the withdrawal phase without any modification of brain microvascularization or blood alcohol levels...|$|E

Modeling of the chronic alcoholic poisoning in rats was realized by daily introduction of ethyl alcohol per os in dosage 2 - 3, 5 mg/g of rat weight dur-ing 30 days. Morphological research comprised both light and electronic microscopy of myocardium of right and left atria, right and left auricles, and also interatrial septum.

In study 1, SR 147778, at doses of 0. 3, 1, or 10 mg/kg/day (mg/kg/d) intraperitonealy (ip), was administered during chronic pulmonary ethanol intoxication for 30 days. The rats were then exposed to a two-bottle choice (ethanol 10 % v/v vs. water) for at least 30 days. Neither 0. 3 nor 1 mg/kg/d had any effect on ethanol preference. In contrast, the high dose induced a significant transient increase in ethanol intake between days 6 and 10. In study 2, SR 147778, at doses of 0. 3, 1, or 10 mg/kg/d ip, was administered during the free-choice period after chronic <b>alcoholization.</b> Both ethanol preference and intake were significantly reduced only for 1 and 10 mg/kg/d.

40|$|AIMS: Previous {{studies have}} shown that CB(1) {{cannabinoid}} receptors are involved in the behavioural effects induced by chronic ethanol administration in Wistar rats by using SR 141716, a CB(1) cannabinoid receptor antagonist. These studies have now been extended to investigate the effect of acute and chronic <b>alcoholization</b> on blood ethanol concentration (BEC) and ethanol preference in CB(1) knockout (-/-) mice. METHODS: BEC was monitored for a period of 8 h in both CB(1) (-/-) male mice and CB(1) male wild-type (+/+) mice, which had received an acute i. p. injection of ethanol in 1, 3 or 5 g/kg doses. Ethanol preference was assayed in both groups of male mice in non-forced ethanol administration and forced chronic pulmonary alcohol administration for 14 and 39 days, respectively. RESULTS: After an acute intraperitoneal ethanol injection of 5 g/kg, CB(1) (-/-) mice showed a significant higher BEC during the ethanol elimination stage than the CB(1) (+/+) mice. However, those in the 1 and 3 g/kg groups showed no significant difference. A 2 - 3 fold increase in BEC was observed in CB(1) (-/-) mice on days 10 and 11 after commencement of forced chronic pulmonary <b>alcoholization</b> in comparison with CB(1) (+/+) mice, although comparable BEC values were assayed in both groups on day 12. In addition, these CB(1) (-/-) mice showed a significantly lower preference for ethanol than CB(1) (+/+) mice. CONCLUSIONS: The studies on CB(1) (-/-) and CB(1) (+/+) mice have clearly confirmed the involvement of CB(1) receptor on ethanol induced behavioural effects and also revealed that CB(1) receptors may be implicated in ethanol absorption/distribution, particularly after administration of high ethanol doses...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Neutrophils are {{involved}} in thrombus formation. We investigated whether specific features of neutrophil activation characterize patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) compared to stable angina and to systemic inflammatory diseases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The myeloperoxidase (MPO) content of circulating neutrophils was determined by flow cytometry in 330 subjects: 69 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), 69 with chronic stable angina (CSA), 50 with inflammation due to either non-infectious (acute bone fracture), infectious (sepsis) or autoimmune diseases (small and large vessel systemic vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis). Four patients have also been studied before and after sterile acute injury of the myocardium (septal <b>alcoholization).</b> One hundred thirty-eight healthy donors were studied in parallel. Neutrophils with normal MPO content were 96 % in controls, > 92 % in patients undergoing septal <b>alcoholization,</b> 91 % in CSA patients, but only 35 and 30 % in unstable angina and AMI (STEMI and NSTEMI) patients, compared to 80 %, 75 % and 2 % of patients with giant cell arteritis, acute bone fracture and severe sepsis. In addition, in 32 / 33 STEMI and 9 / 21 NSTEMI patients respectively, 20 % and 12 % of neutrophils had complete MPO depletion during the first 4 hours after the onset of symptoms, a feature not observed in any other group of patients. MPO depletion was associated with platelet activation, indicated by P-selectin expression, activation and transactivation of leukocyte β 2 -integrins and formation of platelet neutrophil and -monocyte aggregates. The injection of activated platelets in mice produced transient, P-selectin dependent, complete MPO depletion in about 50 % of neutrophils. CONCLUSIONS: ACS are characterized by intense neutrophil activation, like other systemic inflammatory syndromes. In the very early phase of acute myocardial infarction only a subpopulation of neutrophils is massively activated, possibly via platelet-P selectin interactions. This paroxysmal activation could contribute to occlusive thrombosis...|$|E

Eighty-four patients with high STA (group B) compared to 62 patients with normal STA (group A) showed significantly higher LDL-C, TG, apoB rates and TC/HDL-C index contrasting with significantly lower HDL-C and apoA- 1 rates and the apoA- 1 /apoB index. The two groups were matched for age, overweight, cigarette smoking and glycemia. Hepatic dysfunction does not explain {{the differences in the}} lipoproteic parameters. Such results would suggest {{that there may be a}} tryptic alteration of apoproteins in vivo as already demonstrated in vitro and experimentally suspected in vivo in some other studies. Competition by the trypsin-activated a 2 macroglobulin for the chylomicron-remnant LDL receptor-related protein may be evoked...|$|E
40|$|Background: Through a {{qualitative}} and interdisciplinary investigation {{as to the}} theoretical validity of CAGE as a screening instrument for alcohol dependence among the Upper Rio Negro Indian population, the use of alcohol as a theme among culturally diverse groups is approached by studying the assignment of meanings to drinking and the answers given to CAGE by the interviewed Indians. Methods: Geertz (1989) and Menendez's (1982) contributions have allowed {{the distinction between the}} biomedical concept of alcohol dependence and the social notion by the drinkers. Both notions were submitted to the <b>alcoholization</b> process concept which refers back to the ambiguous and conflicting relationships established between drinkers and non-drinkers in historical moments and specific social situations. Results: The analysis of the answers to CAGE made evident the incongruence between its objectives and assumptions and the indigenous understanding of the instrument, invalidating a productive use. Conclusion: Despite CAGE's universalist intentions, the indigenous cultural singularity produced new and unexpected meanings to the test-questions and generated useless answers to carry out the screening of suspects of alcohol dependence, in the studied situation...|$|E
40|$|Fujian Key Laboratory of Advanced Materials, China [2006 L 2003]The superhydrophobic {{silica aerogel}} was {{prepared}} by using less expensive sodium silicate {{as a main}} silica source through a cost-effective and simple route via ambient pressure drying. The sodium impurity was first eliminated by mixing sodium silicate with a co-precursor methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) followed by ion exchange process. The hydrogel was formed by gelation and the alcogel was further obtained by <b>alcoholization</b> of the hydrogel. The surface of alcogel was modified by reacting with trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) diluted in n-hexane. It was suggested that MTES accelerated water expelling from the hydrogel, while TMCS modified the surface of silica network by replacing Si-OH with Si-C. As a result, the obtained silica aerogel exhibited excellent physical properties with less than 10 % volume shrinkage. The density, surface area and cumulative pore volume were 0. 12 g cm(- 3), 684. 44 m(2) g(- 1), and 3. 55 cm(3) g(- 1), respectively. The optical transmission reached 82. 8 % with the water contact angle of 146 degrees. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|CT-guided neurolytic splanchnic nerve {{block is}} a {{technique}} for relieving abdominal cancer pain; the goal is the alcoholic neurolytic interruption of the sensitive structures in retroperitoneal space. CT yields accurate anatomical detailing and the course for needle placement and alcohol spread. January, 1993, to July, 1996, twenty-one bilateral splanchnic nerve blocks were performed through the posterior access. Forty-eight hours after <b>alcoholization,</b> 14 patients (66 %) had complete pain regression; 52 % of the patients needed no analgesics for 6 to 54 days and only 9 patients (42 %) needed another low opioid therapy. Complications included hypotension and diarrhea in all cases. One had a cardiac arrest and died 8 days after the procedure. There were no other complications. The whole procedure usually lasted 60 min (range: 45 to 90 min). Splanchnic nerve neurolysis is a useful treatment in the patients with severe chronic abdominal pain. It {{is used as a}} second line treatment when large lesions change celiac anatomy and complicate the percutaneous block of the celiac plexus...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of present}} trial is study of psycho {{physiological}} peculiarities of adolescents with {{high risk of}} development of beer dependence. 143 schoolchildren from 5 - 11 form of Archangelsk schools of general education took part in trial. 3 groups of adolescents were formed, depending of summarized indices of beer alcoholization: group of high grade of <b>alcoholization</b> (35. 5 %), medium grade (45. 2 %) and low grade (19. 3 %). Adolescents with high risk of development of beer dependence are characterized with lowering of simple visual-motor and audio-motor response rate, complex visual-motor response rate, complex sensomotor response rate on moving object, decrease of stability of sensomotor processes and attention stability, stability of mental work and mental efficiency depending on time, efficiency in deficit of time and information. These disorders {{may be used in}} early diagnostics of beer dependence in structure of primary and secondary psycho prophylactic measures.

Purpose. Ascites, esophageal varicose veins, and acute digestive bleeding are unusual in the clinical presentation of chronic pancreatitis; however, these symptoms are frequently observed in patients with liver cirrhosis. Moreover, {{it is unlikely to}} observe chylous ascites in both presentations. Method. We report a patient who presented with chronic pancreatitis with splenic vein thrombosis, necrosis of the pancreatic neck and tail, esophageal varicose veins with previous bleeding, and chylous ascites. After partial pancreatectomy, his treatment was based on low-fat oral diet with medium-chain triglycerides with remarkable resolution of the chylous ascites. After 3 years, he presented with decompensated chronic pancreatitis and underwent plexus <b>alcoholization</b> and biliary-enteric deviation with an unremarkable postoperative course. Conclusion. Ascites is rarely associated with chronic pancreatitis, and chylous ascites is even rarer. The treatment of atraumatic chylous ascites is based on resolution of the obstructive causes and should include drainage and a low-fat diet with medium-chain triglycerides. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic biparental preconceptional <b>alcoholization</b> {{followed}} by alcohol consumption during the preimplantation period on the maternal and fetal homeostasis of some alkaline and alkaline-earth metals was studied in albino rats. Female and male rats consumed 20 % ethanol (v/v) for 50 - 60 days before mating (group E). Further on pregnant females were alcoholized until day 5 of pregnancy. Control {{females and males}} consumed tap water (group C). Animals were sacrificed on day 20 of pregnancy. Blood samples were obtained from fetuses (the blood of each litter being pooled) and from pregnant females. Biochemical determinations were made by atomic emission spectroscopy for Na and K and by atomic absorption spectroscopy for Ca and Mg. Early and late mortality of conceptuses were checked. Non significant changes were observed within group E in the maternal serum as to Na (increase) and K(decrease), while Ca and Mg showed a significant decrease. Similar changes {{were found in the}} pooled fetal serum, the decrease of K and Mg being less marked. No structural anomalies were detected. With respect to tanatogenesis, both early resorptions and late fetal death were increased. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{intraoperative}} ultrasonography (IOUS) {{to evaluate}} liver, bile ducts and pancreatic disease, {{as compared to}} the results of preoperative ultrasonography and CT, is discussed. Forty-two patients who underwent abdominal surgery for suspected hepatobiliary and/or pancreatic disease were studied. The intraoperative study was carried out with a portable apparatus (Aloka 500, Japan), using 5. 0 MHz and 7. 5 MHz linear sterile transducers. The main indications for IOUS were the search for and/or evaluation of primary hepatic masses,hepatic abscesses or metastases, obstructive jaundice, or neuroendocrine tumors. In 15 cases (38. 5 percent) from the hepatobiliary group and in 7 cases (58. 3 percent) from the pancreatic group, a difference between preoperative and intraoperative findings was observed. The main difference was observed in relation to the number and size of hepatic and pancreatic lesions. The relationship between the lesions and the vascular structures was evaluated through IOUS. The method was also used to guide surgical procedures such as biopsies, the <b>alcoholization</b> of nodules, and the drainage of abscesses. IOUS {{plays an important role in}} detecting small hepatic and pancreatic nodules, in the assessment of anatomical relationships between the lesions and the vascular structures, and in the performance of interventionist procedures...|$|E
