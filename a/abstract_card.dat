40|$|MBA 2013 <b>ABSTRACT</b> <b>Card</b> {{acceptance}} and processing {{as a form}} factor for payment processing is {{a significant part of}} the South African retail payments landscape. For South African banks, the success of the service delivery model of card payment services to their retail merchants is of critical importance to their success and long term shareholder return on equity, this is as a result of the effect improved service levels has on long term customer loyalty and advocacy. This paper assesses what are the customer service expectations of card accepting merchants in South Africa. With the main objective being to determine using SERVQUAL model (Parasuraman, Zeithaml & Berry, 1990) what are the service attributes that are important in meeting card accepting merchant’s service expectations. A web based self-administered survey was used to gather the data findings, to which 87 merchants completed the questionnaire. The data was analysed for means test ranking using the stochastic search algorithm means test methodology (Stacey, 2006). The ranking was analysed to determine the service attributes from the respondents as ranked by order of importance, further to that significance testing (significance level: 0. 05) was performed on the service attribute means to determine significance of ranking. The findings show that indeed the service attributes and expectation for card accepting merchants do differ to those of other banking services as documented in previous studies. Card accepting merchants rated the following 8 service attributes as the most important in meeting their service expectations;  The Bank performs the service right the first time  Employees of the Bank are knowledgeable and can address my questions appropriately  The Bank's employees are professional  Device uptime & communication systems  Employees of the Bank give you prompt service  The employees of my Bank understand my needs as well as that of my business  You feel safe in your as well as your customer’s transactions with the Bank  The Bank has my best interests at heart as well as that of my business The service dimension Reliability was found to be the most important service dimension as rated by the card accepting merchants. The result also found that some of the service attributes were insignificant in the delivery and meeting of merchants customer service expectations. For example service attributes like “The Bank has operating hours convenient to my business' needs and The Bank's employees provide me with personal attention as their client” were found to be insignificant Customer service expectations are not static and differ based on business segment and demographics (Sureshchandar, Rajendran & Anantharaman, 2003 and Reichfield, 2003), the findings of this research also confirm the need for banks to constantly assess the changing needs of their customers and merchants and built service models with attributes that aims to meet or exceed on the service expectation...|$|E

This paper presents a formal model of the smart card Web server specification and the proof of its security properties. The for-malization enables a thoughtful analysis of the specification that has revealed several ambiguities and potentially dangerous behaviors. Our formal model is built using a modular approach upon a model of Java Card and Global Platform. By proving the security properties, we show that the smart card Web server preserves the security policy of the over-all model. In other words, this component introduces no illegal access to the card resources (i. e., file system and applications). Furthermore, the smart card Web server {{provides a}} means for securely managing the card contents (i. e., resources update). ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> Java <b>Cards</b> {{have been}} {{threatened}} so far by attacks using ill-formed applications which {{assume that the}} application bytecode is not verified. This assumption remained realistic {{as long as the}} bytecode verifier was commonly executed off-card and could thus be bypassed. Nevertheless it can no longer be applied to the Java Card 3 Connected Edition context where the bytecode verification is necessarily performed on-card. Therefore Java Card 3 Connected Edition seems to be immune against this kind of attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate that running ill-formed application does not necessarily mean loading and installing ill-formed application. For that purpose, we introduce a brand new kind of attack which combines fault injection and logical tampering. By these means, we describe two case studies taking place in the new Java Card 3 context. The first one shows how ill-formed applications can still be introduced and executed despite the on-card bytecode verifier. The sec-ond example leads to the modification of any method already installed on the card into any malicious bytecode. Finally we successfully mount these attacks on a recent device, emphasizing the necessity of taking into account these new threats when implementing Java Card 3 features...|$|R

Flattening the power profile can thus increase the stability and security of a system. In this paper we present an optimization system that allows a reduction of power peaks based on a compiler optimization. The optimizations are done on different levels of the compiler. In the backend of the compiler we present new instruction scheduling algorithms. On the intermediate language level we propose the use of iterative compiling for reducing critical peaks...|$|R

Unfortunately, these regulations are often taken into account too late, and it results in export restrictions. We claim that most of the times, these restrictions could be avoided by considering the cryptographic export matters at the earliest design stages. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a few principles to use cryptographic primitives. These principles will help the development of smart cart based products that are consistent with the most common cryptographic regulations. 1 Introduction Given the expansion of the Internet technology as the e-commerce, as well as theglobalization of the data exchanges, the security (in the meaning of confidentiality and integrity) of the manipulated and/or sent data is a significant problemof today's computer field. In this context, the smart cards can play an essential role, as an useful and secure device for the mechanisms (e. g., the cryptographicfunctions and secret keys) allowing to guarantee the security. However, the products based on smart card technology must face the constraints of the export ofcryptographic mechanisms. Troubles related to cryptographic export regulations and laws often arisevery late in the life cycle of a product, generally when the product is available and ready to ship. Most of the time, it results in export restrictions, or, at least,increases drastically the time to market of the product...|$|R

Many research works are undergoing in this area to provide highly confidential data transmission. Existing Scheme provides a security against offline attack for the lost Smart Card using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) but it requires more communication and computation overhead with higher key length. To overcome this limitation, DNA based Password authentication using Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) scheme is proposed. It provides more security than existing system which allows server and smartcard to exchange the generated password and verify each other. This system exploits the advantages of Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) technique which is having lesser key size, less communication and computation overhead for Password generation and signature verification process...|$|R

The main conclusion is that largely automatic verification of realistic JAVA CARD software is possible provided that it is designed with verification in mind from the start. ...|$|R
