5|$|Shakur {{personally}} cross-examined the witnesses, getting White to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had once}} {{been in love with}} her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur's ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.|$|E
5|$|In Altranstädt, Marlborough {{reportedly}} approached Carl Piper, {{the most}} favored of the King's advisers of the time. Allegedly, he offered Piper a pension {{in exchange for}} advising Charles XII to invade Russia, as this would distract Charles from interfering in the War of the Spanish Succession. Carl Piper was openly accused of having accepted Marlborough's bribe, persuaded Charles to the Swedish invasion of Russia, which consequently lead to the disastrous Battle of Poltava. Carl Piper denied having accepted Marlborough's offer, but he did <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had accepted that Marlborough provided his wife Christina Piper {{with a pair of}} valuable earrings, which she admitted, and as it was the habit of Carl Piper to personally refuse bribes but allow his wife to accept them and then follow her recommendation, the accusation of Marlborough's bribe is not unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Phil calls Sal, wanting Louise's (now {{played by}} Tilly Keeper) address, {{and when he}} goes to her house, Peggy is there, having {{returned}} a week earlier. Peggy is disgusted to see that Phil has returned to alcoholism, but does give him Louise's address. She then reveals her breast cancer has returned, and she is dying. Phil tries to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has cirrhosis of liver, but she refuses to see him again and he leaves. In May, Peggy turns up on Ronnie's doorstep, and the next day Sal arrives with the news that Peggy's chemotherapy is not working and she is dying. A hospital appointment confirms that Peggy's cancer has spread to her brain and it is terminal. Peggy finally faces Phil, who is in recovery from his alcoholism, and admits she is dying. He is upset that she is refusing any more treatment, and takes her on a boat trip on the Thames, and back to their childhood home, to try and make her fight. However, Peggy is not convinced and asks Phil to help her die.|$|E

50|$|In August 2006, {{a number}} of SSP activists came forward to claim that Sheridan had held {{meetings}} with them, where he made admissions inconsistent with his evidence in the court case, in particular <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had had affairs and visited a swingers' club in Manchester. In October 2006, the News of the World released a videotape which showed Sheridan <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had visited the club, and <b>admitting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had <b>admitted</b> this to the SSP Executive.|$|R
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|Several {{months after}} Belle's death, Aden and Nicole begin a relationship, which becomes {{strained}} when Nicole {{tells him that}} she loves him, but Aden does not return the sentiment. A repentant Aden pays Nicole more attention and {{they are able to}} get their romance back on track. Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Burns is {{at first}} shocked, but after {{acknowledging}} the resemblance admits that Larry {{was the product}} of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, Mr. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and tries to shape Larry after himself. Burns takes Larry to fancy parties and tries to have him enrolled in Yale, but Larry keeps acting like an oaf and proves to be an embarrassment. Larry is put to work in Sector 7G at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer and the two become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner, and at dinner, Mr. Burns becomes frustrated due to Larry's boorishness and tells him that he wishes he had no son. Homer tries to convince Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns will <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> loves his son, and although Larry at first opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to do it and moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer calls Mr. Burns and says that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave the house, they are spotted.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) tells Aden that {{he should}} behave in a manner his {{grandfather}} would be proud of. This upsets Aden, and he tries to cause trouble at school. When Cassie discovers she has HIV, Aden becomes irate at the prospect {{that she may have}} infected him in the car accident. After his tests come back negative, he cries in disappointment. His doctor, Rachel Armstrong (Amy Mathews), suggests that Aden may need counselling, but he refuses. When Aden's alcoholic father Larry throws him out, he is taken in by his friend Roman. Aden is upset to learn that Roman was in the army like his grandfather, and visits the structurally damaged local diner to be alone. The ceiling collapses and Aden is seriously injured. In the aftermath, Larry tells Rachel that Aden was abused by his grandfather as a child. Aden cannot face going home, so moves in with Roman more permanently. He is attracted to Roman's daughter Nicole, but does not pursue her out of respect for Roman. Instead, Aden kisses Belle, but deflects her attempts to take things further. She goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz), which prompts a jealous Aden to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could not sleep with her because of the abuse he suffered as a child. When Larry injures himself while drunk, he is found by his son, and admits that Aden's grandfather also abused him. Aden holds Larry, Rachel and Belle hostage so that his father cannot receive medical assistance, but they are rescued by Angelo. Aden is forced into counselling, and begins {{to come to terms with}} his abuse.|$|E

25|$|In 1533 he {{was allowed}} to {{accompany}} Dom Martinho de Portugal to Rome on an embassy to Pope Clement VII, to whom Father Álvares delivered the letter Lebna Dengel had written to the Pope. The precise date of Francisco Álvares death, like that of his birth, is unknown, but the writer of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article concludes it was later than 1540, in which year an account of his travels were published at Lisbon. In the introduction of their translation of Álvares work, C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford furnish evidence that points to Álvares death in Rome, and <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have died before his work was published.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, The National Enquirer began {{a series}} of reports alleging an adulterous affair between Edwards and former {{campaign}} worker Rielle Hunter. By July 2008, several news media outlets speculated that Edwards' chances for the Vice Presidency as well as other positions such as the Attorney General were harmed by the allegations, which now included that he fathered a child with Hunter and had visited her and the baby girl at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. However, the story was not widely covered by the press for some time, until, after initially denying the allegations, Edwards admitted the affair. On January 21, 2010, John Edwards issued a press release to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fathered Hunter's child.|$|E

25|$|Profumo's {{statement}} did {{not prevent}} newspapers publishing stories about Keeler, and it soon became apparent to Macmillan that Profumo's position was untenable. On 5 June 1963, Profumo was forced to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lied to the House, an unforgivable offence in British politics. He resigned from office, from the House, and from the Privy Council. Before making his public confession Profumo confessed the affair to his wife, who stood by him. It was never shown that his relationship with Keeler had led to any breach of national security. The scandal rocked the Conservative government, and was generally held to {{have been among the}} causes of its defeat by Labour at the 1964 election. Macmillan had already gone by then, having resigned in October 1963 to be succeeded by Alec Douglas-Home.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Barry was openly {{suffering}} {{from the effects of}} longstanding addictions to cocaine and alcohol; he would later <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lost control of his drug habit soon after being sworn in for a third term. His public appearances were marked by his glassy eyes and slurred speech. His aides began scheduling all of his daily events later and later in the day as he was arriving to work as late as lunchtime, and nodding off to sleep at his desk. His ability to function as mayor had become so impaired that even his closest associates urged him not to run again. They tried to create an endowed professorship for him at the University of the District of Columbia. In the wake of Barry's inattention, the city declined badly. Barry was watching Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, California when a winter blizzard struck Washington in January 1987; city crews were accused of badly mishandling the road clearing, adversely affecting local businesses.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after she wakes up, Paul sends Sophie to a rehab clinic in Sydney. Andrew {{purchases}} some medication online to control his epilepsy symptoms, which Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) advises him against taking. Chris is asked by his lawyer to collect witness statements from everyone involved in the crash, but Andrew refuses to give him one. However, Paul is forced to call off the lawsuit when Andrew admits that the crash was his fault. He makes up with Chris, while Summer and Natasha initially keep their distance. Sophie returns from rehab {{and is able to}} walk with the help of crutches, but she struggles to be around her friends.

25|$|Evgenii is accorded equal {{status with}} Peter in purely human terms, and his {{rebellion}} against state power {{is shown to}} be as admirable and significant in its way {{as that of the}} Decembrists. Yet turning now to the question of Evgenii’s role in the wider scheme of things, we have to <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> seems an insignificant third factor in the equation when viewed {{against the backdrop of the}} titanic struggle taking place between Peter and the elements. Evgenii is utterly and completely helpless against both. The flood sweeps away all his dreams of happiness, and it is in the river that he meets his death. Peter’s statue, which at their first ‘encounter’ during the flood had its back turned to Evgenii as if ignoring him, late hounds him mercilessly when he dares to protest at Peter’s role in his suffering. The vast, impersonal forces of order and chaos, locked in an unending struggle– these,Pushkin seems to be saying, are the reality: these are the millstones of destiny or of the historical process to which Evgenii and his kind are but so much grist.|$|E
25|$|Solas {{confesses to}} being Fen'Harel, and {{creating}} the Veil {{in order to}} seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, {{the only one who}} kept their ambition in check, before their lust for power destroyed the world. He also reveals his intentions to restore the world of the ancient elves, even if he must destroy the world of the present day. If asked about his role in the events of the core game, Solas explains that he had arranged for Corypheus to obtain the magical orb he used, intending for the magister to unlock it and kill himself in the subsequent explosion, after which Solas would retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to tear down the Veil, restoring the world of the ancient elves. After Corypheus survived the blast, an event Solas had not foreseen, Solas joined and supported the Inquisition, seeing them as the world's best hope of defeating Corypheus. If questioned about why he arranged for the Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered, depending on whether or not he is friends with the Inquisitor, he will either <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sees value in the present world, or that he simply wanted to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At the end of their conversation, Solas magically amputates the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaves, with the Inquisitor resolving to stop him by any means necessary. Alternatively, an Inquisitor who befriended Solas can vow to convince him to abandon his plan, with Solas replying that he would be glad to be proven wrong again.|$|E
