5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> of the cycle {{have been used to}} explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge eating.|$|E

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|Besides gyres, {{there are}} {{temporary}} surface currents that occur under specific conditions. When waves meet a shore at an angle, a longshore current is created as water is pushed along {{parallel to the}} coastline. The water swirls up onto the beach {{at right angles to}} the approaching waves but drains away straight down the slope under the effect of gravity. The larger the breaking waves, the longer the beach, and the more oblique the wave's approach, the stronger the longshore current is. These currents can shift great volumes of sand or pebbles, create spits, and make beaches disappear and water channels silt up. A rip current can occur when water piles up near the shore from advancing waves and is funnelled out to sea through a channel in the seabed. It may occur at a gap in a sandbar or near a man-made structure such as a groyne. These strong currents can have a velocity of , can form at different places <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> of the tide, and can carry away unwary swimmers. Temporary upwelling currents occur when the wind pushes water away from the land and deeper water rises to replace it. This cold water is often rich in nutrients and creates blooms of phytoplankton and a great increase in the productivity of the sea.|$|E

40|$|Hydroponic {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} appraise variation in the salt tolerance potential of two wheat cultivars (salt tolerant, S- 24 and moderately salt sensitive MH- 97) <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Salinity stress caused a marked reduction in plant {{biomass and grain yield}} of both wheat cultivars. However, cv. S- 24 was superior to cv. MH- 97 in maintaining higher plant biomass and grain yield under saline stress. Furthermore, salinity caused a significant variation in different physiological attributes measured <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> For example, salt stress caused a marked reduction in net photosynthetic and transpiration rate in both wheat cultivars but to a varying extent <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Higher photosynthetic and transpiration rates were recorded at the boot stage than at other growth stages in both wheat cultivars. The response of other gas exchange attributes was also variable <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Salt sensitive wheat cultivar MH- 97 was more prone to salt-induced adverse effects on gas exchange attributes as compared to cv. S- 24. Salt stress caused considerable reduction in different water relation attributes of wheat plants. A significant reduction in leaf water, osmotic and turgor potentials was recorded in both wheat cultivars <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Maximal reduction in leaf water potential was recorded at the reproductive stage in both wheat cultivars. In contrast, maximal turgor potential was observed at the boot stage. Salt-induced adverse effects of salinity on different water relation attributes were more prominent in cv. MH- 97 as compared to those in cv. S- 24. The integrity of PS II was greatly perturbed in both wheat cultivars <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages</b> and this salt-induced damage to PS II was more in cv. MH- 97. A significant alteration in different biochemical attributes was also observed in both wheat cultivars <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> For example, salt stress caused a substantial decrease in chlorophyll pigments, ascorbic acid, phenolics and tocopherols. In contrast, it increased the endogenous levels of ROS (H 2 O 2), MDA, total soluble proteins, proline, glycine betaine and activities of enzymatic antioxidants (SOD, POD, CAT, APX). These biochemical attributes exhibited significant salt-induced variation <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages</b> in both wheat cultivars. For example, maximum accumulation of glycine betaine and proline was recorded at the early growth stages (vegetative and boot). However, cv. S- 24 showed higher accumulation of these two organic osmolytes and this could be the reason for maintenance of higher turgor than that of cv. MH- 97 under stress conditions. The activities of various enzymatic antioxidants increased markedly in both wheat cultivars, particularly at the vegetative stage. However, cv. S- 24 exhibited consistent increase in the activities of various enzymatic antioxidants, whereas, this phenomena occurred erratically in cv. MH- 97 <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Salt stress significantly increased the endogenous levels of toxic ions (Na+and Cl-) and decreased essential cations (K+ and Ca 2 +) in both wheat cultivars <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages.</b> Furthermore, K+/Na+ and Ca 2 +/Na+ ratios decreased markedly due to salt stress in both wheat cultivars <b>at</b> <b>different</b> growth <b>stages</b> and this salt-induced reduction was more prominent in cv. MH- 97. Moreover, higher K+/Na+ and Ca 2 +/Na+ ratios were recorded at early growth stages in both wheat cultivars. It can be inferred from the results that wheat plants are more prone to adverse effects of salinity stress at early growth stages than that at the reproductive stage...|$|R
5|$|Newton (test plate) {{interferometry}} {{is frequently}} {{used in the}} optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured. Fig.13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> of completion, showing the different patterns of interference fringes. The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces {{in contact with the}} test flats, and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source. The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere, resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands. The surface in the left photo is nearly flat, indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals. The surface in the right photo is uneven, resulting in a pattern of curved fringes. Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used, so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes. The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method. To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat, any of several procedures may be adopted. One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat. If one observes the fringes in white light, the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation. Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position. These sorts of maneuvers, while common in the optical shop, are not suitable in a formal testing environment. When the flats are ready for sale, they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>stages</b> of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E
