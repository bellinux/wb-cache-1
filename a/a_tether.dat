5|$|Marge's absence is {{felt at home}} as Homer and {{the rest}} of the family struggles to cope without her. Without Marge, the house shortly becomes a {{complete}} wreck. The annual bake sale also suffersâ€“ without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They even unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> ball post.|$|E
25|$|Tether {{satellites}} are satellites {{which are}} connected to another satellite by a thin cable called <b>a</b> <b>tether.</b>|$|E
25|$|In hunting, Salticidae {{also use}} their silk for <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> {{to enable them}} to reach prey that {{otherwise}} would be inaccessible. For example, by advancing towards the prey to less than the jumping distance, then retreating and leaping in an arc {{at the end of the}} tether line, many species can leap onto prey on vertical or even on inverted surfaces, which of course in a gravitational field would not be possible without such <b>a</b> <b>tether.</b>|$|E

25|$|The diver {{must ensure}} that {{there is always a}} {{positive}} indication of the route to the exit area. <b>A</b> <b>tether</b> to a surface tender is usually preferable as {{it can be used to}} communicate, but if this is not practicable a reel and distance line is an alternative.|$|E
25|$|Tethered plug drawing, {{also known}} as {{semi-floating}} mandrel drawing, is a mix between floating plug drawing and fixed plug drawing. The mandrel is allowed to float, but it still anchored via <b>a</b> <b>tether.</b> This process gives similar results to the floating plug process, except that it is designed for straight tubes. It gives a better inner surface finish than rod drawing.|$|E

25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with <b>a</b> <b>tether,</b> which guides {{the face of the}} kite to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which the kite is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Phelps {{threatens to}} kill Ethan, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs {{to the roof}} of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a {{helicopter}} and <b>a</b> <b>tether.</b> Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the Channel Tunnel after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents, but Hunt resigns. As he flies home, a flight attendant approaches him and asks, through a coded phrase, if he is ready to take on a new mission, just as she asked Phelps at the beginning.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} space drives that need {{little or no}} reaction mass to function. <b>A</b> <b>tether</b> propulsion system employs a long cable with a high tensile strength to change a spacecraft's orbit, such as by interaction with a planet's magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object. Solar sails rely on radiation pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they require a large collection surface to function effectively. The magnetic sail deflects charged particles from the solar wind with a magnetic field, thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion system, which uses a small cloud of plasma held in a magnetic field to deflect the Sun's charged particles. An E-sail would use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect these particles, and may have more controllable directionality.|$|E

25|$|Violet rings {{have several}} unique abilities. They can create {{crystals}} {{which can be}} used to imprison members of other Lantern Corps on Zamaron. Over time, the rings of the prisoners trapped in stasis within the crystals are infected with violet energy. After spending enough time inside, the prisoner will emerge as a Star Sapphire. The rings can also detect when a love is in jeopardy, locate it, and then create a connection to the embattled heart that can be used as <b>a</b> <b>tether.</b> Sapphires are also shown as being able to show others their greatest love. Unlike constructs created by Green Lanterns, Orange Lanterns cannot absorb those made by Star Sapphires. Star Sapphires appear to be able to teleport in order to escape attackers, while their energy constructs release a disorienting dust when destroyed. These two abilities can be combined effectively to avoid being pursued. Violet power rings have the ability to restore the recently deceased to life by drawing power from the heart of one that loves them.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} methods of {{piloting}} balloons: free flight or captive. Free flight {{meant that the}} balloon was able to travel in any direction or distance for as long or {{as far as the}} pilot was able to fly it. Captive flight meant that the balloon was retained by <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> or series of tethers manned by ground crews. Free flight required that the pilot ascend and return by his own control. Captive flight used ground crews to assist in altitude control and speedy return to the exact starting point. Tethers also allowed for the stringing of telegraph wires back to the ground. Information gathered from balloon observation was relayed to the ground by various means of signaling. From high altitudes the telegraph was almost always necessary. At closer altitudes a series of prepared flag signals, hand signals, or even a megaphone could be used to communicate with the ground. At night either the telegraph or lamps could be used. In the later battles of Lowe's tenure, all reports and communications were ordered to be made orally by ascending and descending with the balloon. This is notable in Lowe's Official Report II to the Secretary where his usual transcriptions of messages were lacking. Free flight would almost always require the aeronaut to return and make a report. This would be an obvious detriment to timely reporting.|$|E

500|$|Following {{several months}} of ground testing, the XR-1 {{conducted}} its maiden flight on May 12, 1941, although the aircraft was restrained by <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> for its early flights. On June 23 the aircraft conducted its first free flight, albeit remaining within {{a few feet of}} the ground. As flight testing continued and the aircraft's performance envelope was expanded, the XR-1's quickly proved troublesome, the testing showing a variety of troubles with the design. These included issues with the aircraft's controls, insufficient control authority being present, and in addition there were resonance issues with the airframe that made the XR-1 prone to pilot-induced oscillations. The aircraft was modified in an attempt to resolve these issues, and the Army modified Platt-LePage's contract to provide additional funding for improvements to the design, but despite this the XR-1's problems continued. In addition, the company's test pilot, Lou Leavitt, lacked confidence in the design, refusing to fly the aircraft to its full potential. The situation was only resolved when Colonel H. Franklin Gregory, director of rotor-wing projects for the Army Air Forces, flew the aircraft himself, reaching [...] on his first flight in the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, using {{a radically}} {{different}} design looking more like a tailless biplane, he devised and flew a manned [...] "glider-kite". The machine was launched on <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> like a kite, and the tether was then released to allow gliding flight. The design showed little similarity to his earlier kites, but had more {{the appearance of a}} tailless biplane. It was notable in being the first aircraft to use ailerons (in fact they were elevons) effectively to control roll.|$|E
2500|$|Slingload Operations: During {{the second}} three-day phase of Air Assault School, {{candidates}} will {{learn how to}} rig equipment onto rotary aircraft with a sling, an operation that generally requires the loading soldier to hook <b>a</b> <b>tether</b> to the underbelly of a helicopter hovering {{just a few feet}} above the ground.
