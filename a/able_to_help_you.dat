Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>you</b> with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do? why, go, of course. I {{can look}} after myself; and if I can't, {{certainly}} <b>you</b> won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> me. Perhaps <b>you</b> will be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get some <b>help</b> from the farm. At any rate, you must go." ...|$|R

He concluded that the story was about not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> who <b>you</b> love. Two people with [...] "warm hearts" [...] acting without intent to heart Phoebe.

6000|$|Then {{the devil}} (who is {{always trying to}} slander God to us) whispers to them, as he did to Eve, [...] "How unreasonable! how hard on you.

How much money you might get by it--how much wiser, and cleverer, and more <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> yourself <b>you</b> would become, if you went your own way, and did what you like. Surely God is hard on you, and grudges you pleasure. Never mind--don't be afraid. Surely you can judge best what is good for you. Surely you know your own business best.

6000|$|Now, if to this {{household}} {{game you}} could {{add a little}} money interest, the amusement would be increased far beyond the mere money value, as a game at cards for sixpence {{is better than a}} rubber for nothing. If you can interest yourself about sixpence, all life is invested with a new excitement. From sunrise to sleeping you can always be playing that game--with butcher, baker, coal-merchant, cabman, omnibus man--nay, diamond merchant and stockbroker. You can bargain for a guinea over the price of a diamond necklace, or for a sixteenth per cent in a transaction at the Stock Exchange. We all know men who have this faculty who are not ungenerous with their money. They give it on great occasions.

60|$|MRS. TURNER (looking at her keenly). There is {{something}} upsetting you. You've something {{on your mind}} that you can't tell me, is that it? (Eileen maintains a stubborn silence.) But think--can't you tell me? (With a kindly smile.) I'm used to other people's troubles. I've been playing mother-confessor to the patients for years now, and I think I've usually been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them. Can't <b>you</b> confide in me, child? (Eileen drops her eyes, but remains silent. Mrs. Turner glances meaningly over at Murray, who is watching them whenever he thinks the matron is not aware of it--a note of sharp rebuke in her voice.) I think I can guess your secret, my dear, even if you're too stubborn to tell. This setback is your own fault. You've let other notions become more important to you than {{the idea of getting}} well. And you've no excuse for it. After I had to warn you a month ago, I expected that silliness to stop instantly.|$|R

'No. You may persuade {{yourself}} {{for the moment}} that you do, {{but after a while}} you will have to go by the evidence. <b>You</b> won't be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> yourself. <b>You</b> haven't realized what a crushing thing evidence is. You have to go by it against your will. You see, evidence is the only guide. You don't know that I am speaking the truth; you just feel it. You're trusting your heart and not your head. The head must win in the end. You might go on believing for a time, but sooner or later you would be bound to begin to doubt and worry and torment yourself. You couldn't fight against the evidence, when once your instinct--or whatever it is that tells you that I am speaking the truth--had begun to weaken. And it would weaken. Think what {{it would have to be}} fighting all the time. Think of the case your intelligence would be making out, day after day, till it crushed you. It's impossible that you could keep yourself from docketing the evidence and arranging it and absorbing it. Think! Consider what you know are actual facts! Nutty invites you down here, knowing that you are Lord Dawlish. All you know about my attitude towards Lord Dawlish is what I told you on the first morning of your visit. I told you I hated him. Yet, knowing you are Lord Dawlish, I become engaged to you. Directly afterwards you hear Nutty consoling me as if I were marrying you against my will. Isn't that an absolutely fair statement of what has happened? How could you go on believing me with all that against you?' ...|$|R

The method used is the approach to library research with content analysis of the various references relevant to the subject matter covered. The results indicate discussion of Islam and the health of the human spirit can not be separated, because the most <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> people when <b>you</b> get a load and disasters are Allah SWT then ask Allah SWT to be given the power to deal with any heavy trials. Maintaining healthy (mind) is one of the maqhasid syari'ah. Islamic law applies flexible in addressing the technological advancement of health. Nevertheless, there remain limitations and restrictions, such as blood transfusion is permissible based on the loose in an emergency. Likewise, transplantation of animal organs in human organs, in a state of emergency can be done with the record organs that organ must necessarily have a part in the excreta (najis), as well as the organ in the human body. While human cloning is forbidden in Islam because the Al-Qur'an surat At-Tin: 4, states, which means: “Sesungguhnya Kami telah menciptakan manusia dalam bentuk yang sebaik-baiknya”.
