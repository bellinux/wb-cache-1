Boyle designed the gold-coloured space suits along these lines despite persistent encouragement to model them after the NASA template. The helmets were designed to have cameras mounted in them. This further enhanced a sense of claustrophobia useful to the actors in delivering more heartfelt performances. The helmets were also limited to a horizontal slit for visibility instead of a full-face visor as further consideration toward protecting the characters from the <b>ambient</b> <b>radiation</b> of outer space.

25|$|The highest {{background}} radiation in an inhabited area {{is found in}} Ramsar, primarily due {{to the use of}} local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external effective radiation dose of 6mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the ICRP recommended limit for exposure to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to <b>ambient</b> <b>radiation</b> fields was 131mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal committed dose from radon was 72mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr).

[...] In 1997 CIPM added that the periods would be defined for a caesium atom at rest, and approaching the theoretical temperature of absolute zero (0K), and in 1999, it included corrections from <b>ambient</b> <b>radiation.</b> Absolute zero implies no movement, and therefore zero external radiation effects (i.e., zero local electric and magnetic fields).|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a {{transient}} third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt {{in a matter of}} minutes and the outer belt in about [...] hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft. Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even Dr. James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions. Plait cited an average dose of less than 1rem (10mSv), which is equivalent to the <b>ambient</b> <b>radiation</b> received by living at sea level for three years. The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.|$|E

40|$|High solar {{radiation}} along with extreme transparency leads to high penetration of {{solar radiation}} in the Red Sea, potentially harmful to biota inhabiting {{the upper water}} column, including zooplankton. Here we show, based on experimental assessments of solar radiation dose-mortality curves on eight common taxa, the mortality of zooplankton in the oligotrophic waters of the Red Sea to increase steeply with ambient levels of solar radiation in the Red Sea. Responses curves linking solar radiation doses with zooplankton mortality were evaluated by exposing organisms, enclosed in quartz bottles, allowing all the wavelengths of solar radiation to penetrate, to five different levels of <b>ambient</b> solar <b>radiation</b> (100 %, 21. 6 %, 7. 2 %, 3. 2 % and 0 % of solar radiation). The maximum mortality rates under <b>ambient</b> solar <b>radiation</b> levels averaged (±standard error of the mean, SEM) 18. 4 ± 5. 8 % h(- 1), five-fold greater than the average mortality {{in the dark for}} the eight taxa tested. The UV-B radiation required for mortality rates to reach ½ of maximum values averaged (±SEM) 12 ± 5. 6 h(- 1) % of incident UVB radiation, equivalent to the UV-B dose at 19. 2 ± 2. 7 m depth in open coastal Red Sea waters. These results confirm that Red Sea zooplankton are highly vulnerable to <b>ambient</b> solar <b>radiation,</b> {{as a consequence of the}} combination of high incident radiation and high water transparency allowing deep penetration of damaging UV-B radiation. These results provide evidence of the significance of <b>ambient</b> solar <b>radiation</b> levels as a stressor of marine zooplankton communities in tropical, oligotrophic waters. Because the oligotrophic ocean extends across 70 % of the ocean surface, solar radiation can be a globally-significant stressor for the ocean ecosystem, by constraining zooplankton use of the upper levels of the water column and, therefore, the efficiency of food transfer up the food web in the oligotrophic ocean...|$|R

We have measured photochemical efficiencies of PS II and ETS activity, reflectance and trasmittance, and determined clorophyll a and b, carotenoids and anthocyanins in invastigated leaves. We observed the influence on dry and fresh mass, in underground and overground parts of plant, and also determined morphological and anatomical leaf properties. The treatments influenced the transpiration, potential photochemical efficiency of PS II and activity of terminal electron transport system. The treatmentsexcited less effect on morphological poperties, because it was observed only in fresh leaves. Influence of interacions of both factor is shown in stoma and trychomes. The way we treated the plants had influenced concentrations of pigmentation, because plants that were treated with Se+UV+the lowest concetration of chlorophyll a, clorophyll b and carotenoids.

All sexually immature adults remained on perches in sunflecks in deciduous forests. They controlled their thoracic temperature against radiant heat load in similar manner. After maturation, territorial males, with orange wings, were seen to spend much time perching in open streams, increasing the degree of thermoregulation. They changed some physiological properties, {{probably due to the}} quantity of haemolymph because of decline in water content of the thorax. Although there was a similar decline in water content of mature females, with orange wings, change in the body temperature did not show higher degree of thermoregulation because of their perching behavior for mating in open streams. Both sexes of mature insects with hyaline wings were restricted to deciduous forests. Their water content ratio did not vary with ageing. The response of controlling thoracic temperature to <b>ambient</b> and <b>radiation</b> temperature was similar to that in immature adults.
