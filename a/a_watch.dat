5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration <b>a</b> <b>watch</b> is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue <b>a</b> <b>watch</b> approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>watch</b> post {{existed on}} Punta di Santa Maria (now known as Tigné Point after the fort) in 1417.

After the siege, the peninsula became known as Dragut Point after the Ottoman corsair Dragut.|$|E

5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII {{set his sights}} on {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep <b>a</b> <b>watch</b> on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E

A large stone windmill, which doubled as <b>a</b> <b>watch</b> tower, was built on a hill by late 1686 and featuring machicolation and other castle-like features. The fort was burned down by Iroquois in 1691, with only the mill itself left standing.|$|E

In this position, Lindemann was promoted to Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) on 1 January 1925.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether <b>a</b> <b>watch</b> is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of severe weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the Windward Islands from St. Vincent and the Grenadines south to Trinidad and Tobago. One hour later, the watch was extended to Saint Lucia. Later that day, the watches were upgraded to warnings in Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada. On October 1, Trinidad's warning was downgraded to <b>a</b> <b>watch.</b> After that, the watches and warnings were gradually discontinued, first in Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, then Trinidad and Saint Lucia, then Tobago, and finally Grenada. In response to the approaching hurricane, emergency operations centers in Grenada and both main islands of Trinidad and Tobago were placed on alert.|$|E

5|$|The new {{corporation}} {{was required}} to appoint <b>a</b> <b>Watch</b> Committee and a police force under {{the provisions of the}} County and Borough Police Act 1856. In 1947, the City of Peterborough Constabulary amalgamated with the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary, which had shared its chief constable with Northamptonshire until 1931 and Peterborough thereafter, to form the Peterborough Combined Police force. This, in turn, merged into Mid-Anglia Constabulary in 1965 and was renamed Cambridgeshire Constabulary in 1974. The Fire Brigades Act 1938 made it a requirement for the corporation to maintain a fire brigade; under the Fire Services Act 1947 this function passed to the councils of counties.|$|E
