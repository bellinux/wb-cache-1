50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> outspoken {{and could}} <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> blunt and {{sometimes}} inconsiderate with people he disagreed with. He {{was known to}} have <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> opinionated, sharp of tongue, and occasionally obnoxious, though he tried to portray himself as a strict religious figure.|$|R

5|$|Bushshrikes {{are similar}} in habits to shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch on a bush. Although similar in build to the shrikes, these tend to be either {{colourful}} species or largely black; some species <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> secretive.|$|E
5|$|Seed {{germination}} rates <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> high. One {{study found}} germination rates better than 77% in most batches tested. Seed {{is likely to}} remain viable for a long time, as seed of the closely related B.cuneata remains viable for around ten years.|$|E
5|$|Some of germanium's artificially-produced {{compounds}} <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> reactive {{and present}} an immediate hazard {{to human health}} on exposure. For example, germanium chloride and germane (GeH4) are a liquid and gas, respectively, {{that can be very}} irritating to the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat.|$|E

5|$|Technologically and socially, {{most of the}} civilizations in Eora are in what roughly {{corresponds}} to {{the early stages of}} the Renaissance. Firearms are still a relatively new invention and <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> cumbersome to use; as a result, their use is not widespread. They have, however, proven quite effective against magic users.|$|E
5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> different from those in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> {{similar to}} its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it}} is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations {{of the two}} martins <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> different. Mascarene {{martin has}} a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or {{displays}} of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when begging for food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent. The song of Brazza's martin consists {{of a series of}} short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks. The song becomes increasingly loud, although the final clicks <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> soft. The song {{is similar to that of}} the banded martin, and does not resemble that of the Mascarene martin, suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient. The differences, which <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> significant in infants, gradually disappear as the human body approaches a mature age and body mass index.|$|E

5000|$|The single mix of [...] "Rhythm Bandits" [...] <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> {{different}} from the album version (which <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> beat-based), and <b>is</b> arranged into more of a surf rock style.|$|R
5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of}} an adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% of attempts. Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E
5|$|Ants also <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons in the Master of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E

6000|$|I laughed, of course, {{but he had}} the air {{of being}} {{perfectly}} serious. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> the best thing we could do. I should <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> ready to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|But Lucy only cast {{a frightened}} glance around, and rising {{up with the}} accents of perfect sincerity, said, 'No, papa; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> ready; I <b>am</b> <b>quite</b> happy. I <b>was</b> only silly.' ...|$|R
5|$|Corythosaurus started {{developing}} its crest when {{half the size}} of adults, but Parasaurolophus juveniles grew crests when only 25% as long as adults. Juvenile Corythosaurus, along with adults, had a premaxilla-nasal fontanelle. Young and adult Corythosaurus are similar to Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus but dissimilar to Parasaurolophus in that the sutures of the skull are sinuous, and not smooth and straight. This feature helps differentiate parasaurolophins from lambeosaurins. Generally, the crests of juveniles of lambeosaurines like Corythosaurus, Lambeosaurus, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, parasaurolophines like Parasaurolophus, and primitive lambeosaurines like Kazaklambia <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> alike, although other features can be used to distinguish them.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E
5|$|Fancy rats {{care for}} themselves, {{and are thus}} very {{affordable}} compared to even other small pets. This {{is one of the}} biggest draws to them. Additionally, fancy rats <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> independent, loyal and easily trained, earning them comparison to both cats and dogs. This comparison is merited given fancy rats are considered more intelligent than any other domesticated rodent.|$|E

60|$|If five-year-old Nellie had <b>been</b> <b>quite</b> well Mrs. Campbell {{would have}} taken both her and Mary Margaret and locked up the house. But Nellie had a very bad cold and <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> unfit to go sailing across the harbour on a raw, chilly November day.
