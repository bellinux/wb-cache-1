40|$|Description The target {{equivalence}} range (TEQR) {{design is}} a frequentist {{implementation of the}} modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design and a competitor to the standard 3 + 3 design (3 + 3). The 3 + 3 is the work horse design in Phase I. It is good at determining if a safe dose exits, but provides poor accuracy and precision in estimating the level of toxicity at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The TEQR {{is better than the}} 3 + 3 when compared on: 1) the number of times <b>the</b> dose <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target toxicity level was selected as the MTD, 2) the number of subjects assigned to doses levels, <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> MTD, and 3) the overall trial DLT rate. TEQR more accurately and more precisely estimates the rate of toxicity at the MTD because a larger number of subjects are studied at the MTD dose. The TEQR on average uses fewer subjects and provide reasonably comparable results to the continual reassessment method (CRM) in the number of times <b>the</b> dose <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target toxicity level was selected as the MTD and the number of subjects assigned doses, <b>at,</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearest</b> <b>the</b> target and in overall DLT rate...|$|R

5|$|The antbirds are a {{large family}} of small {{passerine}} birds of subtropical and tropical Central and South America.

5|$|The mass {{extinction}} of marine plankton {{appears to have}} been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, are classified as metalloids.|$|E

5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> surface.|$|E

The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike — also known as the Salisbury Turnpike — was chartered over the trail and extended from Salisbury, Connecticut to the Susquehanna River <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Town of Jericho (now Bainbridge).|$|E

Their home games at Washington–Grizzly Stadium have a near 90% winning percentage and average over 25,000 spectators in attendance. All games are televised throughout Montana. The Grizzlies men's and Lady Griz basketball teams have also been successful at the conference level where they both rank <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> top in attendance, about 4,000 and 3,000 respectively, and play their home games at Dahlberg Arena.|$|E

5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that were collected at the Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were collected. Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E

5|$|A {{knowledge}} of pKa values {{is important for}} the quantitative treatment of systems involving acid–base equilibria in solution. Many applications exist in biochemistry; for example, the pKa values of proteins and amino acid side chains are of major importance for the activity of enzymes and the stability of proteins. Protein pKa values cannot always be measured directly, but may be calculated using theoretical methods. Buffer solutions are used extensively to provide solutions <b>at</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> physiological pH for the study of biochemical reactions; the design of these solutions depends on a {{knowledge of}} the pKa values of their components. Important buffer solutions include MOPS, which provides a solution with pH 7.2, and tricine, which is used in gel electrophoresis. Buffering {{is an essential part of}} acid base physiology including acid–base homeostasis, and is key to understanding disorders such as acid–base imbalance. The isoelectric point of a given molecule is a function of its pK values, so different molecules have different isoelectric points. This permits a technique called isoelectric focusing, which is used for separation of proteins by 2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.|$|E

Legislative reforms have had some positive outcomes for Valuers, however valuers need to continue to maintain high ethical standards, independence and professionalism in valuation practice...|$|R
