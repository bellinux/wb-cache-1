40|$|To {{reduce the}} chances of policy failures, policy makers need {{information}} {{about the effects of}} policies. Sometimes, policy makers can rely on agents who already possess the information. Often, the information does not exist yet. This raises two questions. First, how much resources should be devoted to the production of information? Second should information be produced by a profitmaximizing firm (a private consultant) or by someone who has an interest in policy outcomes (<b>a</b> political <b>adviser)</b> ? This paper shows that policy makers may prefer hiring <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> for two reasons. First, in contrast to a private consultant, <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> need not be fully compensated for exerting effort. Second, <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> with moderate preferences produces information of a higher expected quality than a private consultant is induced to do by the optimal monetary incentive scheme. The cost of hiring <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> is that she may distort policy decisions by manipulating information. As long as <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> is not too biassed, the policy maker prefers consulting <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> to consulting <b>a</b> private consultant, even if <b>a</b> political <b>adviser</b> and <b>a</b> private consultant are equally costly. Competition among political advisers is shown to reduce the willingness of political advisers to produce information...|$|R
