40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{description}} of the wood anatomy of Blepharocalyx salicifolius (H. B. K.) Berg (Myrtaceae). There were collected 6 samples of wood, three from Serra do Sudeste and the others from Campos de Cima da Serra - RS. The wood microtechnique followed the standard procedures used in the Wood Anatomy Laboratory of the Federal University of Paraná. For the maceration of wood sticks, the Jeffrey method was used. The wood anatomy agrees, in general lines, with the typical standard of this family, congregating a large number of narrow and solitary vessels, with simple perforation plates, besides diffuse <b>apotracheal</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> heterogeneous rays and bordered pit fibres. The presence of rhomboid chrystals and the absence of vasicentric tracheids permit to discriminate the studied species from other previously described myrtacean woods, that are native of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. </p...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are reported for one species of Martynia (Martyniaceae) and for seven species of six genera of Pedaliaceae. The inclusion of woody annuals {{as well as}} of shrubs provides a broader picture ofPedaliaceae than hitherto available. The wood features of Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae (listed in the Systematic Conclusions) are compatible with placement of these families in Scrophulariales (Bignoniales). Ifindividual features of the two families are compared with those of other families of the order, however, no one family can be cited as more closely related to Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae than any other. Martyniaceae is not necessarily the family closest to Pedaliaceae, but its wood is like that of herbaceous Pedaliaceae and may reflect not merely scrophularialean affinity but the similarity of its herbaceousness to that of Pedaliaceae as well. Wide vessels in Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae very likely relate to high transpiration rates in the summer-wet areas where many of them grow. Low vessel density and <b>apotracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> bands that may store water and be related to semisucculence in Sesamothamnus. Thin-walled imperforate tracheary elements and predominance of upright ray cells in Martyniaceae and Pedaliaceae bear a relationship with the herbaceous nature of taxa...|$|E
40|$|Features {{in which}} Agdestis differs from Phytolaccaceae s. s. include {{presence}} of both libriform fibers and vasicentric tracheids (rather {{than one or}} the other); bands and strands of thin-walled <b>apotracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> (in addition to paratracheal scanty parenchyma, and raylessness (also reported for Bougainvillea of Nyctaginaceae, a family close to Phytolaccaceae). Dimorphism in vessel diameter in Agdestis (narrow vessels like libriform fibers in diameter) is attributable to the lianoid habit. Packets of crystals coarser than typical for raphides occur idioblastically in Agdestis, as do raphides in Phytolacca. ln Phytolacca and in other Phytolaccaceae, one finds an unusual feature that occurs in Agdestis: nonbordered simple perforation plates. Anatomical data support Agdestis as forming a mono- generic subfamily within Phytolaccaceae s. l. The nature of successive cambia in Agdestis is compared with those in other Phytolaccaceae and in Nyctaginaceae. A common pattern is probably present, although differences in terminology and observations obscure the pattern. The term 2 ̆ 2 interxylary phloem 2 ̆ 2 is a misnomer because conjunctive tissue is not secondary xylem as generally understood. After cessation of the cambium in the first cylinder, radial rows of cells form outside the phloem and inside the cortex; this activity may constitute a lateral meristem. Apparently within the radial rows of cells, successive cambia form; each of these cambia produce secondary phloem externally and secondary xylem internally. There {{is little or no}} cambial activity in interfascicular areas...|$|E
40|$|Sengon (Falcataria moluccana) is {{fast growing}} species mostly planted by farmers {{due to its}} high productivity. Sengon {{originating}} from Solomon Island has been known with the high productivity eventhough susceptible to gall rust attack; on the other hand, sengon originating from Wamena {{is known to be}} more tolerant to gall rust attack. There is no previous study in terms of stem xylem structures comparing sengon from those seed origins. Therefore, this study was undertaken to identify the differences in anatomical structure of sengon stem; and to compare the xylem cell based on proportions and dimensions of the stems between the two provenances. Six stem samples of tolerant Wamena provenance and six samples of susceptible Solomon provenance were used in this study. Samples were collected from progeny trial of sengon in Lumajang, Jawa Timur. The observations include the anatomical structures and vessel element, <b>parenchyma</b> <b>apotracheal</b> cell, <b>parenchyma</b> paratracheal cell, xylem fiber, fiber length, and fiber diameter. The result showed that {{there was no difference in}} terms of anatomical structures between sengon Wamena (tolerant) and Solomon (susceptible) stem in cross section, tangential and radial section of periderm, phloem, secondary xylem (vessel cell, xylem fiber, and parenchyma xylem) and pith. However, in one of susceptible stem sample, a black reaction zone on the secondary xylem was found. Analysis of variance showed that <b>parenchyma</b> paratracheal cell, <b>apotracheal</b> cell, number of xylem fibers, xylem fiber diameter and length were not significantly different between stem of sengon Wamena (tolerant) and Solomon (susceptible) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the wood of the genera Castilla, Helicostylis, Maquira, Naucleopsis, Olmedia, Perebea and Pseudolmedia, considered to belong in the Olmedieae (cf. Berg 1972) is described. The diversity in anatomical structure between the genera is small, {{and it is hard}} to distinguish Maquira, Perebea and Pseudolmedia from each other. Castilla can be recognized by its thinwalled and wide-lumined fibres, Helicostylis by its parenchyma distribution, Naucleopsis (usually) by its more numerous vessels with a smaller diameter. A more marked difference is shown by the monotypic genus Olmedia with <b>apotracheal</b> banded <b>parenchyma</b> instead of the paratracheal aliform to confluent-banded parenchyma of the other genera. Septate fibres, which are characteristic for the other genera – some species of Helicostylis excepted – are nearly completely absent in Olmedia. This structural difference is considered as an argument in favour of the exclusion of Olmedia from the tribe Olmedieae (Berg 1977) ...|$|R
40|$|Gross and {{anatomical}} {{features of}} eleven lesser known wood species of Mimosaceae. Myristicaceae and Momceae were observed and described for identification pueposes. Fiber dimension were also measured and evaluated for their suitability for pulp manufacturing purposes. Members of Mimosaceae (Adenanthera pavonina and Albizia chinensis) {{are characterized by}} homoselular ray, paratracheal pa-renchyma and vestured pit. Further differenttiation is posibie based on other characters. Members of Myristicaceae (Myristica maxima and Horsfieldia sylvestris) are characterized by <b>apotracheal</b> banded <b>parenchyma.</b> vessels mostly in radial multiples {{and the presence of}} taniniferous tube in ray tissue. Further differentiation is not possible. No spesific features Were found for Moraups but two groups were recognized : 1) those brown in colour with paratrachealparenchyma and white deposit in some of their vessels (5 species) : 2) those white in colaur, aportracheal banded, parenchyma,withoute white deposit in vessel (2 species). Futher differentiation of each group is possible up to genera level. Ten out of eleven species examined contain fibers with medium quality. The rest one species, (Prainea limpato - Moraceae) contain fibers with poor quality...|$|R
40|$|Ebony (Diospyros sp.)   {{is a heavy}} {{hardwood}} that is  {{popularly known}} as blackwood. Diospyros consists of over 300 species spread throughout tropics area and about 100 species occur in Indonesia. Bisbul wood (Diospyros btancoi A. DC.) is one species of  streaked ebony that is locally known as 'buah mentega'.   The anatomical and physical properties of  bisbul  were studied to collect information  for wood identification  and to support appropriate use of the timber. Anatomical properties were studied from microtome sectioned samples, which have been coloured by safranin and mounted by entellan, while fiber dimensions  were studied from macerated samples.   Physical properties  of  bisbul wood studied include moisture content, density and percentage of volumetric shrinkage. Moisture content and density were studied from 20 x 20 x 20 mm samples based on wet and oven dry condition. Volumetric shrinkage was measured from dimension changes in radial, tangential and longitudinal shrinkage of 20 x 20 x 40 mm samples. The samples were measured in wet and oven dry conditions. The main anatomical characteristics to identify bisbul wood were black wood with pinkish streaked, heavy and very hard,  very fine texture, even, lustrous surface and glossy, distinct growth ring, small size of vessels, <b>apotracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> forming reticulate pattern. The average moisture content was 59. 86 ± 2. 84 %,  the density average was 0. 74 ± 0. 04 gr/cm 3   and volumetric shrinkage was 10. 41 ± 0. 70 %.    The higher the stem, the more moisture  content and the lower the density will be. Sapwood density was lower and had more moisture  content than heartwood. The black pinkish heavy wood, bisbul was recommended {{to be used for}} carvings, sculpture, souvenir and luxuryinterior products...|$|E
40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae <b>apotracheal</b> <b>parenchyma</b> bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially included phloem of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} features are presented for 13 collections of 8 species of Ascarina. Wood anatomy is maximally primitive in most respects; moderate exception {{occurs in the}} imperforate tracheary elements, which range from tracheidlike (A. solmsiana) to fiber-tracheids (septate in two species). Perforation plates are scalariform, average more than 100 bars per plate, and have bordered bars. Even more significantly, portions of the primary walls in perforations characteristically fail to dissolve; these pit membrane portions range from nearly intact (much like the pit membranes in pits on end walls of tracheids of vesselless dicotyledons) to remnant strands or flakes. Dissolution of pit membranes in perforations is apparently inhibited by deposition of resinlike substances in some species; the rugose surfaces formed by these deposits may account for a report of vesturing on vessel walls of Ascarina. Axial parenchyma is diffuse, with only very small expressions of diversification; <b>apotracheal</b> banded <b>parenchyma</b> is, however, present in A. swamyana. Wood of Ascarina is highly mesomorphic. With age of plant, vessels increase in diameter, vessel elements and fiber-tracheids increase in length, and rays become wider and have {{a higher proportion of}} procumbent cells; uniseriate rays decrease in abundance. The implications of wood anatomy data on generic distinctions within the family and on the systematic position of Chloranthaceae will be examined when monographs on woods of the other genera have been completed...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{samples of}} 49 {{specimens}} representing 31 species and 11 genera of woody balsaminoids, i. e., Balsaminaceae, Marcgraviaceae, Pellicieraceae, and Tetrameristaceae, were investigated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The wood structure of Marcgraviaceae, Pellicieraceae, and Tetrameristaceae {{is characterized by}} radial vessel multiples with simple perforation plates, alternate vessel pitting, <b>apotracheal</b> and paratracheal <b>parenchyma,</b> septate libriforin fibers, {{and the presence of}} raphides in ray cells. Tetrameristaccae and Pellicieraceae are found to be closely related based on the occurrence of unilaterally compound vessel-ray pitting and multiseriate rays with long uniseriate ends. The narrow rays in Pelliciera are characteristic of this genus, but a broader concept of Tetrameristaceae including Pelliciera is favored. Within Marcgraviaceae, wide rays (more than five-seriate) are typical of the genus Marcgravia. Furthermore, there is evidence that the impact of altitude and habit {{plays an important role in}} the wood structure of this family. The wood structure of Balsaminaceae cannot be compared systematically with other balsaminoids because of their secondary woodiness. Balsaminaceae wood strongly differs due to the presence of exclusively upright ray cells in Impatiens niamniamensis, the absence of rays in Impatiens arguta, and the occurrence of several additional paedomorphic features in both species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the important problems of large cities. In connection with this, comprehensive study of the mechanisms of the corresponding reactions of tree species, introduced in the process of landscaping, to various environmen tal factors is required. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the influence of urban technogenic environmental pollution on the anatomical characteristics of Quercus rubra Linnaeus, 1753 annual shoots. The object of research was 35 -year-old plants of Q. rubra, which grew in a non-polluted site (conditionally clean zone), the Botanical Garden of DNU (plot 1), and in a polluted site (roadside planting) (plot 2) of Dnipro City. Industrial emissions of the city’s western, northeastern and northwest industrial complexes also have an effect on plants, depending on the wind direction. For anatomical research, the annual shoots were taken at the tips of the vegetation from the south-eastern side of the model trees at a height of 2 m and fixed in 70 % alcohol. Cross sections were made at a distance of 1 cm from the beginning of growth. Phloroglucine was used to dye the cells. The influence of industrial and automobile emissions on the structural parameters of Q. rubra shoots was investigated. We established that the membrane thickened evenly in both control and experimental plants. Cork thickness of Q. rubra shoots growing in the roadside plantation was higher than in plants of the Botanical Garden by 57. 5 %. Increasing its thickness in plants exposed to atmospheric air pollution has an adaptive value. Q.  rubra shoots have a tabulate type of collenchyma, the tangent walls of whose cells thicken. The collenchyma cells of the control variant of shoots are larger. This tissue was thicker in Q. rubra shoots from the polluted site by 26. 8 % compared to those from the non-polluted zone. The parenchyma cells of the primary cortex were large and contained chloroplasts. The thickness of this histological element on the shoot circumference varied considerably both in the control and experimental variants, which is the result of its uneven formation. This is due to the fact that the shape of the shoot core resembles a pentagonal star, and the layers of phloem and xylem tissues repeat its shape. The thickness of each of them in the cross section of the shoots in various places varied little, while the parenchyma of the primary cortex above the ray cells was narrower, and between them was thicker, as a result the thickness of the shoots was aligned in a circle. In areas where the parenchyma of the primary cortex was narrower, it was better developed in the shoots of experimental plants than the control ones, but where its layer was thicker, it was more developed in plants of the control variant. The diameter of the primary cortex in the shoots of the experimental variant in its narrower parts was 120. 5 % of the control, and in the broader – 87. 6 %, which is due to unequal changes in the thickness of the primary cortex parenchyma, possibly with different rates of cell division. In the one-year Q. rubra shoots, the hard bast resembled a circle ruptured by parenchymal cells. Environmental pollution does not affect formation of soft bast in Q. rubra annual shoots. The difference between the thickness of the layer of this element in the control and experimental plants was statistically insignificant. The width of the bark (soft and hard bast) somewhat decreased in shoots of the roadside trees due to the thinning-out of the hard bast. The thickness of the wood tissue of the Q. rubra shoots was practically the same in both variants of the experiment, although it is known that the formation of xylem of certain species of plants is sensitive to environmental pollution. According to our data, the distribution of vessels in the wood of the Q. rubra annual shoots on both experimental sites had no clearly expressed annular-vessel type. On the cross section, the vessels are arranged relatively evenly along the width of the entire ring. The location of the woody <b>parenchyma</b> <b>apotracheal</b> does not depend on the location of vessels. Histochemical reactions showed that a large amount of starch grains and fat drops are deposited in the core and ray cells. The diameter of the core was measured in two directions: in narrower and broader places. Plant shoots of the polluted site have a significantly more developed core in the narrower place by 1. 44 times, in the broad – 1. 56 times. The adaptation of the Q. rubra shoots to technogenic pollution takes place through thickening of the cork and collenchyma, thereby reducing the possibility of penetration into the internal tissues of industrial and automotive emissions. There was virtually no change in the thickness of the circle of soft bast and wood in conditions of environmental pollution. In the conditions of multicomponent environmental pollution there are adaptive changes in the parameters of the histological elements of the Q. rubra shoots – thickening of the phellem and structural element of the primary cortex – collenchyma, which helps to protect the internal tissues from the penetration. of pollutants. Environmental pollution practically did not affect the thickness of the layer of soft bast and wood in the Q. rubra shoots. This testifies to the stability of the most important functions of the Q. rubra shoots to phytotoxicants of anthropogenic origin. The components of industrial and automotive emissions have a negative effect on the formation of hard bast and core of Q. rubra shoots, which manifests itself in reduction in their thickness...|$|R
