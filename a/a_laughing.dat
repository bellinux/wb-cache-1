5|$|When You Reach Me is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and write down the location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E
5|$|In October 37 AD, Caligula fell seriously ill, {{or perhaps}} was poisoned. He soon {{recovered}} from his illness, but many {{believed that the}} illness turned the young emperor toward the diabolical: he started to kill off or exile those who were close to him or whom he saw as a serious threat. Perhaps his illness {{reminded him of his}} mortality and of the desire of others to advance into his place. He had his cousin and adopted son Tiberius Gemellus executed – an act that outraged Caligula's and Gemellus's mutual grandmother Antonia Minor. She is said to have committed suicide, although Suetonius hints that Caligula actually poisoned her. He had his father-in-law Marcus Junius Silanus and his brother-in-law Marcus Lepidus executed as well. His uncle Claudius was spared only because Caligula preferred to keep him as <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> stock. His favourite sister Julia Drusilla died in 38 AD of a fever: his other two sisters, Livilla and Agrippina the Younger, were exiled. He hated being the grandson of Agrippa and slandered Augustus by repeating a falsehood that his mother was actually conceived as the result of an incestuous relationship between Augustus and his daughter Julia the Elder.|$|E

The riddle is solved when looking at a company catalog (leaflet) that zooms out showing a clown complete with ruffles and a tall pointed hat and carrying a Fun Ho! sign (Jordan 2015). The clown was most often printed in red, and was even used for company Christmas cards {{once upon a time}} (Jordan 2015). The logo was probably OK from the 1930s through the 1960s, but as an advertising gimmick, the design would probably would not work well with children today.|$|E
25|$|When John II of Aragón (one of the Princes of Aragón) {{broke the}} Truce of Majano (1430) and invaded Castile, King John II of Castile, along with loyal {{followers}} including Bishop Barrientos, {{was forced to}} take shelter in Medina del Campo. Although Medina collected tolls from wayfarers, other than an extensive moat, it had few military fortifications, and was consequently not easily defended. Bishop Barrientos offered {{to act as a}} mediator with the invading forces and apparently obtained beneficial treatment for both sides. Nevertheless, everything points {{to the fact that he}} betrayed his monarch; when John II was celebrating, believing himself to be secure in the heart of Medina del Campo, troops of the Kingdom of Navarre burst into the villa where he was sheltering and took him prisoner. Although he was soon released, his detention made him <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> stock and dishonored the prestige of the crown. It is possible to read into these events, that Barrientos was one of the instigators of the exile of Álvaro de Luna in 1439, preparing the way for the victory of the Princes of Aragón.|$|E

500|$|In 1927, O'Neill {{returned}} to the United States, and by 1937 was living at Bonniebrook permanently. By the 1940s, she had lost the majority of her money and properties, partly through extravagant spending, {{as well as the}} cost of fully supporting her family, her entourage of [...] "artistic" [...] hangers-on, and her first husband. The Great Depression also hurt O'Neill's fortune. During that period, O'Neill was dismayed to find that her work was no longer in demand. After thirty years of popularity, the Kewpie character phenomenon had faded, and photography was replacing illustration as a commercial vehicle. O'Neill experimented with crafting a new doll, eventually creating Little Ho Ho, which was <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> baby Buddha. However, before plans could be finalized for production of the new little figure, the factory burned to the ground.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Killer7 {{occurs when}} the player {{encounters}} enemies called [...] "Heaven Smiles". Smiles announce their presence with <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles.

The player may aim for a [...] "critical point" [...] that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.|$|E

The paper said that it was [...] "...certainly not an anti-Kazakh, anti-Romanian or anti-Semitic" [...] film, but rather [...] "cruelly anti-American ... amazingly funny and sad at the same time." [...] Another favorable word came from Kazakh novelist Sapabek Asip-uly, who suggested Baron Cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the Kazakh Club of Art Patrons. In a letter published by the newspaper Vremya, Asip-uly wrote, [...] "(Borat) has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in Kazakhstan—something our authorities could not do during the years of independence.

Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an inkling of what acting's all about." [...] TV-Radio Mirror {{magazine}} praised Presley's acting over his past roles: [...] "Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> stock. [...] But nobody is laughing now". Meanwhile, The Monthly Film Bulletin criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, [...] "This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie".|$|E
500|$|At first, the Waldorf {{appeared}} {{destined for}} failure.

Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, George Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children on its opening day. The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. The ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid five dollars for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. It soon became a major success, earning $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.|$|E
500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan that perhaps it is only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} 808s & Heartbreak draws heavily on {{electronic}} elements, particularly virtual synthesis, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks. Tracks {{on the album}} utilize step input drum machine and synth-bass parts. Step input sequencing, a product of vintage analogue devices limited to recording only 16 individual notes, was popular in music production during the 1980s, but also became available in digital workstations. The album's music features austere production and elements such as dense drums, lengthy strings, droning synths, and somber piano. Andy Kellman of AllMusic writes of the music, [...] "Several tracks have almost as {{much in common with}} irrefutably bleak post-punk albums, such as New Order's Movement and The Cure's Pornography, as contemporary rap and R" [...] These musical elements help convey moods of despair and dejection that reflect the album's subject matter. NJ.com columnist Trist McCall wrote that the record [...] "stripped modern art-pop down to its iconic rudiments — beats, charismatic personalities, hand-selected melodies, and computer-assisted vocals." [...] Most of the lyrics are directed at an ex-lover; West refers to her treatment of him as [...] "the coldest story ever told" [...] on [...] "Heartless", and on [...] "RoboCop", she is called a [...] "spoiled little L.A. girl" [...] and is compared to the antagonist in the 1990 film Misery. On [...] "Welcome to Heartbreak", West's character faces an existential crisis as he dispassionately recounts sitting alone on a flight, with <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> family seated ahead of him. He longs for his late mother on the album's penultimate track [...] "Coldest Winter", which samples the desolate 1983 song [...] "Memories Fade" [...] by Tears for Fears.|$|E
500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant. She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
500|$|Early on, the Waldorf was <b>a</b> <b>laughing</b> stock {{with its}} {{large number of}} {{bathrooms}} and was known briefly as [...] "Boldt's Folly" [...] after Boldt, or [...] "Astor's Folly", with the general perception of the palatial hotel being {{that it had no}} place in New York City. It appeared destined for failure. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. [...] Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. In the face of all of this, Boldt decided that the hotel would host a benefit concert for St. Mary's Hospital for Children the day after the Waldorf opened. [...] The hospital was the favorite charity of those on the Social Register. [...] Despite the rain, the ballroom filled with many of New York's First Families, who had paid $5.00 for the concert and dinner at the Waldorf. Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt donated the services of the New York Symphony Orchestra led by Walter Damrosch to provide the music for the event. Even with proper escort, women of the times generally did not venture into hotels, but those attending also toured the facilities. While Boldt made news by insisting the Waldorf's waiters be clean-shaven even though he wore a beard, his decision to hire young Oscar Tschirky was one of the key factors in the hotel's success. Oscar was personable, humble and very willing to tend to patrons' needs on an individual basis. More than thirty years later, Tschirky was able to recall the Waldorf's opening day and the names of many of the Social Register guests who made the hotel successful when it hosted the charity concert and dinner. Business soon picked up and it earned $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period. By 1895, the Waldorf added a five story addition. [...] This brought the hotel's ballroom down to the main floor; the move brought many parties and dinners which were formerly held in private homes, into the Waldorf. [...] Adjacent to the new ballroom was the Oak Room, where one could sit by large fireplaces where there were always logs on the hearth. [...] In winter, waiters would offer patrons complimentary baked potatoes with butter.|$|E
