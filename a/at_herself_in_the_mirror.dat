5|$|The seven-minute long video depicts Beyoncé {{playing a}} beauty pageant contest {{representing}} Third Ward, Houston, {{the area in}} which she grew up. It opens with the sound of a poignant piano and shots of Beyoncé sporting short hair, looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> It transitions to a segment of her fellow contestants preparing for the pageant backstage, combing their hair, fitting their dresses and analyzing their bodies; one scene during the preparations shows Beyoncé arguing with another contestant over a hair dryer. Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a three-day-long cocaine binge in 2005, Carlisle {{says she}} looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and [...] "didn't see a light or a soul" [...] in her eyes: [...] "I just thought, ‘I know I don’t look like myself anymore.'" [...] The same morning, {{she had an}} {{auditory}} hallucination telling her she would be found dead {{in a hotel room}} if she did not stop using drugs. The incident jarred Carlisle into seeking sobriety, and she has been sober since 2005.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not easy for him {{to come up with the}} lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and <b>the</b> hook, <b>in</b> spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|R
5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply of trial rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent <b>herself</b> <b>at</b> trial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of a state procedural rule requiring {{a higher standard of}} competence for pro se representation.|$|R
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared into her room and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> and cried.|$|E
60|$|She became {{absorbed in}} gazing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> while she dabbed some powder {{on her nose}} and dabbed it off again.|$|E
60|$|Aline glanced <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> She {{was just}} out of her mistress's range of vision, and she made a little grimace at her reflection.|$|E
25|$|Painters {{depicting}} someone {{gazing into}} a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This {{is a kind}} of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and still photography an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking <b>at</b> him- or <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mirror, and yet the reflection faces <b>the</b> camera. <b>In</b> reality, <b>the</b> actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the program}} Ally McBeal first ran, many women lauded its {{portrayal}} of the lead character. Sharon Waxman, writing for The Washington Post, commented that Kelley had a keen insight into the human nature of both men and women. She quoted Dyan Cannon: [...] "This man understands the way a woman thinks, ... the complex ways we've found to hide our fears." [...] A New York Times writer used the character {{as an example of}} a strong television woman's role, another saw <b>herself,</b> <b>at</b> times, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> character's portrayal of self-absorption and reflection, her crafted neuroses, her vulnerabilities.|$|R
2500|$|Booth {{was still}} {{scarcely}} {{more than a}} young girl when a friend suggested to her that no complete history {{of the city of}} New York had ever been written, and that it might be well to prepare such a one for the use of schools. Although without ambition to attempt the impossible, yet never daunted by the possible, she <b>at</b> once busied <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> undertaking, and, after some years spent in preparation, finished one that became, on the request of a publisher, the basis of a more important work upon the same subject, her material having far outgrown the limits proposed, and her experience having taught her the best way of using it. She knew that it was no petty work, as many of the most stirring events of colonial and national history were connected with its story. During the course of her historical work, Booth had full access to libraries and archives. Washington Irving sent her a letter of cordial encouragement, and D. T. Valentine, Henry B. Dawson, W. J. Davis, E. B. O'Callaghan, and numerous others showered her with documents and every assistance. [...] "My Dear Miss Booth," [...] writes Benson G. Lossing, [...] "the citizens of New York owe you a debt of gratitude for this popular story {{of the life of the}} great metropolis, containing so many important facts in its history, and included in one volume accessible to all. I congratulate you on the completeness of the task and <b>the</b> admirable manner <b>in</b> which it has been performed." [...] <b>The</b> history appeared <b>in</b> one large volume, and met at once with a generous welcome, whose pecuniary results were very considerable. So satisfactory, indeed, was its reception, that the publisher proposed to her to go abroad and write popular histories of the great European capitals, London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. It was a bright vision for the young writer, but the approach of war and other fortuitous circumstances prevented its becoming a reality.|$|R
60|$|With a last admiring glance <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{she came}} into the room. Burton patted her on the arm and waved the wine list away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{put some}} of these violets on me," [...] she said, glancing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and then taking the flowers from their water, she dried them, and {{fastened}} them among her lace.|$|E
60|$|But Violet's {{occasional}} fits {{of weakness}} were never {{of a very}} long duration. She dashed her hand impatiently across her eyes, straightened her tall figure, and laughed as she glanced <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b>|$|E

60|$|The maid {{illuminated}} the darkened room. The Princess gazed <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> and reaching out again {{took a small}} powder-puff from its case and gently dabbed her face. Then she laid both mirror and powder-puff back in their places.|$|E
60|$|The {{electric}} bell rang softly from outside, and the orchestra commenced to play. Lady Ruth rose and looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> Then {{she turned and}} smiled at her visitor. The pallor of her face was no longer unnatural. She was a wonderful woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dearest creature, I {{thought we}} never should get here, for Papa had a {{tiresome}} dinner party, {{and we were}} obliged to stay, you know," [...] cried Rose, the lively sister, shaking out the pretty dress and glancing <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as she fluttered about the room like a butterfly.|$|E

60|$|The {{young man}} sprang {{up to his}} seat and the car glided off. Pamela leaned forward and looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror.</b> There was a shade more colour in her face, perhaps, than usual, but her low waves of {{chestnut}} hair were unruffled. She used her powder puff with attentive skill and leaned back.|$|E
60|$|Margery glanced <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> or at {{as much as}} {{she could}} see of herself: the image {{presented}} was superb. Then she hastily rolled up her old dress, put it in the box, and thrust the latter on a ledge as high as she could reach. Standing on tiptoe, she waved the handkerchief through the upper aperture, and bent to the rift to go out.|$|E
6000|$|... "No roses for me," [...] said Jessie, smiling <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> as she {{fastened}} a {{spray of}} rosy ivy-leaves in the bosom of her fresh white gown that October morning. [...] "I'll be true to my old friend; for it helped me in my dark days, and now it shall rejoice with me in my bright ones, and go on teaching me to climb bravely and patiently toward the light" ...|$|E

60|$|Christina had {{remained}} {{but for a}} moment in the chair which Rowland had placed for her, had given but a cursory glance at the statues, and then, leaving her place, had begun to wander round the room--looking <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror,</b> touching the ornaments and curiosities, glancing at the books and prints. Rowland's sitting-room was encumbered with bric-a-brac, and she found plenty of occupation. Rowland presently joined her, and pointed out some of the objects he most valued.|$|E
60|$|It was of {{pale green}} voile--a colour which brought out admirably the ruddy gloss {{of her hair}} and the clear {{brilliance}} of her skin. When she had finished dressing she looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> with frank delight. Lucinda was not vain, but she was quite {{well aware of the}} fact of her beauty and took an impersonal pleasure in it, as if she were looking at some finely painted picture by a master hand.|$|E
60|$|He {{crossed the}} room a little more slowly than usual, and his sister, who was still {{watching}} him critically, sighed. There was no doubt at all that his walk was becoming the walk of an old man. The stoop of the shoulders was also a new thing. She counted up his age on her fingers, and, rising from her place, looked <b>at</b> <b>herself</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mirror</b> opposite. Her face for a moment was hard and set, and her fingers clenched.|$|E
