The union welcomed paraprofessionals and other school-related personnel—including bus drivers, custodians, cafeteria workers, and others.

25|$|Nursing {{shortage}} is {{not necessarily}} {{due to a lack}} of supply of trained nurses. In some cases, perceived shortages occur simultaneously with increased admission rates of students into nursing schools. Potential factors include lack of adequate staffing ratios in hospitals <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities, lack of placement programs for newly trained nurses, and inadequate worker retention incentives.|$|E
25|$|One of PEF's larger campaigns during Benson's time {{in office}} was {{fighting}} health care cutbacks in New York state. For several years, the union protested against staff layoffs and {{the closure of}} hospitals <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities. PEF also sought increases {{in the number of}} health care workers on staff, an end to mandatory overtime, and minimum worker-to-patient staffing ratios.|$|E

Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas {{where there are no}} pharmacists.|$|E

25|$|Brynien and {{the union}} confronted a state {{proposal}} to close or merge several state-owned hospitals <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities during {{his first year in}} office. A state commission first proposed the plan in November 2006. Brynien and PEF strongly opposed the plan, claiming it would harm patients and lead to lower levels of care. PEF's parent union, SEIU, said it would not oppose the plan. PEF began a series of public protests and a legislative lobbying effort to prevent the closures and mergers. It also sued to prevent the plan from being implemented.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, {{the union}} adopted its current name. In the 1990s, OPEIU began major {{organizing}} drives {{in the insurance}} industry, organizing several thousand workers at CUNA Mutual and Prudential. A similar organizing drive at Allstate ended after the National Labor Relations Board ruled that the 10,000 workers were independent contractors. OPEIU also began organizing {{in the health care}} industry, organizing office workers at a number of health insurers. But it also began organizing registered nurses <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> workers in limited numbers around the United States. In 1998, the much-raided collective bargaining arm of the Pennsylvania Nurses Association affiliated with OPEIU, adding 2,500 nurses to the union's rolls.

25|$|The Greens {{base their}} health {{policies}} on prevention, and claim to consider health {{in areas such}} as organic agriculture, active transportation, urban planning, and education. In particular, party policy closely links the areas of disease prevention and environmental health, with policies such a ban on cosmetic pesticides, a Cancer Prevention Act, and doubling funding for the Ministry of Health Promotion. Policies on health care include expanding the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) system, increasing support for multidisciplinary clinics (those with doctors, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> professionals), and increasing support for midwifery, along with a number of administrative reforms. GPO policy emphasizes a reduction in health care costs through avoidance of illness and expansion of alternative access models (such as CCACs), rather than simply closing facilities or increasing expenditures.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{positive}} relationship between national wealth and good health. The rich and industrialized countries of the world, prominently Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, spend a large proportion of their wealthy budget on the health care system. As, a result, their health care systems are very sophisticated, with many physicians, nurses, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> experts servicing the population. Thus, infant mortality is low. On the other hand, a country such as Mexico, which spends disproportionately less of its budget on healthcare, suffers from high mortality rates. This is because the general population is likely to be less healthy. In the U.S., infant mortality rates are especially high in minority groups. For instance, non-Hispanic black women have an infant mortality rate of 13.63 per 1000 live births whereas in non-Hispanic white women it was much lower at a rate of 5.76 per 1000 live births. The average infant mortality rate in the U.S. is 6.8 per 1000 live births.|$|E

Background: Because ankle sprains are a common and often disabling injury in athletes, athletic trainers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> sports <b>health</b> <b>care</b> professionals {{must be able to}} implement the most current and evidence-supported treatment strategies to ensure safe and rapid return to play. Equally important is initiating preventive measures to mitigate both first-time sprains and the chance of reinjury.

2500|$|Just as {{the more}} loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs {{themselves}} have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were [...] "staff-model" [...] HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> professionals who staffed them. The name health maintenance organization stems from {{the idea that the}} HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.|$|E
