5|$|People {{struggled}} to survive together, and a rich culture based on shebeens (informal and mostly illegal pubs), mbaqanga music and beer-brewing developed. The shebeens {{were one of}} the main forms of entertainment. People came to the shebeens not only for skokiaan or baberton (illegally self-made alcoholic beverages), but to talk about their daily worries, their political ideas and their fears and hopes. In these shebeens the politicians tried to influence others <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to conform to their form of thinking. If one disagreed he immediately became suspect and was classified as a police informer.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E

Using a small helicopter and nonlethal weapons, the player is able to spirit the delegates to a French frigate somewhere in the Taedong River <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> out of the country; other delegates left behind are sent to bomb shelters or are evacuated by STRIKE Chinook transports. Also, between escorting the delegates to safety, the player and Andrea manage to take over an AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter from a museum while fending off Kym's security forces in the process. The missing nuclear weapon explodes as the player sits out the blast in the Rungnado May Day Stadium.|$|E

5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical warbles and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.|$|E

At the beginning of every episode, after the titles had aired, a prerecorded segment was played in which the presenters emerged from the lift in the studio in a costume (e.g. Aeroplanes) whilst a song relating to the costume was played.

25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and wondering how species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds in brine then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation {{brought him back to}} animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} a number of {{parallels}} with long-running BBC comedy Only Fools and Horses, with both being set in London and involving lovable dodgy dealers with endless get-rich-quick schemes that invariably backfire <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> into trouble (and both of whom tried to make out to be of a higher status than they really were), and both having a blend of comedy and drama. Indeed, Only Fools and Horses creator / writer John Sullivan claimed that one of the ways he persuaded the BBC to commission the series was by pointing to the success of ITV's Minder, which had begun the previous year. After both having lukewarm starts, both series went on to become huge hits, and share much of the same fan base. At Christmas 1985, specials of Only Fools and Horses and Minder were scheduled against each other, angering many viewers (in the days before video recorders were commonplace in many UK homes).|$|E
25|$|Amrita Sher-Gil {{was born}} on 30 January 1913 in Budapest, Hungary, to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Sikh aristocrat and a scholar in Sanskrit and Persian, and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer who came from an {{affluent}} bourgeois family. Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore. Her mother came to India as a companion of Princess Bamba Sutherland, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (née Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist Vivan Sundaram. She spent most of early childhood in Budapest. She was the niece of Indologist Ervin Baktay. Baktay noticed Sher-Gil's artistic talents {{during his visit to}} Shimla in 1926 and was an advocate of Sher-Gil pursuing art. He guided her by critiquing her work and gave her an academic foundation to grow on. When she was a young girl she would paint the servants in her house, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to model for her. The memories of these models would eventually lead to her return to India. Her first teachers were Major Whitmarsh, who was later replaced by Beven Pateman. She attended Santa Annuciata, Florence.|$|E

25|$|FLOC {{was founded}} in September 1967 by Baldemar Velásquez and his father. Velásquez had been deeply {{influenced}} by the ideas of César Chávez, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Initially, his goal was merely to organize the farmworkers {{so that they could}} cooperate with the growers to improve pay, housing, and education for the pickers. Sensing that the farmworkers would not take a 20-year-old student seriously, Velásquez relied on his father to gather the employees <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to listen to him. He even sent volunteer organizers to Texas during the winter to talk to and organize the workers during their months away from work. But the effort largely failed, and in September 1968 Velásquez called a strike against 10 tomato growers in Ohio. Five growers signed contracts recognizing the union, agreeing to a minimum wage and limited health insurance, and promising not to discriminate against union members or union organizers. Within a few weeks, 21 other growers had agreed to contracts with FLOC as well. But in the following year, sustained anti-union opposition from the growers (backed by the American Farm Bureau Federation), the withdrawal of some growers from the tomato market, the refusal of some growers to honor their contracts, and the efforts of some growers to raise wages and improve working conditions (which led employees to abandon the union) caused Velásquez to rethink his organizing strategy.|$|E
500|$|Although Alkin {{acted as}} one of the newsbook sellers, between 1650 and 1651 she {{published}} several short-lived newsbooks, including The Impartial Scout, The Moderne Intelligencer, Mercurius Anglicus (formerly a royalist title which she appropriated) and Mercurius Scoticus, or, The Royal Messenger. Clarke believes Alkin may have used formerly royalist titles, or royalist-sounding names to win the confidence of royalist sympathisers, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to reveal the location of illicit printers. The historian Marcus Nevitt disagrees, and argues that Alkin was [...] "reappropriating Royalist titles for Parliamentarian consumption".

Cecil and Bacon in particular took pains to find the most promising young men <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to join the Inn. In 1574 it was the largest of all the Inns of Court by number, with 120 barristers, and by 1619 it had a membership of more than 200 barristers.|$|E

[...] Since then, the Horse Project has gained momentum and participation; horses can be found tied to rings throughout the city, especially in east Portland.

Horses are often defaced or go missing.|$|E
