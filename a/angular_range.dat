Abstract Differential cross sections (DCS) for inelastic electron scattering to the n = 2 states in helium have been measured at incident energies of 80 eV, 100 eV and 120 eV. These DCS have been determined across the complete <b>angular</b> scattering <b>range</b> (0 ° to 180 °) using a magnetic angle changer (MAC) with a soft-iron core. The converging close-coupling (CCC), R-matrix with pseudostates (RMPS), and B-spline R-matrix (BSR) {{methods have been}} used to calculate these DCS. Agreement between the experimental data and the predictions from these highly sophisticated theoretical methods is generally good. The remaining discrepancies mainly occur at small and large angles for the triplet states 2 3 S and 2 3 P, whereas excellent agreement is found between 30 º- 150 º. The small-angle differences are likely due to contamination of the observed experimental signal from the neighbouring 2 1 S and 2 1 P states.
