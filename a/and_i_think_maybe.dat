5000|$|I love that! I was so {{stunned when}} I first heard it. I {{thought it was}} wonderful. It's very rare for people to cover my songs. I {{think there are a}} couple of reasons. One is they're {{personal}} - they don't have a universal quality to them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> it's because I've already sung them, and who wants to compete with that? But it's always flattering when somebody does.|$|E
5000|$|Veganism and {{straight}} edge beliefs {{are becoming more}} prominent in the hardcore scene, and in Adelaide in particular, according to McCall. [...] "I'd say Adelaide has probably got the biggest straight edge/vegan scene in Australia. In Byron there's about five straight edge kids <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> two kids that are vegan and that's about it," [...] McCall laughs. [...] "I'm vegetarian myself and there's a couple of us that are straight edge, but we just wanna have fun and play music. We do believe {{in trying to make}} a difference in some way, but as a whole we don't really champion any beliefs. We're just a hardcore band!" ...|$|E

He rips and riffs and goes places that horn players aren’t {{supposed}} to go without a net, map, seat belt, crash helmet, overhead air support, and a note from their mothers. And he does so with extraordinary ease <b>and</b> musicality. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> nobody ever told him ‘Jazz playing on horn is very difficult, and probably not natural or perhaps the phrase does not translate into Russian.’ I’d walk a camel a mile to hear this guy.” ...|$|R

5000|$|It took Koenig {{a decade}} to bring the film to fruition. He {{initially}} wrote the lead role for himself, but reevaluated his view [...] "that the audience would buy me as a romantic interest", and offered it to Battlestar Galactica's Richard Hatch. He also considered playing attorney Ellis: [...] "In retrospect, I {{might have had a}} great deal of fun playing the lawyer — which, I have to admit, Erick Avari so brilliantly played — but I love comedy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> I could've brought something to it." [...] He chose the role of antagonist Dr. Schilling instead: [...] "I've played heavies before — I had a recurring role on Babylon Five as one — so I'm not unfamiliar with emotional mechanisms and mechanics that go along with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a late 2012 interview, Cronenberg {{provided}} {{additional details}} on why the project had stalled, citing [...] Budget constraints <b>and</b> other things. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> the script that I wrote {{was a little too}} radical for Fox, and they felt it really needed to be a very low-budget film at that point. However, what was in it that attracted them could not be done low-budget. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that was the problem. [...] He also described the project as [...] "more of a sequel or a sidebar. It was a meditation on fly-ness. None of the same characters or anything and, of course, with an understanding of modern technology." ...|$|R
5000|$|McGhee {{improved}} as {{an athlete}} from his freshman year to his sophomore year. Eastern Washington University's defensive coordinator John Graham said, “Nothing seems to rattle him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he’s <b>maybe</b> even staying in the pocket longer and not panicking and taking off running {{as much as he}} did as a freshman.” The fall of his sophomore season, the team voted him one of the three captains. [...] One of McGhee’s best games of his sophomore season was against Portland State. His statistics were good; he completed 15 of his 22 passes, and had no turn overs. [...] After that game against PSU, McGhee was awarded Big Sky Offensive Player of the Week. He was also in the running for the Walter Payton Award and was in the final 20, along with 9 other quarterbacks.McGhee led MSU to its first playoff win since 2006 when it beat New Hampshire 26-25 in Bozeman. McGhee ran for two touchdowns and threw for another as the Bobcats advanced to the FCS quarterfinals.|$|R

You ever heard that song Pancho <b>and</b> Lefty? <b>I</b> wrote that', <b>and</b> they looked back around and {{they looked at each other}} and started grinning, and it turns out that their squad car, you know their partnership, it was two guys, it was an Anglo and a Hispanic, and it turns out, they're called Pancho <b>and</b> Lefty ... so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> that's what it's about, those two guys ... I hope I never see them again." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tracks on}} the album were {{recorded}} raw and live with no overdubs to capture {{the energy of the}} band. The band urged Bowie to avoid re-writing his lyrics: [...] "They were there all the time saying, 'Don't wimp out,' sing like you wrote it. Stand by it. <b>I</b> have done <b>and</b> frequently do censor myself in terms of lyrics. I say one thing <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> 'Ah <b>maybe</b> I'll just take the edge off that a bit." [...] He elaborated, [...] "We wanted {{to come out of the}} box with energy, the energy we felt when we were writing and playing. There's very, very little over-dubbing on album. For us it is our live sound." [...] There were no demos made for the album; Gabrels said [...] "Basically the album is the demo." ...|$|R

5000|$|Libby's {{relationship}} with Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald) {{comes to an}} abrupt end after he kisses Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor-Cotter), but Libby soon finds romance again with Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker). Valentine told TV Week that Libby decides that she has had enough of Darren and their relationship is over for good. Then {{over the next few months}} there is a hint of romance for Libby and Dan. Tucker said that there is [...] "an immediate attraction" [...] for Dan when it comes to Libby. Dan hides some secrets from Libby and when she discovers them, there is [...] "an emotional upset." [...] Valentine explained [...] "Libby will begin to feel like she's being constantly let down by men. She can't seem to take a trick. Guys just keep disappointing her." [...] Tucker added that it was never planned for Libby and Dan to have a trouble free relationship, although he previously thought otherwise. When she was asked to choose between Dan and Drew, Valentine chose Dan and she explained [...] "I do honestly think that Dan is more her match. ... <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> Dan <b>and</b> Libby are very similar like with their careers - they've got a lot more in common, they're both teachers and they're both very articulate <b>and</b> educated. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> Libby <b>and</b> Dan can entertain each other a little bit more, in many different ways, than Libby and Drew could." [...] Libby and Dan's relationship does not run smoothly and Dan's ex-wife Samantha (Simone Buchanan) causes problems for them. Sam lies to Dan that she is pregnant with his child and when the lie is exposed, Libby sees Dan is upset that he does not have a child. Valentine told Digital Spy; [...] "when Libby sees how upset Dan is about it all, she desperately wants him to have his own child. So for the next few months, we've got this long-term storyline based around Libby wanting to have a baby with Dan which we all know is incredibly risky because she could die if she has another baby." ...|$|R

So we came up {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>maybe</b> {{one of the}} {{purposes}} of music is to transcend politics, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> when you're judging music with a political criteria, you're ignoring a lot, because music is not political. Music is notes and things swirling around in the air. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the bulk of the critical establishment favorably reviews music because of a political slant, not because of the music at all, and it kind of misrepresents what the thing is about. Also, I feel like any time a magazine favorably reviews a left-wing band, à la maybe The Mekons or The Clash, that just opens up the door to the right-leaning bands, [...] "Oh, it's cool to be political in a rock band? Cool, we'll start Skrewdriver.” It gets so asinine, and it was only our statement to keep your politics out of our music and my music.|$|R
