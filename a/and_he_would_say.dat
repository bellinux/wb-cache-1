In an {{interview}} with Creative Screenwriting, Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if Iñárritu would {{even be able to}} film some of the sequences they wrote. He recalled, [...] "He would have some ideas and I would say, 'Alejandro, we can’t pull this off.

And he'd say, 'Baby, wow!' And then he'd film me, like, peeing in a cup and, like, ridiculous things." ...|$|E

Harrison was admittedly still [...] "camera-shy", so Heston [...] "taught me to favour the camera. Don't look right into it.

2500|$|After he recovered, he made {{a second}} effort and {{went back into the}} desert to a farther {{mountain}} by the Nile called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite Arsinoe. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned Roman fort for some 20 years. According to Athanasius, the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, [...] "If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me." [...] At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> a few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrative}} for Overwatch {{is led by}} Blizzard's senior game designer Michael Chu. Creating {{a narrative}} for the game was a challenge compared to past Blizzard titles as the game lacks a single-player mode or a traditional story-telling mechanic. Instead, the story crafters for the game sought to create a spanning narrative that could be interjected into the game through short in-game dialogue and unlockable hero skins. A March 2017 patch for the game added short character biographies, as well as lore details about specific character skins in the Hero Gallery. Outside of the game, the narrative is primarily driven by a transmedia storytelling method, which includes animated shorts and digitally released comics. This gives the developers some flexibility as to where they can take the story as Overwatch is expanded over the years. The narrative can still be seen being hinted at through map environments and character dialogue within the game itself; Chu explains that [...] "you get a character like Soldier: 76 and he says, like: 'back in my day we'd have this payload delivered'. And then you get a character like Zenyatta, the robot monk, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> something like, [...] "becoming one with the objective." [...] So we find these ways to really differentiate them and it makes for unexpected and sometimes ridiculous lines." [...] Blizzard also found ways to include narrative elements through limited-time events, such as the [...] "Junkenstein's Revenge" [...] event during October 2016 and the April 2017 [...] "Uprising" [...] event. Chu said that with these types of events, they will encourage players to explore the other forms of media that Blizzard is using to develop the Overwatch narrative, as well as prompt fans to continue to explore and speculate on the world and characters they created.|$|E

6000|$|Disappointed is {{not just}} the word, for the ladies did not really expect him to do what he said. They pretended to believe him when he promised, but at the bottom of their hearts they never did or could. He was gentle-mannered and soft-spoken, and when he set his head on one side, and said that a coat would be ready on Wednesday, or a dress on Saturday, and {{repeated}} his promise upon the same lady's expressed doubt, she would catch her breath and say that now she absolutely must have it on the day named, for otherwise she would not have a thing to put on.

He took his glass without any grimaces, smiled whenever he said any thing, though I could not understand a word he said, and answered all my remarks quite as civilly as if he spoke English. I must say, I think Mr. Dodge manifested a want of consideration in quitting his company with so little ceremony. The gentleman was hurt, I'll answer for it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> as much if he could only make out to explain himself on the subject.

And so there is not an hour in the day that you do not think of Ochterlony and wonder who he was. It is good that Clive cannot come back, for he would think it was for Plassey; and then that great spirit would be wounded when the revelation came that it was not. Clive would find out that it was for Ochterlony; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle. And he would think it was a great one, too, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "With three {{thousand}} I whipped sixty thousand and founded the Empire--and there is no monument; this other soldier must have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved the world." ...|$|E

[...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> never judged another that he was negligent or proud, but through his kind disposition, saw good in everyone and received benefits from everyone. May the good Lord grant us the same kind disposition, so that we too may receive benefits from everyone and so that we never notice the failings of others.|$|R

Johnson, with whom conversation was everything, used to judge Goldsmith too much by his own colloquial standard, and undervalue him for being less provided than himself with acquired facts, the ammunition of the tongue and often the mere lumber of the memory; others, however, valued him for the native felicity of his thoughts, however carelessly expressed, and for certain good-fellow qualities, less calculated to dazzle than to endear. [...] "It is amazing," [...] said Johnson one day, after he himself had been talking like an oracle; [...] "it is amazing how little Goldsmith knows; he seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else." [...] "Yet," [...] replied Sir Joshua Reynolds, with affectionate promptness, [...] "there is no man whose company is more liked." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hans was {{affected}} differently. He became obsessed {{by the idea}} that it was his duty to kill Dennin; and whenever he waited upon the bound man or watched by him, Edith was troubled by the fear that Hans would add another red entry to the cabin's record. Always he cursed Dennin savagely and handled him roughly. Hans tried to conceal his homicidal mania, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to his wife: [...] "By and by you will want me to kill him, and then I will not kill him. It would make me sick." [...] But more than once, stealing into the room, when it was her watch off, she would catch the two men glaring ferociously at each other, wild animals the pair of them, in Hans's face the lust to kill, in Dennin's the fierceness and savagery of the cornered rat. [...] "Hans!" [...] she would cry, [...] "wake up!" [...] and he would come to a recollection of himself, startled and shamefaced and unrepentant.|$|E

I know the man thoroughly well; he requires a good deal of management. If I offered him the steward's place beforehand, his modesty would get in his way, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> 'No.' If I pitch him into it neck and crop, without a word of warning and with nobody at hand to relieve him of the situation, he'll have nothing for it but to consult my interests, and say 'Yes.'

6000|$|Sir Felix, when {{he promised}} to meet Ruby at the Music Hall on the Tuesday, was under an {{engagement}} to start with Marie Melmotte for New York on the Thursday following, and {{to go down to}} Liverpool on the Wednesday.

The details of his journey were settled between him and Marie, with no inconsiderable assistance from Didon, in the garden of Grosvenor Square, on the previous Sunday,--where the lovers had again met during the hours of morning service. Sir Felix had been astonished at the completion of the preparations which had been made. 'Mind you go by the 5 p.m. train,' Marie said. 'That will take you into Liverpool at 10:15.

6000|$|A man's moral {{responsibility}} for his acts has, in fact, {{nothing to do with}} the causation of these acts, but depends on the frame of mind which accompanies them. Common language tells us this, when it uses [...] "well-disposed" [...] as the equivalent of [...] "good," [...] and [...] "evil-minded" [...] as that of [...] "wicked." [...] If A does something which puts B in a violent passion, it is quite possible to admit that B's passion is the necessary consequence of A's act, and yet to believe that B's fury is morally wrong, or that he ought to control it. In fact, a calm bystander would reason with both on the assumption of moral necessity. He would say to A, [...] "You were wrong in doing a thing which you knew (that is, of the necessity of which you were convinced) would irritate B." [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to B, [...] "You are wrong to give way to passion, for you know its evil effects"--that is the necessary connection between yielding to passion and evil.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems to}} me, for my part, that Mr. Rawdon's {{marriage}} {{was one of}} the honestest actions which we shall have to record in any portion of that gentleman's biography which {{has to do with the}} present history. No one will say it is unmanly to be captivated by a woman, or, being captivated, to marry her; and the admiration, the delight, the passion, the wonder, the unbounded confidence, and frantic adoration with which, by degrees, this big warrior got to regard the little Rebecca, were feelings which the ladies at least will pronounce were not altogether discreditable to him. When she sang, every note thrilled in his dull soul, and tingled through his huge frame. When she spoke, he brought all the force of his brains to listen and wonder. If she was jocular, he used to revolve her jokes in his mind, and explode over them half an hour afterwards in the street, to the surprise of the groom in the tilbury by his side, or the comrade riding with him in Rotten Row. Her words were oracles to him, her smallest actions marked by an infallible grace and wisdom. [...] "How she sings,--how she paints," [...] thought he. [...] "How she rode that kicking mare at Queen's Crawley!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to her in confidential moments, [...] "By Jove, Beck, you're fit to be Commander-in-Chief, or Archbishop of Canterbury, by Jove." [...] Is his case a rare one? and don't we see every day in the world many an honest Hercules at the apron-strings of Omphale, and great whiskered Samsons prostrate in Delilah's lap? ...|$|E
