40|$|During {{the years}} 1991 - 1993, from May till October, specialists from the Federal Republic of Germany {{investigated}} both {{the environmental and}} population radiation exposure due to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union. In the survey an area of approximately 100, 000 km" 2 extending from Tula in Russia to Rovno in the Ukraine was investigated. This area included regions of low and high contamination levels in the three post-Soviet republics of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Up to seven environmental measuring vans from different German institutions {{took part in the}} field study on the determination of the local dose rates and of the burden of environmental samples and foodstuffs. The results agreed fairly well with those obtained by Russian scientists. The body content of radioactive cesium of more than 300, 000 individuals was examined. Up to 7 mobile whole-body counting laboratories were operational with a total number of 20 counters. Each person examined received an official certificate giving the result of the measurement. Observed activity levels were generally much less and in no case higher than the <b>annual</b> <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>intake</b> acceptable for professional radiation workers. Only for about 2 % of the people examined did the results suggest the necessity of further observation by health physicists and physicians similar to the regular medical examination professional radiation workers undergo. The project was supplemented by the individual measurement of external doses. About 7000 thermoluminescence dosemeters were distributed and evaluated in the years 1992 and 1993. The results show a dependence on social and location factors. To complete the programme, blood samples from 100 Ukrainian individuals were investigated in 1993. The results of biological dosimetry show remarkable deviations from the normal distribution.

The establishment and testing of a whole body counter would benefit the Texas A&M Nuclear Science Center (NSC) Health Physics staff and workers by allowing better assessment of a worker's internal exposure. Presently NSC relies exclusively on estimating worker internal exposures through analysis of air samples. With ready access to a whole body counter, emergency and routine bioassay measurements can be made for such exposures. All the associated counter electronic equipment had to be initially tested and repairs and replacements made so that the lung and GI detectors of the counter were operational. The major route for a potential intake at the NSC is inhalation. With this in mind, the focus {{of this study was to}} bring the lung detector into operation and to initially test that part of the counter. The American National Standard Institute (ANSI) in cooperation with the Health Physics Society published a standard, N 1 3. 3 0 "Performance Criteria for Radiobioassay," that provides testing and operational criteria for radiobioassay systems and programs. This standard was used as a guide to initially test the lung detector for adequate performance and provide a basis for estimating minimum detectable activities (MDAs). SeveralsourceswerefabricatedusingguidanceinNI 3. 30 tocalibratea ndtest the lung detector. At the conclusion of this project, the lung detector was tested and shown to be capable of performing to the strict NI 3. 30 criteria. The lung detector was able to detect small fractions of the Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations Part 20 <b>Annual</b> <b>Limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Intake</b> (ALIs). With additional effort, the complete system (all three Nal detectors) could be made operational and become a valued tool for the NSC Health Physics group...|$|R

PM2.5 refers to airborne particulates smaller than 2.5 microns, particles so small that they can be inhaled into the blood system and cause cancer and heart disease. Chiang Mai, Tak, Khon Kaen, Bangkok, and Saraburi were among the worst cities with the highest PM2.5 levels in 2017.|$|R
