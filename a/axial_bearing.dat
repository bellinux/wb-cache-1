40|$|Estimation of <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> {{capacity}} {{plays an}} essential role in pile design. A part from semi-empirical and numerical methods, <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of piles can be either predicted by means of a maintain load test or dynamic load test.

40|$|The bearing {{capacities}} of concrete-filled steel tubes are normally derived through experiments with small-scale specimens, {{but it is}} uncertain whether such derivations are appropriate for the much larger components used in practical engineering. This study therefore investigates the effect of different diameters (219, 426, 630, and 820 [*]mm) on the axial compression of short concrete columns in steel (Q 235) tubes. It is found that the peak nominal stress decreases with increasing specimen size and that the <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity is determined by three separate components: the cylinder compressive strength of the concrete, the improvement in strength due to the confining effect of the steel tube, and the longitudinal strength of the steel tube. At peak load, increases in the specimen diameter reduce the hoop stresses in the steel tube, thereby reducing the strengthening effect of confinement. Vertical stress in the steel tube is increased with diameter; therefore, the <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of the steel tube {{is directly related to}} the specimen size. Size effect coefficients for these three aspects of bearing capacity are defined and used to develop a size-dependent model for predicting the <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of large, concrete-filled steel tubes.

This new-type joint is characterized by keeping the concrete floor slab continuous while breaking the steel tube of the column for the joint, thus joining the slab and the concrete filled steel tubular(CFST) columns at the top and the bottom of the slab. The joint has the advantage of transferring loads dependably, constructing conveniently and saving on the cost. Three groups of experiments (21 specimens contained) were performed to test the safety of the joint and investigate its <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity.

40|$|AbstractA {{kinematic}} hardening {{constitutive model}} with von Mises failure criterion considering cyclic degradation {{was developed to}} analyze the cyclic axial response of single piles in saturated clay. After validation by comparison against published triaxial test results, this model was applied to a numerical simulation developed for computing the <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity of a pile foundation subjected to a cyclic loading. The <b>axial</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity degradation of a single pile under different cyclic load levels and different cyclic load numbers was studied.

In order to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified analysis method based on a simple nonlinear soil model is presented for the cyclic axial capacity degradation of single piles. The results calculated by this simplified analysis are consistent with those of the numerical simulation. Comparisons with laboratory test data suggest that both the finite element method and the simplified analysis method provide reasonable estimates of the axial pile capacity degradation of a single pile after cyclic loading...|$|E

Component-level testing is performed using a miniature radio telemeter embedded in a bearing roller. Contact pressure and temperature are measured with thin-film contact sensors fabricated on steel and glass disks and loaded in an optical EHL (elastohydrodynamic lubrication) test system. ^ Low crosstalk bearing torque measurements were made with a compliant fixed shaft and two RF (radio frequency) proximity sensors. Use of single components for multiple functions permitted the fabrication of a 5 by 9 by 1. 5 millimeter sensor/telemeter weighing 80 milligrams. Data was transmitted using thermal frequency modulation of oscillator tank capacitance. Telemeter output sensitivity of the thermal frequency modulation technique at temperatures above 40 °C was 15 KHz/MHz-°C. A comparative analysis of signal conditioner bandwidth, spatial averaging and capacitive coupling facilitates determination of the speed-limiting aspect of a thin-film contact sensor.
