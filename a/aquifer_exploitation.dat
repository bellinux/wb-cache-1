40|$|The {{impact of}} {{intensive}} <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> {{has been observed}} in numerous places around the world. Mexico is a representative example of this problem. In 2010, 101 out of the 653 aquifers recognized in the country, showed negative social, economic, and environmental effects related to intensive exploitation. The environmental effects include, among others, groundwater level decline, subsidence, attenuation, and drying up of springs, decreased river flow, and deterioration of wáter quality. This study aimed at determining the hydrochemical changes produced by intensive <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> and highlighting water quality modifications, taking as example the Valle de Toluca, Salamanca, and San Luis Potosi aquifers in Mexico’s highlands. There, elements such as fluoride, arsenic, iron, and manganese have been detected, resulting from the introduction of older groundwater with longer residence times and distinctive chemical composition (regional flows). High concentrations of other elements such as chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and vanadium, as well as pathogens, all related to anthropogenic pollution sources (wastewater infiltration, irrigation return flow, and atmospheric pollutants, among others) were also observed.

Subsequently, the existing methodologies in India for assessment of groundwater resources are reviewed to examine: the robustness of the criteria used; and the scientific accuracy of the methodologies and procedures suggested. Finally, the current estimates of groundwater over development for India are reviewed from the perspective of detailed water balance, geology, hydrodynamics, and negative social, economic, ecological and ethical consequences. The paper argues that there are several conceptual issues involved in the assessment of <b>aquifer</b> over <b>exploitation.</b> Over-exploitation is linked to various “undesirable consequences ” of groundwater use that are physical, social, economic, ecological, environmental, and ethical in nature. Further, there are differences in the way undesirable consequences are perceived by different stakeholders.

40|$|Abstract. Groundwater is {{endangered}} by agricultural activities, wastes disposal, <b>aquifer</b> over <b>exploitation</b> and seawater intrusion. The pollution risk is high, as the depth {{to the water}} table is shallow and the aquifers are highly permeable and have poor buffering capacity. Intensive farming activities have also put stress on groundwater quality due to intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides. As a result, concentrations of NO 3 -, SO 4 2 - and PO 4 - 2 are very high. Most of the house owners {{do not have access}} to public sewers, which poses another risk for the aquifers. More than 71. 2 % of the aerial distribution of nitrate concentration is greater than 44. 29 mg/L, thus causing a serious problem. Static water level maps from 1983 to 2000 show the declining of the water level with time. The discharge from Quaternary aquifers exceeds the recharge rates after 1988 resulting in both upward leakage of the deeper high saline water and seawater intrusion. Factor analyses were used to define the factors that affect the groundwater quality. Dissolution and deposition of several minerals, evaporation from the groundwater, human impact on the aquifers, cation exchange, mixing between different waters and rainfall recharge were identified as the main factors impacting the ground waters...|$|R

40|$|A general {{analysis}} of the problems arising from <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> in semi-arid {{areas such as the}} Autonomous Region of Murcia, which belongs to the Segura Basin is presented, with particular reference to the Ascoy-Sopalmo aquifer, which is the most overexploited aquifer in Spain. It has suffered intense overabstraction over the last forty years, given renewable water resources of 2 Mm 3 yr− 1 and abstractions amounting to as much as 55 Mm 3 yr− 1 . This has resulted in the drying of springs, continuous drawdown of water levels (5 m yr− 1 ); piezometric drops (over 30 m in one year, as a consequence of it being a karstic aquifer); increase in pumping costs (elevating water from more than 320 m depth); abandoning of wells (45 reduced to 20), diminishing groundwater reserves, and deteriorating water quality (progressing from a mixed sodium bicarbonate-chloride facies to a sodium chloride one).

40|$|Planning for the {{development}} of new lignite mines in the Ptolemais basin in western Macedonia, Greece, required the investigation of the hydrogeological characteristics of the adjacent karstic <b>aquifer,</b> since open-cast <b>exploitation</b> involves extensive and sustained groundwater table lowering (up to 260 metres). Review and evaluation of existing hydrological-hydrogeological data, in conjunction with the results of recent measurements, shows that groundwater flow is to the southeast in a single highly transitive karstified marble aquifer. An analytical regional flow model based on the finite element method is developed and used to assess the feasibility of the required groundwater table lowering and its effects on the hydrological budget of lake Vegoritis, nine kilometres from the mines and in hydraulic continuity with the karstic aquifer. Model predictions show that the required ground water table lowering is not economically feasible at present and that any sustained large-scale dewatering scheme will significantly increase lake losses within a period done to two years. It is thus concluded that exploitation of the new lignite-bearing horizons should not reach the karstic marbles at the boundary of the basin, but a zone of the relatively impermeable alluvium should be left to act as a seal. This scheme should be combined with partial lowering of the groundwater table to relieve the hydrostatic pressures on the seal, thus increasing the margin of safety against piping and slope failure...|$|R

Using a generalized analytical sharp interface model, we review the salinization history and current status of these aquifers, and quantify their resilience/vulnerability to current and future seawater intrusion forcings. We identify two different critical limits of seawater intrusion under groundwater exploitation and/or climatic stress: a limit of well intrusion, at which intruded seawater reaches key locations of groundwater pumping, and a tipping point of complete seawater intrusion up to the prevailing groundwater divide of a coastal aquifer. Either limit can be reached, and ultimately crossed, under intensive <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> and/or climate-driven change. We show that seawater intrusion vulnerability for different aquifer cases can be directly compared in terms of normalized intrusion performance curves.

40|$|Ongoing hydrogeological {{research}} aims {{to develop}} a correct management model for the Plio-Pleistocene multi-aquifer system of the Albegna River coastal plain (southern Tuscany, Italy); overexploitation of this aquifer for irrigation and tourism has caused seawater intrusion. The conceptual model is based on field and laboratory data collected during the 1995 - 2003 period. Meteoric infiltration and flows from the adjoining carbonate aquifer recharge the aquifer. Natural outflow occurs through a diffuse flow into the sea and river; artificial outflow occurs through intensive extraction of groundwater from wells. Water exchanges in the aquifer occur naturally (leakage, closing of aquitard) and artificially (multiscreened wells). The aquifer was represented by a 3 D finite element model using the FEFLOW numerical code. The model was calibrated for steady-state and transient conditions by matching computed and measured piezometric levels (February 1995 - February 1996). The model helped establish that seawater intrusion is essentially due to withdrawals near the coast during the irrigation season and that it occurs above all in the Osa-Albegna sector, as well as along the river that at times feeds the aquifer.

Groundwater receives significant recharge from infiltrations, percolations of rivers and torrents and costal discharges from karstic volumes. There is also rich surface run-off; there are two springs in the basin, one karstic in Kevalovriso village (40 x 106 m 3 /year) in the north and the springs at Amourio area (13 x 106 m 3 /year), in the alluvial sediments of the basin. Additionally, the basin is crossed by Titarisios River (109 x 106 m 3 /year), which is developed by the conflux of Boulgari and Elasonitikos rivers. In the sub-basin of Domeniko, two aquifers are developed, one unconfined aquifer overlying of lignite deposits, that has low capacity and one confined <b>aquifer</b> underlying. <b>Exploitation</b> of this deposit, demands the destruction of the upper aquifer, but huge problems are not expected during the excavation, except the need for pumping. Attention is required on hydrostatic pressure of the aquifer {{at the bottom of the}} future mine. On the contrary, the smaller reservoir Amouri, it is not probably exploitable because of the hydrogeological and hydrological conditions in the region. Titarisios River crosses the lignite field, and therefore requires a diversion, making the cost of exploiting the deposit, prohibitive. Alongside the rich aquifer across the river, because of the infiltration, there are significant problems of abstractions and slope stability during the extraction, particularly in combination with high pressure water-bearing capacity. These particular conditions of the region may make the lignite deposit of Amourio not economically exploitable. The water quality (surface and groundwater) is good.

In contrast to theoretical approaches which assert that the status of ownership determines water supplier strategies, we argue that supplier strategies depend on the activation of property rights and the specific public policies applied to the resource. These two components of the institutional water regime are thus factors that are more important in explaining the suppliers' strategies than the intrinsic characteristics of the water operator. We thus present two case histories of <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> for drinking and mineral water production; we compare two companies in Belgium, one publicly and one privately owned. This comparison shows that the operator strategy is identical in both cases, regardless of whether the ownership status of the water supplier was public or private. Both companies attempted to appropriate the resource privately in order to maximize its security over the resource and its supply. In each case, the winning strategy consisted in gradually excluding all direct or indirect users of the resource such as competitors, farmers and residents. The aquifer was then effectively protected in quantity and quality over time; however this state of affairs does not necessarily entail sustainability of the resource in a broader sense, as social and economic aspects were not directly considered. © IWA Publishing 2007.

Such characterization in terms of productive capacity may allow a preliminary assessment to be made of the probability of success for a required productivity (i. e. target point). This evaluation is usually carried out by statistical analysis of a geological dataset, which is likely to be influenced by many parameters. Such datasets are often incomplete or unreliable. Therefore, a method for evaluating potential productivity, using probabilistic hydraulic conductivity data, is proposed. The hydraulic characterization of hydrogeologic units is based on the collection of information obtained mainly through pumping tests and their interpretation. The results, expressed in terms of hydraulic conductivity, are summarized in a range of variability that is strictly dependent on the number of performed tests and their spatial distribution in the unit itself. If this range is known, an estimate of well’s yield can be made on a deterministic basis, through Thiem’s relationship for steady state conditions, by setting a value of hydraulic conductivity that corresponds to the average value of the range. The proposed reliability analysis enables to overcome the limitations of the deterministic approach by correlating each calculated flow rate, which is taken to be a design flow rate exceeding the critical flow rate of the hydrogeologic unit, to its probability of failure. Therefore, this approach aims to evaluate the probability of failure of the water system. The preliminary result is to associate the values of <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> with a probability failure function. This outcome can then be used to define the potential solutions in the optimal allocation of the withdrawal by means of reliability analysis that takes into account the uncertainty of the system...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date:June 17, 2017 Globally, as {{surface water}} quality and {{quantity}} diminishes there is increasing reliance on groundwater to buffer water demands of growing populations. Today in many arid regions around the world aquifer pumping rates far exceed recharge rates. Often the groundwater is nonrenewable, or thousands of years old. Despite the known hydrologic connection between surface and groundwater, existing institutions and laws governing surface water are poorly equipped to manage groundwater. While {{there are more than}} 600 international treaties governing surface water, only one treaty worldwide explicitly addresses groundwater allocation. Like many other regions of the world, the treaties covering the Paseo del Norte region shared between Mexico and the United States allocate the quantity and timing of surface water deliveries, yet fail to regulate groundwater abstraction. The three transboundary aquifers shared by two countries and three states (New Mexico/U. S., Texas/U. S., and Chihuahua/MX) within Paseo del Norte study area present an ideal microcosm to closer examine water management institutions across the local, state, national, and international scales. This research assesses the United States and Mexico’s institutional capacity to manage groundwater across each scale. The problem is imminent since the Hueco Bolson transboundary aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for nearly 2 million people and the fresh water is predicted to be completely depleted between 2020 - 2050. The ultimate objective is to identify which future legal, scientific and economic options can best contribute to more sustainable management of transboundary aquifers without compromising water security in both countries. This research proposes three major paths to move forward: {{the first step is to}} increase public awareness of the <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> problem; second, for water managers to accurately plan for future water demands there should be a binational groundwater model built by scientists on both sides of the border; third, an international treaty or regional joint agreement is necessary to legally support groundwater management efforts...|$|E
40|$|The Alto Rio Lerma Irrigation District (ARLID), {{located in}} the state of Guanajuato in Mexico, is an {{agricultural}} area whose sustainability depends partially upon groundwater withdrawal for crop irrigation. Because of high pumping demands and current land-management practices, water levels in the regional groundwater aquifers have declined severely, resulting in aquifer overdraft. The potential adverse consequences of this overdraft cannot be overstated, as the long-term economic viability and environmental integrity of the region is threatened. In order to analyze this economic, environmental, and water use problems in this region, simulation of the agricultural system was performed and associated water use impacts quantified under different management scenarios. Linear programming identified the 12 optimal cropping patterns, and then multi-criteria decision-making methodologies were applied to rank and identify the best cropping pattern (satisficing solution). The GLEAMS model was used to simulate the amounts of water, nitrate, and pesticides in both runoff and percolation for each cropping pattern. In order to quantify the economic and environmental impacts of aquifer overdraft, two attributes were used; pumping costs and an <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation</b> coefficient. Three multiple criteria methods: Q-analysis, ELECTRE II, and the Range of Value Method, were evaluated and the latter method was selected to analyze the payoff matrix for the ARLID, where 12 alternatives, each with 13 attributes, were considered. The results show the best alternative for effectively balancing environmental with economic considerations was the farming practice, consisting of land leveling, growing vegetables such as red tomato, and controlled groundwater withdrawals to preserve aquifer sustainability. Low water availability does not necessarily reduce farmer's profits, if new water saving alternatives are applied, combined with more profitable crops. Given that ROV method only considers full compensation between objectives, this research contemplate an extension for the nonlinear case in order to assess the whole range of values of the objective function. The final findings suggest that the best methodology was to apply L 1 in the lower levels and then L 2 for the highest level in the hierarchy. In this manner, the partial compensation between objectives is considered and also the decrease in the uncertainty of alternatives selection...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of space-borne {{geodetic}} techniques, Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) has demonstrated its high performance in measuring surface displacements in different conditions and scenarios, both natural and anthropic. In particular, the advanced DInSAR time series processing method referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS), that allows studying both the spatial and temporal variability of the surface displacements, {{has proven to be}} particularly suitable in different contexts, as for natural hazards (volcanoes, earthquakes and landslides) and human-induced deformation (subsidence due to <b>aquifer</b> <b>exploitation,</b> mining operations, and building of large infrastructures). Recently, an efficient implementation of this algorithm (referred to as P-SBAS approach) has been fully integrated within the Geohazards Thematic Exploitation Platform (GEP) of ESA by the CNR IREA team. The GEP is devoted to the exploitation of EO data resources in {{the context of}} the Geohazard Supersites & Natural Laboratories as well as on the CEOS Pilots on Seismic Hazards and Volcanoes. The GEP ([URL] is sourced with elements, data and processing, including P-SBAS, relevant to the geohazards theme. The integration of the P-SBAS algorithm within GEP resulted in a web-based tool freely available to the scientific community. This tool allows users to process, from their own laptops, the European SAR data archives (ERS, ENVISAT and Sentinel- 1) for obtaining surface displacement maps and time series in a completely unsupervised way, without caring about data download and processing facility procurements. The course is organized in four parts. First, a short overview on the DInSAR processing methods allowing retrieving mean surface deformation maps and displacement time series will be provided, with a specific focus on the SBAS-DInSAR technique. Secondly, the GEP and G-POD environments will be introduced and the P-SBAS web tool will be presented. Subsequently, the advanced features as well as some case studies and results achieved via the web tool are also shown. Finally, some case studies relevant to mountain environments will be presented and analysed.
