40|$|The {{international}} business literature posits {{that the major}} motive for international strategic alliances is to share resources, costs, and risks in foreign operations. Based on the data collected <b>in</b> 233 <b>alliances</b> <b>in</b> low-tech industries and 192 <b>alliances</b> <b>in</b> high-tech industries, this study finds that the argument is tenable in low-tech industries but untenable in high-tech industries. In high-tech industries, international strategic alliances are mainly used to mitigate environmental dynamism. The identification of different functions of international strategic <b>alliances</b> <b>in</b> low-tech and high-tech industries has important managerial implications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934.

However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E
