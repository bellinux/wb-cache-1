5|$|Choughs are monogamous, {{and show}} high partner and site fidelity. Both species build <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> nest of roots, sticks and plant stems lined with grass, fine twiglets or hair. It is {{constructed}} on a ledge, {{in a cave}} or similar fissure in a cliff face, or in man-made locations like abandoned buildings, quarries or dams. Red-billed will also sometimes use occupied buildings such as Mongolian monasteries. The choughs are not colonial, although in suitable habitat several pairs may nest in close proximity.|$|E

A bas relief of the church's secondary patron, San Vicente Ferrer, was prominently {{located on the}} center of the facade. A string of finely cut coral stones, molded into flowers, could be seen on the lower cornice of the facade. Beside the façade was an extension of <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> belfry.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover his modest living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> file on Feynman.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem quality or size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E
5|$|The defence was {{supported}} by a strong artillery component that included 41 Breda Model 35 20mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47mm antitank guns; 26 Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifles; 41 Cannone da 65/17 modello 13 65mm infantry support guns; 147 Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 75mm and 77mm field guns; 76 Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 and Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider 105mm guns; and 27 120mm and Obice da 149/12 modello 14 149mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of them quite old, created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the fuses were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The Breda 30, the principal light machine gun, had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming. The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 was <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal medium machine gun, the Breda M37, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced rate of fire. Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} in 2006 that the {{deliberate}} structural distortion of a Mn6 compound {{by the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> salicylaldoxime derivative switches the intra-triangular magnetic exchange from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic, resulting in an S = 12 ground state.|$|E

25|$|In the {{presence}} of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> p-(dimethylamino)phenyl substituent above {{the plane of the}} molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity.|$|E
25|$|The {{adequacy}} of surgical resection {{is a major}} factor in determining the role of postoperative adjuvant therapy. In the presence of a positive margin on pathological examination, most radiation oncologists recommend radiation to the primary site, and concurrent chemotherapy. A negative margin {{is more likely to be}} treted with lower doses and a smaller treatment volume. Also the removal of <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> tumour may allow reduced dosage to adjacent uninvolved pharyngeal structures and hence less effect on normal swallowing.|$|E
25|$|With {{the season}} opener against {{defending}} national champion Clemson looming, the Bulldogs received bad news when Walker suffered a fractured right thumb in practice on August 21, 1982. He {{was expected to be}} out of action for 3–6 weeks. When the two teams met on September 6, Walker wore <b>a</b> <b>bulky,</b> padded cast on his right thumb. In this tight game, Walker was used primarily as a decoy and rushed 11 times for 20 yards. The Georgia defense made up for its injured star by shutting down Clemson, limiting the Tigers to 249 total yards of offense as the Bulldogs prevailed, 13–7.|$|E
50|$|Overall, Titanis {{was very}} similar to the South American Phorusrhacos and Devincenzia, its closest relatives. However, it differs from these in having a shorter, thicker neck, <b>a</b> <b>bulkier</b> head, and <b>an</b> overall more heavily built bodily structure. Little is known of its body structure, but it seems to have been less wide-footed than Devincenzia, with a {{proportionally}} much stronger middle toe.|$|R

25|$|Starting {{with his}} first book Tergiversaciones in 1925, {{every one of his}} {{published}} books of poetry that was directed by him were named in order as mamotretos, which in Spanish loosely refers to <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> jumbled collection of writings that could be loosely interpreted as a tome. The name was both an example of de Greiff's masterful use of language and his humbleness towards his work and himself. His eighth and last mamotreto would be Nova et Vetera, published a year before his death, and was a collection of new and old found poems of his from even before Panida.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} {{is located}} in the wide end of the re-entry cone, where it can be larger, and thus more powerful. The usual arrangement is to put the heavier, denser secondary in the narrow end for greater aerodynamic stability during re-entry from outer space, and to allow more room for <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> primary in the wider part of the cone. (The W87 warhead drawing in the W87 article shows the usual arrangement.) Because of this new geometry, the W88 primary uses compact conventional high explosives (CHE) to save space, rather than the more usual, and bulky but safer, insensitive high explosives (IHE). The re-entry cone probably has ballast in the nose for aerodynamic stability.|$|E
25|$|Two migrant field {{workers in}} California on their {{plantation}} during the Great Depression—George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, <b>a</b> <b>bulky,</b> strong man but mentally disabled—are in Soledad {{on their way}} to another part of California. They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet rabbits on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from Weed after Lennie touched a young woman's dress and wouldn't let go, leading to an accusation of rape. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.|$|E
50|$|A modular {{connector}} is {{an electrical}} connector that was originally {{designed for use}} in telephone wiring, but has since been used for many other purposes.

25|$|The takahē is monogamous, with pairs {{remaining}} {{together from}} 12 years to, probably, their entire lives. It builds <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> nest under bushes and scrub, and lays {{one to three}} buff eggs. The chick survival rate is 73-97%. Recently, human intervention has been required to maintain the breeding success of the takahē, which is relatively low in the wild compared to other, less threatened species, so methods such as the removal of infertile eggs from nests and the captive rearing of chicks have been introduced to manage the takahē population. The Fiordland takahē population has a successful degree of reproductive output due to these management methods: the number of chicks per pairing with infertile egg removal and captive rearing is 0.66, compared to 0.43 for regions without any breeding management.|$|E
25|$|The {{fountain}} {{is a large}} granite surface, {{forming an}} elongated backrest, measuring about 3 metres wide and 1.20 metres high. On {{the left of the}} rock is a carved human figure, about 1.10 metres tall, upright, but deteriorated, and possibly male with a beard, wrapped in a toga, holding in his left arm <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> object. It is flanked above by Latin inscription, the first word partially cut into the stone. To the right of the figure (just slightly below) is a rectangular building cut into the rock, about 0.7 metres high, 0.6 metres wide and 0.12 deep, with the worn figure of human head. The little house is crowned by a triangular pediment with a bird engraved into its triangular form, while other Latin inscriptions are engraved into its sides, extending to the base. At the base of this granite structure flows the fountain's water.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod {{design was}} based on that of the Comet 4 civil {{airliner}} which had {{reached the end of}} its commercial life (the first two prototype Nimrods, XV148 & XV147 were built from two final unfinished Comet 4C airframes). The Comet's turbojet engines were replaced by Rolls-Royce Spey turbofans for better fuel efficiency, particularly at the low altitudes required for maritime patrol. Major fuselage changes were made, including an internal weapons bay, an extended nose for radar, a new tail with electronic warfare (ESM) sensors mounted in <b>a</b> <b>bulky</b> fairing, and a MAD (magnetic anomaly detector) boom. After the first flight in May 1967, the RAF ordered a total of 46 Nimrod MR1s. The first example (XV230) entered service in October 1969. A total of five squadrons using the type were established; four were permanently based in the UK and a fifth was initially based in Malta.|$|E
