5|$|A large {{percentage}} of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E

5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an undamaged city could be observed.

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary.

5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety.

5|$|Causes include falls, vehicle collisions, and violence.

In addition to the damage caused <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of injury, a variety of events in the minutes to days following the injury may result in secondary injury. These processes include alterations in cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull.
