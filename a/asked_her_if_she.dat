5|$|Another American {{victim of}} sexual trafficking, Sheila White, {{describes}} {{an incident in}} 2003 when she was beaten {{up next to the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She says that nobody even <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> needed help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York. In 2012, after the film was released, Barack Obama, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative.|$|E
5|$|She {{then took}} up {{wheelchair}} basketball, playing for GRBK Gothenburg in the Swedish league, but Sweden had no national women's team. She spent two semesters studying German in Insbruck, {{but there was}} no wheelchair basketball team there, and she began playing for USC Munich, initially for their second team. There, she caught the attention of Holger Glinicki, the coach of the German national team, who <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would like to play for the German national team. She took German citizenship, a relatively painless procedure for an athlete, and made the German national team, which went on to win gold at the 2011 European Championships in Nazareth, Israel, defeating the Netherlands in the final, 48-42.|$|E
5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted to be in the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E

5|$|That morning, {{the police}} interrogated Fischer's girlfriend Marianela at the sheriff's office. They <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had ever had}} cross words with Cristina. She said she had never talked to her, though she was {{confused}} why they asked about his ex-girlfriend. Cisneros was also interrogated, but the police found nothing unusual about her behavior, only that she was nervous, and had left her car keys inside her vehicle. Later that day, Cristina went to Buddy's house and offered her condolences. The police did not treat the Cisneros' connection to Fischer any differently {{than the rest of}} the leads. They knew of Cisneros's calls, but they did not think it was suspicious enough to rule the murder a crime of passion. His stepfather initially thought that the murder was tied to a legal dispute over a contract worth thousands of dollars he had with a Chinese shrimp firm based in Arroyo City, Texas, just north of Brownsville that he had terminated. The police began to investigate this lead, and told Fischer's family that they were probably in danger. For about two weeks, they rarely left their house, and his parents considered sending Kathy and Eric to San Antonio, Texas, where their grandparents lived.|$|E
25|$|The Wilburn Brothers {{listened to}} Patty Ramey and after her {{performance}} <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had ever sung professionally. She {{explained that she}} had worked with Porter Wagoner some and had traveled with him and Dolly Parton on weekends and during the summers. Doyle Wilburn asked {{if she wanted to}} come to Nashville and work with their band to replace their female singer, to which Patty Ramey agreed. Between 1973 and 1975 Patty Ramey traveled with the Wilburns on weekends and during the summers when school was out. Loveless's parents insisted that the Wilburns watch over her while on the road.|$|E
25|$|Another {{reference}} to their simple life {{comes to us}} from the Tasbih of Fatimah, a divine formula that was first given to Fatimah when she asked her father for a kaneez (servant girl) in order to help her with household chores. Her father <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.|$|E

25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> might be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
25|$|Sage {{stated that}} on Sunday afternoon, July 22, Dillinger <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to go}} to the show with them, he and Polly.She asked him what show was he going to see, and he said he would 'like to see the theater around the corner,' meaning the Biograph Theater. She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken, and was going to the store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter. She then returned to the house so Polly would not be suspicious that she went out to call anyone.|$|E
25|$|During {{her early}} period she {{reported}} night time visitations by an apparition of Hor-Ra. He slowly dictated to her, over a twelve-month period, {{the story of}} her previous life. The story took up around seventy pages of cursive hieroglyphic text. It described the life of a young woman in ancient Egypt, called Bentreshyt, who had reincarnated in the person of Dorothy Eady. Bentreshyt ("Harp of Joy") is described in this text as being of humble origin, her mother a vegetable seller and her father a soldier during the reign of Seti I (c.1290 BC to 1279 BC). When she was three, her mother died, and she was placed in the temple of Kom el-Sultan because her father couldn't afford her. There, she was brought up to be a priestess. When she was twelve years old the High Priest <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wished {{to go out into the}} world or stay and become a consecrated virgin. In the absence of full understanding and without a practical alternative, she took the vows.|$|E

25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner table near a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak {{said he had been}} going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

He {{strongly}} advised her not to take acting classes because he believed she already had the necessary skills. When Laurent was 16, Depardieu gave her a part in The Bridge, a drama he starred in and co-directed with Fréderic Auburtin. Laurent played the role of Lisbeth Daboval, the daughter of one of the protagonists of the film, Claire Daboval.|$|E
500|$|Hawks and Hepburn had a {{confrontation}} one day during shooting. While Hepburn was chatting {{with a crew}} member, Hawks yelled [...] "Quiet!"

When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her, she asked what was the matter; Hawks <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never {{to talk to her}} like that again since she was old friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E
500|$|Criticism {{was also}} raised {{regarding}} the relatively few convictions. Despite several people's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party, only Wilson {{was charged with}} assault, and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged. NC1 admitted to having sex with another under-age girl at the party, though he was not charged with that offence. With {{the exception of the}} charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation, nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries. During a report on Radio National, Leigh's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged, he <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew [...] "how much it costs to run an investigation".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, the White House feared {{reaction}} from Congress and the public, {{as well as}} that from radio and television talk shows, in the apparent, if not actual, repetition of the Baird controversy, and asked Wood to withdraw. A further burden was the disclosure that while she was a student in London, Wood had trained for five days as a Playboy bunny. [...] The White House was annoyed with Wood, because they said that when they had initially <b>asked</b> <b>her</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had a [...] "Zoë Baird problem," [...] she had responded in the negatory. [...] Allies of Wood gave a starkly different account and said that she had been fully forthcoming about the details of her dealings with the immigrant.

500|$|When Carey {{compiled}} {{her first}} compilation effort #1's, [...] "When You Believe" [...] {{was included in}} the track listing.
