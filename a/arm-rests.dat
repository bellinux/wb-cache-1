60|$|Evidently Lakamba's mercy went so far--for in a {{short while}} he came {{out from behind the}} curtain--but it did not go to the length of {{inducing}} him to make an extensive toilet. A short red sarong tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment. The merciful ruler of Sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky. He sat in the arm-chair, his knees well apart, his elbows on the <b>arm-rests,</b> his chin on his breast, breathing heavily and waiting malevolently for Dain to open the important talk.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Travers {{got up to}} {{see what}} was wanted, and {{returned}} without uttering a single word to the folding armchair {{by the side of the}} bed-place, with an envelope in her hand which she tore open in the greenish light. Mr. Travers remained incurious but his wife handed to him an unfolded sheet of paper which he condescended to hold up to his eyes. It contained only one line of writing. He let the paper fall on the coverlet and went on reposing as before. It was a sick man's repose. Mrs. Travers in the armchair, with her hands on the <b>arm-rests,</b> had a great dignity of attitude.|$|E

60|$|This {{is as much}} {{almost as}} anyone need know to begin essay writing. Given your proper pen and ink, or pencil and paper, you simply sit down and write the thing. The value of an essay is not its matter, but its mood. You must be comfortable, of course; an easy-chair with <b>arm-rests,</b> slippers, and a book to write upon are usually employed, {{and you must be}} fed recently, and your body clothed with ease rather than grandeur. For the rest, do not trouble to stick to your subject, or any subject; and take no thought for the editor or the reader, for your essay should be as {{spontaneous}} as the lilies of the field.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed instantly, {{and with}} her small hands {{gripping}} the <b>arm-rests</b> of the rude seat cowered in silence, while the clambering monster rushed and roared over the level lands and labored up the grades, shrieking now and again, as if in mingled pain and warning. Johnson and the brakeman, for the most part, kept to the lookout in the turret, and the girl rode alone--rode far, passing swiftly from girlhood to womanhood, so full of enforced meditation were the hours of that ride. It seemed that she was leaving something sweet and care-free behind her, and it was certain that {{she was about to}} face death. She had one perfectly clear conception, and that was that the man who had been most kind to her, and to whom she had given her promise of marriage, was dying and needed her--was calling for her through the night.|$|E
60|$|Along the Embankment, you see, {{there are}} iron seats at regular intervals, seats you cannot lie upon because iron <b>arm-rests</b> prevent that, and each seat, one saw by the lamplight, {{was filled with}} {{crouching}} and drooping figures. Not a vacant place remained, not one vacant place. These were the homeless, and {{they had come to}} sleep here. Now one noted a poor old woman with a shameful battered straw hat awry over her drowsing face, now a young clerk staring before him at despair; now a filthy tramp, and now a bearded, frock-coated, collarless respectability; I remember particularly one ghastly long white neck and white face that lopped backward, choked in some nightmare, awakened, clutched with a bony hand at the bony throat, and sat up and stared angrily as we passed. The wind had a keen edge that night even for us who had dined and were well clad. One crumpled figure coughed and went on coughing--damnably.|$|E

50|$|A rear <b>arm-rest</b> will {{typically}} fold away {{between the}} back seats, {{to allow for}} the central (third) seating place to be used. In some designs where occupant safety is emphasised, including some Volvo models, the armrest doubles as a child seat, complete with specially adjustable seatbelt. As with the front, it is not unusual to have armrests built into rear doors, or the side of the car if there is no rear door.|$|R

'There I found a seat of some yellow {{metal that}} I did not recognize, {{corroded}} in places {{with a kind}} of pinkish rust and half smothered in soft moss, the <b>arm-rests</b> cast and filed into the resemblance of griffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} variants, those {{built for the}} Midland, Scottish, and Eastern / North Eastern regions had six seats per compartment, with fold-up <b>arm-rests</b> which folded into the seat-back, while those built for the Southern and Western regions, with their heavy {{commuter}} loadings into London, had eight seats in each compartment, and no <b>arm-rests.</b> Seating was of the interior sprung bench type.

50|$|While a {{mobility}} scooter eliminates {{much of the}} manual strength problems of an unpowered wheelchair, its tiller steering mechanism still requires upright posture, shoulder and hand strength, and some upper-body mobility and strength. The <b>arm-rest</b> mounted controller typical of powerchair designs may be more suitable for many users. Scooters also have fewer options for body support, such as head or leg rests. They are rarely designed for ease of patient transfer from seat to bed.|$|R
50|$|To serve {{a target}} {{market for a}} low-priced, basic pickup truck, Studebaker {{produced}} a Scotsman truck based on {{the lines of the}} 1949-53 style of grille and front-end sheetmetal, with a few modifications. Most trucks in the 1950s had as standard one tail-lamp, one interior sun visor, one windshield wiper, and one arm-rest—all on the driver's side. The Scotsman followed this philosophy with one exception: there was no <b>arm-rest.</b> Externally, the Scotsman had simple plaid decals and no chrome trim.|$|R

In some cases the controller may be mounted for use by an aide walking behind the chair rather than by the user. Capabilities include turning one drivewheel forward while the other goes backward, thus turning the wheelchair within its own length.|$|R

5000|$|Some guitar makers, like Greg Smallman propose an armrest {{integrated}} to the guitar. An armrest provides {{three primary}} benefits: it lessens damping {{of the top}} caused by the right forearm; it is potentially more comfortable for the player; and it absorbs the wear to the finish that would otherwise happen on the top, the binding, and the side. These benefits are of particular importance for ultra-thin-topped instruments, such as Smallman’s, but will subtly improve any guitar, including double-tops. The Rasgueo-Rest armrest additionally helps large and tall players avoid hunching-over the Guitar, since the Guitar's surface area is in effect, [...] "expanded" [...] using the <b>arm-rest,</b> giving the arm-height support needed for good playing posture.|$|R

40|$|Chronic whole-body {{vibration}} exposure, {{as expected}} in large construction and mining vehicles, {{has been associated}} with neck and back pain and injury. 1 While work has been done towards gaining {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between vibration and shock and muscle activity of the back musculature 2, relatively little information regarding the activity of neck, shoulder and upper arm muscles is known. Today s equipment designs must conform to domestic and international standards, however these standards do not specifically address the vibration exposure in the head and upper quarter. Further it is not well known how the control configuration within a vehicle (e. g. steering wheel versus arm controls) influences muscle voluntary and reflex activity levels. Greater muscle activity may lead to greater muscle fatigue - which in turn may be associated with greater risk of injury. 2 Thus, muscle contractions needed to maintain static postures as well as those resulting reflexively should be considered during an analysis of seating position. Unfortunately, little is known regarding the influence of arm position on head and neck muscle function. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relative muscle activities of 5 neck, shoulder, and upper arm muscles during riding simulations of large construction equipment, using three different arm control options. Methods Five typical heavy equipment ride files were played back through a man-rated Servo Test 6 -degree of freedom (dof) vibration system. Each ride was repeated using 3 seat and control configurations (steering wheel (SW), floor mounted <b>arm-rest</b> controls (FM), seat mounted <b>arm-rest</b> controls (SM)). Two trials were performed for each ride and seat control combination (each trial: 60 sec of 6 -dof and 60 sec of vertical vibration). Five channels of surface electromyography (EMG) of the right-side cervical erector spinae muscles (neck extensors), sternocleidomastoid (neck flexor), upper trapezius (shoulder elevator), biceps brachii (elbow flexor) and triceps brachii (elbow extensor) muscles were collected throughout each ride (~ 2 min) using pre-amplified (10 x), 1 cm silver bar electrodes, with 1 cm fixed inter-electrode distances (Delsys, Inc). Further analog amplification was set at 10 k (1 k for one subject), and sampled at 1000 Hz using a 12 -bit DAQ card and Labview 7. 1 software (National Instruments). A total of 7 right-handed male subjects were tested, but only 5 had complete EMG data sets to analyze for this sub-study. EMG was analyzed using root mean square (RMS, in mV) of 20 ms moving windows, and then averaged across the entire trial for a measure of mean total muscle activity (voluntary and reflexive). The muscle activity to maintain the static posture was estimated as the mean RMS EMG over a 1 sec interval just prior to and/or after completion of the ride. Repeated Measures ANOVAs were used to test for with-in subject differences using ? = 0. 05...|$|R
