Detailed soil survey (scale 1 : 25 000) was {{conducted}} to classify, characterise and determine status of the soils of the plateau of SMNP. Umbric Andosols, Luvic Andosols and Mollic-Lithic Leptosols were found to be the major soil types. Land use and topographic attributes affected many of the characteristics of the soils. Thickness of total and topsoil depth decreased with increase in slope gradient and altitude. Whereas the whole of the study area was once covered by dark topsoil, this characteristic was lost in many of the cultivated soils. Under natural conditions, the soils had high levels of andic properties (which fixed P availability) and high contents of surface organic carbon (commonly over 6 %), and total nitrogen (> 0. 4 %), <b>available</b> <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> (over 30 %) and CEC (> 30 Cmolc kg- 1 soil).

Due to lack of basic materials and data, the <b>water</b> environment <b>capacity</b> in small basin was not massively researched with appropriate calculating method. This paper mentioned a <b>water</b> <b>capacity</b> calculating method suitable for environment management. The method was based on the study of Xuchang Section of Qingyi River and described with details as follows: Xuchang Section was divided into four control units with GIS technology. The river pollution loads of non-point source pollutants from farmland runoff, rural life, livestock and poultry were calculated with the in-site and statistical data of pollution resource. Meanwhile the calculated river pollution loads of non-point / point source pollutants were statistically analyzed on the basis of control units. Then a water quality module was tested and verified, in which the predicted value tallied with the measured value. The parameter of this water quality module corresponds to the in-site data within relative error ± 14 %.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{regeneration}} silviculture, [...] "spring", [...] "summer", etc. lack precise meaning. Typically, the spring planting season begins as soon as lifting becomes possible in the nursery, and ends with {{the completion of the}} program. At this time, planting stock is physiologically attuned to the oncoming growing season, and the outplant has the whole of that season in which to establish its root system before it is challenged by any frost heaving. In practice, ideals are seldom attained. That stock is normally dormant when spring-planted is a widespread fallacy. Active growth is commonly obvious at the time of planting, but in any case the metabolic activity increases in planting stock before the tops give visible expression to this. The difficulty of obtaining, in quantity, spring-lifted stock in dormant condition increases with increasing continentality of climate. In many areas, the period of spring-like weather is unreliable and often short. As well, the soil moisture advantage claimed for spring planting is also insecurely founded. Soils that are sandy or gravelly, and shallow soils of any texture are highly dependent on current weather due to their limited <b>available</b> <b>water</b> <b>capacities.</b> Nor will a plentiful supply of soil moisture benefit an outplant whose roots are enveloped in anaerobic and/or cold soil, and mortality of trees outplanted into soil colder than about 6 °C may be excessive. Flushing increases the vulnerability of planting stock to both physiological stress (because of increased water requirements and reduced root growth capacity) and mechanical damage, which probably accounts for the commonly asserted superiority of early spring over late spring planting.|$|R

Twenty-seven treatments comprising a factorial combination of three rates of FYM (0, 7. 5, and 15 t·ha - 1), three rates of nitrogen (0, 60, 120 kg·N·ha - 1) and three rates of phosphorus (0, 50 and 100 kg·P 2 O 5 ·ha - 1) were tested.
