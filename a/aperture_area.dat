25|$|Even {{though the}} {{principles}} of focal ratio are always the same, the application to which the principle is put can differ. In photography the focal ratio varies the focal-plane illuminance (or optical power per unit area in the image) and is used to control variables such as depth of field. When using an optical telescope in astronomy, there is no depth of field issue, and the brightness of stellar point sources in terms of total optical power (not divided by area) {{is a function of}} absolute <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> only, independent of focal length. The focal length controls the field of view of the instrument and the scale of the image that is presented at the focal plane to an eyepiece, film plate, or CCD.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way as one f-stop {{corresponds}} to a factor of two in light intensity, shutter speeds are arranged so that each setting differs in duration by a factor of approximately two from its neighbour. Opening up a lens by one stop allows twice as much light to fall on the film in a given period of time. Therefore, to have the same exposure at this larger aperture as at the previous aperture, the shutter would be opened for half as long (i.e., twice the speed). The film will respond equally to these equal amounts of light, since it has the property of reciprocity. This is less true for extremely long or short exposures, where we have reciprocity failure. Aperture, shutter speed, and film sensitivity are linked: for constant scene brightness, doubling the <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> (one stop), halving the shutter speed (doubling the time open), or using a film twice as sensitive, has the same effect on the exposed image. For all practical purposes extreme accuracy is not required (mechanical shutter speeds were notoriously inaccurate as wear and lubrication varied, with no effect on exposure). It is not significant that aperture areas and shutter speeds do not vary by a factor of precisely two.|$|E

2500|$|Feed {{illumination}} taper - The maximum {{gain for}} any aperture antenna is only achieved when {{the intensity of}} the radiated beam is constant across the entire <b>aperture</b> <b>area.</b> [...] However the radiation pattern from the feed antenna usually tapers off toward the outer part of the dish, so the outer parts of the dish are [...] "illuminated" [...] with a lower intensity of radiation. [...] Even if the feed provided constant illumination across the angle subtended by the dish, the outer parts of the dish are farther away from the feed antenna than the inner parts, so the intensity would drop off with distance from the center. [...] So {{the intensity of the}} beam radiated by a parabolic antenna is maximum {{at the center of the}} dish and falls off with distance from the axis, reducing the efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given <b>aperture</b> <b>area</b> than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines microwave network. [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E

50|$|In photography, {{reciprocity}} {{refers to}} the relationship whereby the total light energy - proportional to the total exposure, {{the product of the}} light intensity and exposure time, controlled by aperture and shutter speed, respectively - determines the effect of the light on the film.
