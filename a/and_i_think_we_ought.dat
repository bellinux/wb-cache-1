6000|$|... "Mr. Harding's {{position}} is now very strong," [...] the man contended. [...] "He can, if he wishes, dictate {{to the rest}} of us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to know his plans and how he expects to profit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly we will," [...] the Colonel said. [...] "He must be {{a wonderfully}} shrewd young fellow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to take his statement, if only to record the part he played in proving his brother's innocence. But where is the brother, Mr. Henderson; hasn't he come back yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The abode is, however, a great {{improvement}} on the hotel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall grow quite fond of it.--Ever your affectionate son, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{indeed he}} was; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all did what little {{we could to}} make you welcome at Greshamsbury, Mary, till those {{unpleasant}} occurrences took place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two {{or three}} of us have got bruised a little, captain; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have all of us got a severe fright. We thought she was over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} to stop in that town and send some help here-- a police official, or a constable, or some men. Crabtree {{has got to go}} back to jail, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to have Pelter and Japson locked up, too-- {{although}} that may depend upon what father may have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{she joined}} Mrs. Maynard, [...] "Well, Grace," [...] said the latter, [...] "I do {{believe you are}} right. I have taken some more cold. But that shows {{that it does n't}} get worse of itself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to be {{encouraged}} by that. I'm going to be more careful of the night air after this." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ed rose, and glancing {{about him}} with an {{appealing}} look, said, as if sure his proposition would not be well received, [...] "I wish to propose {{the name of a}} new member. Bob Walker wants to join, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to let him. He is trying to behave well, and I am sure we could help him. Can't we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] agreed Louise; [...] "we all would. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{could turn}} out a very creditable paper--for Millville. But wouldn't it {{cost a lot of}} money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fairies, of course, {{you have}} invited? It {{has always been}} usual, in our family, on an {{occasion}} like this; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have neglected them a little of late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have put}} up a good fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall win; but, while you will {{understand}} me better by-and-by what you have offered me almost hurts," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] said this {{creature}} of impulse to her escort. [...] "My uncle and aunt {{will take care}} of me now. Aunt Harriet and Uncle Archibald, this is Mr. Clyde. He saw a great snake go into a hole over there just before supper-time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> all to be very careful how we pass that way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, really,' said Traddles, cheerfully, 'I must, once more, give Mr. Micawber high praise. But for {{his having}} been so patient and persevering {{for so long}} a time, we never could have hoped to do {{anything}} worth speaking of. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to consider that Mr. Micawber did right, for right's sake, when we reflect what terms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself, for his silence.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dear Sir,--You {{will act}} as you please upon that point; but whether I go or stay, I shall not say another word on the subject till May--nor then, unless quite {{convenient}} to yourself. I have many things I wish to leave to your care, principally papers. The vases need not be now sent, as Mr. W. is gone to Scotland. You are right about the Er[rata] page; place it at the beginning. Mr. Perry is a little premature in his compliments [1]: these may do harm by exciting expectation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to be above it--though I see the next paragraph is on the 'Journal' [2], which makes me suspect you {{as the author of}} both.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{ought to}} make it {{impossible}} for such a thing to happen again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might," [...] added Priscilla, so decidedly that the others looked at her in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm well {{satisfied}} {{to have you}} near me, in an alarm, Chippewa. We've stood by each other once, in troublesome times; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can do as much, ag'in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard a Thrums woman say {{it would}} account for my being called Grizel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> came to Scotland to look for him, {{but it is so}} long, long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is exactly}} the same with them. Why should they be more to us than the floors and walls of the houses we move in and move out of with no {{particular}} pathos? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not to care for them, certainly not to the point of letting them destroy our eternal-womanly with the anxiety she feels for them. She is really much more precious, if she could but realize it, than anything she swathes in cheese-cloth or wraps up with moth-balls. The proof {{of the fact that the}} whole thing is a piece of mere sentimentality is that we may live in a furnished house for years, amid all the accidents of birth and death, joy and sorrow, and yet not form the slightest attachment to the furniture. Why should we have tender and sacred associations with a thing we have bought, and not with a thing we have hired?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{the banker}} returned, [...] "I don't know that I should {{have much to}} say against that. It seems as {{reasonable}} as anything in the system of education which we force upon the working classes. They know perfectly well, whether we do or not, that the three R's will not make their children better mechanics or laborers, and that, if the fight for a mere living is to go on from generation to generation, they will have no leisure to apply the little learning they get in the public schools for their personal culture. In the mean time we deprive the parents of their children's labor, in order that they may be better citizens for their schooling, as we imagine; I don't know whether they are or not. We offer them no sort of compensation for their time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to feel obliged to them for not wanting wages for their children while we are teaching them to be better citizens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'They had not formed any fixed plan of division, {{but they}} {{believed}} that, {{as they had}} had the trouble, and, in fact, the danger, of getting the gold, they should have the main share, but they considered that they had enough to help out any of the original party who might be hard up for money." [...] Of course, we must always remember," [...] said Shirley, in finishing up his story, [...] "that {{if we can find}} the heirs of McLeish, the money belongs to them. But, even in that case, Burke <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to keep a good share of it to pay us for getting it away from that beastly desert." [...] Here I interrupted him. [...] "Don't you trouble yourself any more about McLeish," [...] I said. [...] "That money did not belong to him. He stole it." [...] "How do you know that, and who did he steal it from?" [...] cried Shirley. [...] "He stole it from me," [...] said I.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have put}} up a good fight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall win, but, while you will {{understand}} me better by and by, what you have offered me almost hurts," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{this great}} grace and noble virtue should surely {{be in our}} Lord, from whom all graces and virtues come; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need not look far through the gospels to find it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon we've {{all said}} that. None {{of the gang}} wants to quit. They all <b>think,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>we</b> can't be touched. We may be blamed, but nothing can be proved. We're too strong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well; then there's {{no reason}} why we shouldn't stay in Venice till that time. We are both very fond of the place, and we'd quite concluded, this morning, to stop here till the {{mosquitoes}} came. You know, Mr. Ferris, my daughter had to leave school much earlier than she ought, for my health has obliged me to travel a great deal since I lost my husband; and I must have her with me, for we're all that there is of us; we haven't a chick or a child that's related to us anywhere. But wherever we stop, even for a few weeks, I contrive to get her some kind of instruction. I feel the need of it so much in my own case; for {{to tell you the}} truth, Mr. Ferris, I married too young. I suppose I should do the same thing over again if it was to be done over; but don't you see, my mind wasn't properly formed; and then following my husband about from pillar to post, and my first baby born when I was nineteen-- well, it wasn't education, at any rate, whatever else it was; and I've determined that Florida, though we are such a pair of wanderers, shall not have my regrets. I got teachers for her in England,--the English are not anything like so disagreeable at home as they are in traveling, and we stayed there two years,--and I did in France, and I did in Germany. And now, Italian. Here we are in Italy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> to improve the time. Florida knows a good deal of Italian already, for her music teacher in France was an Italian, and he taught her the language as well as music. What she wants now, I should say, is to perfect her accent and get facility. I think she ought to have some one come every day and read and converse an hour or two with her." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wine was}} excellent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all came {{separately}} and secretly {{to the same}} conclusion--that our chance of getting through the evening was intimately connected with our resolution in getting through the bottles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dan's goose is {{the largest}} and the fattest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better kill him for the [...] .Thanksgiving dinner," [...] Dan heard his father say, three days before Thanksgiving; and Mrs. Hardy had replied: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God;--yes. I {{was looking}} at Brownriggs to-day,--and Ingram's. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> we'll sell either. I have a plan, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can pull through without it. It is {{so much easier to}} sell than to buy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sony BMG Nashville {{chairman}} Joe Galante {{thought that}} the duo and the label [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> got a little too soft." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall {{come to town}} {{until you}} want to show the progress, {{whenever}} that may be. I shall look forward to another dinner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> must encourage the Oriental, for the goodness of its wine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing for it {{till the}} river breaks, baron, {{and then a}} dash with La Bijou. St. Vincent, you had better bring your {{blankets}} up and sleep here to-night. We'll need three paddles, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can get McPherson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{all know}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about this war," [...] said Kasker {{in a loud voice}} and with a slight German accent. [...] "I don't approve of it, {{whatever}} anyone says, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were wrong to get into it, anyhow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{are pretty}} well {{agreed on the}} point that she had best go home. People make {{mistakes}} sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> both made a mistake when we got married. Anyhow, we have both agreed that {{it is best to}} part for a time." ...|$|R
5000|$|An online {{interview}} with Nydahl also featured the following statement: [...] "Judaism and Christianity are fine. Islam, I warn against. I know the Koran, I know the life story of Mohammad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> cannot use {{that in our}} society today." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jerry Lawson cites Roy Hamilton, Sam Cooke, Al Hibbler, Brook Benton, and Elvis Presley as his mentors, adding, [...] "Believe it or not, Elvis {{was a big}} influence. I {{thought he}} was...a fine singer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> do him pretty good." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{few minutes}} later, the Spaniard crossed the after well. [...] "Now," [...] he said, [...] "we must decide when {{we ought to}} have our {{interview}} with Señor Kenwardine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should put it off until just before we land." ...|$|R
