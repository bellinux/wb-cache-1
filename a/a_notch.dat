5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked tip to the bill, and all antbirds have <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> or 'tooth' {{at the tip}} of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|E
5|$|The easiest {{species to}} confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are short}} and angular, while the pelvic fins {{are long and}} relatively large. The dorsal fins are small, with the first dorsal fin origin lying behind the pelvic fin origins. There is no anal fin. The caudal peduncle is robust and lacks notches at the caudal fin origins. The asymmetrical caudal fin has an indistinct lower lobe and an upper lobe without <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the trailing margin.|$|E

50|$|Izod {{impact testing}} is an ASTM {{standard}} method {{of determining the}} impact resistance of materials. A pivoting arm is raised to a specific height (constant potential energy) and then released. The arm swings down hitting <b>a</b> <b>notched</b> sample, breaking the specimen. The energy absorbed by the sample is calculated from the height the arm swings to after hitting the sample. <b>A</b> <b>notched</b> sample is generally used to determine impact energy and notch sensitivity.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in their apex) were quite different from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (<b>a</b> <b>notch</b> formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E

5|$|Other {{features}} of the skull distinguish the two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of the}} tympanic cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone {{at the back of the}} skull, are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate at the sides of the skull that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic notch (<b>a</b> <b>notch</b> formed by a projection at the front of the zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic notch.|$|E
5|$|Slim and streamlined, {{the silky}} shark has a fairly long, rounded snout with barely {{developed}} flaps of skin {{in front of}} the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. Fourteen to 16 and 13–17tooth rows are found {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, with <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of gill slits are moderate in length.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{delicate}} and lightly built. The rostrum, the front {{part of the}} skull, is narrow and fairly long; it is shorter in eastern voalavo. The narrow zygomatic plate (a plate {{on the side of}} the skull) extends back to about the front of the first upper molar (M1). The zygomatic notch, <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the upper part of the zygomatic plate, is small. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are narrow, but as usual in nesomyines contain a relatively long jugal bone. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and short and lacks accessory shelves and ridges. The braincase also lacks such ridges.|$|E

5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the sun set into <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E
5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001. In 2008, the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification, and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis). The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was worn, the authors identified what appeared to be <b>a</b> <b>notch,</b> which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Originating {{below the}} fourth pair of gill slits, the {{pectoral}} fins are short, broad, and falcate (sickle-shaped) with pointed tips. The first dorsal fin {{is tall and}} falcate with a distinctively long free rear tip, and is positioned just behind the pectoral fin bases. The second dorsal fin is large and tall without a notably elongated free rear tip, and is positioned over or slightly behind the anal fin. Usually there is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins, and when present the ridge is slight. The caudal peduncle has a deep crescent-shaped notch at the upper caudal fin origin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is large and}} triangular, with a pointed apex and a concave {{trailing}} margin; it originates roughly over the posterior insertions of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin {{is less than a}} third as high as the first, and originates ahead of the anal fin. There is no midline ridge between the dorsal fins. The long pectoral fins are broad and slightly falcate (sickle-shaped), becoming narrow and pointed at the tips. The anal fin has a sharply notched trailing margin. The caudal peduncle has a deep notch on its upper surface at the caudal fin origin. The caudal fin is asymmetrical, with a well-developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the trailing margin near its tip.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring about as long {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E
40|$|Optimum and {{comparable}} {{results in}} testing adhesives {{can only be}} obtained if the research methodology is standardized. The attachment of the specimen to the testing device is very critical, as the tensile stress should be imposed perpendicular to the interface. Objectives: In this study, we hypothesized that <b>a</b> <b>notched</b> jig would simplify fixation of the samples and improve the test consistency and reproducibility. Methods: The micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) was determined of a three-step (Optibond FL, Kerr) and a two-step (experimental EXM- 628, 3 M Espe) etch & rinse adhesive {{as well as of}} a two-step self-etch adhesive (One Coat SE Bond, Coltène Whaledent) using <b>a</b> <b>notched</b> jig and <b>a</b> flat so-called Ciucchi's jig (control). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD multiple comparisons test were used to determine statistical differences. Results: Specimens tested on <b>a</b> <b>notched</b> jig consistently yielded higher values than samples fixed on a flat surface: for OptiBond FL + 11, 48 %, for EXM# 628 + 29, 3 % and for One Coat Se Bond + 37, 4 %. The coefficient of variation appeared to be lower and, in addition, the stress-graphs revealed a more uniform pattern. Conclusion: <b>A</b> <b>notched</b> jig eased manipulation and fixation of the specimens to the testing device and lead to more standardized and consistent results.

50|$|Noise-induced {{hearing loss}} (NIHL) {{typically}} manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting) between 3000 and 6000 Hz, centered at 4000 Hz. As noise damage progresses, damage spreads to affect lower and higher frequencies. On an audiogram, the resulting configuration has <b>a</b> distinctive <b>notch,</b> called <b>a</b> 'noise' <b>notch.</b> <b>As</b> aging and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6-8 kHz on <b>an</b> audiogram), this <b>notch</b> may be obscured and entirely disappear.|$|R

5|$|The nasal and premaxillary bones do {{not extend}} back beyond {{the point where}} the lacrimal, frontal, and maxillary bones meet. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch, is broad and develops <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> at its front end. The plate's back margin is located before the first upper molar. The jugal bone, part of the zygomatic arch, is reduced, as usual in oryzomyines. The sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{at the side of the}} skull above the molars, is small; it is much larger in the marsh rice rat. The narrowest part of the interorbital region is towards the front and the edges are lined by prominent shelves. The parietal bones extend to the sides of the braincase. The interparietal bone is narrow and wedge-shaped, so that the parietal and squamosal bones meet extensively.|$|E
5|$|This 150-year period next saw the {{eruption}} of less silica-rich lava {{in the form of}} andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.|$|E
5|$|Euan MacKie has {{supported}} Thom's analysis, {{to which he}} added an archaeological context by comparing Neolithic Britain to the Mayan civilization to argue for a stratified society in this period. To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. Kintraw is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed {{that this was a}} foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on Jura. This, Thom argued, was <b>a</b> <b>notch</b> on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at Maes Howe and on the Bush Barrow Lozenge led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.|$|E
