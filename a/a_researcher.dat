5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, <b>a</b> <b>researcher</b> concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, <b>a</b> <b>researcher</b> who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
