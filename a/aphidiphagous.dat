40|$|The Chinese farmers apply {{a lot of}} {{pesticides}} in their vegetable crops. This situation, due to the socio-economic context of the rural population of the country, affects the food security. This work aims to study alternatives to the intensive use of synthetic pesticides, namely by the establishment of “push-pull” strategies, in courgettes and potato fields. We used three semiochemicals, the (E) -β-farnésène, the (Z) - 3 -Hexenyl acetate and a garlic extract and intercropping with pea. The effect of these treatments in the populations of <b>aphidiphagous</b> beneficial insects was determined by five weeks of insect trapping and observations on the plants. The results indicate {{that none of the}} modalities has a significant effect on the populations of beneficial insects and aphids. However, we observed some trends, especially with the (E) -β-farnésène in the courgettes fields. In addition, information sheets were made to inform and raise awareness of the Chinese farmers about the use {{of pesticides}} and the role of beneficial insects in the control of aphid populations...|$|E
