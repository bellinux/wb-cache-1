5|$|Nixon {{was unwilling}} to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen during the 1960s as NASA {{prepared}} to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans {{for the establishment of}} a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon rejected both proposals due to the expense. Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost-effective way to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reconnaissance objective.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E

5|$|The rider applies {{torque to}} the {{handlebars}} {{in order to}} turn the front wheel and so to control lean and maintain balance. At high speeds, small steering angles quickly move the ground contact points laterally; at low speeds, larger steering angles are required to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> results in {{the same amount of}} time. Because of this, it is usually easier to maintain balance at high speeds. As self-stability typically occurs at speeds above a certain threshold, going faster increases the chances that a bike is contributing to its own stability.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings and that she had ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, Walther Bothe and {{his student}} Herbert Becker had used {{polonium}} to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this {{was evidence of}} something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick's attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium {{as a source for}} what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work for}} single-relay {{channels}} shows that quantize-forward (QF) with long-message encoding <b>achieves</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> reliable rates as compress-forward (CF) with short-message encoding. It is shown that short-message QF with backward or pipelined (sliding-window) decoding also <b>achieves</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rates. Similarly, for many relays and sources, short-message QF with backward decoding <b>achieves</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> rates as long-message QF. Several practical advantages of short-message encoding are pointed out, e. g., reduced delay and simpler modulation. Fur-thermore, short-message encoding lets relays use decode-forward (DF) if their channel quality is good, thereby enabling multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) gains {{that are not}} possible with long-message encoding. Finally, one may combine the advantages of long- and short-message encoding by hashing a long message to short messages. I...|$|R

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six anvils which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four anvils to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger anvils, but this also increases the amount of force needed on the anvils to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface {{area to volume ratio}} of the pressurized volume, by using more anvils to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1993, Carey began conceptualizing Music Box (1993), {{which became}} the highest selling album of Carey's career. For her past two albums, Carey's {{creative}} choices were heavily controlled by her label Columbia Records, {{as well as her}} husband and CEO of the company, Tommy Mottola. Carey's previous effort, Emotions (1991), drew influence from 1950s, 60s, and 70s balladry, gospel, R and soul music, and failed to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> success matched by her debut album. Following its tepid commercial performance, Columbia aimed for Music Box to be a vehicle for very commercial singles that could garner strong radio airplay. The album was formed as a pop record, and more mainstream than anything on Emotions. Music Box went on to sell over 32 million copies worldwide, and earned its place among the best-selling albums of all time. Due to the album's success, Columbia allowed Carey more control over the music she recorded for Daydream (1995).|$|E
5|$|After unsuccessfully {{searching for}} a club in Europe, Haber {{returned}} to Canada, and subsequently joined the Vancouver Whitecaps on February 11, 2009. He claimed both the 'Newcomer of the Year' and 'Fan's Favourite' awards after a successful first season with the Whitecaps. The striker was one of seven USL First Division players to appear in every regular season match for his club that year, with Whitecaps goalkeeper Jay Nolly being another player to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> feat during the 2009 season. Haber scored his first goal for the club on April 18, 2009, netting in a 2–1 away defeat to the Puerto Rico Islanders. The goal earned Haber {{a spot in the}} USL-1 Team of the Week for Week Two. In the Nutrilite Canadian Championship, Haber scored the winning goal in the Whitecaps' 2–0 away win over the Montreal Impact on May 20, scoring just 33 seconds into the match. Haber set the record for the quickest goal scored in a Nutrilite Canadian Championship match. He also scored a consolation goal in a 2–1 home defeat to the Montreal Impact on June 7. Two weeks later, Haber scored his fourth goal of the season in a 2–2 away draw with the Cleveland City Stars, scoring the first goal of the match.|$|E

After Seth attempts to deploy the player in an operation against the United States military without Kane's approval, Kane kills him and thereafter issues commands to the player directly. The player's {{goal is to}} drive GDI forces out of North Africa {{through the use of}} both conventional and unconventional warfare. In a ploy to secure victory for Nod, the player is assigned to gain control of GDI's space-based ion cannon, and to establish Nod's Temple in South Africa. The campaign ends with the entire African continent under Nod's control, and with the Brotherhood planning to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in Europe. The conclusion of the campaign allows the player to choose a historical landmark to destroy with GDI's hijacked ion cannon, in order to shatter GDI's public image. Potential targets include the White House, the British Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower and the Brandenburg Gate.|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} a dictator novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the dictator, the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some dictator novels centre on one historical dictator (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The dictator novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional dictator to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the dictator is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the dictator novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their dictator novels.|$|E
