5000|$|The primary {{advantages}} of a DDA over the conventional <b>analog</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> are greater precision of the results {{and the lack of}} drift/noise/slip/lash in the calculations. The precision is only limited by register size and the resulting accumulated rounding/truncation errors of repeated addition. Digital electronics inherently lacks the temperature sensitive drift and noise level issues of analog electronics and the slippage and [...] "lash" [...] issues of mechanical analog systems.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> an <b>analog</b> computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|R

So most parallelizations take advantage of repeated patterns, massive parallel computers and so on. Sequential Digital <b>Differential</b> <b>Analyzer</b> shows better peformance than Bresenham if fixed point arithmetic is used [7]. This algorithm can be pipelined and parallelized. It is easily hardware implemented and scalable. Hardware cost is linear with speed up. Utilization is nearly 100 % and hardware waste is low...|$|R
