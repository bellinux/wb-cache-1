5|$|Steered by a mid- to {{low-level}} wind flow, {{the depression}} continued west-northwest toward Martinique, decelerating {{in reaction to}} the island's northern mountain range. Satellite images on the afternoon of August14 showed the development of a central dense overcast as greater <b>atmospheric</b> <b>turbulence</b> over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's convection; the next reconnaissance flight revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to gale force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40mph (65km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable outflow, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development. Over the course of August15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable wind shear; the center of circulation became ill defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August16, attaining peak winds of 45mph (75km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1007mbar (hPa; 29.74inHg), roughly 85mi (140km) southeast of Santo Domingo.|$|E

25|$|When {{light from}} a star or another astronomical object enters the Earth's atmosphere, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>turbulence</b> (introduced, for example, by {{different}} temperature layers and different wind speeds interacting) can distort and move the image in various ways (see astronomical seeing for a full discussion).

25|$|Continuous gusts or {{stochastic}} gusts are {{winds that}} vary randomly {{in space and}} time. Models of continuous gusts are used to represent <b>atmospheric</b> <b>turbulence,</b> especially clear air turbulence and turbulent winds in storms.

25|$|Because {{a science}} target is often too faint {{to be used}} as a {{reference}} star for measuring the shape of the optical wavefronts, a nearby brighter guide star can be used instead. The light from the science target has passed through approximately the same <b>atmospheric</b> <b>turbulence</b> as the reference star's light and so its image is also corrected, although generally to a lower accuracy.|$|E
25|$|These assumptions, while unrealistic, yield {{acceptable}} {{models for}} flight dynamics applications. The last assumption of a velocity field {{that does not}} vary with time is especially unrealistic, since measurements of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>turbulence</b> {{at one point in}} space always vary with time. These models rely on the airplane's motion through the gusts to generate temporal variations in wind velocity, making them inappropriate for use as inputs to models of hovering, wind turbines, or other applications that are fixed in space.|$|E

Commonly astronomers apply a technique called “Lucky Imaging ” that selects a few of the recorded frames that fulfill certain criteria, such as reaching a certain peak intensity (“Strehl ratio”). The selected frames are then averaged to obtain a better image. In this paper we introduce and analyze a new method that exploits all the frames and generates an improved image in an online fashion.
