[...] Glover's colleague Nigel Andrew was not a fan of the adultery storyline and wanted the old Ruth back, saying she had [...] "been replaced by Ruth Mark 2, a helpless overgrown teenager, reduced to a puddle of lust by amorous cowman Sam." [...] Rachel Cooke of the New Statesman was not a fan of the character at all, writing [...] "Ruth bores me to sobs, so I didn't give a fig that this was out of character."

In contrast, IGN was more favorable to the PC version of the game. Francois Laramee of Allgame praised the game for its [...] "excellent audio-visuals. The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips are beautiful. The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently {{to be anything but}} distracting. The slot machine wheels are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> the small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game [...] "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired". ComputerAndVideoGames.com's Alex Huhtala criticized the game for its [...] "Poor, vomit-inducing presentation".|$|E
500|$|... "I Was Here" [...] {{garnered}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics, {{most of whom}} felt the song's message was too deep for an artist like Beyoncé to sing, and criticized its placement on the track list of 4. Georgette Cline of The Boombox gave the song a positive review stating that, although the lyrics are <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>on</b> the morbid side, it works in Beyoncé's favor, [...] "proving she can tackle a myriad of subjects". Matthew Horton of BBC criticized the song's order of placement on the track list of 4, stating that [...] "'Run the World (Girls)' is tagged on like a bonus track following 'I Was Here', which sounds like the perfect ending for the album." [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also had the same view, saying it [...] "disrupts the flow of up-tempo songs on the second half 4". Perpetua however calls it a [...] "showstopper" [...] and added that it [...] "work well as a bittersweet emotional climax for the album". Perpetua finished his review by saying that [...] "'I Was Here' is the blustery ballad one would expect by a Beyoncé/Warren team-up, and stands off as flat and generic {{when compared to the}} rest of 4." [...] Another reviewer of the same magazine, Jody Rosen complimented Beyoncé's vocals stating that she sings with authority; however, he coined [...] "I Was Here" [...] as a low point on the album and added that it is [...] "swamped in 'My Way'-style self-mythologizing." ...|$|E
