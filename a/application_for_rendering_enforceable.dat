40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method <b>for</b> {{efficiently}} <b>rendering</b> indirect highlights. Indirect highlights {{are caused by}} the primary light source reflecting off two or more glossy surfaces. Accurately simulating such highlights is important to convey the realistic appearance of materials such as chrome and shiny metal. Our method models the glossy BRDF at a surface point as a directional distribution, using a spherical von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. As our main contribution, we merge multiple vMFs into a combined multimodal distribution. This effectively creates a filtered radiance response function, allowing us to efficiently estimate indirect highlights.

40|$|Figure 1 : We {{proposed}} a new method to render screen-space glossy to glossy reflections in realtime. Three scenes are all with glossy materials and rendered at 1280 × 720 resolution. The FPS {{of these three}} snapshots are 65. 1, 64. 1 and 61. 7 respectively. Glossy to glossy reflections are lights bounced between glossy surfaces. Such directional light transports are important for humans to perceive glossy materials, but difficult to simulate. This paper proposes a new method <b>for</b> <b>rendering</b> screen-space glossy to glossy reflections in realtime. We use spherical von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions to model glossy BRDFs at surfaces, and employ screen space directional occlusion (SSDO) rendering framework to trace indirect light transports bounced in the screen space. As our main contributions, we derive a new parameterization of vMF distribution so as to convert the non-linear fit of multiple vMF distributions into a linear sum in the new space. Then, we present a new linear filtering technique to build MIP-maps on glossy BRDFs, which allows us to create filtered radiance transfer functions at runtime, and efficiently estimate indirect glossy to glossy reflections. We demonstrate our method in a realtime <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>rendering</b> scenes with dynamic glossy objects.

40|$|The Internet is {{evolving}} with us along the time, nowadays {{people are more}} dependent of it, being used {{for most of the}} simple activities of their lives. It is not uncommon use the Internet for voice and video communications, social networking, banking and shopping. Current trends in Internet applications such as Web 2. 0, cloud computing, and the internet of things are bound to bring higher traffic volume and more heterogeneous traffic. In addition, privacy concerns and network security traits have widely promoted the usage of encryption on the network communications. All these factors make network management an evolving environment that becomes every day more difficult. This thesis focuses on helping to keep track on some of these changes, observing the Internet from an ISP viewpoint and exploring several aspects of the visibility of a network, giving insights on what contents or services are retrieved by customers and how these contents are provided to them. Generally, inferring these information, it is done by means of characterization and analysis of data collected using passive traffic monitoring tools on operative networks. As said, analysis and characterization of traffic collected passively is challenging. Internet end-users are not controlled on the network traffic they generate. Moreover, this traffic in the network might be encrypted or coded {{in a way that is}} unfeasible to decode, creating the need for reverse engineering for providing a good picture to the Internet operator. In spite of the challenges, it is presented a characterization of P 2 P-TV usage of a commercial, proprietary and closed application, that encrypts or encodes its traffic, making quite difficult discerning what is going on by just observing the data carried by the protocol. Then it is presented DN-Hunter, which is an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>rendering</b> visible a great part of the network traffic even when encryption or encoding is available.

Findings reveal that most of the content residing on cloud computing and Internet storage infrastructures is served by one single Amazon datacenter located in Virginia despite it appears to be the worst performing one for Italian users.

However, there have been vast improvements of the graphic cards (GPUs) in recent years and with the first GPU implementation of volume raycasting in 2003, how does this algorithm perform on modern hardware? Can the performance of the algorithm be improved with the introduction of GPGPU (DirectCompute) in Directx 11 ?

40|$|This Article {{challenges}} the conventional view of contemporary international adjudication. It identifies {{a new generation}} of international tribunals, which has been largely ignored by commentators, and argues that these tribunals offer a highly successful, alternative model to traditional public-international-law adjudicatory bodies. The proliferation of international tribunals is widely {{regarded as one of the}} most significant developments in international law over the past century. The subject has given rise to an extensive and robust body of academic commentary. Although commentators reach widely divergent conclusions about many aspects of international law and adjudication, they all agree that international tribunals differ fundamentally from national courts. In particular, according to the commentary, international tribunals such as the International Court of Justice lack the power to <b>render</b> <b>enforceable</b> decisions or to exercise compulsory jurisdiction. This Article argues that commentators have proceeded from a flawed and incomplete understanding of contemporary international adjudication. Virtually all commentary on the subject ignores the development of a second generation of international tribunals, best represented by international commercial and investment tribunals, World Trade Organization panels, and claims-settlement mechanisms. Contrary to the conventional wisdom about international adjudication, this new generation of international tribunals has the power to exercise what is effectively compulsory jurisdiction and to <b>render</b> <b>enforceable</b> decisions that can often be coercively executed against states and their commercial assets. These second-generation tribunals have been the most frequently used and, in many respects, the most successful form of international adjudication in recent decades. The caseloads of these tribunals have grown rapidly over the past forty years and now substantially exceed those of traditional public-international-law tribunals. Moreover, an analysis of state treatymaking practice over recent decades shows that states have virtually never concluded treaties accepting the jurisdiction of traditional first-generation tribunals—concluding less than one treaty per year—whereas they have frequently accepted the jurisdiction of second-generation tribunals capable of <b>rendering</b> <b>enforceable</b> decisions—accepting some fifty treaties per year. More fundamentally, second-generation tribunals have played an essential role in facilitating international trade, finance, and investment; have contributed to the development of important fields of international law; and have provided leading contemporary examples of international law working in practice. Although largely ignored by the commentary, the success and frequent use of second-generation tribunals have important implications for conventional analysis of international adjudication. The success of these tribunals flatly contradicts the claims, advanced by a number of academic commentators, that international adjudication is unimportant in contemporary international affairs and that states do not use international tribunals—particularly tribunals that would be effective. In reality, second-generation tribunals have been frequently and successfully used in vitally important fields, in part because they issue effective and enforceable decisions. At the same time, the success of second-generation tribunals also contradicts prescriptions, offered by a number of commentators, that future international tribunals be modeled on “independent” first-generation tribunals or, alternatively, on entirely “dependent” adjudicative mechanisms. Successful second-generation tribunals exhibit a blend of structural characteristics that defy blanket prescriptions for either “independence” or “dependence” and that counsel for more tailored, nuanced institutional designs...|$|R
