5|$|In {{an attempt}} to slow the Chinese advance, MacArthur ordered the bridges across the Yalu to be bombed. After due {{consultation}} with his advisers, Truman declared {{that he would not}} approve of such an action, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs cancelled the order. When MacArthur protested, the President <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Joint</b> Chiefs authorized the bombings, subject to the caveat that Chinese air space not be violated. Major General Emmett O'Donnell would later cite this to the Congressional inquiry into MacArthur's relief as an example of undue political interference in military operations. The Yalu River had many bends, and in some cases there were very restricted lines of approach without overflying the Yalu. This made life easier for the Communist antiaircraft gunners, but correspondingly less so for the aircrew. Within weeks, MacArthur was forced to retreat, and both Truman and MacArthur were forced to contemplate the prospect of abandoning Korea entirely.|$|E

5|$|A trough {{developed}} {{along the}} northeast monsoon on 25October 2015 off the southwest coast of India, {{consisting of a}} fragmented area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system was located within an environment of moderate wind shear, which prevented early development, although conditions were anticipated to become more favorable. On 26October, the system developed a distinct low pressure area.

At 03:00UTC on 28October, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as a depression.

5|$|On November21, 1960, the {{formation}} of a small low-pressure area was noted following a shift in surface winds on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Slowly developing, the low organized into a tropical depression by 1200UTC, the 24th of the season. At this time, it was situated 270km (165mi) southwest of Enewetak Atoll. Though classified a depression, maximum sustained winds were only estimated at 35km/h (25mph). For unknown reasons, the system soon became diffuse and abruptly shifted direction to the east-southeast.
