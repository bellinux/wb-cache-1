This pocket guide was specifically designed for student tourists to find information quickly and easily. Aside from general information, this book is intended {{to be used as a}} reference manual which lists the names, addresses, and phone numbers of places to find additional or more detailed information. The images and illustrations help to clarify the text copy so that a student can more easily understand what is being discussed. For example, in the chapter that discusses ‘Writing Home’ there are illustrations to show the differences between an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> <b>post</b> card stamp and an <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> letter stamp. The Traveling Student’s Guide to London does not make recommendations for lodging, restaurants, tourists’ spots or places to visit. It is simply an informational handbook that contains tips, suggestions and illustrations that the traveling student can refer to...|$|R

Only outgoing <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> was distributed at these workrooms, channeled there by both the post offices and Railway Post Office (RPO) routes. This mail was distributed and dispatched to other AMFs via the different flight connections. Incoming mail from other AMFs was distributed by general scheme and pouched to outgoing RPOs and necessary post offices. The Motor Vehicle Service provided frequent trips between the city post office and the AMF for <b>air</b> <b>mail</b> ground transportation. In 1951, there were 1200 clerks manning forty AMFs.
