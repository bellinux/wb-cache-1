The <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> aims to ensure the good functioning of the internal market, while assuring that risks of SVHCs are properly controlled. Since ECHA has become operational in 2008, recurring decisions on SVHCs have been made.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> shows that risk assessors and competent authorities frequently argue that additional studies are not needed because the assumed risk is 'negligible' or 'tolerable'. There are different reasons why society {{might decide to}} acquiesce with residual risk: The limits of scientific understanding which advises to apply 'praktische Vernunft' (practical reason) [8], and, alternatively or in addition, considerations of benefits drawn from new technologies. The authors suggest that a residual risk should only be accepted if it is balanced by a benefit. Such benefit is scientific progress at the stage of small or large-scale release and more environmentally friendly agriculture at the stage of {{placing on the market}} [9].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the operation of}} the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL) and its role in the <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> of feed additives in the European Union. Feed additives are authorised according to Regulation (EC) No. 1831 / 2003, which introduced a completely revised <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedure</b> and also established the EURL. The regulations authorising feed additives contain conditions of use such as legal limits of the feed additives, which require the availability of a suitable method of analysis for official control purposes under real world conditions. It is the task of the EURL to evaluate the suitability of analytical methods as proposed by the industry for this purpose. Moreover, the paper shows that one of the major challenges is the huge variety of the methodology applied in feed additive analysis, thus requiring expertise in quite different analytical areas. In order to cope with this challenge, the EURL is supported by a network of national reference laboratories (NRLs) and only the merged knowledge of all NRLs allows for a scientifically sound assessment of the analytical methods.

40|$|Cultivation {{has been}} the primary driver of habitat {{transformation}} in South Africa. This paper explores the effectiveness of agricultural and, latterly, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) <b>authorisation</b> <b>procedures</b> in stemming biodiversity loss resulting from cultivation in the lowlands of the Cape Floristic Region, a global biodiversity hotspot. Owing to an activity-based focus, agri-environmental regulation has been largely unable to mitigate the cumulative effects of large-scale land clearance in threatened ecosystems. Case studies in the Sandveld and Slanghoek districts are used to argue that revised EIA regulations published in 2006 partly perpetuate the structural shortcomings of activity-based EIA. An ecosystem-based strategy for agri-environmental screening in biodiversity hotspots is introduced, drawing on conservation plans, the agricultural LandCare programme and the provision for Environmental Management Frameworks (EMF) in the 2006 EIA regulations. "Agri-EMFs", as a collaborative initiative that involves government, agricultural and non-governmental representatives, may present an effective alternative to the inefficiencies of project-level EIA. EIA, agriculture, threatened ecosystems, Environmental Management Frameworks...|$|R
