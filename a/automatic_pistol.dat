5|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 October 1978, {{about a week after}} the {{extermination}} threat, George Burkitt and his 20-year-old son Philip were working on Philip's Triumph Spitfire car in front of their house. At around 7pm, annoyed by the noise they were making, Williams shot them both with a 9mm, Smith & Wesson <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol.</b> George died where he fell and Philip, wounded, ran into the house. Williams followed him, shooting him again and killing him. He then shot and killed George's wife, Iris. The Burkitts' 17-year-old daughter was hit four times in the back and once in the thigh, but survived. Two other neighbours, a married couple who had witnessed the attack on the Burkitts, also survived being shot. The injured were treated at Birmingham General Hospital.|$|E

Sean Hogan initially attempted to dissuade him, but relented and gave Savage an <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol.</b> The unit's intelligence operative had informed it that Lord French would be travelling in the second car of the armed convoy that comprised an outrider and three following cars, which would bring Lord French from Ashtown railway station to the Vice-Regal Lodge in Phoenix Park, Dublin.|$|E

25|$|The Fokker Scourge {{is usually}} {{considered}} to have begun on 1August, when B.E.2c aircraft of No. 2 Squadron bombed the base of FFA62 at 5:00a.m., waking the German pilots, including Boelcke and Immelmann, who were quickly into the air after the raiders. Boelcke suffered a jammed gun but Immelmann caught up with a B.E.2c and shot it down. This aircraft was flown as a bomber, without an observer or Lewis gun, the pilot armed only with an <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol.</b> After about ten minutes of manoeuvring (giving the lie to exaggerated accounts of the stability of B.E.2 aircraft), Immelmann had fired 450rounds, which riddled the B.E. and wounded the pilot in the arm.|$|E

500|$|From Casino Royale to From Russia, with Love Bond's {{preferred}} {{weapon is}} a [...]25 ACP Beretta <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol</b> {{carried in a}} light-weight chamois leather holster. However Fleming was contacted by a Bond enthusiast and gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, who criticised Fleming's choice of firearm for Bond and suggested a Walther PPK 7.65mm instead. Fleming used the suggestion in Dr. No, also taking advice {{that it should be}} used with the Berns-Martin triple draw shoulder holster. By way of thanks, the Secret Service Armourer who gives Bond his gun was given the name Major Boothroyd, and is introduced by M as [...] "the greatest small-arms expert in the world".|$|E
500|$|Police {{were unable}} to recover any {{fingerprints}} from the well-oiled grip of the pistol, and a paraffin test for gunshot residue was not performed on Danna or Sharon Kinne. Multiple people, including family and neighbors, told police that James had often allowed Danna to play with his guns, and in a test by investigating officers, Danna proved able {{to pull the trigger}} on a gun matching the one that had killed her father. With no evidence to the contrary, investigators ruled the case an accidental homicide. The pistol that killed James Kinne was taken into police custody and never returned to the widow, despite her efforts to reclaim it; she later had a male friend secretly buy her a [...]22 caliber <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol.</b> When the friend told her that he had registered the gun in her name, she requested that he re-register it under a name other than hers.|$|E
500|$|The {{animosity}} {{between the}} mourners {{and the police}} continued until the procession split to allow the hearses {{to travel to the}} respective family homes, and then on to Milltown cemetery. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) agreed to maintain a minimal presence at the funeral in exchange for guarantees from the families {{that there would be no}} salute by masked gunmen. This agreement was leaked to Michael Stone. During the funeral, Stone, who described himself as a [...] "freelance Loyalist paramilitary", threw several hand grenades into the congregation, before firing an <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol</b> at the gathered mourners, injuring 60 people. After initial confusion, several of the mourners began to pursue Stone, throwing rocks and shouting abuse. Stone fired on his pursuers, hitting and killing three. He was eventually captured by members of the crowd, who had chased him onto a road, and beaten him with rocks and makeshift weapons until the RUC arrived to extract him and arrest him.|$|E

500|$|Two anecdotes {{illustrate}} {{the level of}} security affecting the 509th's personnel and equipment. En route to Tinian on 4 June 1945, the B-29 that became The Great Artiste made an intermediate stop at Mather Field, near Sacramento, California. The commanding general of the base allegedly attempted to enter the aircraft to inspect it and was warned by a plane guard who aimed his carbine at the general's chest {{that he could not}} do so. A similar incident occurred to a Project Alberta courier, 2nd Lieutenant William A. King. King was escorting the plutonium core of the Fat Man implosion bomb to Tinian, strapped to the floor of one of the 509th's C-54s. On 26 July 1945 it made a refueling stop at Hickam Field, Hawaii. The commander of a combat unit returning to the United States learned that the Skymaster had only one passenger and attempted to enter the C-54 to requisition it as transport for his men. He was prevented from doing so by King, who aimed a [...]45 caliber <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol</b> at the colonel.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{return to}} No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored {{morning and evening}} {{victories}} on 15September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his aircraft with eight Le Prieur rockets, fitted to the outer struts and designed to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by salvoing his rockets at them, then picked {{off one of the}} pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, Nieuport 17 A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the Colt <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol</b> that he habitually carried. Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain's top-scoring ace. [...] By this time he had told his commanding officer that he had to have a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of his nerves. On 3October, he was sent on leave, en route to a posting at the Home Establishment in England. A French semi-official report of Ball's successes was issued the same day; it was picked up and repeated in the British aviation journal Flight nine days later.|$|E
500|$|The museum's {{exhibits}} collection {{includes a}} wide range of objects, organised into numerous smaller collections such as uniforms, badges, insignia and flags (including a Canadian Red Ensign carried at Vimy Ridge in 1917, a Union flag from the 1942 British surrender of Singapore, and another found among the wreckage of the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks); personal mementoes, souvenirs and miscellanea such as trench art; orders, medals and decorations (including collections of Victoria and George Crosses); military equipment; firearms and ammunition, ordnance, edged weapons, clubs (such as trench clubs) and other weapons, and vehicles, aircraft and ships. The museum holds the national collection of modern firearms. The firearms collection includes a rifle used by T. E. Lawrence, and an <b>automatic</b> <b>pistol</b> owned by Winston Churchill.

The museum's vehicles collection includes Ole Bill, a bus used by British forces in the First World War, and a number of vehicles used by Field Marshal Montgomery during the Second World War. The museum's aircraft collection includes aircraft that are notable for their rarity, such as the only complete and original Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 in existence and one of only two surviving TSR-2 strike aircraft, and aircraft associated with particular actions, such as a Supermarine Spitfire flown during the Battle of Britain.

The popularity of the [...]32 ACP in the early half of the 20th century cannot be overstated—especially in Europe. Firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd of the UK informed author Ian Fleming, his countryman, that James Bond's side arm should be a Walther PPK chambered in [...]32 ACP.
