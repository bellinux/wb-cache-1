5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green undercoat, then with pink, which gave the faces <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Manchester Mark 1 {{began in}} August 1948, {{with the initial}} aim of {{providing}} the university with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given {{a demonstration of the}} prototype, and was so impressed that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.|$|E

25|$|A gynoid is a {{humanoid}} robot that is gendered feminine. Gynoids appear widely in science fiction film and art. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> {{humanoid robot}} design is technologically possible, {{they are also}} emerging in real-life robot design.|$|R

5|$|Graphically, F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> appearance; {{the latter}} is used to {{give the appearance of}} depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. Volumetric lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E
5|$|In January 1972, the State Committee for Cinematography {{requested}} editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These included <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> {{film with}} a clearer {{image of the}} future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972.|$|E
5|$|Reconciling the {{continuity}} of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> level.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, Chappell {{found the}} ACB obdurate in his {{attempts}} {{to make a living}} from the game. In 1969 and 1970, they refused his applications to play professionally in England. As Australian captain, he made several unsuccessful representations at ACB meetings in an effort to secure <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> financial deal for the Australian players. In consultations with the then-president of the ACTU, Bob Hawke, he explored the possibility of unionising the players.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{progressive}} reforms advocated by McCreary and {{passed in the}} 1912 legislative session were making women eligible to vote in school board elections, mandating direct primary elections, and allowing the state's counties to hold local option elections {{to decide whether or}} not to adopt prohibition. McCreary appointed a tax commission to study the revenue system, and the Board of Assessments and Valuation made <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> appraisal of corporate property. McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, {{before and after the}} trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.|$|E

5|$|Character Designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nicolas Marlet {{worked on}} setting {{the design and}} overall look of the {{character}}s. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The Backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use of Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E

5|$|It is {{the only}} Bond film to be {{directed}} by Peter R. Hunt, who {{had served as a}} film editor and second unit director on previous films in the series. Hunt, along with producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, decided to produce <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> film that would follow the novel closely. It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was still one of the top performing films of the year. Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time.|$|E
5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed too far away, however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play for them, as he considered it to be <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E
50|$|Released on April 1, 2016, OpenTTD 1.6.0 focused {{mainly on}} {{aesthetics}} by introducing a new, redesigned land generator which gave coastlines and hills <b>a</b> <b>more</b> curved, <b>realistic</b> terrain.|$|R

5|$|Retrospectively, GoldenEye 007 is {{considered}} an important game {{in the history of}} first-person shooters for demonstrating the viability of game consoles as platforms for the genre, and for signalling a transition from the then-standard Doom-like approach to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> style. It pioneered features such as atmospheric single-player missions, stealth elements, and a console multiplayer deathmatch mode. The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A spiritual successor, Perfect Dark, was released in 2000, while a reimagining of the game, also titled GoldenEye 007, was released in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Strike is set {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-Communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, a broken leg causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system was designed as <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for a broken leg. The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E
50|$|Glow plug engines can be {{designed}} for two-cycle operation (ignition every rotation) or four-cycle operation (ignition every two rotations). The two-cycle (or two-stroke) version produces more power, but the four-cycle engines have more low-end torque, are less noisy and have <b>a</b> lower-pitched, <b>more</b> <b>realistic</b> sound.|$|R
50|$|Yoo {{also asked}} actor Kim Rae-won to shed 15 {{kilograms}} since his character {{works as a}} rag man {{in the beginning of}} the film; Kim lost the weight in one month, which he said also made his fist-fighting scenes as <b>a</b> gangster <b>more</b> <b>realistic.</b>|$|R
