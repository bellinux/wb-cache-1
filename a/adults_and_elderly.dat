25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

50|$|After {{the forming}} {{of the new}} centre in the 19th century, the city {{expanded}} northward. The intense industrialization {{which began in the}} 1860s in Helsinki saw the construction of the industrial areas around Sörnäinen harbour and to the workers' district of Kallio, with the area becoming inhabited mostly by factory workers. However, most of the working-class families have long ago been replaced as the most typical Kallio residents by young <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> people living alone, in a process which could be seen as some sort of gentrification. For many people who move into Helsinki from elsewhere in Finland, Kallio is the area where they first settle. Most flats are small, and rents are typically lower than elsewhere in central Helsinki, partly explaining the area's popularity among students and artists. The small flat sizes also mean that Kallio is expected to resist full gentrification. However, the rents have increased as the district has grown more popular and become an increasingly desirable area to live in.|$|E

The aim of this work was to observe the collagen tissue of the myocardium {{of the human heart}} as a function of age. The types of collagen, as well as the density of collagen tissue and the diameter of collagen fibrils, were examined. Fragments of the left ventricular wall from 15 hearts, 5 from children, 5 from young <b>adults,</b> <b>and</b> 5 from <b>elderly</b> individuals, were analyzed by using the Picrosirius-polarization method and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed the presence of collagen type III and collagen type I, both in the endomysium and perimysium of the 3 groups studied. Measurements of collagen content in myocardial tissue displayed that both endomysial and perimysial collagen increase in number and thickness in the <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly.</b> These histochemical results coincided with the observations obtained with the electron microscope in showing {{an increase in the number}} of collagen fibrils with a large diameter in the <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> hearts.

40|$|Background The psychometric {{properties}} of the three-item Minimal Insomnia Symptom Scale (MISS) were evaluated using the classical test theory. Different cut-offs for identifying insomnia were suggested in two age groups (≥ 6 and ≥ 7 among <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> people, respectively). The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the measurement properties of the MISS using the Rasch measurement model, with special emphasis on differential item functioning by gender and age. Methods Cross-sectional MISS data from adult (age 20 – 64 years, n[*]=[*] 1075) <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> (age 65 +, n[*]=[*] 548) populations were analysed using the Rasch measurement model. Results Data generally met Rasch model requirements and the scale could separate between two distinct groups of people. Differential item functioning was found by age but not gender. The difference between the <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> samples was lower for the originally recommended ≥ 6 points cut-off (0. 09 logits) than for the ≥ 7 points cut-off (0. 23 logits), but greater at the lower and higher ends of the scale. Conclusions This study provides general support for the measurement properties of the MISS. Caution should be exercised in comparing raw MISS scores between age groups, but applying a ≥ 6 cut-off appears to allow for valid comparisons between <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> the <b>elderly</b> regarding the presence of insomnia. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to determine the clinically optimal cut-score for identification of insomnia...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{presentation}} is to discuss research methods for data collection togive voice throughout the lifespan including children, <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly.</b> More specifically,the aim is to present research methods to capture intergenerational experiences ofpsychosocial well-being, and transformation of knowledge between age groups. Subjectivewell-being is people’s positive evaluation of their lives including pleasant emotions,fulfillment and satisfaction. The methods {{are based on the}} concept of salutogenese, focusingon empowerment combining written and oral, individual and group methods to access variousforms of communication. The focus is on self-determination, ability to influence andparticipation as dimensions of empowerment, which lead us to an approach that is solutionfocusedwith a starting point in the participants’ own experiences of psychosocial well-being. First reflective narratives – open letters – are offered to the children, <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> as away to share their experiences, thoughts and ideas on how to amplify health and well-being. Then participants meet in different constellations, focus groups, to share their healthpromoting experiences first with each homogeneous group; children, <b>adults</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly,</b> thenin mixed age groups. The purpose of the heterogeneous focus groups are to develop the openletters, with health promotion ideas the individual participants have written, in order todeepen the understanding of how health promotion activities can be designed in differentcontexts. The purpose of the homogeneous focus groups are to make knowledgetransformation possible between different age groups, both as a way to enrich the discussionabout the topic as well as to empower the participants. Based on research showing thatpsychosocial well-being increase when people are listened to, taken seriously and have thepossibility to participate, these research methods may not only be ways to collect researchdata but promote health and well-being as well.

40|$|Background: When H 1 N 1 v {{vaccines}} {{become widely}} available, most elderly subjects will have already received their seasonal influenza vaccination. Adults seeking H 1 N 1 v vaccination may be offered seasonal vaccine as well. We investigated prior seasonal vaccination in <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> subjects, <b>and</b> concomitant vaccination with seasonal vaccine in adults, on the tolerability and immunogenicity of the Novartis MF 59 -adjuvanted H 1 N 1 v vaccine, Focetria ®. Methods: A total of 264 <b>adult</b> (four groups) <b>and</b> 154 <b>elderly</b> (three groups) subjects were enrolled. The licensure study cohorts for plain (Agrippal ®) and MF 59 -adjuvanted (Fluad ®) 2009 - 2010 seasonal vaccines {{were invited to}} receive Focetria 3 months later, with seasonal vaccine-naïve controls, <b>and</b> <b>adults</b> who received Focteria and seasonal vaccine concomitantly. Immunogenicity of all vaccines was assessed by haemagglutination inhibition on Days 1 and 22, safety and reactogenicity were monitored using patient diaries. Results: All <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> groups met all the European CHMP licensing criteria for H 1 N 1 v, as did adults receiving concomitant seasonal vaccine for the three seasonal strains. Vaccines were generally well tolerated, causing no SAEs, and profiles typical of MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccines. Reactions were mainly mild or moderate and transient, and unaffected by prior or concomitant seasonal vaccination except for elderly subjects previously given MF 59 -adjuvanted seasonal vaccine, whose reaction rates to Focetria were about half those seen in groups receiving their first MF 59 vaccine. Conclusion: One dose of MF 59 -adjuvanted H 1 N 1 v vaccine met the licensure criteria for <b>adult</b> <b>and</b> <b>elderly</b> subjects 3 months after seasonal vaccination, or concomitantly with seasonal vaccine in adults, without impacting the tolerability or immunogenicity of either vaccine, thus facilitating mass influenza immunisation campaigns...|$|R
