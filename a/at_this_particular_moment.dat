Ney accomplished this with what was left of D'Erlon's corps soon after 18:00. Ney then moved horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre and began to destroy the infantry squares at short-range with canister. This all but destroyed the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment, and the 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square. Wellington's centre was now {{on the verge of collapse}} and wide open to an attack from the French. Luckily for Wellington, Pirch I's and Zieten's corps of the Prussian Army were now at hand. Zieten's corps permitted the two fresh cavalry brigades of Vivian and Vandeleur on Wellington's extreme left to be moved and posted behind the depleted centre. Pirch I Corps then proceeded to support Bülow and together they regained possession of Plancenoit, and once more the Charleroi road was swept by Prussian round shot.

Specifically, the chapter looks at the position of women in the Berlusconi IV government. By the time Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister in November 2011, there were five women in the cabinet. Largely holding marginal portfolios, and much criticised for simply augmenting Berlusconi’s masculinity, they remain largely under-studied as a political phenomenon.

40|$|Loss {{is a part}} of our atomic make-up: {{as energy}} {{persists}} and develops, so it creates memory of place and time. Our world is a remnant of others’ loss and will be so for those beyond us: much of our presence is confirmed by what we leave behind us. How much easier it is to dispense with a loved one’s possessions when they are still alive is an indication of that shift from the inanimate to the shrine. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> very <b>particular</b> <b>moment</b> in our history loss seems magnified in the media, in terms of human life, habitat, morality and economic integrity.

Losing the familiar, whether in terms of an object or an environment, stimulates similar mental and emotional processes that recreate through memory a personalised image that becomes a reshaped replacement for the original.

40|$|September 1, 1999, saw {{the opening}} of Paris Las Vegas, the most ambitiously themed of Las Vegas’s resorts to that date. In 2001, Baz Luhrmann’s Moulin Rouge and Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Le Fabuleux destin d’Amélie Poulain were {{released}} to huge popular success. These two films share with the Vegas resort the mobilization of the brand or commodity “Paris,” and function via a shared alchemy of appeals to potential consumers (tourists and viewers in all cases). All feature prominent use of totemic Parisian imagery to situate their narratives, and invite us to travel to a “Paris” born of collective memory. This paper examines how Paris is commodified by the films and resort, {{as well as what}} these three examples can reveal about the image of Paris as an imaginary construct. It is necessary to examine the three phenomena as equal manifestations of a spike in an enduring fascination with particular concepts of Paris in the popular imagination and in the uses of commodity culture – a vogue heightened around {{the end of the twentieth}} century and the beginning of the next. Analysis of the of the Parisian phenomenon circa 1999 - 2001 – as manifest by the resort and the two feature films – benefits from consideration of its relationships to Guy Debord’s theories of the spectacle, and to theorizations of nostalgia and the touristic drive. This analysis reveals how the brand of Paris may have been mobilized in an especially pronounced way <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> cultural <b>moment</b> to serve as a container or palliative for anxieties around the impending turn of the century, the new millennium and the global changes <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> passage of time seemed to underline...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{consider}} {{the range of}} political interpretations that have been placed upon “open access” to academic research. This stretches from those, like Jeffrey Beall, who condemn the phenomenon {{as a mode of}} “collectivizing production and denying the freedom of the press from those who prefer the subscription model of scholarly publishing”, to those, such as John Holmwood, who see a danger in OA of neoliberal appropriation and re-enclosure (Beall 2013; Holmwood 2013 b; Holmwood 2013 a). I also examine the ways in which open access to reading can facilitate a co-productive mode of open access to writing; a mass intellectuality. Indeed, it strikes me that open access may be a fundamental historical pre-requisite for a mass intellectuality, in which a society-wide and disciplinarily ambiguous co-production and mutual harnessing of intellectual labour – wheresoever it may be found – can become possible. Beginning from a description of the forms of open access, I note that there are intrinsic power motivations at play in the enforcement of OA mandates, often linked to corporate finance, and that, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment,</b> it is possible to effect apolitical interpretations, socialist interpretations and capitalist interpretations of the movement. Like many social changes engendered by the internet – and while eschewing technological fetishism (Sayre 2005) – I also argue that {{it is very difficult to}} predict the outcomes, even if one group's intentions are clear. From this diagnosis, I next move to suggest the ways in which those with a democratic outlook on mass intellectuality can take a role of intellectual leadership – through innovative experimentation – to act to decouple the potentially dangerous side-effects of OA from its liberating potential: an upending of traditional hierarchies of research universities based purely on extant accumulated capital. Finally, I note that OA on its own is not enough, amid radical projects, to re-think the hierarchies and divisions of labour, but that it can be a useful tool along that road, so long as proponents are vigilant for the dangers of recuperation and co-option...|$|R
40|$|International audienceConsultation {{with medical}} {{physician}} is organised in several phases (Byrne and Long 1976, Ten Have 1989, Cosnier 1993, Traverso, 2001). The different phases {{the authors are}} distinguishing are almost always similar. Even though the phases are presented in an organised and linear way, the interlocutors may navigate from one phase to another, in particular if different problems are evocated along the interaction (Ten Have 1989). The different phases have been well described in the literature (Heritage and Maynard 2005, Ten Have 2002) but little {{has been said about}} the transition from one phase to another: when does it appear? How is it done? By whom? <b>This</b> study aims <b>at</b> exploring <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>moment</b> in the interaction looking at the different modalities that may be involved. We intend to do so using the analysis of interaction in a multimodal perspective. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} behaviour of the participants is evolving through the interaction (Guardiola et al. 2012). For example, during medical encounter, the doctor is usually the main speaker but appears to give the floor to the patient in the second half of the interaction when the latter thus become the main speaker (Vergely et al. 2011). Therefore, we suppose that the transitions might be produced differently through the interaction. The corpus analysed was created by and belongs to the Institut Paoli-Calmette (Marseille, France) and is an authentic corpus of training sessions for doctors involved in role plays with an actor playing the role of a patient. It is composed by 6 audio-video recorded interactions involving one doctor in training and one actor/patient. Each dialogue is about 15 minutes long. The participants are involved in a consultation to break bad news. In our case, the actor actually plays the role of the patient’s relative. We conducted both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Changes of topic were considered as changes of phase. Then, transitions were described in terms of the phases involved, speech production, co-speech gestures production (McNeill, 1992), gaze, head movements and posture (Tan et al. 2010) of each participant. Preliminary results show that participants first tend to follow the linear order of the phases then they return to earlier phases when needed. In the first stage of the consultation, transitions are initiated by the doctor and follow the linear order, and then are initiated by the patient depending on the needs of the latter. Transitions are mostly introduced by statements when done by the physician, and by questions when done by the patient. Both types of sentences are accompanied by co-speech gestures. Interestingly, before each transition the patient is not reacting, meaning that he doesn’t produce speech nor co-speech movements...|$|R

40|$|Scholarship on Post-Apartheid South African {{literature}} {{has engaged in}} various ways with the politics of identity, but its dominant mode has been to understand the literature through an anxious rupture-continuation paradigm in which the Apartheid past manifests itself in the present. However, in the contemporary moment, there are writers whose texts attempt to forge new paths in their depictions of identities both individual and collective. These texts are useful in contemplating how South Africans experience belonging and dislocation in various contexts. In this thesis, I consider a range of contemporary South African texts via the figure of life-writing. My analysis demonstrates that, while many texts in the contemporary moment have displayed new and more complex registers of perception concerning the issue of ‘race’, {{there is a need}} for more expansive and fluid conceptions of crafting identity, as regards the politics of space and how this intersects with issues of belonging and identity. That is, much South African literature still continues along familiar trajectories of meaning, ones which are not well-equipped to understand issues that bedevil the country <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> historical <b>moment,</b> which are grounded in the political compromises that came to pass during the ‘time of transition’. These issues include the recent spate of xenophobia attacks, which have yet to be comprehensively and critically analysed in the critical domain, despite the work of theorists such as David Coplan. Such events indicate the need for more layered and intricate understandings of how our national identity is structured: Who may belong? Who is excluded? In what situations? This thesis engages with these questions in order to determine how systems of power are constructed, reified, mediated, reproduced and/or resisted in the country’s literature. To do this, I perform an attentive reading of the mosaic image of South African culture that emerges through a selection of contemporary works of literature. The texts I have selected are notable for the ways in which they engage with the epistemic protocol of coming to know the Other and the self through the lens of the Apartheid past. That engagement may take the form of a reassertion, reclamation, displacement, or complication of selfhood. Given that South African identities are overinscribed in paradigms in which the Apartheid past is primary, what potentials and limits are presently encountered when writing of the self/selves is attempted? My study goes beyond simply asserting that not all groups have equal access to representation. Rather, I demonstrate that the linear shaping of the South African culture of letters imposes certain restrictions on who may work within it. Here, the politics of publishing and the increasing focus on urban spaces (such that other spaces become marginalized in ways that reflect the proclivities of the reading public) are subjected to close scrutiny. Overall, my thesis aims to promote a rethinking of South African culture, and how that culture is represented in, and defined through, our literature...|$|R
