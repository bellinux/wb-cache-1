5|$|Decade of <b>Aggression</b> <b>is</b> {{a double}} live album by Slayer, {{released}} on October 22, 1991, through Def American Records (later renamed to American Recordings) and produced by Rick Rubin. The album {{was recorded in}} three separate places on three separate dates. Its working title was Decade of Decadence until Mötley Crüe registered the name. Three of the album's tracks {{were included in the}} box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse. The album's reception was generally positive, with Entertainment Weekly and Robert Christgau both giving the album a positive rating. The album reached number 55 in the Billboard 200 and also charted on two other charts.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a granivore {{and adapted}} for {{the consumption of}} seedheads, with a conical beak {{to remove the seeds}} and agile feet to grip the stems of seedheads while feeding. It is a social bird, and will gather in large flocks while feeding and migrating. It may behave territorially during nest construction, but this <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> short-lived. Its breeding season is tied to the peak of food supply, beginning in late July, which is relatively late in the year for a finch. This species is generally monogamous, and produces one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{has four}} basic vocalisations; a {{guttural}} hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters {{between males and}} females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel's way of expressing <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of the}} stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.|$|E

40|$|Relations {{among social}} preference, {{perceived}} popularity, social intelligence and {{two types of}} aggressive behaviour were studied. Peer-estimation techniques were used to measure all major variables. Altogether, 403 Greek schoolchildren from fourth-through sixth-grade classrooms participated in the study. Both overt and relational <b>aggression</b> <b>were</b> negatively associated with social preference for girls; overt <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with perceived popularity for boys. Relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with perceived popularity for both boys and girls, and social information processing only for girls. In addition, as <b>was</b> hypothesized, relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> predicted by cognitive aspects of social intelligence whereas overt aggression by lack of social skills.

40|$|Relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> studied within {{classroom}} environments {{by examining}} individual and classroom correlates among 2731 children (3 rd- 5 th graders) during two successive measurement years. Multilevel analyses yielded small gender differences for relational aggression, indicating that such aggressive behavior was more associated with girls {{as compared to}} boys. Findings further demonstrated that relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> positively associated with perceived popularity and peer rejection. Relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> also found to be highly stable over time. Additionally, higher classroom aggression norms, reflected by the classroom level for relational <b>aggression,</b> <b>were</b> associated with increased relational aggression in children. Although variation in relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> situated both at class- and individual-level, differences between individuals were considerably larger than differences between classes. Limitations and further research suggestions are provided and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2008 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|The {{presence}} of female social dominance sets lemurs apart from most other primates and mammals; in most primate societies, males are dominant unless females band {{together to form}} coalitions that displace them. However, many Eulemur species are exceptions and the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) does not exhibit female dominance. When females are dominant within a group, the way they maintain dominance varies. Ring-tailed lemur males act submissively with or without signs of female aggression. Male crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), on the other hand, will only act submissively when females act aggressively towards them. Female <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> often associated with, but not limited to, feeding.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{military}} experience {{began in the}} French and Indian War with a commission as a major in the militia of the British Province of Virginia. In 1753 Washington was sent as an ambassador from the British crown to the French officials and Indians {{as far north as}} present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. The following year he led another expedition to the area to assist in the construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before reaching that point, he and some of his men, accompanied by Indian allies, ambushed a French scouting party. Its leader was killed, although the exact circumstances of his death were disputed. This peacetime act of <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> seen {{as one of the first}} military steps leading to the global Seven Years' War. The French responded by attacking fortifications Washington erected following the ambush, forcing his surrender. Released on parole, Washington and his troops returned to Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. <b>Aggression</b> <b>is</b> shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} whether overt and relational forms of reactive and proactive <b>aggression</b> <b>were</b> differentially related to adolescents’ temperament and attachment security. Measures of adolescents’ temperament, attachment security, and <b>aggression</b> <b>were</b> completed by 211 adolescents, ages 10 – 14, and their caregivers. Attachment security was consistently associated with all four dimensions of aggression, whereas proneness to frustration {{was found to}} be uniquely associated with reactive-overt <b>aggression.</b> Additionally, it <b>was</b> found that at lower levels of effortful control more secure attachment was related to lower levels of reactive-relational aggression. Results also indicated that, for girls, the relation between attachment and proactive-overt and proactive-relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> only significant when effortful control was low. Conversely, for boys, the relation between attachment and proactive-overt aggression and proactive-relational <b>aggression</b> <b>was</b> significant when effortful control was high.

5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} classifications and {{dimensions}} of aggression have been suggested. These depend on {{such things as}} whether the <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> verbal or physical; {{whether or not it}} involves relational aggression such as covert bullying and social manipulation; whether harm to others is intended or not; whether it is carried out actively or expressed passively; and whether the <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> aimed directly or indirectly. Classification may also encompass aggression-related emotions (e.g. anger) and mental states (e.g. impulsivity, hostility). Aggression may occur in response to non-social as well as social factors, and can have a close relationship with stress coping style. Aggression may be displayed in order to intimidate.|$|E
25|$|Konrad Lorenz {{stated in}} his 1963 classic, On Aggression, that human {{behavior}} {{is shaped by}} four main, survival-seeking animal drives. Taken together, these drives—hunger, fear, reproduction, and aggression—achieve natural selection. E. O. Wilson elaborated in On Human Nature that <b>aggression</b> <b>is,</b> typically, a means of gaining control over resources. <b>Aggression</b> <b>is,</b> thus, aggravated during times when high population densities generate resource shortages. According to Richard Leakey and his colleagues, aggression in humans has also increased by becoming more interested in ownership and by defending his or her property. However, UNESCO adopted the Seville Statement of Violence in 1989 that refuted claims, by evolutionary scientists, that genetics by itself was the sole cause of aggression.|$|E
25|$|Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scale (IPAS) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire. Half of {{the items}} {{describe}} impulsive aggression and half the items describe premeditated aggression. Aggressive behavior has traditionally been classified into two distinct subtypes, impulsive or premeditated. Impulsive <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> defined as a hair-trigger aggressive response to provocation with loss of behavioral control. Premeditated <b>aggression</b> <b>is</b> defined as a planned or conscious aggressive act, not spontaneous or related to an agitated state. The IPAS is designed to characterize aggressive behavior as predominately impulsive or predominately premeditated in nature. Those subjects who clustered on the impulsive factor showed {{a broad range of}} emotional and cognitive impairments; those who clustered on the premeditated factor showed a greater inclination for aggression and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
