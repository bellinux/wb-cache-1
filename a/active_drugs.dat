5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically <b>active</b> <b>drugs.</b> Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E

5000|$|Generic drug {{applications}} are termed [...] "abbreviated" [...] because (in comparison with a New Drug Application) {{they are generally}} not required to include preclinical (animal and in vitro) and clinical (human) trial data to establish safety and effectiveness. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs {{in the same manner}} as the innovator drug). One way scientists demonstrate bioequivalence is to measure the time it takes the generic drug to reach the bloodstream in 24 to 36 healthy volunteers. This gives them the rate of absorption, or bioavailability, of the generic drug, which they can then compare to that of the innovator drug. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a patient's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug. In cases of topically <b>active</b> <b>drugs,</b> the bioequivalence of a drug can be demonstrated by comparing drugs dissolution or transdermal drug absorption is compared with the innovator drug.

40|$|A novel {{therapy for}} {{improving}} selectivity in cancer chemotherapy aims to modify distribution of a cytotoxic drug by generating it selectively at tumour sites. In this approach an antibody-enzyme conjugate {{is allowed to}} localise at the tumour sites before injecting a prodrug which is converted to an <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> specifically by the targeted enzyme in the conjugate. We present here pharmacokinetic studies on the prodrug 4 -(bis (2 -chloroethyl) amino) benzoyl-L-glutamic acid and its activated derivative, benzoic acid mustard. The glutamic acid is cleaved from the prodrug to form the <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> by carboxypeptidase G 2 (CPG 2), an enzyme from Pseudomonas sp., which is not found in mammalian cells. The prodrug and its parent <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> were rapidly distributed in plasma and tissues after administration of prodrug or <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> (41 mumol kg- 1 intraperitoneally) to mice bearing human choriocarcinoma xenografts. Prodrug and <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> both followed a two-compartment kinetic model. Prodrug was eliminated more rapidly (t 1 / 2 alpha = 0. 12 h, t 1 / 2 beta = 0. 70 h) than <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> (t 1 / 2 alpha = 0. 37 h, t 1 / 2 beta = 1. 61 h). Conversion of the prodrug to the activated parent drug was detected within 5 min of administration to mice which had previously received a F(ab') 2 -anti-human chorionic gonadotrophin antibody (W 14 A) conjugated to the enzyme, CPG 2 (1, 000 U kg- 1). Tumour was the only tissue that activated all the prodrug reaching the site. It contained the highest concentration of targeted enzyme conjugate capable of catalysing the reaction of prodrug to drug. Plasma and other tissues were also capable of activating the prodrug but <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> production was limited {{by the amount of}} enzyme present. The <b>active</b> <b>drug</b> measured in plasma and tissues other than tumour was attributable to residual antibody-enzyme conjugate at non-tumour sites.

50|$|Moclobemide is {{considered}} to be less toxic in overdose compared to older antidepressants, such as the tricyclic antidepressants and nonselective, irreversible MAO inhibitors, making it a safer antidepressant in the elderly or people with physical disorders. Of 18 people who overdosed on moclobemide during clinical trials, all recovered fully and moclobemide was judged to be safe for in as well as outpatient use. Intoxications with moclobemide as single agent are usually mild; however, when combined with tricyclic or SSRI antidepressants the overdose much more toxic and potentially fatal. Moclobemide, is preferred by doctors for patients who are at risk of suicide, due to moclobemide's low toxicity in overdose. Patients with mixed intoxications (e.g. with other CNS <b>active</b> <b>drugs)</b> may show severe or life-threatening symptoms and should be hospitalized.

50|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} {{in the application of}} IC in the analysis of pharmaceutical drugs. IC is used in different aspects of product development and quality control testing. For example, IC is used to improve stabilities and solubility properties of pharmaceutical <b>active</b> <b>drugs</b> molecules as well as used to detect systems that have higher tolerance for organic solvents. IC has been used for the determination of analytes {{as a part of a}} dissolution test. For instance, calcium dissolution tests have shown that other ions present in the medium can be well resolved among themselves and also from the calcium ion. Therefore, IC has been employed in drugs in the form of tablets and capsules in order to determine the amount of drug dissolve with time. IC is also widely used for detection and quantification of excipients or inactive ingredients used in pharmaceutical formulations. Detection of sugar and sugar alcohol in such formulations through IC has been done due to these polar groups getting resolved in ion column. IC methodology also established in analysis of impurities in drug substances and products. Impurities or any components that are not part of the drug chemical entity are evaluated and they give insights about the maximum and minimum amounts of drug that should be administered in a patient per day.|$|E

5000|$|Type IA prodrugs {{include many}} {{antimicrobial}} and chemotherapy agents (e.g., 5-flurouracil). Type IB agents rely on metabolic enzymes, especially in hepatic cells, to bioactivate the prodrugs intracellularly to <b>active</b> <b>drugs.</b> Type II prodrugs are bioactivated extracelluarly, {{either in the}} milieu of GI fluids (Type IIA), within the systemic circulation and/or other extracellular fluid compartments (Type IIB), or near therapeutic target tissues/cells (Type IIC), relying on common enzymes such as esterases and phosphatases or target directed enzymes. Importantly, prodrugs can belong to multiple subtypes (i.e., Mixed-Type). A Mixed-Type prodrug {{is one that is}} bioactivated at multiple sites, either in parallel or sequential steps. For example, a prodrug, which is bioactivated concurrently in both target cells and metabolic tissues, could be designated as a [...] "Type IA/IB" [...] prodrug (e.g., HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors and some chemotherapy agents; note the symbol [...] " [...] / [...] " [...] applied here). When a prodrug is bioactivated sequentially, for example initially in GI fluids then systemically within the target cells, it is designated as a [...] "Type IIA-IA" [...] prodrug (e.g., tenofovir disoproxil; note the symbol [...] " [...] - [...] " [...] applied here). Many antibody- virus- and gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapies (ADEPTs, VDEPTs, GDEPTs) and proposed nanoparticle- or nanocarrier-linked drugs can understandably be Sequential Mixed-Type prodrugs. To differentiate these two Subtypes, the symbol dash [...] " [...] - [...] " [...] is used to designate and to indicate sequential steps of bioactivation, and is meant to distinguish from the symbol slash [...] " [...] / [...] " [...] used for the Parallel Mixed-Type prodrugs (see Table 1 in Wu, K.M. and Table 1 in Wu and Farrelly).|$|E
