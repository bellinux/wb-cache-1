5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kick}} {{and a short}} return, Florida State began a drive at the Tech 34-yard line, {{seemingly}} in excellent field position. But on the first play of the State drive, the Seminoles were stopped for a loss. State was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a short gain on the second play, but on the third, Weinke was sacked {{for the third time}} in the game. After the Seminole punt and a touchback, Tech's offense started at its 20-yard line. The Hokies picked up a first down with an option run to Stith, then Vick ran for a long gain and another first down at the Florida State 20-yard line. Stith picked up seven yards on a rush up the middle of the field, then Vick completed a first-down pass to Derek Carter inside the Seminole 10-yard line. Kendrick advanced the ball to the Seminole three-yard line, then Vick ran the remaining yardage for a touchdown. Following the extra point, Tech cut Florida State's lead to 2814 with 37 seconds remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than one-third the density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E

Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.|$|E

25|$|Many {{adventure}} games {{make use}} of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode. Players are only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> some objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important. Because {{it can be difficult}} for a player to know if they missed an important item, they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a point and click device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.|$|E

25|$|Although the SAM {{supported}} commerce, by arranging products by type {{rather than}} by brand it helped visitors compare features and prices. The Salon organizers tried to impose some degree of uniformity on the display stands, but there was naturally competition by the vendors to attract attention through taller and more original stands. To counteract this, all displays had to meet standards and be approved by a committee. There was some social segregation. The displays of inexpensive small items in the basement from 1956 tended to be fairly chaotic, with visitors <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and examine the products, while the booths upstairs showing the larger and more expensive items were calmer and more elegant.|$|E
