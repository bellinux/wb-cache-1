5|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, there were two {{accidents}} (one serious) caused by what {{is believed to be}} loose objects hitting riders while riding the roller coaster. The most serious accident was when a man got struck with an object and had to get his eye removed due to the amount of damage. On the same day that the man got hit, Universal Studios announced that the coasters would not duel until an investigation was completed. For two months the coasters were dispatched separately and in mid-October 2011, Universal made the decision to remove the dueling aspect of the ride permanently without <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> to what caused the injuries. No injuries have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 April 2013, the Facebook and Twitter {{accounts}} of Valor por Tamaulipas were shut down unexpectedly and without <b>any</b> <b>explanation.</b> A new page with the same name was created by other administrators, who said {{that they did not know}} what had happened to the original administrator but that they wanted to continue his work nonetheless. This raised concerns about who was actually working behind the scenes to keep the page running. Another page run by other users and with a similar name, Responsabilidad por Tamaulipas ("Responsibility for Tamaulipas"), posted on their page that Valor por Tamaulipas had only closed temporarily in order to improve the page and protect the administrator. They advised online users to ignore websites that posed as the original page.|$|E

5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|Podgorny's {{life after}} his {{resignation}} {{is not well}} documented. The last mention of him in any major Soviet media was his meeting with Urho Kekkonen, the President of Finland. There was never <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> given, nor a denunciation of him, by the Soviet authorities. Podgorny retained his seat in the Supreme Soviet after his downfall. He was seen at the 61st anniversary reception of the October Revolution at the Grand Palace of the Kremlin in November 1978 by Tokichiro Uomoto, the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Podgorny spoke to Brezhnev, Kosygin, and then to Andrei Gromyko, all of whom looked embarrassed {{by the presence of}} Podgorny, according to Uomoto. Soon after this incident, Podgorny lost his seat in the Supreme Soviet. In Tretyakov Gallery, Podgorny was removed from the 1977 painting of the Soviet leaders at the Red Square by Dmitriy Nalbandyan in which Podgorny stood between Brezhnev and Kosygin. Podgorny died of cancer on 12 January 1983, and was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.|$|E

They had a profitable and discreet business relationship, which was only visible in a few unusual and incomplete documents and contracts, most of which were undated, and some were signed in the wrong places. Almost every document dealt with interest-free loans with no specified date of repayment. In 1999, Shaik wrote all the loans off without <b>any</b> <b>explanation.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Any</b> <b>explanation</b> of {{what goes}} on in a {{specific}} individual observation of one photon has {{to take into account the}} whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded. Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication. Because this would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity, we believe that such a viewpoint should be given up entirely.|$|E
25|$|Eric: Eric {{is portrayed}} as a {{diminutive}} teenager with visible Irish ancestry that influences his first story. As he has only had two stories in the first season before his character was cut, there is no visible theme in his storytelling {{but they seem to}} be about incredibly powerful evil forces (ones never proved innocent or misunderstood like some others). In his short run on the show, Eric was shown to be rather snide and negative, spending most of the time making sarcastic remarks and antagonizing the other members, especially Frank. He is the only character to leave the show without <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> for his departure.|$|E

25|$|Two changes {{took place}} in the fall of 1979, at the {{beginning}} of the fourth season. The first was the addition of Lana, an older woman who chased Jack around. She liked to pursue him but he did not appreciate her advances. Since Ann Wedgeworth did not appreciate her diminishing role in the series, Lana was dropped from the show without <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> before the season was half over. The other new addition that fall was the new building manager, Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts), whose brother Bart bought the building from the Ropers. Mr. Furley pursued Lana unsuccessfully, as she unsuccessfully pursued Jack. Unlike Lana, Mr. Furley appeared until the end of the series.|$|E
25|$|Usually by {{a system}} of prices. But prices depend on profit rate. In the Heckscher–Ohlin model, the rate of profit is {{determined}} according to how abundant capital is. If capital is scarce, it has {{a high rate of}} profit. If it is abundant, the profit rate is low. Here is a logical circle. Before the profit rate is determined, the amount of capital is not measured. This logical difficulty was the subject of academic controversy many years ago—sometimes called the Cambridge Capital Controversies. The conclusion of the controversies was that the concept of homogeneous capital was untenable. Heckscher–Ohlin theorists ignore all these stories without providing <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> how capital is measured theoretically.|$|E
25|$|Young Earth creationism is {{most famous}} for an {{opposition}} {{to the theory of}} evolution, but believers also are on record opposing many measurements, facts, and principles in the fields of physics and chemistry, dating methods including radiometric dating, geology, astronomy, cosmology, and paleontology. Young Earth creationists do not accept <b>any</b> <b>explanation</b> for natural phenomena which deviates from the veracity of a plain reading of the Bible, whether it be the origins of biological diversity, the origins of life, or the origins of the universe itself. This has led some young Earth creationists to criticize other creationist proposals such as intelligent design, for not taking a strong stand on the age of the Earth, special creation, or even the identity of the designer.|$|E
