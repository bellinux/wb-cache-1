50|$|The {{role of an}} <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> is to {{make the}} surface or the {{material}} itself slightly conductive, either by being conductive itself, or by absorbing moisture from the air; therefore, some humectants can be used. The molecules of an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> often have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas, similar to those of a surfactant; the hydrophobic side interacts with the surface of the material, while the hydrophilic side interacts with the air moisture and binds the water molecules.|$|E

5000|$|Behentrimonium {{chloride}}, {{also known}} as docosyltrimethylammonium chloride or BTAC-228, is a yellow waxlike organic compound with chemical formula 3(2)21 (...) (3)3, used as an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> and, sometimes, a disinfectant. It is commonly found in cosmetics such as conditioners, hair dye, and mousse, and also in detergents. Laboratory tests have indicated {{that it does not}} readily biodegrade.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} a transparent, {{conductive}} polymer with high ductility in different applications. For example, AGFA coats 200 million photographic films per year with a thin, extensively-stretched layer of virtually transparent and colorless PEDOT:PSS as an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> to prevent electrostatic discharges during production and normal film use, independent of humidity conditions, and as electrolyte in polymer electrolytic capacitors.|$|E

40|$|Three {{factors have}} been studied which are {{significant}} {{in the development of}} ELECTROSTATIC CHARGE on HAIR FIBERS: (1) the charge generated by separation between hair fibers and brush or comb; (2) the mobility of charge on the fibers; and (3) the distribution of charge along the fiber length. Instrumentation has been developed to measure each of these parameters, and the effect upon them of quaternary ammonium compounds and other fiber treatments. Quaternary <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> are found to reduce substantially the charge generated on the fibers; the half-life of charge mobility varies with the quantity of agent on the hair. The density of charge is greatest near the fiber tips, corresponding to the region of a peak in the combing force. It is concluded that the mechanism of action of these <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> is primarily one of lubrication: a reduction in combing force leads to a reduc-tion of static charge generated on the hair...|$|R
50|$|An <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> is a {{compound}} used {{for treatment of}} materials or their surfaces {{in order to reduce}} or eliminate buildup of static electricity. Static charge may be generated by the triboelectric effect or by a non-contact process using a high voltage power source. Static charge may be introduced on a surface as part of an in-mold label printing process.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{commercial}} use of dimethyl methylphosphonate is as a flame retardant. Other {{commercial use}}s are a preignition additive for gasoline, anti-foaming agent, plasticizer, stabilizer, textile conditioner, <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent,</b> and an additive for solvents and low-temperature hydraulic fluids. It {{can be used}} as a catalyst and a reagent in organic synthesis, as it can generate a highly reactive ylide. The yearly production in the United States varies between 100 and 1000 ST.|$|E
50|$|JP-4 was a {{non-conductive}} liquid, {{prone to}} build up static electricity when being moved through pipes and tanks. As it is volatile and has a low flash point, the static discharge could cause a fire. Beginning in the mid-1980s an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> {{was added to the}} fuel to lower the charge buildup and decrease the corresponding risk of fires. Flow rates must be controlled, and all the equipment used must be electrically interconnected and well grounded.|$|E
50|$|In clothing, static cling occurs from static electricity, {{which is}} usually due to rubbing as in a clothes dryer (the triboelectric effect). It is {{especially}} noticeable when humidity is low, allowing static electricity to build up. Certain substances can reduce static cling and are often included in fabric softener and dryer sheets. <b>Antistatic</b> <b>agents,</b> which make the surfaces slightly conductive, {{can be used on}} fabrics.|$|R
50|$|Anionic {{softeners}} and <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> can be, for example, salts of monoesters and diesters of {{phosphoric acid}} and the fatty alcohols. These {{are often used}} together with the conventional cationic softeners. Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that they be added in the rinse cycle. Anionic softeners can combine with anionic surfactants directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on smectite clays. Some compounds, such as ethoxylated phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.|$|R
30|$|The {{nanocomposite}} containing 3 : 1 {{molar ratio}} of ZnO/TiO 2 {{was used to}} decolorize wastewater of a textile factory under the following conditions: catalyst loading = 6 g/L; pH about 7, and solar irradiation time = 2 h. The textile factory used BGY and Orange G(an anionic dye) for dyeing, and about 80 % photodecolorization was achieved (data not shown). Lower decolorization of the wastewater by the ZnO-TiO 2 nanocomposite {{may be due to}} the presence of other materials such as surfactants, <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents,</b> salts, etc. which inhibits the decolorization efficiency of the ZnO-TiO 2 nanocomposites.|$|R
50|$|Cocamidopropyl betaine {{is used as}} a foam booster in shampoos. It is {{a medium}} {{strength}} surfactant also used in bath products like hand soaps. It is also used in cosmetics as an emulsifying agent and thickener, and to reduce irritation purely ionic surfactants would cause. It also serves as an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> in hair conditioners, which most often does not irritate skin or mucous membranes. However, some studies indicate it is an allergen. It also has antiseptic properties, making it suitable for personal sanitary products. It is compatible with other cationic, anionic, and nonionic surfactants.|$|E
5000|$|Polystyrene-based packing peanuts were {{developed}} and patented by Tektronix Inc. They were made commercially available circa 1965 by Dow Chemical. Originally made from 100% virgin polystyrene resin, peanuts made from 100% recycled polystyrene have been commercially available since the mid-90s. The color and shape sometimes indicate {{what it is}} made of and who made it. Often green is 70% or more recycled polystyrene, white is 70% or more virgin resin and pink means an <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> has been applied; {{although there are some}} variations. The most common shapes are similar to a [...] "S", [...] "figure 8" [...] or [...] "W" [...] [...] Foam peanuts are very light (usually around 3 grams per litre/0.17 to 0.2 lb per cu ft) and easy to use.|$|E
50|$|Common {{antistatic}} {{agents are}} based on long-chain aliphatic amines (optionally ethoxylated) and amides, quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., behentrimonium chloride or cocamidopropyl betaine), esters of phosphoric acid, polyethylene glycol esters, or polyols. Traditional migrating antistatic agents include long-chain alkyl phenols, ethoxylated amines, and glycerol esters, such as glycerol monostearate. Migrating antistatic agents offer cost-effective protection for short-term applications, but other applications need longer-term protection or the lower resistivity required to prevent sparks and protect electronics from electrostatic dissipation. These applications utilize permanent antistatic agents or conductive additives such as carbon black, conductive fibers, and nanomaterials. An <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> for the treatment for coatings may also involve an ionic liquid or a solution of a salt in an ionic liquid. Indium tin oxide {{can be used as}} transparent antistatic coating of windows. It is also possible to use conductive polymers, like PEDOT:PSS and conducting polymer nanofibers, particularly polyaniline nanofibers. In general these systems are not very durable for coating, especially antimony tin oxide is used for durable systems, often in its nano form, it is then formulated to a final coating.|$|E
40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} salts, including alkyl chain, alkanol, and polymer derivatives (trimoniums) {{are used}} in cosmetics mainly as surfactant-cleansing agents, hair-conditioning <b>agents,</b> and <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents.</b> The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reviewed the relevant animal and human data and noted gaps in the available safety data {{for some of the}} trimomiums. The available data on many of the trimoniums are sufficient, however, and similar structural activity relationships, functions in cosmetics, and cosmetic product usage supported extending these data to the entire group.

50|$|Many methods {{exist for}} neutralizing, varying in use and {{effectiveness}} {{depending on the}} application. <b>Antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> are chemical compounds that {{can be added to}} an object, or the packaging of an object, to help deter the buildup or discharge of static electricity. For the neutralization of static charge in a larger area, such as a factory floor or workshop, antistatic systems may utilize electron emission effects such as corona discharge or photoemission that introduce ions into the area that combine with and neutralize any electrically charged object. In many situations, sufficient ESD protection can be achieved with electrical grounding.|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} and method of contact-electrifying a {{dielectric}} {{to determine its}} electrostatic properties is described. The dielectric is placed in contact with a contact plate means, and connected to a voltage source means to charge the contact plate and to contact-electrify the dielectric. The contact plate means is disconnected from the voltage source and a charge sensor means monitors the rate of decay of the charge on the dielectric. If a conductive path from the contact plate to ground is desired, a lead may be connected between the conductor and ground. Automatic timing and charge monitoring are preferred for maximum accuracy, especially where dielectrics treated with <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> are tested...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the surface}} {{finishing}} process of anti-alcohol, anti-oil and antistatic was applied on terylene needle-punched nonwoven filter material. We used contact angle, anti-alcohol grade, anti-oil grade, static voltage and half-life period {{as the main}} indicators for evaluating {{the effect of the}} finishing. The organic fluorine TG- 410 C and nonionic <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> TF- 481 were selected as finishing agents. The single factor experiments and orthogonal experiments were carried out on four effect factors of the finishing, including volume percent of organic fluorine, volume percent of <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent,</b> baking temperature, baking duration. The results show an optimum formula: the volume percent of organic fluorine is 20 %, the volume percent of <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent</b> is 15 %, baking temperature is 170 ℃, and baking duration is 7 min. After finishing, anti-alcohol grade can reach level eight, anti-oil grade can reach level five; the half-life period is less than 1 second. So it can be employed in filtering the air and reducing dust particle and concentration...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Novel {{antistatic}} agents containing {{metal salt}} {{were used to}} pre-pare polyurethane foam (PUF) in this study. The effects of different conditions such as amount of <b>antistatic</b> <b>agent,</b> type and ratio of metal salt, temperature, relative humidity and time, on the surface resistivity were studied. Typically, the research of replacement of silver metal salt with tin metal salt has been conducted. Antistatic property of these composites illustrates that AgIO 3 metal salt replaced by two-thirds amount of SnCl 4 also shows excellent conductivity. Structure and other properties of these conductive PUF were examined by FTIR, DSC, and TGA. Moreover, the antistatic mechanism of these agents was put up.

This can increase conductivity of the polymeric materials and decrease the corresponding surface resistivity...|$|E
50|$|<b>Antistatic</b> <b>agents</b> {{are also}} added to some {{military}} jet fuels, and to nonpolar organic solvents, to impart electrical conductivity {{to them and}} avoid buildup of static charge {{that could lead to}} sparks igniting fuel vapors. Stadis 450 is the agent added to some distillate fuels, commercial jet fuels, and to the military JP-8. Stadis 425 and Dorf Ketal's SR 1795 are similar compounds, for use in distillate fuels. Statsafe products are used in non-fuel applications. Antis DF3, similar to Stadis 425, is an amber-colored liquid composed of polyamine and polysulfone.

40|$|Review of the {{procedures}} and results of {{a program designed to}} remove the threat of sources of molecular and particulate contamination of critical optical, electrical, and mechanical elements in spacecraft. The results of recent contamination-probing thermal-vacuum tests indicate that some of the materials and practices commonly used to protect critical surfaces from molecular or particulate contamination can themselves represent significant threats. These contamination sources include clean-room and clean-tent materials, gloves, tissues, and covering or packaging materials. Mass and infrared spectral analyses of these materials and the environments and instruments exposed to them show that the contaminants are mostly plasticizers, slip or <b>antistatic</b> <b>agents,</b> and binders used in the manufacture of these products. Products of particular threat include vinyl gloves, boots, clean-tent walls, and some polyethylene sheets and bags. Techniques for reducing these threats are discussed...|$|R
