40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{development of the}} mountainous regions {{and at the same}} time the forest exploitation is the main goal of the Greek forest policy. At most of the cases the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> to the natural environment that are required, lead to consequences that downgrade it. One of the most important <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> to the natural environment of the mountainous regions is the forest opening-up. Thus, in the frame of the sustainable exploitation of the forest ecosystems of the mountainous regions, the examination of the compatibility of the forest opening-up works with the natural environment of the mountainous region of Metsovo, in this thesis, is accomplished according to countable criteria. Also, the contribution of the opening-up and of this particular method is estimated in the examination of the compatibility and the viable development of this region. Furthermore, the intensity of the consequences of the forest road opening-up works to the natural environment of the region is examined, and their absorption by it, is also measured. For the achievement of the above, the below goals have been set: a) the analysis of the subordinate situation of the study area (forest, soil, climatic conditions etc.) b) the calculation of the financial elements of the construction of the forest road net of the Municipality of Metsovo, c) the calculation of the actual skidding distance of the wood, the percentage of the forest opening-up, the actual and the theoretical optimum road density in a representative area of the Municipality of Metsovo, d) the calculation using countable criteria of the intensity of the consequences that the forest opening-up works have caused to the natural environment, e) also the estimation of the absorption of the consequences by the forest ecosystem at the same area and f) the result extraction that lead to development proposals for the mountainous region of the Municipality of Metsovo. In this way, a new frame of examination of the Environmental Impact Assessments is applied and is used in all the stages (draft report, study and construction) of the realization of separate or even whole development works in the sensitive mountainous regions, with ulterior goal the decrease to the minimum of the Environmental Impact Assessments and their incorporation to the cost of each work. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn central Western Europe, {{several studies}} have shown that colder Holocene periods, such as the Little Ice Age, also {{correspond}} to wet periods. However, in mountain areas which are highly sensitive to erosion processes and where precipitation events can be localized, past evolution of hydrological activity might be more complicated. To assess these past hydrological changes, a paleolimnological approach was applied on a 13. 4 -m-long sediment core taken in alpine Lake Anterne (2063 m asl) and representing the last 3. 5 ka. Lake sedimentation is mainly composed of ﬂood deposits triggered by precipitation events. Sedimentological and geochemical analyses show that ﬂoods were more frequent during cold periods while high-intensity ﬂood events occurred preferentially during warmer periods. In mild temperature conditions, both ﬂood patterns are present. This underlines the complex relationship between ﬂood hazards and climatic change in mountain areas. During the warmer and/or dryer times of the end of Iron Age and the Roman Period, both the frequency and intensity of ﬂoods increased.

40|$|AimThis study {{aimed to}} verify {{if the water}} {{characteristics}} of Apodi/Mossoró River basin aquatic environments are mainly determined by a longitudinal gradient or its rain regime. MethodsThrough one year quarterly sample expeditions were carried (August/ 2007 to May/ 2008), in 24 sampling stations. In each place, water samples were collected and direct parameters were measured. Concentrations of nutrients, biochemical oxygen demand and thermotolerant coliforms were determined. For ordination of the sampling stations {{and in order to}} find patterns in water quality was conducted a Principal Components Analysis. ResultsThe results showed that points inside urban agglomerates had depreciated water quality, with high concentrations of nutrients. In general, {{it was not possible to}} define a longitudinal gradient for the studied variables, probably due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> along the basin. Otherwise, the effect of rainy and dry seasons were marked, resulting in a grouping of the sampling stations during the dry months, mainly due to the raised values of nutrients and biochemical oxygen demand.

We performed analyses of frequency distribution to determine the pattern of this species spatial distribution, as well as correlation tests to determine the effect of these two variables of habitat structure. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that T. topitotum presents aggregated distribution in both areas, indicating that this species has low environmental demands or that both areas are below a minimum environmental quality threshold. However, even with this similarity, the population in the fragmented site presented a higher index of aggregation when compared with the population of the plantation site. Corroborating previous studies, there was a negative correlation between abundance of T. topitotum and litter layer depth in the plantation site.

However, in reality, <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> risk the integrity of the Cerrado. Deforestation and burning for the maintenance and expansion of agriculture and pastures consume its areas even inside Conservation Units, which are protected from these practices by law. In the Uruçuí-Una Ecological Station (ESECUU), a 203, 426. 91 ha area in Baixa Grande do Ribeiro city, in Piauí, a northeastern state of Brazil, it’s not different. Neither it is in its buffer zone. This study detected and quantified the deforestation and burning dynamics during the dry season in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in these areas using orbital images of the sensors CCD/CBERS- 2 and TM/Landsat- 5. Two dates from each of the years were analyzed: one at the middle of the dry season and one at the end. Deforestation was detected in all dates and occurred mostly in the buffer zone. Both, the ESECUU and buffer zone showed burning scars in all dates too, although sometimes it was more intense in one than in the other.

40|$|Large, abrupt, and {{widespread}} climate changes with major impacts have occurred {{repeatedly in the}} past, when the Earth system was forced across thresholds. Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons, {{it is conceivable that}} human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large, abrupt events. Were such an event to recur, the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious. Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections. In light of these uncertainties, policy-makers should consider expanding research into abrupt climate change, improving monitoring systems, and taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and economies. Climatic records show that large, widespread, abrupt climate changes have occurred repeatedly throughout the geological record. Some mechanisms have been identified that could account for these changes, and model simulations of them are improving, but the models that are currently being used to assess human impacts on climate do not yet simulate the past changes with great accuracy. Although public debate regarding climate change has focused on the climatic consequences of greenhouse-gas emissions and their impacts on the planet and on human societies, scientists and policymakers have given less attention to the possibility that large climate changes could occur quickly.

The deforested areas grew through all dates analyzed and were larger in the buffer zone, suggesting a relative protection of the ESECUU. New cut-offs were predictable because of the early opening of roads that would become its limits. The burning scars were larger in the end of the dry season in consequence of the anthropic burnings for the management and implementation of agricultures and pastures. In 2004 and 2007 these scars were considerably larger probably because of the increase of dry biomass that every three years is big enough to spread through the native vegetation the fire originated in agricultures and pastures.

There were 118 fish species of eight orders and 29 families. Of these, 100 species are autochthonous (84. 8 %), 13, allochthonous (11. 0 %) and five, exotic (4. 2 %). The main causes for {{the occurrence of}} non-native species are escapes from aquaculture, introduction for fishing purposes {{and the construction of}} the Itaipu hydroelectric plant. The predominance of small and medium-sized Characiformes and Siluriformes, including 13 species new to science, accounts for approximately 11. 0 % of all species and 13. 0 % of all native species. About 10. 2 % of all species and 12. 0 % of all native species are endemic to the upper stretch of the Ivaí River, isolated by numerous waterfalls in tributary rivers and streams.

40|$|The first {{records of}} mass occurrences (swarming behaviour) in giant pill-millipedes, order Sphaerotheriida, are {{reported}} from Madagascar. Swarming behaviour {{in the order}} Sphaerotheriida seems to be restricted to a single of more than sixty described Malagasy species, Zoosphaerium neptunus (Butler, 1872), which is the world’s largest known giant pill-millipede. Rolled-up individuals can {{be up to the}} size of a baseball, tennis ball or small orange, but only females reach this giant size, males being smaller than a ping-pong ball. Nine occurrences of such Z. neptunus swarms were analyzed based on actual specimens, video or photographic evidence collected by other researchers, dating back as far as 1892. One additional swarm, comprising several thousand individuals was examined in detail, with 260 randomly collected specimens being dissected and measured. The findings highlight that the swarming behaviour inZ. neptunus differs from that of all other millipedes in two important details: (1) The individual swarm is restricted to specimens of a single related size (and presumably age) class; often only sexually immature individuals; (2) the swarming behaviour is obligate, most, if not all specimens of the species in a given area participate in such swarms; Z. neptunus specimens are rarely, if ever, not found in a swarm. Reasons behind such massing events in millipedes are currently little understood, but a potential explanation for the mass occurrences in Z. neptunus might be higher survival rate from predation in combination with a close sibling relationship between members of one swarm. The almost obligate swarming behaviour in the widespread Z. neptunus species might represent a conservation problem, since whole swarms, and therefore a whole generation in a given area, can be lost through <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> such as over-collecting for the pet trade, habitat fragmentation or road kills...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{an urgent}} need for an {{improved}} understanding of the sources, distributions and properties of atmospheric aerosol {{in order to control}} the atmospheric pollution over northeastern Himalayas where rising <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> from rapid urbanization and development is becoming an increasing concern. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An extensive aerosol sampling program was conducted in Darjeeling (altitude approximately 2200 meter above sea level (masl), latitude 27 degrees 01 'N and longitude 88 degrees 15 'E), a high altitude station in northeastern Himalayas, during January-December 2005. Samples were collected using a respirable dust sampler and a fine dust sampler simultaneously. Ion chromatograph was used to analyze the water soluble ionic species of aerosol. The average concentrations of fine and coarse mode aerosol were found to be 29. 5 +/- 20. 8 microg m(- 3) and 19. 6 +/- 11. 1 microg m(- 3) respectively. Fine mode aerosol dominated during dry seasons and coarse mode aerosol dominated during monsoon. Nitrate existed as NH(4) NO(3) in fine mode aerosol during winter and as NaNO(3) in coarse mode aerosol during monsoon. Gas phase photochemical oxidation of SO(2) during premonsoon and aqueous phase oxidation during winter and postmonsoon were the major pathways for the formation of SO(4) (2 -) in the atmosphere. Long range transport of dust aerosol from arid regions of western India was observed during premonsoon. The acidity of fine mode aerosol was higher in dry seasons compared to monsoon whereas the coarse mode acidity was higher in monsoon compared to dry seasons. Biomass burning, vehicular emissions and dust particles were the major types of aerosol from local and continental regions whereas sea salt particles were the major types of aerosol from marine source regions. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The year-long data presented in this paper provide substantial improvements to the heretofore poor knowledge regarding aerosol chemistry over northeastern Himalayas, and should be useful to policy makers in making control strategies...|$|R

Over the years of time, river has been subjected to human interference regularly and water quality was to be getting deteriorated profoundly. Major anthropogenic activities practiced in and around the stretch: agriculture, abstraction of water for irrigation and drinking, washing cloths and utensils, discharging of sewage waste, sand dredging, boating, fishing, open defecation and religious ritual activities along the stretch were generating serious threat to the biota of the river by altering the physicochemical and biological concentration of the river system. The seasonal and yearly trends were discussed to comprehend <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>interferences</b> on the river stretch. Correlation analysis was also been tried in between physico-chemical parameters. The pH, Conductance, Alkalinity and Hardness levels indicate the moderate quality of water. The values of DO, BOD and COD levels indicate the absence of major organic pollution sources. Seasonal and yearly averages of plant nutrients like phosphate, nitrates, potassium and also sulphates at drain out falls and mixing zones, were not showing any significant variation in their concentration indicate no sign of problems like eutrophication, which is generally raise due to agricultural and sewage wastes. The other possibility is that since there are no major industries in the project area, the major source of organic pollutants is only the domestic source. Population density spread over sparsely located villages like Dasanapura and Harle certainly contributes towards total and fecal coliforms as excreta of the villagers due to lack of toilets in their houses. Thus present study concludes that river water was not polluted; all results are within permissible limit when compared with Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and National River water quality standards.
