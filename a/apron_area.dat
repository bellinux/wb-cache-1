25|$|In 2011, {{with most}} of the former Kai Tak area still abandoned, ideas were floated to develop the area for {{commercial}} property, citing shortages of office space and rising property costs. In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of August 2014, the checkerboard remains visible, though with strong natural overgrowth obscuring much of its facade. The same can be said for much of the Kai Tak <b>apron</b> <b>area.</b> A few new buildings have been erected on the north eastern part of the apron creating the Kai Ching Estate.|$|E

500|$|The {{expansion}} {{was estimated}} to cost NOK17.8 million, of which NATO would fund 15.6 million, and approved by Parliament on 7 May 1965. NATO adjusted the plans later that year, reducing the <b>apron</b> <b>area</b> by [...] while increasing from one to two hangars. Construction lasted from 1967 to 1968. It consisted of extending the runway with , constructing two hangars, a communications building and a network of internal roads and taxiways. The upgrades were followed up by pressure from {{the armed forces to}} establish an squadron of fighters at Banak. Following the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August–September 1968, the ministry decided to upgrade the Garrison of Porsanger from 400 to 1000 men.

50|$|Rapid {{expansion}} in passenger traffic {{has led to}} increasing commercial utilization of the south-side of the airport, which was previously used for general aviation, and is now used for freight, mail and corporate flights. This is partially due to difficulties obtaining departure and arrival slots for light aircraft traffic, which need {{to be separated from}} larger aircraft to protect against wake turbulence. As part of the Airport Master Plan, the south-side area is to be expanded with maintenance facilities including new hangar and <b>apron</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R

This study also estimates the input excess and output shortfalls with respect to production and service processes, respectively. Slacks-based measure Network DEA model Efficiency Airport...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper focusses {{on the use}} of {{wireless}} networks, with special em-phasis on Wi-Fi, in the manoeuvering and <b>apron</b> <b>areas</b> of an airport to control the ground vehicles movements in those areas and, consequently, to improve user safety, efficiency of operations and airport security. The use of Wi-Fi for these purposes constitutes a novel approach in an airport environment. Other wireless networks, namely CDMA and Tetra, are also experimented in this pro-ject as a lower bit-rate alternative to Wi-Fi. The platform consists of an on-board system in each vehicle, a centralised ground system and wireless net-works to allow the communication between the vehicles and ground system. The architecture, protocols and network configurations in use are analysed as well as the respective deployment made in the airport of Porto in Portugal. ...|$|R
50|$|The Armidale Regional Council has {{a number}} of {{upgrades}} to the airport currently in progress, with much of the funding for the works promised by Member for New England Barnaby Joyce during the 2013 Australian federal election campaign.

50|$|In 1960 {{there were}} four grass runways, with lengths ranging from 2040 ft to 3060 ft. 1960 also saw the {{construction}} of a new tarmacked runway of a length of 4800 ft. In early 2000s alongside the work on the new terminal, the States of Guernsey Commerce and Employment department claimed an extension was necessary to allow use of larger aircraft such as the Boeing 737 Classic or Airbus A320 family for trans-European flights. In 2012, a set of four two-day closures under the Airport 2040 programme allowed contractors for the States of Guernsey to resurface the existing runway, extend runway end safety areas and also reconstruct parts of the concrete <b>apron</b> <b>areas.</b> Taxiways which connect the aprons to the runway were also resurfaced and realigned, whilst a new drainage system was implemented. New airfield ground lighting and navigational aids were also installed.|$|R
