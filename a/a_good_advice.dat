The 12 -lead ECG is decomposed into Hermite basis functions, and the resulting coecients are used as inputs to the ANNs. Furthermore, we present a case-based method that qualitatively explains {{the operation of the}} ANNs, by showing regions of each ECG critical for ANN response. Key ingredients in this method are: (i) a cost function used to nd local ECG perturbations leading to the largest possible change in ANN output, and (ii) a minimization scheme for this cost function using mean eld annealing. Our approach was tested on 2238 ECGs recorded at an emergency department. The obtained ROC areas for ANNs trained with the Hermite representation and standard ECG measurements were 83. 4 % and 84. 3 % (p = 0 : 4), respectively.

The motivation of this thesis is the idea of extending the results in [13] to the case of logics with fixpoints and with a non-classical base. We focus in particular on the intuitionistic modal mu-calculus. We enhance the ALBA algorithm [26] for the elimination of monadic second order variables so that mu-formulas can be treated in which all the variables occur inside the scope of fixpoint binders. We prove that this enhancement is sound thanks to the order-theoretic properties of the interpretation of fixpoint binders in the algebraic semantics for intuitionistic mu-calculus. We define the class of recursive inequalities and informally justify that the enhanced ALBA is successful on this class...|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{research}} was started because Dutch food safety employees {{had the impression}} that more overfilled joints in pigs were observed since the trend of slaughtering more boars instead of castrates. Therefore the aim of the research became: Determine if there are more affected boars compared to castrated boars with joint problems. However due the present Dutch situation, the research question had to be altered because not enough castrated boars were slaughtered. Therefore the {{research was}} aimed to distinguish if there was difference in affected joints between boars and gilts. Furthermore this research was organized in order to evaluate what could be the underlying reason for the joint problems. Therefore also pathology evaluations were performed on random selected affected joints. This part of the research has to be considered as a good pilot for future research. Strong suspicions for osteochondrosis are present after the examinations, but no significant conclusion can be made. A lack of enough data made it impossible to do proper statistics. Also in order to confirm the suspicion which came up during the research, further microscopically research should have been done. This trial if interpenetrated as a pilot, can give <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> what sort of research should be performed in the future to determine the underlying reason of overfilled joints in pigs...|$|E

They are viewed as a key enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) and ubiquitous applications, like mobile healthcare, telemetry, or intelligent transport systems. We survey existing work on mobile M 2 M communications, we identify open challenges that have a direct impact on performance and resource usage efficiency, especially the impact on energy efficiency, and we review techniques to improve communications. We review the ETSI standard and application protocols, and draw considerations on the impact of their use in constrained mobile devices. Nowadays, smartphones are equipped {{with a wide range of}} embedded sensors, with varied local and wide area connectivity capabilities, and thus they offer a unique opportunity to serve as mobile gateways for other more constrained devices with local connectivity. At the same time, they can gather context data about users and environment from the embedded sensors. These capabilities may be crucial for mobile M 2 M applications. Finally, in this paper, we consider a scenario where smartphones are used as gateways that collect and aggregate data from sensors in a cellular network.

40|$|The Judge-Advisor System (JAS) {{highlights}} the importance of advice within the decision making process. Past JAS literature has focused on ways in which to improve advice utilisation and clients’ decision outputs. The aim of this thesis was to focus on an under researched area within the JAS literature: the advice giver. It predominantly aimed to explore three main input areas in relation to what makes <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> giver: characteristics of the advice giver, the quality of advice, and how the advice is given. It began by identifying individuals’ implicit understanding of what characteristics are important for a good advisor. A three-factor framework was developed, which relates to advisors’ affect, behaviour, and cognition. Further, it explored whether two external motivators (the type of advisors’ financial incentive and competition between advisors) impacted advice quality (the accuracy of recommendations, amount of advice provided, and amount of information acquired) and how the advice is given (how confident the advisor appeared to their client). The type of advisors’ financial incentive impacted advisors’ input within an estimation task, but was not consistent within a choice task. Competition alone was found to have no impact on the advisors’ input. When competition and the advisors’ incentive (financial or quality) were explored together, competition, not the advisors’ incentive, impacted advice quality. A combination of both competition and a financial incentive was found to increase advisors’ public confidence. Finally, as advice-giving is an interactive process, the impact on the client was also explored. Clients’ ratings of their advisors’ trustworthiness were found to predict advice utilisation which increased clients’ decision accuracy but did not predict clients’ decision confidence. The thesis has begun to explore optimal characteristics of good advice givers and how external factors influence advisors’ inputs. Implications of the findings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many stroke {{patients}} have an inclination to consciously guide their movements, {{a phenomenon that}} {{is often referred to}} as reinvestment. It is generally thought that reinvestment may delay motor recovery, because it requires a part of the inherently limited capacity of working memory, and hence results in less automatic performance. However, stroke patients’ inclination to reinvest may be necessary for executing motor and dual-task performance. Because of the contradictory findings, it is unclear whether physical therapists should promote or reduce reinvestment. Aim: This study aims to assess whether stroke patients’ inclination for reinvestment is associated with single- and dual-task motor performance, and whether this association is related to patient’s general walking ability and working memory capacity. Methods: Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to assess cross-sectional associations between an inclination to reinvest and respectively single- and dual-task motor performance. Working memory capacity and general walking ability were simultaneously added to the multivariate regression model as possible confounding factors and subsequently added apart as interaction term with reinvestment. Results: Nineteen clinical stroke patients (< 6 months post-stroke) were analysed. Patient’s inclination to reinvest was not significantly associated with single- and dual-task motor performance. These findings remained when general walking ability and working memory capacity were added into the model as possible confounders and moderators. Working memory capacity and general walking ability were independently positive associated to motor dual-task costs% and cognitive dual-task costs%. Conclusion: This study did not find associations between an inclination to reinvest and single- and dual-task motor performance in clinical stroke patients. These findings seems not being different for patients with better or worse general walking ability or working memory capacity, although, this should interpret with care because of the low power of this study. Clinical Relevance: Patient’s inclination to reinvest seems not influence single- and dual-task motor performance, regardless patient’s motor or cognitive capacity. For giving <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> to physical therapists regarding to facilitating or discouraging reinvestment in clinical rehabilitation, future research with more power needs to establish whether motor or cognitive capacity influences the relationship between reinvestment and performance in clinical stroke patients...|$|E
40|$|Better {{farming methods}} Cue: When {{it come to}} farming for better {{nutrition}} for people with HIV/AIDS, there is one crop that is often overlooked in Africa. It is high in body-building protein It is easy to grow. And it sells for a good price in the market. In Tanzania Lazarus Laiser goes {{in search of the}} secrets of how to grow this very useful crop. He meets with Kiagho Msuya, a communications officer for the Ministry of Agriculture and Food security, to hear how it can be grown by rural and urban farmers alike. Can you guess what the crop is? It?s mushrooms?. IN:	?This mushroom crop in fact? OUT:	?difficult to get this education [...] ? DUR?N:	 3 ? 14 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Lazarus Laiser reporting from Tanzania on the often ignored but very useful crop ? mushrooms. Are you tempted to grow them in your garden? The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Msuya	This mushroom crop in fact it is very manageable. Most of our farmers are being taught on how to make these small housings whereby they can plant them {{in the house and the}} house itself is not very costly because they can use lets say these cheap woods and thatching with grass or banana leaves and then the inside they can make some compartments whereby they water the floor throughout and then they make some tables up and they plant those mushrooms. The mushrooms in fact is very cheap to prepare. They can do it very easily without even using much labour and also they are using a very small space. Laiser	So the work will not cause any trouble or any problem to affected HIV-affected people? Msuya	No because in fact they do not use much labour. Mushrooms, when you eat it, it is like tender meat, it is like tender meat. You get a lot of proteins. Especially these mushrooms have got more than 26 per cent of protein, how do you think, where will we get it so cheaply? So if they eat them of course they will become strong, they will get energy, they can sell these mushrooms. Laiser	Many parts of Africa is so much dry, you find not enough water, always there is that problem. Do you think that it is possible to these ill people to grow mushrooms with that problem of water? Msuya	If you are far from the sources of water then you are relying on rain. Now why don?t you do the rainwater harvesting? You can collect your water and then when it is hot and you have got your dam somewhere you can just use it for irrigating or you wait in the season of rainy season, you can practise it. Laiser	How about the market for selling mushrooms? Msuya	Oh the market is plenty, the market is plenty. Lets say an example in towns these big hotels especially foreigners when they come they like them very much because if you sell them only a kilo if you harvest after every two to three days about lets say five to ten kilos what do you think about it? I think they get a lot of money and it can also help them to keep up their health and also sometimes if you have got a child you can pay school fees. Laiser	How do you encourage good agricultural practices to encourage the growth of nutritious food to these ill people? Msuya	The practices differ from place to place according to the soil fertility or the weather, something like that or ecological zones. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>advice</b> which I can give them so that they don?t suffer a lot they better go and request some information from the nearby extension worker whereby they will be directed on the best ways they can do such that they do not get problems or tiresomeness.

It will be cheaper for them to get advice but if they stay in scattered ways it is difficult to get this education. End of trackWhy growing mushrooms is a good optio...|$|E
