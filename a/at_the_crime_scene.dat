5|$|Magazine editor Daphne Zimmer (Mam Smith), who edits for the Society Fair magazine, {{is found}} dead in her {{swimming}} pool. Daphne {{is a friend of}} Megan's (Dana Delany) mother, Joan Hunt (Joanna Cassidy). <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Megan finds evidence to suggest that there was a struggle near the pool, as well as bruising on the Daphne's stomach, which indicates that she died several days ago instead of that morning as was originally believed. At Daphne's workplace, Megan, Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch), and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) tell the employees of Daphne's death. Bud questions Daphne’s employees, Stephen Burnett (Neal Bledsoe) and Lauren Matthews (Nadia Dajani), finding out that one of Daphne's enemies is Colin Lloyd (Robert Walsh), a wealthy man whose career Daphne ruined. Megan examines Daphne’s body, noticing that Daphne has kidney damage. Whilst Dr. Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) is working on maggots found on Daphne’s body, Dr. Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) determines that hair, which was found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> is human, and there are traces of arsenic and lead.|$|E
5|$|Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> {{and meets}} NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her {{in out of}} his belief that the murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective {{that it was not}} devil worship, and that the killer {{probably}} was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

5|$|About 10 {{years after}} the death of her father, Shi Jianqiao tracked down Sun Chuanfang in Tianjin. Shortly after 3pm on November 13, 1935, she {{approached}} him from behind while he was leading a sutra-recitation session at his lay-Buddhist society on Nanma Road. She then killed the kneeling former warlord by shooting him three times with her Browning pistol. After the assassination, she stayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> to explain her deed and distribute mimeographed pamphlets to bystanders. Her case drew a significant amount of public and media attention.|$|E
5|$|Church members {{reported}} that Father Feit's confession line moved slowly {{that night and}} that he was away from the sanctuary several times. When the canal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> was drained several days after the discovery of Garza's body, Feit's photo slide viewer was found in the canal. Fellow priests noticed scratch marks on Feit's hands after midnight mass, and they said it was irregular for Feit to have taken Garza to the church rectory to hear her confession. The McAllen Police Department initially said that Feit passed polygraph tests, but the tests were later said to be inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He shows up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> and finds {{he is at}} the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Hudson recanted his {{testimony}} that DeJac had confessed to Crystallynn's murder, {{but he was}} seen as an unreliable witness. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, however, new forensic analysis revealed the presence of Donohue's DNA <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> for both Crystallynn and Giambra.|$|R

5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some documented in the X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> were the {{municipal}} authorities of Los Cabos, followed by the Mexican Armed Forces and {{the federal and state}} police forces. Upon the arrival of the authorities, Francisco Rafael's wife—in between tears—informed them of the former drug lord's identity. The autopsy revealed that Francisco Rafael died of severe traumatic brain injury from shots in the thorax and head with a FN Five-seven pistol. The murder of Francisco Rafael initially fell under state jurisdiction because he was not wanted by the federal government when he was killed. Therefore, the murder investigation was started by the Baja California Sur authorities and not by the Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR). However, the PGR joined the case after it was requested by the state authorities.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{what was}} {{initially}} known about the killings, there was a common pattern. In a hit-and-run shooting, the gunman would walk up to his victim, shoot <b>the</b> victim repeatedly <b>at</b> close range, and flee on foot. Another link to the shootings was the killers' preference for a [...]32-caliber pistol, based on the slugs recovered from the victims and the shell casings found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Based on McClane's {{testimony}} {{and the male}} corpse in his house with the face ruined by a shotgun blast, he {{is believed to have}} killed himself. However, analysis eventually reveals that the corpse's fingerprints don't match prints <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> Dolarhyde travels to Graham's home in Florida. He attacks Graham and stabs him in the face. Graham's wife Molly intercepts Dolarhyde, however, and shoots him dead.|$|R

5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Because of his presence {{at the scene of the}} crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. One of them is the pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E
5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 11 October 1943, during World War II, Japanese forces bomb the Indian city of Madras (now Chennai). The next morning, Rajan, a radio {{engineer}} and communications researcher, is found shot dead by his own hand gun in his house in Madras after his neighbour, Chinnaiah, having heard the gunshot, complains to the police. Purushothaman Naidu, a local police inspector, arrives at Rajan's house and starts investigating the death. Crime Investigation Department (C.I.D.) Officer Sivanandam joins Naidu {{to help with the}} investigation. Naidu suggests that the killer could be a thief who killed Rajan for the money found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> However, Sivanandam is unconvinced by Naidu's theory because the amount of money at the scene matches the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room. Rajan was about to leave Madras in anticipation of the bombings.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{connection}} between <b>the</b> <b>crimes</b> was DNA, which as of March 2009 had been recovered from 40 <b>crime</b> <b>scenes,</b> ranging from murders to burglaries. In late March 2009, investigators {{concluded that the}} [...] "Phantom" [...] criminal did not exist, and <b>the</b> DNA recovered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> had already been present on the cotton swabs used for collecting DNA samples; they belonged {{to a woman who}} worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> factory where they were made.|$|R
50|$|Strangely, {{witnesses}} see {{a ghostly}} figure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> Saeki restarts <b>the</b> Witchcraft Club {{with a new}} crop of girls, but it's unclear at first, if she is fighting Kitami or helping her. Meanwhile, Imari and her Tokken subordinate, Aki, are caught up in a bank robbery conducted by occult robbers. An impromptu ceremony performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scene causes Kitami to take over the possessed Imari. In the aftermath, Imari steals the Lance of Longinus from the bank vault that the robbers were after.|$|R
50|$|Legally, Miller {{argued that}} he never engaged in any murders directly, nor did he {{explicitly}} agree prior to going out cruising for women that he would support Worrell in the murders. Nevertheless, he {{was found guilty of}} murder because he was found {{to be a part of}} a joint criminal enterprise. He was present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes</b> and assisted in disposing of the bodies. This created subsequent legal difficulties over the definition of a joint criminal enterprise, but these have largely been resolved on the basis that this was a special—and particularly horrifying—case.|$|R
5|$|Scully and Doggett arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> in Idaho {{and meet}} Detective Yale Abbott. He {{says they are}} less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their {{attention}} to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out {{that there is only one}} footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album.|$|E
5|$|They meet {{an old man}} who angrily {{tells them}} that there are no monsters and sends them to see his son, a {{geneticist}} named Francis Pollidori (John O'Hurley). Dr. Pollidori shows them his experiments studying the Hox gene using the fruit fly Drosophila. This presentation includes images of a fly with legs growing out of its mouth. He tells the agents that the same kind of experiment could, in theory, be performed on humans. Afterward, Mulder tells Scully that he believes that Dr. Pollidori, acting as a modern-day Victor Frankenstein, has created The Great Mutato. Later, Dr. Pollidori's wife Elizabeth (Miriam Smith) is knocked unconscious and is attacked {{in the same manner as}} Shaineh. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> Mulder and Scully find a chemical residue from an agricultural agent used to anesthetize animals, which leads them to suspect Dr. Pollidori's father, who is a farmer. Dr. Pollidori comes to his father's house, angrily confronts him, and murders him. Later, Mutato, who lives with Pollidori Sr., finds his dead body and tearfully buries it in a barn.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

This is confirmed to the reader when it is noted that the phrase [...] "it's all right" [...] is written in blood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>The</b> Piewacket bar, where the gang had previously hung out, was attacked by Denny with gunfire. Several people including the bartender and some bikers were killed.|$|R

Kang goes undercover as Gees' new driver, and she tells him she is working for someone known as [...] "The General," [...] who is taking his money back from the Russian mafia. As Kang arrests her, a sniper kills her to stop her from talking.|$|R
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene,</b> who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the jurors that there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The suspect (later {{identified}} as David Lace) was discovered when {{the profile of}} the killer showed a partial match on the national database, which belonged to a sibling of a previous suspect. A further sample was taken from another sibling, who was not on the database, to help confirm the match via a process called familial searching. At first the police refused to release the identity of the new prime suspect, except to reveal that he had committed suicide in 1988, and had confessed to DeSimone's murder while in custody for an unrelated crime in 1983, 18 months after Hodgson's conviction. His body was exhumed at Kingston cemetery in Portsmouth on 12 August 2009 in order to compare his DNA to that found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene.</b> Hampshire Constabulary said the breakthrough in the case was only possible because of advances in forensic science and tests on the body would take six weeks, after which a file on the dead suspect could then be submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service. Visitors to the cemetery in Portsmouth said the grave of the suspect had no headstone and was untended. Police revealed that the suspect's confession was one of seven which had been made since Hodgson's conviction.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scene</b> do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

50|$|Steven Seagal {{stars as}} a tough cop, Jacob King, whose brutal methods have gained him a legendary {{reputation}} among his colleagues. Seemingly indifferent to the fact his twin brother was murdered {{in front of him}} as a child, Seagal investigates a series of brutal killings, most involving young, attractive women. The murderer, Lazerus, played by Michael Filipowich, leaves cryptic, astrological clues <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, another murderer, Billy Joe Hill (Mark Collie), is killing women. King finds him and kicks him out a window, after which Hill seeks revenge by murdering Celine (Karyn Michelle Baltzer), whom he believes to be King's girlfriend.|$|R
500|$|The episode also {{presents}} a temporary role reversal for Mulder and Scully. When discussing {{the lack of}} evidence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crime</b> <b>scenes,</b> Scully points out that [...] "a crime is only as perfect as the man [...] Even if he made not one mistake, there still is a motive. If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|R
