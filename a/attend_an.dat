5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must <b>attend</b> <b>an</b> IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests.

In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, and blamed himself {{for the death of}} fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could <b>attend</b> <b>an</b> interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request.

5|$|In December 1997, Suharto for {{the first}} time did not <b>attend</b> <b>an</b> ASEAN presidents' summit, which was later {{revealed}} to be due to a minor stroke, creating speculation about his health and the immediate future of his presidency. In mid-December, as the crisis swept through Indonesia and an estimated $150 billion of capital was being withdrawn from the country, he appeared at a press conference to re-assert his authority and to urge people to trust the government and the collapsing Rupiah. However, his attempts to re-instill confidence had little effect. Evidence suggested that his family and associates were being spared the toughest requirements of the IMF reform process, further undermining confidence in the economy and his leadership.|$|E

In recognition of his performance that season, the USHL named him the league's rookie of the year.|$|E
5|$|Miller's love of horseracing then {{interfered}} with his quest. Wanting to <b>attend</b> <b>an</b> afternoon race meeting, {{he opened the}} batting in the morning against Cambridge University.

He stayed at the track until late afternoon, and returned to find the Australians walking out to field. This {{was followed by a}} match against the MCC at Lord's where he took four wickets of English Test players. Miller then took match figures of 5/27 against Oxford University. In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males <b>attend</b> <b>an</b> active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
