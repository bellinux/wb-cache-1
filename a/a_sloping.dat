5|$|The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, {{submitted}} three {{designs in}} early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April. The design was quite innovative {{in several different}} ways. It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour, which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured, {{the first to use}} <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament.|$|E
5|$|When {{the stars}} near the Sun are plotted on an HR diagram, it {{displays}} a distribution of stars of various masses, ages, and compositions. Many {{of the stars}} lie relatively close to <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> curve with increasing absolute magnitude as the stars are hotter, known as main-sequence stars. However the diagram also typically includes stars that are in later stages of their evolution and have wandered away from this main-sequence curve.|$|E
5|$|An irregularly shaped parade area {{occupies}} {{the middle of}} the fort, which is divided by <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> ramp leading up to the casemates. A small brick building – originally used as a laboratory or shell-filling facility – stands {{to the right of the}} ramp. The fort is entered through a single gateway on its west side, protected against landward attackers by a caponier. The front of the fort was surrounded by a dry ditch, in which there were originally four caponiers to provide musketry defence. A very wide outer wet ditch blocked access from the riverside.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of the East and South courses creates a par 72 layout. From the black tees the course measures 6952 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 74.6/139. From the blue tees the course measures 6769 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 73.4/138. From the white tees the course measures 6322 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 71.0/135. From the red tees the course measures 5725 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 72.8/127.|$|R
50|$|In {{physical}} geology, {{aspect is}} the compass direction that <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> faces. For example, <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> {{on the eastern}} edge of the Rockies toward the Great Plains is described as having an easterly aspect. <b>A</b> <b>slope</b> which falls down to a deep valley on its western side and a shallower one on its eastern side has a westerly aspect or is <b>a</b> west-facing <b>slope.</b> The direction <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> faces can affect the physical and biotic features of the <b>slope,</b> known as <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> effect. The term aspect can also be used to describe the shape or alignment of a coastline. Here, the aspect is the direction which the coastline is facing towards the sea. For example, a coastline with sea to the northeast (as in most of Queensland) has a northeasterly aspect.|$|R
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the air rights of the property. Except for Embankment, which had <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} of the South and North courses creates a par 72 layout. From the black (back) tees, the course measures 7003 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 74.2/139. From the blue tees the course measures 6754 yd and has <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 73.4/138. From the white tees the course measures 6321 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 71.0/135. From the red tees the course measures 5712 yd with <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> rating of 72.8/127. For the 1998 PGA Championship, the course played as a par 70 at 6906 yd.|$|R

5|$|The M7 tank {{locomotive}} was {{the first}} design by Dugald Drummond upon replacing William Adams as Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR in 1895. It was an enlargement of the T1 with <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> grate of increased area giving greater power. Drummond drew upon his previous experience with the successful London Brighton and South Coast Railway D1 class, whilst he was works manager at Brighton in the early 1870s, and his own 157 class of 1877, on the North British Railway in Scotland. It was the heaviest 0-4-4 type ever to run in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} waves, while {{directly}} {{powered by the}} wind, is distinct from a storm's wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves {{in the direction of}} its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water particles moving toward the shore have considerable momentum and may run up <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> parapet to mount a single gun in the 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{focal point}} of the Cycle Center is an atrium that introduces the two lower levels of facilities and provides an aesthetic above-ground presence. The atrium, which has been praised by Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic Blair Kamin more than once, has <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> solar paneled roof. The 120solar panels produce 6.5percent of the electricity supply required for the climate-controlled building. The Cycle Center has an opaque design, with thin steel frames for its main windows. The interior design uses stainless steel and blond wood, and shade is produced by awnings.|$|E
5|$|Many nocturnal {{species have}} large, {{independently}} movable ears, {{although there are}} significant differences in sizes and shapes of the ear between species. The structure of the middle and inner ear of strepsirrhines differs between the lemurs and lorisoids. In lemurs, the tympanic cavity, which surrounds the middle ear, is expanded. This leaves the ectotympanic ring, which supports the eardrum, free within the auditory bulla. This trait is also seen in adapiforms. In lorisoids, however, the tympanic cavity is smaller and the ectotympanic ring becomes attached {{to the edge of}} the auditory bulla. The tympanic cavity in lorisoids also has two accessory air spaces, which are not present in lemurs. Both lorisoids and cheirogaleid lemurs have replaced the internal carotid artery with an enlarged ascending pharyngeal artery. Strepsirrhines also possess distinctive features in their tarsus (ankle bones) that differentiate them from haplorhines, such as <b>a</b> <b>sloping</b> talo-fibular facet (the face where the talus bone and fibula meet) and a difference in the location of the position of the flexor fibularis tendon on the talus. These differences give strepsirrhines the ability to make more complex rotations of the ankle and indicate that their feet are habitually inverted, or turned inward, an adaptation for grasping vertical supports.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Frame {{structure}} on <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> is <b>a</b> common kind of structure in a mountainous area. It can diminish {{the impact on}} environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the <b>slope,</b> using <b>an</b> opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the frame {{structure on}} <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general frame structure in seismic design. Four sets of frame structure example on <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly. The seismic responses characteristics of frames on <b>a</b> <b>slope</b> are studied in the paper from period, lateral deformation, seismic shear and so on, based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of frame structure on <b>a</b> <b>slope.</b> The main conclusions are as follows: the slope can enhance structural lateral stiffness to a certain extent; the opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, are not necessarily frail stories; the distribution of seismic force is uneven between the columns in the same floors which connect with the ground on different elevation level, and fixed columns undertake more than others, making them more fragile; the torsional effect is noticeable in the frame structure on <b>a</b> <b>slope...</b>|$|R
