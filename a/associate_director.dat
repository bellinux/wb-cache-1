Sellars expected this additional cost to eventually be supported by the <b>associate</b> <b>director's</b> finding their own private sponsorships, but this was never achieved. This unrealistic expectation may have come from Sellar's work in American contexts where private support is much more common, whereas in Australia the mix of government, corporate and philanthropic funding is markedly different, especially in Adelaide where few major corporations have their headquarters.|$|R
