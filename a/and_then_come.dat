25|$|Michael Palin {{attended}} Oxford, {{where he}} met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series Ripping Yarns together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches {{tended to be more}} focused than that of the others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After Flying Circus, Palin hosted Saturday Night Live four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979, published in 2007.|$|E
25|$|The play {{features}} {{three groups}} of characters that interact slightly at first, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> together in the Battle of Shrewsbury, where {{the success of the}} rebellion will be decided. First there is King Henry himself and his immediate council. He is the engine of the play, but usually in the background. Next there is the group of rebels, energetically embodied in Henry Percy ("Hotspur") and including his father, the Earl of Northumberland and led by his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. The Scottish Earl of Douglas, Edmund Mortimer and the Welshman Owen Glendower also join. Finally, at the centre of the play are the young Prince Hal and his companions Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto. Streetwise and pound-foolish, these rogues manage to paint over this grim history in the colours of comedy.|$|E
25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman can let some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

25|$|Most F1 drivers {{start in}} kart racing competitions, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> up through {{traditional}} European single seater series like Formula Ford and Formula Renault to Formula 3, {{and finally the}} GP2 Series. GP2 started in 2005, replacing Formula 3000, which itself had replaced Formula Two as the last major stepping-stone into F1. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion Lewis Hamilton became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One driver's title in 2008. Drivers {{are not required to}} have competed at this level before entering Formula One. British F3 has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions including Nigel Mansell, Ayrton Senna and Mika Häkkinen having moved straight from that series to Formula One. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, {{as was the case with}} 2007 World Champion Kimi Räikkönen, who went straight from Formula Renault to F1, as well as Max Verstappen, who made his debut following a single season in European F3.|$|E
25|$|An ogbanje is a reincarnating evil {{spirit that}} would {{deliberately}} plague {{a family with}} misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under {{a certain amount of}} time (usually before puberty), would deliberately die <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. Female circumcision was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits Iyi-uwa, which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The Iyi-uwa is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.|$|E
25|$|Fever during {{treatment}} can {{be due to}} a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to drug allergy. The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back, it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.|$|E

500|$|Tittle's most {{productive}} years {{came when he}} was well beyond his athletic prime. On his ability to improve with age, he credited {{a feel for the}} game that came from his years of experience in the league. [...] "If you could learn it by studying movies, a good smart college quarterback could learn all you've got to learn in three weeks <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> in and be as good as the old heads," [...] he told Sports Illustrated in 1963. [...] "But they can't." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his {{relationship}} with McCartney, Harrison said, [...] "Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help.

There {{were a lot of}} tracks, though, where I played bass... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{recording}} studios used by the band were not the most advanced. One studio in Vancouver, credited as [...] "a hut", had an 8-track set up that did not even have proper headphone facilities. The group's lead singer Robert Plant later discussed the writing and recording process, stating [...] "It was crazy really. We were writing the numbers in hotel rooms and then we'd do a rhythm track in London, add the vocal in New York, overdub the harmonica in Vancouver <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back to finish mixing at New York." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{feature film}} {{adaptation}} of 24 was originally {{planned for the}} hiatus between the sixth and seventh seasons. Series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran were set to write the script with showrunner Howard Gordon working on story. Filming {{was going to take}} place in London, Prague, and Morocco. Plans for the film were later put on hold. Kiefer Sutherland explained, [...] "It's impossible to ask writers to work on the show <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> up with an amazing film we can shoot in the break between seasons." ...|$|E
500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|Hunter and Morse {{are written}} off the {{series in the}} episode [...] "Parting Shot", both leaving S.H.I.E.L.D., as Palicki and Blood [...] "physically had to go leave to shoot the pilot ... they had to stop being on S.H.I.E.L.D. {{and get ready for}} the pilot and then shoot the pilot and all of that, so it didn't make sense for us to have all these episodes with them and then not have them in two or three episodes, and then go, [...] "Oh, we were just over here," [...] <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back and go away again." [...] On whether they could return to the series at some point, Bell said, [...] "I can't answer that, but I can say it would be kind of {{cheating}} to make Mack cry like that only to buy it back—not that we haven't brought characters back from the dead. We want to earn stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E

500|$|The day's early {{breakaway}} {{was formed}} by Nathan Haas (...) , Frederik Veuchelen (...) , Laurens De Vreese (...) , Jesper Asselman (...) , Nico Denz (...) , and David Boucher (...) [...] The racing conditions were fairly easy, as there were no crosswinds. The breakaway's lead was over seven minutes at one point, but this was quickly closed down by the peloton and reduced to three minutes with [...] remaining. There were three intermediate sprints {{in the space of}} , described as a [...] "golden kilometre", which were won by Denz, Asselman and de Vreese respectively. The breakaway was then caught and [...] and [...] drove the peloton towards the finish line. Sky's Andy Fenn was leading out his teammate Elia Viviani and, with [...] remaining, Viviani was able to follow the wheel of André Greipel (...) [...] Greipel opened his sprint with a long distance to the finish line and Viviani was able to follow him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> past him to take the stage victory. Danny van Poppel (...) finished second and Jean-Pierre Drucker (...) third, with Greipel in fourth place.|$|E

500|$|Fuller readily agreed, having focused {{much of his}} {{own career}} on racial issues. Already {{familiar}} with the novel and {{with the concept of}} [...] "white dogs," [...] he was tasked with [...] "reconceptualizing" [...] the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would [...] "see a dog slowly go insane <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back to sanity." [...] Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily white cast and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a [...] "second-rate novel" [...] and questioned its use when [...] "bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Pinkner and J. H. Wyman {{decided to}} {{alternate}} the episodes between the prime and parallel universes because they [...] "thought {{that the best}} way to really thoroughly tell these stories was to dive into them wholeheartedly... the journey that our heroine is on <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> back over here because [...] is embedded in our team, we have point of view characters in both universes and it seemed to us the perfect opportunity to really explore in a really thorough fulsome way the alternate universe". Wyman elaborated that he felt fans [...] "would really appreciate a mythology in two places", and showing both universes [...] "just presented itself in such a natural organic way to evolution in our storytelling". Fox however was initially worried about the premise's sustainability, and that an episode without Peter or Walter [...] "wouldn't feel like our show anymore," [...] to which Pinkner responded that [...] "not unlike a show like Lost, Fringe has to constantly evolve, to move and grow and go forward, otherwise we'll get bored, the cast will get bored, the audience will get bored". After the first three episodes, both Fox and Warner Bros. became more favorable to the storyline.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, or wherever we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>come</b> out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E
