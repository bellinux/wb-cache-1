40|$|Equity is an {{essential}} issue to consider in emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> problems to ensure the participation of as many market participants as possible. Various equity principles have been practiced in emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocations,</b> {{and some of them}} conflict. The main purpose of this work is to present an emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> methodology that takes into account both individual interests and different versions of equity and makes progress toward reaching a global consensus for emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> in deregulated power systems. We propose nine equity principles for emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation.</b> We combine a hierarchical system with a voting mechanism to incorporate various definitions of equity and to find a compromise solution. The voting mechanism is used for selecting equity principles for each power plant (market participant). The hierarchical system is composed of two subsystems. The upper level subsystem computes the emission allowances among all regions, while the lower level subsystem obtains the emission allowances among the power plants in each region. A test power system serves to illustrate the essential features of the proposed methodology, and the results are used to investigate the choice of equity principles of different types of power plants located in different regions.

40|$|The initial {{allocation}} of tradable carbon emission allowances {{is among the}} most contentious issues in developing an emission trading scheme (ETS). China faces serious dilemmas of system complexity and information incompleteness and asymmetry in allocating carbon allowance among enterprises. As one of the pilot ETS regions, Shenzhen has launched the first regional cap-and-trade ETS (SZ ETS) in China. Adhering to the overall plan and classification analysis, SZ ETS intends to solve the aforementioned dilemmas by developing innovative <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> policies. A fundamental principle is to allocate allowances based on carbon intensity and actual output, according to which a two-step allocation procedure is constructed. A competitive game mechanism is introduced for <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> among manufacturing enterprises. Empirical results indicate the following: (1) Carbon <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> based on carbon intensity and actual output can mitigate carbon emission growth by reducing CO 2 emitted per unit output, and, thus, buffer the shocks of unexpected economic fluctuations to ETS stability; (2) Competitive game allocation may contribute to improving the use of scattered information to enhance the efficiency of information and emission resource allocation. Exploring SZ ETS may provide a reference for formulating future national carbon <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> policies in China and other developing regions...|$|R
40|$|The <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> {{under the}} European Emission trading schemes differs {{fundamentally}} from earlier {{cap and trade}} programs, like SO 2 and NOx in the USA. Because of the iterative nature of negotiations of the overall budget, the allocation also has to follow an iterative process. If power generators anticipate that their current behaviour will affect future <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation,</b> then this can distort today’s decisions. Furthermore, the National Allocation Plans (NAPs) contain multiple provisions dealing with existing installations, what happens to allocation when they close, and allocations to new entrants. We provide a framework to assess the economic incentives and distortions that provisions in NAPs can have on market prices, operation and investment decisions. To this end, we use both analytic models to illustrate the incentives effects and results from numerical simulation runs that estimate the magnitude of impacts from different <b>allocation</b> rules. <b>Allowance</b> <b>allocation,</b> Emission trading, Power sector, Economic incentives...|$|R
30|$|The {{machining}} of thin-walled parts is {{a crucial}} issue to NC machining. The traditional method will allocate uniform finishing allowance to each machining surface, which will easily leads to insufficient wall thickness and poor stiffness of some machining surfaces, resulting in excessive deformation of the final formed parts, or deduce machining efficiency for some machining features due to too thick remains. In order to solve this problem, a non-uniform <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> method based on interim state stiffness of machining features for thin-walled parts finishing is proposed in this paper. According to the evaluation of interim state stiffness of each machining feature, the non-uniform allowance is allocated to ensure the stiffness requirement in the finishing process. The finite element simulation results reveals that the non-uniform <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> method proposed in this paper can effectively guarantee the stiffness of the parts and reduce the deformation of the parts compared with the traditional uniform <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> method.|$|R
40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the volume}} of free allowances that different National Allocation Plans proposed to allocate to existing and new installations, with specific reference to the power sector. Most countries continue to allocate based on historic emissions, contrary to hopes for improved allocation methods, with allocations to installations frequently based on 2005 emission data; this may strengthen belief {{in the private sector}} that emissions in the coming years will influence their subsequent <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation.</b> Allocations to new installations provide high and frequently fuel differentiated subsidies, risking significant distortions to investment choices. Thus in addition to being numerically weak in aggregate, proposed allocation plans reveal continuing if diverse problems, including perverse incentives.

As DSMES is an extensible platform, the emission allowance pricing model are added to DSMES {{for the purpose of}} emission market research [31]. Moreover, supported by DSMES, experiments with human subjects were conducted and major driving factors of emission trading were extracted, which could aid the construction of multi-agent stochastic models with the same distribution characteristics [32, 33]. In this paper, we implement different power dispatching models and <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> models in DSMES, based on which all participants’ mathematical models are constructed and key parameters are set.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} alternative <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> designs for industry profits and GDP under a federal cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We employ a general equilibrium model of the U. S. economy with a unique treatment of capital dynamics that permits close attention to profit impacts. Effects on profits depend critically on the relative reliance on auctioning or free <b>allocation</b> of <b>allowances.</b> Freely allocating fewer than 15 % of the emissions allowances generally suffices to prevent profit losses in the most vulnerable U. S. industries. Freely allocating all of the allowances substantially overcompensates these industries. When emissions allowances are auctioned and the proceeds employed to finance cuts in income tax rates, GDP costs are about 33 % lower than when all allowances are freely allocated. Our results are robust to policies differing in stringency, the availability of offsets, and the opportunities for intertermporal trading of allowances.

40|$|The {{supply of}} {{allowances}} in the European Union Emissions Trading System is determined within a rigid allocation programme.

We derive analytical dependencies between the <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> adjustment rate and the market equilibrium dynamics, which allows us to represent the quantity thresholds as quantiles for the number of allocated and unused allowances. Finally, we present an analytical tool for the selection of an optimal adjustment rate under both risk-neutrality and risk-aversion.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{distributional}} and efficiency impacts of different <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes motivated by recently proposed U. S. climate legislation {{for a national}} cap and trade system using a new dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the U. S. economy. The USREP model tracks nine different income groups and twelve different geographic regions within the U. S. We find that the allocation schemes in all proposals are progressive over {{the lower half of}} the income distribution and proportional in the upper half of the income distribution. Scenarios based on the Cantwell-Collins allocation proposal are less progressive in early years and have lower welfare costs due to smaller redistribution to low income households and, consequently, lower income-induced increases in energy demand and less savings and investment. Scenarios based on the three other allocation schemes tend to overcompensate some adversely affected income groups and regions in early years, but this dissipates over time as the <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> effect becomes weaker. Finally, we find that carbon pricing by itself (ignoring the return of carbon revenues through <b>allowance</b> <b>allocations)</b> is proportional to modestly progressive. This striking result follows from the dominance of the sources over uses side impacts of the policy and stands in sharp contrast to previous work that has focused only on the uses side. The main reason is that lower income households derive a large fraction of income from government transfers, and we hold the transfers constant in real terms, reflecting the fact that transfers are generally indexed to inflation. As a result, this source of income is unaffected by carbon pricing while wage and capital income is affected. ...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two methods}} for <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> in an {{emission}} market: free allocation or auction, each having its pros and cons. Auction is generally {{recognized as a}} more equitable method, which provides more incentives for emission reductions [16], and can produce an explicit reference price for the secondary market [17]. Free allocation is more acceptable for stakeholders as it does not significantly increase the emission cost. At the initial stage of an ETS, free allocation is more favorable [18].|$|R
30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> for takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation.</b> After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % allowance for free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated allowance for the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the allowance for the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the allowance for the takers, can be introduced to the allowance for the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free for the allowance of the givers.|$|R
30|$|For {{thin-walled}} parts, uniform allowance to each machining {{surface is}} allocated {{by the traditional}} machining method. Considering the sequence of the adjacent machining features, it may cause poor stiffness for some side walls due to a minor wall thickness, which may cause the deformation of the final formed parts to be large, or deduce machining efficiency for some machining features due to too thick remains. In order to address this issue, a non-uniform <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> method based on interim state stiffness of machining features for the finishing of thin-walled structural parts is proposed in this paper. In this method, the interim state model of machining features is constructed according to the machining sequence of the parts, and the stiffness of the side wall is taken as the evaluation index to allocate reasonable allowance value to the corresponding machining surface to ensure the stiffness requirement of the parts in the machining process. According to the finite element simulation results, the non-uniform <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the stiffness of the parts and reduce the deformation of the parts, {{when compared with the}} traditional uniform allowance machining method.|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} and scholars have used various strategies {{to improve and}} optimize the allocation ratios for carbon emission allowances. This issue is more urgent for China due to the uneven development across the country. This paper proposes a new method that divides low-carbon economy development processes into two separate periods: from 2020 to 2029 and from 2030 to 2050. These two periods have unique requirements and emissions reduction potential; therefore, they must involve different allocation methods, so that reduction behaviors do not stall the development of regional low-carbon economies. During the first period, a more deterministic economic development approach for the carbon emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> ratio should be used. During the second period, more adaptive and optimized policy guidance should be employed. We developed a low-carbon economy index evaluation system using the entropy weight method to measure information filtering levels. We conducted vector autoregressive correlation tests, consulted 60 experts for the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, and we conducted max-min standardized data processing tests. This article presents first- and second-period carbon emission allowance models in combination with a low-carbon economy index evaluation system. Finally, we forecast reasonable carbon emission <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> ratios for China for the periods starting in 2020 and 2030. A good allocation ratio for the carbon emission allowance can help boost China’s economic development and help the country reach its energy conservation and emissions reduction goals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how tax reductions {{financed by}} {{a carbon tax}} could be designed to mitigate the need for specific relief for firms in select energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) sectors. In particular, I consider impacts on manufacturing sectors at the six-digit North American Industry Classification System level, with a special focus on firms that would be presumptively eligible for competitiveness relief using the criteria in the Waxman–Markey bill (H. R. 2454). The paper {{has a number of}} findings. First, determination of eligibility for relief analogous to the free <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> in H. R. 2454 is sensitive to energy intensity. Second, providing compensation to EITE sectors through the corporate income tax—analogous to the output-based <b>allowance</b> <b>allocation</b> in Waxman–Markey—is certainly feasible, but tax appetite within the EITE sectors is insufficient to fully use any credits that attempted to offset more than about one-quarter of their carbon tax liability. Third, certain reforms do better than others at providing disproportionate relief to EITE sectors. Finally, economic theory predicts a substantial cost to diverting carbon tax revenue toward compensation of specific sectors. Theory also suggests that firms should treat policy risk no differently from the way they treat the other risks they face as they do business. But politics may dictate otherwise; if so, the analysis here suggests that certain approaches may work better than others to ensure that relief is appropriately targeted at minimal cost...|$|R
