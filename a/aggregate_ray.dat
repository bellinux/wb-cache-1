40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{aggregate}} rays {{present in the}} xylem of the New Zealand species of Nothofagus, and compares them with those present in other genera, particularly Fagus and Dracophyllum. The ontogeny of aggregate rays is investigated, and {{shown to be a}} feature largely of the 'leaf-gap' in Fagus and Dracophyllum. In Nothofagus, however, <b>aggregate</b> <b>ray</b> ontogeny relates more to the leaf-trace. Neither the 'synthetic' nor the 'dissection' theory is adequate for describing <b>aggregate</b> <b>ray</b> ontogeny. The presence of aggregate rays in Nothofagus is correlated with an irregular (not circular) outline of the pith (TS) and may relate to light and hormonal factors and their effect on cell division and elongation within the elongating internode. Certain regions within the growth increment are dominated by pseudo-transverse anticlinal divisions of cambial fusiform initials, other regions are dominated by fusiform initial elongation. An attempt was made to determine whether these regions could be distinguished based on deviations from the normal distribution recorded for axial element length data. The results are not conclusive, but may merit further investigation. Certain features of the aggregate rays in Nothofagus such as: reduced element length; paucity of vessels; reduction of individual rays; and the formation of 'wound-like' areas, indicate that the fluting may actually be responsible for the presence of these aggregate rays...|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the mature wood of three species of the South American genus of woody climbers Dicranostyles Bth. is {{described}} and {{compared with that of}} the secondary wood of other genera of the Convolvulaceae. The stems are characterized by the occurrence of concentric rings of included phloem tissue. In most characters the three species are quite similar, except for the absence of rays over two cells wide in D. guianensis. Instead of these, <b>aggregate</b> <b>rays</b> occur at intervals between consecutive rings of included phloem. D. mildbraediana possesses fibre tracheids with next to the normal large bordered pits numerous very large irregular slits giving the impression of a helical sculpturing of the walls. From a comparison with other Convolvulaceous genera like Bonamia, Ipomoea, Maripa, Neuropeltis, and Prevostea¹ it appears that nearest to Dicranostyles in general appearance as well as in anatomical structure is the genus Maripa. The resemblance to Ipomoea seems only superficial. The relation between anatomical conformities of genera and their position in the various systems of subdivision of the family is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A pixel’s {{color value}} is the {{integration}} over {{a set of}} light rays. These lights rays may vary in color if they originate from different objects or surfaces that vary in albedo. To achieve photorealism, image manipulations such as contrast and gamma adjustment, histogram equalization or color replacement should ideally be applied to each light ray instead of the <b>aggregate</b> of the <b>rays.</b> In this paper, we attempt to separate the set of colors contributing to a pixel. We assume the set can be approximated using a finite set of weighted colors. Experimental results shown that two colors are sufficient. By applying image manipulations {{to each of the}} two colors independently, improved results can be obtained. We demonstrate our approach on a variety of image manipulations and compare both quantitatively and qualitatively against ground truth and baseline methods, as well as via human studies.

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} cone-based ray tracing {{algorithm}} for high-quality rendering of furry objects with reflection, refraction and defocus effects. By <b>aggregating</b> many sampling <b>rays</b> in a pixel {{as a single}} cone, we significantly reduce the high supersampling rate required by the thin geometry of fur fibers. To {{reduce the cost of}} intersecting fur fibers with cones, we construct a bounding volume hierarchy for the fiber geometry to find the fibers potentially intersecting with cones, and use a set of connected ribbons to approximate the projections of these fibers on the image plane. The computational cost of compositing and filtering transparent samples within each cone is effectively reduced by approximating away in-cone variations of shading, opacity and occlusion. The result is a highly efficient ray tracing algorithm for furry objects which is able to render images of quality comparable to those generated by alternative methods, while significantly reducing the rendering time. We demonstrate the rendering quality and performance of our algorithm using several examples and a user study...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} Minas Gerais {{is the largest}} {{producer}} of coffee in Brazil {{and the amount of}} residue in crops seems adequate to support production of solid wood products of Coffea arabica L., which is currently used for energy purposes or remains in the area. This activity adds insignificant value the coffee products and release CO 2, which has harmful effects to the environment. This study was conducted with the aim of characterizing technologically Coffea arabica L. wood to enhance its use in furniture, to characterize its anatomical, chemical and wood basic density. The density showed an average of 0. 608 g. cm- 3. The anatomical analysis showed distinct growth layers, semiporosos vessels with simple perforation plates. The axial parenchyma is apotracheal and diffuse in the <b>aggregate</b> with heterogeneous <b>rays,</b> not laminated and fiber libriformes not septate with bordered pits distinct. The chemical content of extract in hot and cold water were respectively 6. 1 % and 9. 6 %. The ash content was found to be 0. 68 %. Data were comparable to those of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) and Piptadenia peregrina Benth, (angico-vermelho) used for the production of furniture...|$|R
