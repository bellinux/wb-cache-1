40|$|The {{progress}} {{in the field of}} computer networks and Internet is increasing with tremendous volume in recent years. This raises important issue with regards to security. Several solutions emerged in the past which provide security at host or network level. These traditional solutions like antivirus, firewall, spy-ware, and authentication mechanisms provide security to some extends, but they still face the challenge of inherent system flaws, OS bugs and social engineering attacks. Recently, some interesting solution emerged like Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems, but these too have some problems, like detecting and responding in real time, because they mostly require inputs from system administrator. Optimistically, we have succeeded in protecting the hosts to some extent by applying the reactive approach, such as antivirus, firewall and intrusion detection and response systems, But, if we critically analyze this approach, we will reach the conclusion that it has inherent flaws, since the number of penetrations, Internet crime cases, identity and financial data thefts, etc. are rising exponentially in recent years. The main reason is that we are using only reactive approach, i. e. protection system is activated only when some security breach occurs. Secondly, current techniques try to fix the overall huge problem of security using only small remedies (firewall, antivirus and intrusion detection and preventions system) – “point solutions”. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} develop a strategy using Mobile Agents in order to operate in reactive and proactive manners, what requires providing security on the principle of defense in depth. So, that ultimate goal of securing a system as a whole can be achieved. System is assumed to be secure if unauthorized <b>access</b> (<b>penetrations)</b> is not possible and system is safe against damages. This strategy will include three aspects: (a) autonomously detect vulnerabilities on different hosts (in a distributed network) before an attacker can exploit (b) protect hosts by detecting attempts of intrusions and responding to them in real time; and finally (c) perform tasks related to security management...|$|R

Autobiographical texts, also known as “life writing,” embody cultural, national and transnational concerns regarding identity, memory, and history.

The racist constructions of Asians and Asian Americans as inscrutable surfaces inform the referential dynamics in autobiographical self-representation; simultaneously, the historical feminization of the East foregrounds the dynamics of <b>access</b> and <b>penetration,</b> dynamics at work in the penetrating gaze of the consumer of autobiography. My dissertation contributes to the identification and analysis of this paradoxical condition of simultaneously embodying an inscrutable, impenetrable surface and the presumed penetrability associated with femininity and personal disclosure.

The methodology followed in the development of the BONE Roadmap was firstly to identify and analyse the status of broadband <b>access</b> <b>penetration</b> as well as the availability of specific network and IT technologies in various European countries. The data collected were then processed and translated into the traffic volume (distributed across different European countries) that a Pan-European network would need to support. This information is then used as the basis of a WDM optical network dimensioning exercise performed with the aim of identifying the scale of the required optical network. In addition, based on estimations regarding the evolution of broadband access technologies and the degree of broadband penetration and network services and applications, extrapolations regarding the growth of traffic to be supported by the European Network of the Future were made in a systematic manner. These were also used to dimension and understand the requirements of the European Network of the Future.

40|$|Turkey {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} emerging markets in the world. Considering its young educated population prone to use computer technologies, Turkey can make more benefit from broadband services. Compared with OECD countries, however, current broadband <b>access</b> <b>penetration</b> in Turkey, particularly for fixed broadband service, is quite low. Furthermore, there is a limited competition in Turkish fixed broadband market, which is highly dominated by a single incumbent network. Different than many developed countries, cable TV infrastructure, which is an important part of facility based competition in fixed broadband market, has not been developed much and it is still owned and governed by the state company called Torksat which is established primarily responsible for national satellite operations. In October 2014, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has announced Turkish government's new privatization agenda covering cable TV operations of Turksat. In this thesis, it is focused on possible effects of the privatization of cable TV network on the competition dynamics of Turkish fixed broadband market and developing policy implications for Turkey to enhance sustainable broadband ecosystem. The research findings, based on the interviews conducted with experts from Turkish telecommunication and media sector, affirms the government's privatization decision that privatization of cable TV platform is needed because of uncompetitive company behavior and lack of private sector motivations in management under the ownership of state. Moreover, privatization is high likely to enhance consumer welfare. Although, the service coverage area of the cable platform is low, it has a potential, to make a significant impact on competition with follow up coverage investments. There are economic incentives, complementarily, to invest in network roll out in Turkey. However, there are challenges mainly rising from municipals' attitude toward new infrastructure deployment. Therefore, developing policies triggering investment incentives for network roll out and eliminating the reluctance of municipals toward telecommunication infrastructure development would be the key policy implications to increase the attractiveness of the cable platform auction and to sustain competitive environment after the privatization. by Serdar Ozcan.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies from}} major network {{technology}} vendors forecast {{the advent of}} the Exabyte era, a massive increase in network traffic driven by high-definition video and high-speed <b>access</b> technology <b>penetration.</b> One of the most formidable difficulties that this forthcoming scenario poses for the Internet is congestion problems due to traffic volume anomalies at the core network. In the light of this challenging near future, we develop in this work different network-wide anomaly detection and isolation algorithms to deal with volume anomalies in large-scale network traffic flows, using coarse-grained measurements as a practical constraint. These algorithms present well-established optimality properties in terms of false alarm and miss detection rate, or in terms of detection/isolation delay and false detection/isolation rate, a feature absent in previous works. This represents a paramount advantage with respect to current in-house methods, as it allows to generalize results independently of particular evaluations. The detection and isolation algorithms are based on a novel linear, parsimonious, and non-data driven spatial model for a large-scale network traffic matrix. This model allows detecting and isolating anomalies in the Origin-Destination traffic flows from aggregated measurements, reducing the overhead and avoiding the challenges of direct flow measurement. Our proposals are analyzed and validated using real traffic and network topologies from three different large-scale IP backbone networks...|$|R

A contingency framework which outlines the conditions under which FDI inflows will be related to national trade surpluses and/or deficits, based on the dominant strategic motives of the investing firms, is presented and tested. Our findings suggest that the relationship between FDI inflow and trade balance is moderated by whether a country is an Advanced Industrial Nation or a Developing Country.

40|$|In recent years, the {{telecommunications}} industry observes a tremendous increasing of broadband <b>access</b> <b>penetration</b> level. Indeed, the number of subscribers with access to broadband Internet connections either at home or work is growing steadily. This can be explained both {{by the emergence of}} rich content applications and by the drop in access prices due to the broadband technologies' evolution and the fierce competition between access networks operators. The current trend in wired access networks are FTTx optical technologies (Fiber To The Home / Curb / Building / Premises), which present an alternative to xDSL networks (using copper loops deployed primarily for the phone system) and cable networks (using cable infrastructures originally deployed for TV distribution). The optical access networks differ first by the physical medium used to carry information. In the case of optical access networks, it is fiber, which have the largest capacity of all physical media used today. Using such a physical medium would potentially provide more bandwidth to the subscribers. However, optical access network architectures raises many issues. For economic reasons, it is necessary to limit both civil engineering (which cost is dominant), and the number of active equipments (which cost more than passive equipment from CAPEX and OPEX points of views). A popular solution is to deploy a tree architecture, and to focus the intelligence of the access network (active elements) {{at the root of the}} tree: this corresponds to a Passive Optical Network (PON). The absence of active equipment in the terminals, and the sharing of transmission capacity of fiber among several users, especially for upstream traffic, require the implementation of mechanisms used for controlling multiplexing. These mechanisms are implemented in MAC protocols, which are the main subject of this thesis. Downstream traffic is broadcasted and each end-point filters its own traffic. On the other hand, upstream traffic has to be controlled in order to avoid collisions. The present thesis presents mechanisms that can be implemented in a MAC for Ethernet PON (EPON) in order to control upstream traffic. We show that the proposed mechanisms can support multiple classes of traffic, can couple resource allocation with access control and can finally efficiently use the upstream capacity of the EPON. The various mechanism proposed in the present work are mostly analyzed by simulation; this is because the overall behavior of a PON is too complex to be analytically analyzed, except for simple studies reported in Chapter 3. A comprehensive simulation framework, based on Network Simulator, has been designed and is presented in Chapter 4. This framework has enabled the comparison between state of the art mechanisms and our proposals. We show in Chapter 5 that our mechanisms are simple to implement and behave significantly better than classical mechanisms regarding real time traffic support, while ensuring a quasi-optimal use of upstream bandwidth. More generally, we show in Chapter 6 how our mechanisms are part of a global command plane for PONs. Conclusions and perspectives are outlined in Chapter 7.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of broadband penetration has shown substantial differences between OECD countries. This paper empirically investigates {{to what extent}} different forms of regulated competition explain these international differences. It distinguishes three modes of competition between broadband internet access providers that result from regulatory policies: (1) inter-platform competition; (2) facilities-based intra-platform competition; and (3) service-based intra-platform competition. In most countries these forms of competition co-exist although their intensity varies from country to country. Intra-platform competition may differ among countries depending {{on the degree of}} mandatory access obligations imposed by the regulator on the dominant network firm. Based on a sample of OECD countries, the analysis finds that inter-platform competition has been a main driver of broadband penetration. The two types of intra-platform competition have a considerably smaller effect on the broadband penetration. Linking these findings back to access regulation suggests that the "stepping stone" or "ladder of investment" theories might not provide the justification to impose extensive mandatory access obligations on DSL incumbents.

Findings revealed that the experiences of public health faculty, who develop and teach online courses were similar to those in other subjects and were described as difficult, daunting, painful, and time consuming, leaving the public health faculty feeling frustrated and exhausted. While negative feelings described the experience pertaining to the development of online courses, the experience in the teaching phase was seen as positive, enjoyable, joyful, refreshing, and fun. These experiences were found to be contingent upon instructional and organizational support, availability and quality of resources and faculty development and training. Three overarching themes emerged from the study in relation to the experience. These themes included the rhetoric of fear, transformation, and support. The rhetoric of fear described the participants? sense of being afraid or apprehensive toward developing and teaching online courses. Transformation described the transition participants made as they emerged as online instructors. Support described the structures needed to engage in the activities of developing and teaching online courses. The study also revealed five types of barriers to developing and teaching online courses at this particular school of public health. These barriers included psychological, organizational, technical, instructional, and time barriers. Benefits for developing and teaching online courses were identified. They included availability for students, <b>access</b> and <b>penetration</b> into global markets, instructional innovation, design innovation, and new methods of instructional delivery. This study provides data that can be used by institutions and faculty as they design and implement social, political, and technical infrastructures to support the activities of online teaching...|$|R
40|$|The Internet plays {{a central}} role in the lives of an {{increasing}} number of people, whether as a space for entertainment, information, learning, socialising or shopping. With <b>access</b> and <b>penetration</b> of high speed connections ever increasing, the so-called “Internet revolution” is set to continue. This study primarily focuses on the ways in which the Internet is used for shopping, commonly known as e-tailing. Academics have long studied a number of issues that are of significant importance to the phenomenon of e-tailing. The popularity and growth of the Internet has led to a large number of studies that focus on cyberspace, ranging from issues of users’ identity, interaction and communication to the behaviour of web users and through to the construction / deconstruction of place online. Much has been written on the subject of consumption, its birth and growth through different “consumer revolutions” to the present day globalised world of mass consumption. Linked to consumption is retailing, which is also widely covered in academic literature, including traditional spaces and forms of retailing, as well as “alternative” spaces such as farmers’ markets and car boot sales. Whilst much has been written on these individual themes a significant gap in the literature is apparent. This study combines these three topics to critically explore the geography of online retailing and its influence on consumers’ shopping behaviours and cultures of consumption and the relationship between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ spaces. In particular, emphasis is placed upon the consumer. This is achieved through a number of methods, including a 100 user baseline survey and a more in-depth four Internet user biography stage. The findings suggest that a number of factors influence the behaviours of online shoppers, including the layout of websites, the content and familiarity that consumers have with sites, and the trust and loyalty users have with particular retailers. This allowed for the formation of five distinctive Internet shopping typologies: functional Internet shopping; bargain Internet shopping; lifestyle Internet shopping; specialised Internet shopping; and discreet Internet shopping. Whilst these shopping types are distinctive it is shown that consumers tend to exhibit more than one type of shopping behaviour. Once seen as an “alternative” space for shopping, the Internet now displays the same forms of mass consumerism as the “real” world and acts as a mirror/extension of the High Street...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{studied the}} first four years of the statewide carve out for Medicaid enrollees in Massachusetts to assess its effect on access and spending. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Using {{administrative}} data, we compared the state's fiscal years 1992 (the last year before the carve out) through 1996 (the final year of the state's first carve-out vendor, MHMA). We evaluated the effect on spending by converting expenditures to constant (1996) prices using the medical services component of the Consumer Price Index for Boston and standardizing directly for the changing proportion of Medicaid enrollees who were disabled. We measured <b>access</b> through the <b>penetration</b> rate (proportion of enrollees using at least one substance abuse treatment service in a year. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall this carve out reduced real adjusted spending per enrollee by 40 percent from 1992 to 1996. At the same time, access improved from 38 to 43 unduplicated users per 1, 000 enrollees per year f rom 1992 to 1996, adjusted for changes in Medicaid eligibility. these savings were achieved by a shift in the type of 24 -h our services (hospital, detox, and residential treatment). In 1992, 87 percent of these services were provided in hospital compared to only 1 percent in 1996. the reductions were achieved within {{the first two years of}} the carve out and sustained, but not enhanced, in subsequent years. CONCLUSIONS: By arranging Medicaid reimbursement for lower levels of care and limiting use of the most expensive settings, managed care achieved substantial cost reductions over {{the first four}} years in Massachusetts...|$|R
40|$|High-speed, or broadband, {{access to}} the Internet is {{becoming}} ubiquitous, but some policymakers are concerned that broadband penetration in the United States is increasing too slowly, especially compared to other countries. As a result, cities, states, {{and the federal government}} are adopting policies intended to quicken broadband growth. These policies include attempts to streamline rights-of-way laws, telecommunications unbundling regulations, subsidies, and direct municipal broadband provision. To date, however, little empirical research has explored whether these policies, especially at the state level, are effective. In this paper I combine data from several publicly-available sources to test the effects of a number of policies. The analysis reveals that most state-level policies are ineffective. Universal service mechanisms and programs targeted at "underserved" areas do not boost broadband penetration and may even slow it, possibly by giving an artificial advantage to one type of provider over another. Likewise, tax incentives appear to have no impact. Laws limiting municipal deployment of broadband are not statistically significantly correlated with broadband penetration. Other policies, however, do appear to affect broadband <b>penetration.</b> <b>Access</b> to public rights-of-way by broadband providers is strongly correlated with penetration. Telecom unbundling regulations also affect penetration: the share of telephone lines provided under UNE-P regulations is negatively correlated with penetration, but resold lines are positively correlated with it. Some programs targeting rural access may have some positive impact. Subsidies from USDA's Rural Development broadband program are not correlated with increased rural access to broadband, but subsidies from USDA's broader telecommunications program are, though the analysis suggests that it is probably not a cost effective way to increase broadband access. ...|$|R
40|$|Drivers using {{information}} from an Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) could potentially make better travel decisions to reduce travel time and increase trip reliability, thereby benefiting both guided drivers {{as well as}} those without such <b>access.</b> However, market <b>penetration</b> of ATIS can have dramatic effects on the performance of the transportation system in terms of overall benefits conferred as well as the distributional effects between guided and unguided drivers. Because market penetration will be determined both by private market structure and public policies, the effective deployment of ATIS depends critically on the private and public organizations that will provide these services. An understanding of the relationship between transportation system performance and ATIS market penetration provides important insights into a sustaining market structure for the ATIS industry. This thesis provides an empirical study of the impact of ATIS on transportation network quality of service using an application of DynaMIT (Dynamic network assignment for the Management of Information to Travelers). An analysis of the simulation results serves to inform the public and private stakeholder positions {{in the creation of a}} better market for ATIS. The main results are that the provision of dynamic route guidance can simultaneously benefit the individual performance of drivers, both guided and unguided, as well as the system performance of existing transportation infrastructure. In order to perform this analysis, it was necessary to develop a new software framework for the real- time integration of DynaMIT and a Traffic Management Center (TMC). by Daniel George Florian.
