40|$|A {{well-known}} {{problem for}} reproductions of binaural recordings and simulations using HRTFs {{other than those}} of the <b>actual</b> <b>listener</b> is decreased localization performance and increased front-back confusion. Previous studies have indicated that moving the sound source can reduce these problems. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure how a unidirectional sound source movement along an orbit in the horizontal plane (achieved by reproducing sounds with a loudspeaker and turning a recording artificial head with a velocity of 5 °/s) affects front-back confusion and localization errors. Three factors were studied: 1) movement angle (no movement, 20 °, 30 ° and 40 °) 2) acoustic environment (anechoic and reverberant) and 3) type of stimulus (male speech and recurring 840 Hz sinusoidal tones with a Gaussian envelope). Listening tests showed that front-back confusions decreased for 20 ° and 40 ° sound source movements, whereas it increased for 30 ° movement. The localization errors increased with about 5 ° when moving the sound sources. The front-back confusions and localization error was not affected by the implementation of reverberation. The frontback confusions occurred generally 3 % more often for Gaussian tone bursts than speech, whereas the localization errors were equal.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the attitude of Saudi students with regard to varieties of spoken English in a multi-lingual environment. For this objective, twenty-five students who are enrolled in the College of Languages & Translation / KKU were selected. The methods used is that they are made in EFL program to listen to two short texts read by a Standard South African native English speaker (SSAE) and a Standard Indian English (SIE) speaker. The participants rated each speaker's perceived accents and comprehensibility. The results show that each speaker’s accent influences the listeners perceptions. However, the SIE speaker is more highly rated than the SSAE speaker on measures of perceived accent, comprehensibility, and education. As far as ratings of perceived accent, comprehensibility and actual comprehension are concerned, they are not significantly different; this suggests that a strongly perceived accent and reduced perceived comprehensibility do not affect <b>actual</b> <b>listener</b> comprehension. In conclusion, this study suggests a need for more research on the relationship between perceived accent, comprehensibility and actual comprehension. As EFL students harbor traditional views of English, this study also suggests the need for the further development of programs focusing on linguistic diversity of English to combat linguistic stereotypes and standard language ideologies...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} measure how a unidirectional sound source movement along an orbit in the horizontal plane (achieved by reproducing sounds with a loudspeaker and turning a recording artificial head with a velocity of 5 °/s) affects front-back confusion and localization errors. Two factors were studied: 1. Movement (static or rotation). 2. Acoustic environment (anechoic or reverberant). Male speech and recurring 840 Hz sinusoidal tones with a Gaussian envelope were used as stimuli. Listening tests showed that the front-back confusion rate and the rate of incorrectly perceiving that the sound is coming straight from the side were significantly lower (95 % confidence level) in the reverberant condition compared to the anechoic condition. The front-back confusion rate was lower for the moving auditory scene compared to the static auditory scene, both in anechoic and reverberant conditions, but these differences were not significant. To conclude, there is reason to add room reflections to 3 D sound synthesis in order to enhance localization performance in auditory displays. The effect of adding movements is small in comparison to the effect of adding reflections. Godkänd; 2013; 20131212 (arny...|$|E

40|$|Many {{professional}} {{journalists and}} journalism scholars consider the increasing {{attention paid to}} audiences {{as one of the}} causes of the gradual loss of journalistic quality. They reason if ratings, circulation figures, hits and shares determine the content of journalism, the core values of journalism become jeopardized. This article argues how and why studies of journalistic quality should take the <b>actual</b> readers, <b>listeners</b> and viewers of journalistic texts seriously. It reports on a different kind of research for measuring the public's news interests and preferences; one that concentrates on value - what makes journalism precious for people and how news organizations can provide this. By zooming in on the professionals' and public's experience of quality information instead of their views on the topic, the article shows how pleasing the audience might be compatible with producing excellent journalism. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of speech recognition, an {{algorithm}} must learn {{to tell the difference}} between 2 ̆ 2 a nice rock 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 a gneiss rock 2 ̆ 2. These identical-sounding phrases are called oronyms. Word frequency dictionaries are often used by speech recognition systems to help resolve phonetic sequences with more than one possible orthographic phrase interpretation, by looking up which oronym of the root phonetic sequence contains the most-common words. Our paper demonstrates a technique used to validate word frequency dictionary values. We chose to use frequency values from the UNISYN dictionary, which tallies each word on a per-occurance basis, using a proprietary text corpus, to calculate word frequency. In the first phase of our user study, we generated oronym strings for the phrase 2 ̆ 2 a nice cold hour 2 ̆ 2, and had over a dozen people make 62 of the most-common oronyms for that phrase. In the second phase, we selected 15 of the phase one recordings, and had 74 different people transcribe each one, for a total of 953 transcriptions overall. If the frequency dictionary values for our test phrases accurately reflected the real-world expectations of <b>actual</b> <b>listeners,</b> we would expect that the most-commonly transcribed phrases in our user study would roughly correspond with our metric for the most likely oronym interpretation of the root phrase. During the course of our study, we found that using per-occurance frequency values, like those found in the UNISYN dictionary, when computing our overall-phrase-frequency metric caused the end result to be thrown off by excessively common words, such as 2 ̆ 2 the 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 is 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 a 2 ̆ 2 These super-common words had such high per-occurance tallies that they overpowered any effect that any regular word had on a frequency metric. When we used frequency values from the COCA dictionary, which has word frequency values tallied on a document-count basis instead of a UNISYN-like per-occurance basis, we found that this effect was mitigated. As a result, we do not recommend using the UNISYN dictionary for word frequency purposes...|$|R
40|$|Language attitudes color listeners' {{perceptions}} of speakers and language varieties. Speakers of standard varieties are often valued while speakers of non-standard varieties are often disparaged {{because of their}} speech. Previous research has extensively documented native English speakers' attitudes toward the non-standard and non-native English varieties students might encounter in American higher education; however, {{few studies have examined}} listeners' {{perceptions of}} World Englishes, and even fewer have utilized an all-English as a Second Language (ESL) sample. Thirty-one ESL students in two college ESL programs listened to two short texts read by a Standard American English (SAE) speaker and a Standard Indian English (SIE) speaker and rated each speaker's perceived accentedness, comprehensibility, friendliness, attractiveness, education, wealth, and professional desirability. Additionally, the listeners indicated the speakers' professions and answered three comprehension questions about each text's content. The results confirm that speaker accent influences listener perceptions: the SAE speaker is more highly rated than the SIE speaker on measures of perceived accentedness, perceived comprehensibility, education, attractiveness, wealth, professional desirability, and job attainment. Ratings of perceived accentedness, perceived comprehensibility, and actual comprehension are not significantly different, suggesting that a strong perceived accent and reduced perceived comprehensibility does not affect <b>actual</b> <b>listener</b> comprehension. This study suggests the need for more research on the relationship between perceived accentedness, perceived comprehensibility, and actual comprehension. In finding that ESL students harbor traditional views of English, this study also suggests the need for further development of programs focusing on English's linguistic diversity to combat linguistic stereotypes and standard language ideologies...|$|E
40|$|The thesis explores {{individual}} differences in listening behavior and how these differences {{can be used in}} the development and evaluation of listener response prediction models for embodied conversational agents. The thesis starts with introducing methods to collect multiple perspectives on listening behavior. The first method introduced is recording the listening behavior of multiple listeners in interaction with the same speaker. In the MultiLis corpus interactions between one speaker and three listeners are recorded. All four interlocutors believe they are engaged in a one-on-one interaction. The second method presented uses parasocial sampling to collected perspectives on listening behavior. Here participants watch videos of recorded speakers and annotate the places where they would give a listener response if they were the <b>actual</b> <b>listener</b> in the interaction. Following, the collected perspectives are combined into a consensus perspective. Doing this identifies response opportunities. Response opportunities are moments where {{at least one of the}} listeners has given a response. Through conversation analysis the characteristics of the response opportunities where most listeners responded and characteristics of response opportunities where only one listener responded are identified. The context of these response opportunities is analyzed on content of the speech, timing in relation to pauses, pitch and energy of the speech signal and gaze direction of the speaker. These features are used in the listener response prediction models that are developed in the next part of the thesis. These models are developed by learning the models on the MultiLis corpus. Different methods to use the perspectives are explored both in the development phase of the models and in the evaluation stage. The methods explored are 1) learning using a specific subset of the response opportunities based on number of listeners that responded as training or evaluation data, 2) active learning where the subjective ratings from observers of generated listeners based on an earlier model are used in the development of the subsequent model as negative training samples and 3) learning a model for each speaker independently and selecting the model based on the similarity of the new speaker and the speaker the model was trained on...|$|E

In contrast, high-FNE speakers were more effective in their communication, consistent with <b>listener's</b> <b>actual</b> understanding.In the athletic arena, low-FNE basketball players were able to withstand higher levels of pressure and continue to maintain performance levels, whereas high-FNE basketball players showed significant decrease in performance under pressure.|$|R
40|$|When {{instructed}} to speak clearly {{for people with}} hearing loss, a talker can effectively enhance the intelligibility of his/her speech by producing "clear" speech. We analyzed global acoustic properties of clear and conversational speech from two talkers and measured their speech intelligibility {{over a wide range}} of signal-to-noise ratios in acoustic and electric hearing. Consistent with previous studies, we, found that clear speech had a slower overall rate, higher temporal amplitude modulations, and also produced higher intelligibility than conversational speech. To delineate the role of temporal amplitude modulations in clear speech, we extracted the temporal envelope from a number of frequency bands and replaced speech fine-structure with noise fine-structure to simulate cochlear implants. Although both simulated and <b>actual</b> cochlear-implant <b>listeners</b> required higher signal-to-noise ratios to achieve normal performance, a 3 - 4 dB difference in speech reception threshold was preserved between clear and conversational speech for all experimental conditions. These results suggest that while temporal fine structure is important for speech recognition in noise in general, the temporal envelope carries acoustic cues that contribute to the clear speech intelligibility advantage.

50|$|There is {{much debate}} about the {{effectiveness}} of these broadcasts. As with Radio Free Europe during the Cold War, {{there is no way to}} judge the station's true audience through the usual listener surveys. Thus, the <b>actual</b> number of <b>listeners</b> is open to speculation. However, after the fall of the communist Soviet satellite governments of Eastern Europe in 1989 and of the Soviet Union itself at the end of 1991, a Hoover Institution conference reviewing reports from citizens in newly independent Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and other countries tended to substantiate the effectiveness of RFE and U.S. Voice of America broadcasts both in providing information and bolstering democratic movements within those countries, despite attempts at electronic jamming and counter-propaganda, and supporters of Radio Martí hope that it is achieving similar success in Cuba.|$|R
40|$|Working with Roger {{for many}} years in various projects, some of which are {{described}} below, was always very stimulating. Apart from being a very sympathetic collaborator and indeed mentor, he was very sharp and could quickly develop ideas about how to proceed in any situation {{while at the same time}} being open to negotiation. His friendship, his personal touch and his intellectual contributions will be missed. This contribution to New Media & Society outlines one of Roger’s many valuable legacies – the concept of domestication – describing its origin, Roger’s projects relating to the concept and the subsequent development of this approach. Domestication had its origins in a number of traditions and interests. If we start with media studies, by the end of the 1980 s there had been a long-standing interest in media audiences, but the dominance of semiotic approaches meant that there was a limited amount of empirical research on <b>actual</b> viewer or <b>listener</b> experiences. One of the early exceptions was Hobson (1980) looking at the role and meaning of television in the lives of housewives, and a few years later Bausinger (1984) had argued for studying ensembles of media and media consumption in the home as a collective process. Dave Morley, a later collaborator with Roger in the PICT (Programme on Information and Communication Technologies) funded project that helped develop the domestication concept, had started to examine how viewing was managed in households, with an emphasis on the gender dimension (1986). By the late 1980 s there was a collection of international studies on how families watched television (Lull, 1988), a discussion of general findings from this ethnographic work (Lull, 1990) as well as a study of people’s memories of early radio (Moores...|$|R
5000|$|As free jazz, or 'improvised music' {{grew and}} {{developed}} as a popular genre of music in Europe, so did its supporters - both casual and scholarly. While there {{had always been a}} close association between free jazz and political and social strife in Europe, many supporters of the genre began pushing to depoliticize the music, urging listeners to consider free jazz as an art form rather than simply a provocative statement on society bereft of any <b>actual</b> musicality. Many <b>listeners</b> of the time believed that, [...] "free jazz was as much a political as a musical phenomenon". During this time, there were fears that if free jazz was only considered as a mechanism for political commentary, that it would lose its validity as an art form, or at worst, be subject to censorship by European governments. Due to this possibility, there was a surge amongst the free jazz community to dissociate the word [...] "free" [...] with the political environment it is so commonly associated with. In addition to the depoliticizing of this genre of music, other critics asserted that,"Were jazz to be valued henceforth according to its capacity to reveal something of the social conditions under which it was produced or the political beliefs that its producers espoused, then its relevance for those outside the particular community from which it issues would be limited. In other words, by only associating jazz or free jazz with a particular ideology or thought process, in effect only those of a similar thought process can understand or appreciate it fully. Rather, if the free jazz genre was dissociated from the view that it is simply a vehicle for political commentary, and instead it was viewed objectively as a form of art, it would not only would be accessible to a larger audience, but it would allow itself to be judged as an art rather than the political statement {{it may or may not}} be attempting to make.|$|R
