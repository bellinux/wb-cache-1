5|$|A war {{hospital}} in Erskine, Scotland, {{is named after}} Louise. It took her name as {{she was the first}} patron of the unit. It was originally called Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers. The name changed over the years to Erskine Hospital <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> Erskine. The charity is close to its centenary year and has grown to become the biggest ex-service establishment in the country.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{leadership}} at Yarmouk, Khalid ibn al-Walid {{is considered one}} of the finest generals in history and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops.

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

5|$|However, in 1979–80, under former {{player and}} new manager Billy McNeill, {{they reached the}} quarter-finals of the European Cup. Celtic were drawn against Real Madrid, and goals from George McCluskey and Johnny Doyle gave Celtic a 2–0 win in the first leg at Parkhead. Goalkeeper Peter Latchford had an {{excellent}} match, and in particular his saves from England striker Laurie Cunningham and Spanish star Santillana were crucial in helping Celtic keep a clean sheet. The return leg took place two weeks later at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of approximately 120,000 fans. Johnny Doyle missed an excellent chance to score early in the first half, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> before half-time Santillana pulled a goal back for Real. Uli Stielike levelled the tie {{in the second half}} with a powerful volley past Latchford, before Juanito added a third near the end to send Celtic out 3–2 on aggregate.|$|E
25|$|Henry Blackwell {{was born}} May 4, 1832, in Bristol, Gloucestershire, England, the seventh of nine {{children}} of Samuel Blackwell and Hannah Lane Blackwell. Blackwell's father, a sugar refiner whose livelihood conflicted with his abolitionist principles, experimented with making beet sugar {{as an alternative}} to slave-grown cane sugar. In 1832, the family – including eight children and their father's sister Mary – emigrated to the United States. The family settled first in New York, where Blackwell's father established a sugar refinery and the ninth child was born, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> outside New York in Jersey City. Blackwell's father took an interest in the nascent abolition movement, and William Lloyd Garrison other leaders were visitors in the family's home. Blackwell's eldest sister, Anna, participated in the emerging agitation for women's rights, attending the 1837 Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women and drafting its letter to John Quincy Adams thanking him for his support of women's right to petition.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Chester {{would not}} end {{the ability of}} the Welsh to seriously {{threaten}} the Anglo-Saxon polities. Among the most powerful of the early kings of Gwynedd was Cadwallon ap Cadfan (c. 624 – 634), grandson of Iago ap Beli. He became engaged in an initially disastrous campaign against Northumbria where following a series of epic defeats he was confined first to Anglesey <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> to Puffin Island before being forced into exile across the Irish Sea to Dublin – a place which would come to host many royal refugees from Gwynedd. All must have seemed lost but Cadwallon raised an enormous army and after a brief time in Guernsey he invaded Dumnonia, relieved the West Welsh who were suffering a Mercian invasion and forced the pagan Penda of Mercia into an alliance against Northumbria. With new vigour Cadwallon returned to his Northumbrian foes, devastated their armies and slaughtered a series of their kings. In this furious campaign his armies devastated Northumbria, captured and sacked York in 633 and briefly controlled the kingdom. At this time, according to Bede, many Northumbrians were slaughtered, “with savage cruelty”, by Cadwallon.|$|E

25|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} {{live in the}} open water, so unlike {{demersal}} or reef fish, they cannot hide among kelp, or in crevices in coral, or under rocks on the bottom. This leaves them vulnerable to attack by large predatory fish, {{as well as other}} predators, such as marine mammals and seabirds. As a result, small pelagic fish usually aggregate in schools for protection. Schooling fish have evolved sophisticated evasion techniques. When they school, they have many eyes, making ambush difficult; and their silvery bodies dazzle, making it difficult for predators to pick out individual fish. They react to movements from a predator with lightning reflexes, rhythmically streaming up and down with rapid direction changes. When a predator approaches, they can split and reform behind the predator. During the final stages of an attack, they can explosively disband in all directions <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> as rapidly reform. Defensive manoeuvres like these appear to be choreographed, though they are not. Within the school itself, there is no centralized intelligence aware of how the school has configured itself. Rather, the schooling behaviour is the emergent consequence of relatively simple rules followed by each individual fish in the school, such as remaining close together, moving in the same direction, and avoiding collisions with each other.|$|E
25|$|In the 1909–10 season, an England team toured South Africa, playing its non-Test matches as Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The {{game against}} Western Province was won by MCC by an innings inside two days, and Commaille scored only 13 and 14 {{in the two}} Western Province innings. Despite this modest record, Commaille was picked for the South Africa team for the first Test, batting down the order at No 8 in the first innings and No 9 in the second; he scored just 8 in the first innings but in the second he made 19 and put on 74 for the eighth wicket with Aubrey Faulkner, who made 123. Commaille's {{adhesive}} powers were demonstrated again in the second Test. Having failed with a score of just 3 in the first innings when batting at No 9, {{he was promoted to}} No 6 in the second innings and scored 30 out of 103 made while he was at the wicket as South Africa amassed a match-winning total after a tie on first innings. There was further promotion up the batting order in the third Test: he scored 39 batting at No 6 in the first innings <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>just</b> 2 batting at No 3 in the second. Finally in the fourth Test he was tried as an opening batsman alongside Billy Zulch and responded with an innings of 42, his highest of the series and the highest of the South African first innings; he scored just three in the second innings. He was not successful in the final Test, scoring just four and five as England won easily. In the five Tests, Commaille scored 155 runs at an average of just 15.50.|$|E

500|$|Pollack and Rosenberg {{sent the}} script to Alan J. Pakula, {{who felt that}} it needed {{improvement}} and spent a year rewriting it with Pierson. Regarding the screenwriting process, Turow said, [...] "There were three large narrative problems to solve.

[...] Pierson originally envisioned the film adaptation as being [...] "a movie full of sex and blood". Pakula felt that the concept of justice was more central to the story. He also wanted to present the film in a visual style that echoed the novel's narrative. In making various changes from the novel, Pakula and Pierson added new dialogue and rewrote the ending. Pakula signed on to direct the film in January 1989.|$|E
500|$|In 1935 Bush {{began work}} on a piano concerto which, {{completed}} in 1937, included the unusual feature of a mixed chorus and baritone soloist in the finale, singing a radical text by Randall Swingler.
