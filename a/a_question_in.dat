5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification has become very rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to consider the case. Certified questions are also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E

Russell's appointment over Aspinwall led to <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons. However, it was accepted, and Russell conducted the prosecution. The Cotton case was the first of several famous poisoning cases he would be involved in during his career, including those of Adelaide Bartlett and Florence Maybrick.|$|E

Shakur is no longer Catholic. She later earned a General Educational Development (GED) with her aunt's help. Often there were few, or no other black students in her high school class. Shakur later wrote teachers seemed surprised when she answered <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged, and what she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography she later wrote: “I didn’t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history”.|$|E
500|$|A 2010 paper {{written by}} Karli June Cerankowski and Megan Milks, titled New Orientations: Asexuality and Its Implications for Theory and Practice, {{suggests}} that asexuality {{may be somewhat}} of <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> itself for the studies of gender and sexuality. Cerankowski and Milks have suggested that asexuality raises many more questions than it resolves, such as how a person could abstain from having sex, which is generally accepted by society {{to be the most}} basic of instincts. Their New Orientations paper states that society has deemed [...] " [...] female sexuality as empowered or repressed. The asexual movement challenges that assumption by challenging many of the basic tenets of pro-sex feminism [...] already defined as repressive or anti-sex sexualities." [...] In addition to accepting self-identification as asexual, the Asexual Visibility and Education Network has formulated asexuality as a biologically-determined orientation. This formula, if dissected scientifically and proven, would support researcher Simon LeVay's blind study of the hypothalamus in gay men, women, and straight men, which indicates that there is a biological difference between straight men and gay men.|$|E
