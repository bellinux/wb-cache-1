50|$|Morphine-N-oxide (genomorphine) is {{an active}} opioid {{metabolite}} of morphine. Morphine itself, in trials with rats, acts 11-22 times more potent than morphine-N-oxide subcutaneously and 39-89 times more potent intraperitoneally. However, pretreatment with <b>amiphenazole</b> or tacrine increases the potency of morphine-N-oxide in relation to morphine (intraperitoneally {{more so than in}} subcutaneous administration). A possible explanation is that morphine-N-oxide is rapidly inactivated in the liver and impairment of inactivation processes or enzymes increases functionality.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amiphenazole</b> (Daptazile) is a {{respiratory}} stimulant traditionally used as {{an antidote}} for barbiturate or opiate overdose, usually in combination with bemegride, as well as poisoning from other sedative drugs and treatment of respiratory failure from other causes. It was considered particularly useful as it could counteract the sedation and respiratory depression produced by morphine but with less effect on analgesia. It is still rarely used in medicine in some countries, although it has largely been replaced by more effective respiratory stimulants such as doxapram and specific opioid antagonists such as naloxone.|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, benactyzine, mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, <b>amiphenazole</b> and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, benactyzine, azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
