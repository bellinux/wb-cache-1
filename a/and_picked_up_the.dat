5|$|England {{started the}} {{following}} decade with a Grand Slam {{victory in the}} 1980 Five Nations – their first for 23 years. However in the 1983 Five Nations Championship, England failed to win a game <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wooden spoon. In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan and the United States, and met Wales in their quarter-final, losing the match 16–3.|$|E
5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Radford {{reported}} to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant soon thereafter. During the 1920s and 1930s his sea duty alternated among several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the Bureau of Aeronautics. It was during this time, while he served under Rear Admiral William Moffett, that he frequently interacted with politicians <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> political acumen that would become useful later in his career. While he {{did not attend the}} Naval War College, as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind frankly, even to superiors.|$|E

5|$|In {{his major}} league debut against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 8, Fister pitched one inning, struck out one, gave up one hit, {{and gave up}} one walk. He made his first start on August 11 against the Chicago White Sox <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> loss. Fister's first win came on August 16 against the New York Yankees. Fister {{finished}} {{the season with a}} major league record of 3–4 with a 4.13 ERA, and 36 strikeouts in 11 games, 10 starts.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February {{he claimed}} a night victory—a Ju 88 which vanished. MacLachlan claimed it destroyed. The Malta Y Service was combing the air waves <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> German crew's desperate {{distress}} calls. The aircraft {{was actually a}} He 111 from 5./Kampfgeschwader 26 (KG 26—Bomber Wing 26). All the crew survived though one was wounded. Within half an hour {{he was in the}} air again. He engaged a Ju 88 from II./LG 1 and claimed it shot down. In fact the Ju 88 managed to reach Catania, Sicily where it was written off in a crash-landing.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Don Kent donned {{the bush}} hat <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> boomerang once more after not having {{worked as a}} Kangaroo since 1974, except for the short run in 1977. Costello asked Kent to team up with Bruno Bekkar, who was mostly known from working in his native New Zealand and Australia. Kent and Bekkar worked a tour for the WWC while Costello served as their manager. The team won the WWC North American Tag Team titles from Jack and Jerry Brisco on 22 October 1981. They then lost the titles to Invader I and Super Gladiator but quickly gained them back before {{dropping}} the titles for good to Invader and Gladiator on 26 January 1982. The Kent and Bekkar team only lasted through one tour of the Caribbean, after which Bruno Bekkar returned to Australia and New Zealand {{to work for the}} local promotions there.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 1917, {{manned by}} an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> seven {{survivors}} of the Ross Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had all died. This was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier. Aurora left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 June 1917 bound for Chile, and was never seen again, officially posted as missing by Lloyd's of London on 2 January 1918. Among those lost was James Paton, who had acted as the ship's boatswain throughout the Ross Sea Party expedition and the drift, and on the subsequent relief mission. In 1920 King George V appointed Joseph Stenhouse an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), in acknowledgement of his service aboard Aurora.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the war, Connecticut was {{assigned}} to the Cruiser and Transport Force for transport duty, and from 6 January – 22 June 1919 she made four voyages to return troops from France. On 6 January, she left Hampton Roads for Brest, France, where she embarked 1,000 troops. After bringing them to New York (arriving on 2 February), Connecticut traveled back to Brest <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> 53rd Pioneer Regiment, a company of Marines, and a company of military police, 1,240 troops in all. These men were delivered to Hampton Roads on 24 March. After two months, Connecticut made another run overseas: following a short period of liberty in Paris for her crew, she embarked 891 men variously from the 502nd Army Engineers, a medical detachment, and the Red Cross. They were dropped off in Newport News on 22 June. On 23 June 1919, after having returned over 4,800 men, Connecticut was reassigned as flagship of the Second Battleship Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Hilary P. Jones.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was then picked up by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

Punjab went on to post a massive score of 231, the highest innings score of season. In 16 games he had the season's 3rd highest {{aggregate}} of 552 runs at an average of 34.50.|$|E
25|$|Three other SAAF Venturas flew supply {{missions}} to drop water, {{food and other}} emergency supplies. They often flew several flights a day to the survivors on the beach. At times they also dropped supplies to Captain Smith's land convoy on the way from Windhoek to the beach. On 8 December Captain Smith's land convoy reached Rocky Point and Sir Charles Elliots survivors and took them to a makeshift landing strip. There Lt Col PS Joubert landed a Ventura <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tug's surviving crew.|$|E
25|$|Leverock {{played with}} the Bermudian cricket team in their first ever One Day International when they played Canada on 17 May 2006. Leverock claimed one of Canada's wickets as Bermuda won the game by three wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method. He has since gone onto play for Bermuda in 11 ODIs, <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first five wicket haul by a Bermudian bowler in ODIs, when he took 5/53 against Kenya which he {{achieved}} by opening the bowling, no mean feat for a spin bowler.|$|E

When the student was to bring the aircraft out of its spin the rudders failed to respond and the engine ceased. At 400 metres altitude the student was ordered to parachute, while the aircraft regained control {{at the same moment}} the student, 2nd Lt. Follevåg, jumped. The instructor, 1st. Lt.

25|$|While working {{briefly in}} a {{department}} store, Cotten helped a child wandering through the aisles find her mother. The child was Penny Seeger, and the mother was the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger. Soon after this, Cotten again began working as a maid for Ruth Crawford Seeger and Charles Seeger and caring for their children, Mike, Peggy, Barbara, and Penny. While working with the Seegers (a voraciously musical family that included Pete Seeger, a son of Charles from a previous marriage) she remembered her own guitar playing from 40 years prior <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> instrument again and relearned to play it, almost from scratch.|$|E
25|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> skill quickly. (He also learned sword fighting, how to throw a javelin, camel riding, and rowing.) Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers. Among them were Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

25|$|On July 6, 2010, the Seattle Mariners trailed {{the visiting}} Kansas City Royals 3–2 in the 8th inning of a game. With runner Ichiro Suzuki on first {{base for the}} Mariners, Mariners {{designated}} hitter Russell Branyan hit a double down the right field line. As Royals outfielder David DeJesus attempted to make a play on the ball, a young fan reached onto the field <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball. The play was ruled an automatic double, and the umpires ruled that Branyan would take second base and that Ichiro would take third base, denying him a potential opportunity to score on the play. Both Ichiro and Branyan would be stranded on the bases, and the Royals held on for the 3–2 victory.|$|E
25|$|In the NLCS {{against the}} Atlanta Braves, Kim worked a {{scoreless}} inning in Game 2, {{in which the}} Diamondbacks lost. Kim then picked up saves in Games 4 and 5 for the Diamondbacks. Kim entered Game 4 in the 8th inning with the Diamondbacks leading 7-3. However, prior to Kim entering the game, The D-backs had worked themselves into a bases loaded jam with no one out. Kim pitched masterfully in the inning, ending the bases loaded jam with a double play and a lineout. He then retired the next three batters in the 9th inning <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> save. The next night, Kim pitched another two shut-out innings and earned the two-inning save that clinched the Diamondbacks’ ticket to the World Series. Kim became the first pitcher since Goose Gossage to earn two-inning saves on back-to-back days in the postseason. In the 2004 postseason, Houston Astros closer Brad Lidge matched Gossage and Kim's feat.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 1999, {{as part of}} a shakeup of the network's daytime {{and early}} morning {{schedules}} (in which NBC also cancelled NBC News at Sunrise – with newcomer Early Today replacing it as the network's early-morning newscast – <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> daytime talk show Later Today, a short-lived spinoff of Today), NBC announced that it would not renew Another World, ending the series' run after 35 years once the show's previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for Another World cancellation, one of the more notable events occurred in the summer of 1998: the network's San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) – at the time one of NBC's highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether, leaving Days of Our Lives and Sunset Beach as the only NBC soaps that the station cleared on its schedule; the move resulted in Another World being unavailable in around two million television households within the large San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, resulting in additional erosion of the program's already below-mediocre ratings (it was later picked up by smaller independent station KICU-TV).|$|E
