25|$|On August 31, 2006, Creative {{announced}} {{the availability of}} an upgraded player with 60GB capacity. This version has a USB host <b>adapter</b> <b>cable,</b> which enables users to transfer photos from a digital camera directly to the player. It is only available in black and white, and was initially slightly thicker than the 30GB model. On March 11, 2007, the 60GB model was upgraded with a new slimmer profile - the same thickness as the 30GB version.|$|E
2500|$|Tesla {{recommends}} {{that the primary}} method of charging be overnight charging at home, [...] "just like your mobile phone". Tesla Model S vehicles come with the Mobile Connector, which allows charging at up to 40 amps and includes adapters for connecting {{to a variety of}} electricity sources. In North America, adapters for 120-volt NEMA 5-15 and 240-volt NEMA 14-50 outlets, as well as an adapter for SAE J1772 charging stations, are included. In Europe, adapters for CEE red 3P+N+E, CEE blue 2P+E, CEE 7, and BS 1363 are available (inclusion varies by country), and an <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> for connecting to chargers with a Type 2 connector is also included.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of the TimeTrax {{controversy}} was the XM PCR: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of third party developers, who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them [...] from the XM company. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple <b>adapter</b> <b>cable.</b> Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software.|$|E

50|$|When {{attached}} to a PC, an OTG device requires a cable which has a USB Standard-A plug on one end and a micro-B plug on the other end. In order to attach a peripheral to an OTG device, the peripheral either needs a cable ending in a micro-A plug, which is inserted into the OTG device's micro-AB receptacle, or the OTG device itself needs an <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> with a micro-A plug on one end and a Standard-A receptacle on the other. The <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> enables any standard USB peripheral to be {{attached to}} an OTG device. Attaching two OTG devices together requires either a cable with a micro-B plug {{at one end and}} a micro-A plug at the other, or can be achieved using a combination of the PC cable and <b>adapter</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

Although they aided in making the machine more of a true portable, they were nonetheless bulky and heavy, and added more pieces {{that would have to}} be carried. <b>Adapter</b> <b>cables</b> were sold as well that allowed the Apple IIc to plug into an automobile's DC power cigarette lighter.|$|R
5000|$|The DMS-59 {{connector}} {{is used by}} AMD (AMD FireMV), Nvidia and Matrox {{for video}} cards sold in Lenovo Thinkcentres, Viglen Genies and Omninos, Dell, and HP computers. DMS-59 connectors also appeared on Sun Computers. Some confusion has been caused {{by the fact that}} vendors label cards with DMS-59 as [...] "supports DVI", but the cards have no DVI connectors built-in. Such cards, when equipped with only a VGA connector <b>adapter</b> <b>cable,</b> cannot be connected to a monitor with only a DVI-D input. A DMS-59 to DVI <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> needs to be used with such monitors.|$|E
50|$|After the RS-232 COM port {{was removed}} from most IBM PC {{compatible}} computers in the 2000s, an external USB-to-UART serial <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> was used {{to compensate for the}} loss. A major supplier of these chips is FTDI.|$|E

The same external connector is used for both protocols - when DVI/HDMI passive adapter is attached, the transmitter circuit switches to TDMS mode. DisplayPort Dual-mode ports and cables/adapters are typically marked with the DisplayPort++ logo. Thunderbolt ports with mDP connector also supports Dual-mode passive HDMI adapters/cables. Conversion to dual-link DVI and component video (VGA/YPbPr) requires active powered adapters.|$|R

5000|$|In model railways, the NTRAK Modular Railroading Society {{adopted the}} Powerpole PP30 {{connector}} as a recommend practice in 2005. {{and as a}} standard in 2011.

However, {{the owner of a}} module with Cinch-Jones plugs is now required to provide <b>adapter</b> <b>cables</b> to the newer standard.

50|$|The pin, PP, is {{also named}} plug present as the SAE J1772 example pinout {{describes}} the switch, S3, as being mechanically {{linked to the}} connector latch release actuator. During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP-PE loop via S3 and a 150 Ω R6; when opening the release actuator a 330 Ω R7 is added in the PP-PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift {{on the line to}} allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However many low power <b>adapter</b> <b>cables</b> do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.|$|R
50|$|Very short cables {{that connect}} {{relatively}} large jacks to smaller plugs allowing cables {{to be easily}} installed and removed from equipment with limited space available for connectors. The Chromecast device mentioned above, for example, comes with a short HDMI extension cable to allow its use in cramped quarters. Some devices come with a permanently attached length of cable that negates {{the need for a}} short <b>adapter</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even {{though this}} {{circular}} connector was largely standardized, {{there was no}} industry standard for pin assignments. Pin assignments to specific functions varied from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, in amateur radio, Icom, Kenwood, and Yaesu radios have all used the 8-pin screw-on connector, yet microphones from one brand are incompatible {{with the other two}} brands, at least without the use of an <b>adapter</b> <b>cable</b> in between the microphone and the radio.|$|E
