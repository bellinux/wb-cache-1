40|$|Multi-pinhole {{collimation}} is increasinly {{being used}} in SPECT imaging. A wide variety of geometric designs has recently been introduced, which can easily be modeled with the Monte Carlo simulator GATE. However multi-pinhole simulations are still very inefficient with GATE {{due to the lack}} of a dedicated variance reduction technique. In this work, we introduced a pinhole forced detection method which allows for fast 99 mTc GATE multi-pinhole simulations. An excellent agreement with <b>analog</b> <b>GATE</b> simulations was found in terms of spatial resolution, energy spectra, sensitivity and collimator penetration. As the collimator-detector response is modeled with full Monte Carlo - without making any assumptions on the detector configuration - our method can be of use in multipinhole collimator design, development of compensation methods and image reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|GEANT 4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) is a Geometry And Tracking 4 (GEANT 4) {{application}} toolkit {{for accurate}} simulation of {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanners. GATE simulations with realistic count levels are very CPU-intensive as they take up to several days with single-CPU computers. Therefore, we implemented both standard (FD) and convolution based forced detection (CFD) with multiple projection sampling (MPS) which allows the simulation of all projections simultaneously in GATE. In addition, a FD and CFD specialized Geant 4 navigator was developed to overcome the detailed but slow tracking algorithms in Geant 4. This paper is focussed on the implementation and validation of these aforementioned developments. The results show a good agreement between the FD and CFD versus <b>analog</b> <b>GATE</b> simulations.

40|$|Fan beam collimators {{can obtain}} a higher {{sensitivity}} without loss in resolution {{at the cost}} of a reduced field of view. The geometric response has been studied both analytically and with numerical and Monte Carlo simulations, but a fast and accurate Monte Carlo simulator for fan beam geometry is not available. The goal of this work is therefore to accelerate 99 mTc fan beam simulations in Gate, with full MC modeling of the collimator and detector in order to retain the characteristic hexagonal hole pattern of the collimator. To this end, two problems need to be solved: the long calculation time of particle transport in fan beam collimator geometry and the lack of dedicated variance reduction techniques. The first problem is solved by a dedicated tracking algorithm for fan beam collimator. The second problem is solved by the introduction of fan beam forced detection with variable solid angles. Our methods were validated with both <b>analog</b> <b>Gate</b> simulations and measurements. A good agreement was found for the hexagonal hole pattern, energy spectra, spatial resolution and sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{iterative}} reconstruction with Monte Carlo system modeling is {{an effective}} method in improving image quality in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, this approach is quite complex in case of human PET imaging due to the large memory requirements in storage and computaionally expensive simulation of the system matrix. To address these problems, we adapted a rotator based maximum likelihood expectation maximum (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and a fast Monte Carlo simulator. In this paper, a Gaussian rotator is used with the ML-EM algorithm. This algorithm enables the full utilization of the rotational symmetry to reduce the storage of the system matrix, {{as well as the}} simulation cost. The fast system matrix simulator is based on egs_pet, a Monte Carlo code using EGSnrc. For a brain-size field of view, the system matrix storage requirement is reduced by a factor of 131, 083 with regard to that of the full system matrix. This reduction is achieved by using symmetries and a sparse matrix representation. This enables the system matrix to reside in the main memory of a modern desktop. By combining the symmetry with the fast system matrix simulator, the simulation time is reduced by a factor of 9, 240 with regard to an <b>analog</b> <b>GATE</b> simulation. The quality of the reconstructed image was evaluated with the contrast recovery versus background noise. Significant improvements were found with regard to the standard ray-tracing ML-EM...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes an {{alternate}} {{paradigm for designing}} computers using continuous-time analog circuits. Digital computation sacrifices continuous degrees of freedom. A principled approach to recovering them is to view analog circuits as propagating probabilities in a message passing algorithm. Within this framework, analog continuous-time circuits can perform robust, programmable, high-speed, low-power, cost-effective, statistical signal processing. This methodology will have broad application to systems which can benefit from low-power, high-speed signal processing and offers the possibility of adaptable/programmable high-speed circuitry at frequencies where digital circuitry would be cost and power prohibitive. Many problems must be solved before the new design methodology can {{be shown to be}} useful in practice: Continuous-time signal processing is not well understood. Analog computational circuits known as "soft-gates" have been previously proposed, but a complementary set of analog memory circuits is still lacking. Analog circuits are usually tunable, rarely reconfigurable, but never programmable. The thesis develops an understanding of the convergence and synchronization of statistical signal processing algorithms in continuous time, and explores the use of linear and nonlinear circuits for analog memory. An exemplary embodiment called the Noise Lock Loop (NLL) using these design primitives is demonstrated to perform direct-sequence spread-spectrum acquisition and tracking functionality and promises order-of-magnitude wins over digital implementations. A building block for the construction of programmable <b>analog</b> <b>gate</b> arrays, the "soft-multiplexer" is also proposed. by Benjamin Vigoda. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Based on {{explicit}} numerical constructions for Kolmogorov’s superpositions (KS) linear size circuits implementing arbitrary Boolean functions (BFs) are possible. Because classical Boolean {{as well as}} {{threshold logic}} (TL) implementations, require exponential size in the worst case, it follows that, size-optimal solutions for implementing arbitrary BFs should rely (at least partly) on KS-inspired gates (KGs). In this paper, we examine BFs of three inputs in detail and show that even the size given by KS can be reduced when Boolean gates (BGs) could be optimally combined with KGs (low precision <b>analog</b> <b>gates).</b> This shows that {{there is room for}} improving on the synthesis of BFs. Finally, we will show that the size obtained when optimally combining BGs and KGs can be reduced even further if we are allowed to also use TL gates. Such systematic size reductions could help alleviate the challenging power consumption problem. They advocate for the design of KGs, {{as well as for the}} development of the theory, the algorithms, and the CAD tools that could take advantage of optimal combinations of different logic gates and design styles...|$|R

Biological and cognitive perspectives are important among these, but in this book we focus on mathematical perspectives, from w hich these netw orks appear as purely formal systems. Throughout the history of the neural networks field, broadly construed, major turning points have been marked by developments of a primarily mathematical nature: consider how the field was changed forever by the work of McCulloch and Pitts, Rosenblatt, Minsky and Papert, Grossberg, Kohonen, Hopfield, the development of the Boltzmann and back-propagation learning algorithms, and many other equally important formal advances. Mathematical perspectives have been central to the field from its inception. To say w e are limiting ourselves in this book to mathematical perspectives is not at all to say that we are operating within narrow boundaries.

The mechanism for clock feedthrough and a related model of a transmission gate switch are established in the current-voltage domain. A region map is developed for the TG switch during the period when both devices are turned off. The region map is further divided into zones. From these region and zone maps, the sign and relative magnitude of the clock feedthrough noise can be efficiently estimated for different signal levels. Placing the input voltage near half of the power supply voltage is a useful technique for minimizing clock feedthrough noise.

After investigating integrated schemes for DC-DC converters to generate the necessary voltages on chip, this research focuses on charge pumps that are integrated into the programming structure of floating-gate circuits. The impact of this research is far reaching since programmability is an indispensable feature of analog floating-gate circuits.

Specific mutations of this isoform may impair gating behavior of the channel resulting in several pain syndromes. In addition to channel mutations, similar or opposite changes in gating may be produced by spider and scorpion toxins binding to different parts of the voltage-gated sodium channel. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of the alpha-scorpion toxin OD 1 and 2 synthetic toxin <b>analogs</b> on the <b>gating</b> properties of the Na(v) 1. 7 sodium channel.

The core imager performs computations at the pixel plane, but still has a fill-factor of 46 percent - comparable to the high fill-factors of APS imagers. The processing is performed continuously on the image via programmable matrix operations that can operate on the entire image or blocks within the image.
