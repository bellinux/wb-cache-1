5|$|Born in the New South Wales bush town of Cobar on 8 December 1914, Toshack {{was one of}} five {{children}} born to a stationmaster. Orphaned {{at the age of}} six, he was raised by relatives in Lyndhurst in the northwest of the state, and played his early cricket and rugby league for Cowra.

However, the town's doctor, <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>community</b> leader, advised that they were targeting the wrong sport, and the two boys followed his recommendation.

As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E

5|$|Under the magnates {{were the}} barons, who held {{increasingly}} nominal feudal tenures of which an important vestige {{was the right}} to hold baronial courts, which could deal with both matters of land ownership and interpersonal offences, including minor acts of violence. Also important were the local tenants-in-chief, who held legally held their land directly from the king and who by this period were often the major local landholders in an area. In this period, as feudal distinctions declined, the barons and tenants-in-chief merged {{to form a new}} identifiable group, the lairds. This group was roughly equivalent to the English gentlemen. Just as the magnates saw themselves as the king's natural counsellors, so the lairds advised and exerted influence over the dukes and earls. The lairds were often the most important individual in <b>a</b> <b>local</b> <b>community.</b> They ran baronial courts, acted as sheriffs-depute, sat on local assizes and were called in as private arbitrators. In the course of the sixteenth century they would acquire a role in national politics, gaining representation in Parliament and playing {{a major role in the}} Reformation crisis of 1560. As a result of the Reformation and the creation of a Presbyterian Kirk, their position in local society was enhanced. They often gained the new status of elder and greater oversight of the behaviour of the local population through the disciplinary functions of kirk sessions.|$|E
