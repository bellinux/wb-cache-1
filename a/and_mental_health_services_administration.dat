25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E

Furthermore, research in other Western countries on > Korean migrants show that they underutilise <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> when compared to other Asian groups. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten members from the local Korean community which explored their experiences <b>and</b> attitudes towards <b>mental</b> illness <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in New Zealand. Through thematic analysis common themes and patterned responses were identified. Some identified themes were: cultural barriers, language barriers and lack of information on <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services.</b> The most influential factor was found to be Korean cultural values being in conflict with the general understanding of <b>mental</b> illness <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in New Zealand.

40|$|The homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> {{systems are}} {{separate}} service structures in Australia. They {{have their own}} unique funding and governance arrangements and work in separate domains. The homelessness service system fits largely within a community services support framework, while drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> are embedded within their respective health systems. Despite {{the fact that the}} homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> systems are separate, they share many of the same clients and address similar problems among clients. Homelessness services, for example, provide support to clients who also have drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> needs. Therefore, the homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> systems interact. Service integration and effective working relationships between services across the homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> systems is, a priori, critical in achieving good outcomes for clients wherever they may be located. Service integration has become a point of policy focus in recent years. Despite the focus on systems and service integration in the present policy environment and among practitioners, there has been no study, as far as we are aware, of the integration of homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> in Australia that also considers the perspective of clients. This study aims to fill this critical gap in the literature. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to increase our understanding of the extent and ways in which homelessness, drug <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>services</b> are working together to provide services to clients with particular emphasis on the needs of homeless people. The study also considers the barriers, costs and benefits of service integration and the perceived effectiveness of various integrated service delivery responses. It focuses at both the service level and at the level of the client and addresses the question as to client perceptions of the integration of services and the effectiveness of the services they are receiving...|$|R
