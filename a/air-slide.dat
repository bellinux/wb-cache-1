50|$|The main {{carburettor}} types {{commonly associated}} with Amal are slide carburettors for motorcycles. These were historically distinguishable as two types: the Monobloc with integral, offset float chamber and Concentric, a later development with repositioned float chamber directly under the body and <b>air-slide.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Bulk Cargo Terminal handles {{bulk cargo}} like bulk cement, furnace slag, copper slag and liquid bulk. Jurong Port has a {{dedicated}} common-user facility to handle bulk cement. This Cement Terminal {{is one of}} the world's largest common-user cement facilities and consists of two dedicated berths equipped with three cement screw unloaders linked to a fully enclosed <b>air-slide,</b> non-pollutive conveyor system. Jurong Port handles more than 90% of cement throughput into Singapore.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an <b>air-slide</b> pneumatic conveying system depends, first of all, on several basic elements chosen or calculated during {{the design of}} a plant: <b>air-slide</b> design parameters, air mover characteristics, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the material to be transported. However, during the exploitation of this type of system which is used for handling ash in thermal-power plants, either gradual and/or sudden changes in the operating conditions can arise. This may be due to changes both in the proportion of ash content, and in the flow characteristics of the porous membrane. The consequences of changes in these conditions on the performance of the ash handling system are analyzed, based upon the results of the experimental work carried out on the test rig at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Belgrade, and upon the on-site measurements at the thermal-power plant "Nikola Tesla B"...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The way of dry-mixed mortar <b>air-sliding</b> {{has many}} advantages，such as {{improving}} transport efficiency, ensuring cement quality. But, dry-mixed mortar <b>air-sliding</b> may occur segregate, this phenomenon serious break the original ratio of cement, risking quality of cement [2]. This article suggested {{a new model}} of discharge opening with multi-holes, this model can allow dry-mixed mortar flow out at different height, and control the rate of flux in each port to keep mortar equally, this model eliminated the non uniforms caused by different height, eliminated the affection of segregate, ensure the quality of the cement...|$|R
40|$|Air-gravity conveyors, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>air-slides,</b> are widely used in industry to convey bulk materials with the advantages of low particle velocities, low levels of particle attrition, potentially very high conveying rates and low power consumption. Most current designs are based on empirical design charts and past experience as there have been relatively few investigations attempting to model the flow of aerated powders on air-gravity conveyor systems. In this paper, ANSYS FLUENT has been used to simulate the air-gravity flow, where a steady, three-dimensional fluidized granular flow is considered in a rectangular channel having frictional side walls for different flow conditions. The results of simulated bed heights along the air-gravity channel are discussed. Moreover, this paper reports on work which attempts to develop a fundamental conveying model for air-gravity conveyor flows in inclined channels with an emphasis on the conservation of momentum taking into account the rheology of the gas-solid mixture. The conveying model shows the relationship between mass flow rate and bed height. The developed model well predicts the steady flow bed heights for each mass flow rate. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out which demonstrates that the conveying model can be applied to powders in a fluidized state to predict the bed heights of the flow under inclination angles between 1 ° to 10 °...|$|R
40|$|This program {{demonstrated}} the technical feasibility of constructing large-stroke magnetic suspensions that {{can meet the}} active vibration isolation requirements of Space Station. These requirements include: (1) strokes over 1 cm in all directions, (2) actuator bandwidths over 100 Hz, (3) isolator roll-off frequencies below 10 (exp - 2) Hertz, and (4) force capability over 1 Newton in all axes. The 100 Hz actuator bandwidth allows the suspension to reject any direct force disturbances that act on the microgravity experiment, for example forces created by cable connections. The low isolator roll-off frequency and large stroke allow the magnetic suspension to isolate the microgravity experiment from Space Station vibrations above the roll-off frequency. The capability to meet these requirements was demonstrated by designing, constructing and testing a six-degree-of-freedom, prototype magnetic suspension system that featured high-performance, Lorentz-force actuators and full multi-input, multi-output control. This prototype suspension is designed to isolate large orbiter locker experiments under typical spacecraft constraints of size, weight, and power. Suspension in the full six-degrees-of-freedom was successfully demonstrated in this program while using a gravity-force unload mechanism to simulate a space environment. The prototype isolator is capable of space-based isolation service with relatively minor modification. The use of advanced, nonlinear control algorithms were investigated on a specially designed single-degree-of-freedom testbed. This low acceleration test facility simulates the Space Station vibration isolation problem in a single horizontal axis with low-friction, <b>air-slide</b> support. This allowed testing at the desired microgravity levels, without the gravity bias effects that are seen in a full six-degrees-of-freedom suspension. Precision components were used to reduce residual accelerations to microgravity levels so {{that the effects of}} sensor, actuator, and electronic noise could be evaluated. During the Phase 2 program, this testbed was used to demonstrate the advantages of nonlinear control algorithms to provide increased vibration isolation performance...|$|E
