500|$|The Gospel of Matthew relates {{that when}} {{told his mother}} and {{brothers}} were waiting to see him, Jesus replied, [...] "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?" [...] Stretching {{his hand over his}} disciples he said, [...] "Here are my mother and my brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> and mother." [...] Pope Benedict XVI stated that this dictum of Jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level. By doing God's will, any person can become part of the universal family of Jesus. Thus, the fourth commandment's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for [...] "legitimate social authorities". The Catechism specifies [...] "duties of citizens and nations", which Kreeft summarizes as: ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this not very common scene was a reference to the defeat in 324 by the Emperor Constantine I of his co-emperor Licinius, who was killed in 325 after a period under close guard. [...] Another suggestion is that the colour change from green to red was understood as evoking the ripening of red grapes, so that there was a particular suitability in depicting a scene with the god of wine. [...] The cup may have been intended for use at Bacchic cult celebrations, still very much a feature of Roman religious life around 300. [...] A letter supposedly from the Emperor Hadrian (d. 138) to his brother-in-law Servianus, quoted in a biography in the Historia Augusta, records the gift of two dichroic cups, which the 4th century author had seen: [...] "I have sent you particoloured cups that change colour, presented to me by the priest of a temple. They are specially dedicated to you <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister.</b> I would like you to use them at banquets on feast days." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was five}} feet nine {{inches tall and}} was always very slender so that he {{appeared}} taller than he was actually…he had been a gymnast and the muscles of his arms and back stood out like ropes. [...] He was soft spoke and agreeable, yet, {{there was always a}} certain reserve. He was modest, honest, and true. He spoke well of others. As a boy he had gone to church twice on Sundays, once in the morning and once in the evening. He visited the sick and aged. [...] He loved games. He was an avid hunter and fisherman. [...] He was first a cavalryman before he became a flyer and he enjoyed riding and polo. In San Antonio, he had three polo ponies. I was never allowed to ride them, presumably because I would spoil them. He did, however, teach me to ride other horses, to swim, to golf, and to play baseball. [...] He enjoyed music and we sang on long automobile trips when he changed station from one Army post to another, my father and mother in the front seat <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister,</b> Barbara, and I in the back. [...] His posture was firmly erect and he possessed a cold courage that was remarkable. Beneath the calm exterior lay the competitiveness and combativeness fostered by the severe training at West Point.|$|E
2500|$|Amina and Sarah Said {{were the}} {{children}} of Egyptian immigrant Yaser Abdel Said and American Patricia [...] "Tissie" [...] Owens. Both girls were born in Dallas, Texas, Amina on March 2, 1989, and Sarah on March 16, 1990. The girls were found {{shot to death in}} a taxi at the Omni Mandalay Hotel in Irving, Texas, on January 1, 2008. Both girls had left their home in Lewisville, Texas, earlier that evening, with their father Yaser Said. At 7:33 pm CT a call came into the Irving Police Department’s 911 call center. The call was from Sarah Said. She had been shot nine times and told the operator, “My dad shot me <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>sister.</b> I’m dying!” Their mother, Patricia Said, claims that both girls were killed for having non-Muslim boyfriends. Death threats had been made by Yaser against the girls. They ran away and were safe, but their mother brought them back. Yaser Said is still at large, as a FBI Top Ten Fugitive, at the present time the FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Said has been featured on America's Most Wanted as well as on a Fox News special about honor killings in America; he is also the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. [...] He is 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighs about 180 pounds, and almost always wears sunglasses, both indoors and outside. Said almost always carries a weapon, including knives, and is considered armed and extremely dangerous.|$|E
