500|$|On 29 June 1958, Pelé {{became the}} {{youngest}} player {{to play in a}} World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E

Richard's treatment of Henry's body in the final scene {{is another example of}} the lack of reverence for the dead; after Henry's death, Richard stabs the corpse, proclaiming [...] "Down, down to hell, <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> sent thee hither" [...] (5.6.67).|$|E

After being drafted by the Rangers, Dickey was {{initially}} offered a signing bonus of $825,000, before a Rangers team physician saw Dickey's throwing (right) arm hanging oddly in a picture of him with other Team USA players in Baseball America. The Rangers subsequently did further evaluation of Dickey, leading to the discovery of a missing ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow joint, and reduced their offer to $75,000. [...] Dickey has been quoted as saying, [...] "Doctors look at me <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't be able to turn a doorknob without feeling pain," [...] making his ability to pitch somewhat remarkable.|$|E
2500|$|Often they {{incorporate}} text {{as well as}} image, {{although some}} bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to {{the speed at which}} she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with Lynn Barber, Emin said, [...] "It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it." ...|$|E

Jarrett started off 2008 with a 16th-place finish at Daytona. He retired from points racing after the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. At the weekend's pre-race driver's meeting, {{he spoke to the}} other drivers, saying [...] "Enjoy this. We all have our time in this, and mine has been fantastic.

The trial was adjourned to 28 October, when Kelly was presented on the charge {{of the murder of}} Sergeant Kennedy, Constable Scanlan and Lonigan, the various bank robberies, the murder of Sherritt, resisting arrest at Glenrowan and with a long list of minor charges. He was convicted of the willful murder of Constable Lonigan and was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Barry.

2500|$|Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao, after {{negotiations}} {{spread over}} a number of years, on May 2, 2015, inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Mayweather dictated the pace early, controlling range with the jab. His deft movement and pivoting made Pacquiao, who landed only 19% of his punches, consistently miss. Mayweather was able to counter Pacquiao with his right hand constantly throughout the fight and won via unanimous decision with the scorecards reading 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112. The vast majority of media outlets (16/18) scored the bout in his favor. In the days following the fight, many casual observers felt the match {{failed to live up to}} expectations. Pacquiao told the media after the match that he was limited in the fight due to an injured right arm. Sports Illustrated reported that Pacquiao fought through a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder, which will require surgery. Bob Arum revealed Pacquiao's injury to have been a persistent one dating back to 2008. Additionally Pacquiao's camp never requested a cortisone injection, which is allowed by the US Anti-Doping Agency, but rather a last minute toradol injection, which was declined by the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Mayweather, who originally had no plans on a rematch with Pacquiao, told ESPN's Stephen A. Smith in a text that he would be open to a rematch after Pacquiao recovers from shoulder surgery, however as of May 9, 2015, Mayweather stated [...] "Did I text Stephen A. Smith <b>and</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> will fight him again? Yeah, but I change my mind. At this particular time, no, because he's a sore loser and he's a coward." [...] On July 6, 2015, the World Boxing Organization (WBO) stripped Mayweather of his welterweight championship on technical grounds.|$|E
