5|$|Later that night, Detweiler {{arrives at}} a vet's office to get tranquilizers and leaves. The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the Dhole but he locks the room before it can cause <b>any</b> <b>harm.</b> The dog catchers arrive and open fire on the wrong dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing that the dog can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} first chat with Manning, Lamo {{discussed}} the information with Chet Uber of the volunteer group ProjectVIGILANT, which researches cybercrime, and with Timothy Webster, {{a friend who had}} worked in Army counterintelligence. Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo that the government had months to ameliorate <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E
5|$|The Book of the Dead {{developed}} from {{a tradition of}} funerary manuscripts {{dating back to the}} Egyptian Old Kingdom. The first funerary texts were the Pyramid Texts, first used in the Pyramid of King Unas of the 5th dynasty, around 2400 BCE. These texts were written {{on the walls of the}} burial chambers within pyramids, and were exclusively for the use of the Pharaoh (and, from the 6th dynasty, the Queen). The Pyramid Texts were written in an unusual hieroglyphic style; many of the hieroglyphs representing humans or animals were left incomplete or drawn mutilated, most likely to prevent them causing <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> to the dead pharaoh. The purpose of the Pyramid Texts was to help the dead King take his place amongst the gods, in particular to reunite him with his divine father Ra; at this period the afterlife was seen as being in the sky, rather than the underworld described in the Book of the Dead. Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramid Texts ceased to be an exclusively royal privilege, and were adopted by regional governors and other high-ranking officials.|$|E
50|$|Cancer {{screening}} aims {{to detect}} cancer before symptoms appear. This may involve blood tests, urine tests, other tests, or medical imaging. The benefits of screening {{in terms of}} cancer prevention, early detection and subsequent treatment must be weighed against <b>any</b> <b>harms.</b>|$|R

We captured wild sables {{with the traditional}} Chinese traps {{and there were no}} <b>any</b> <b>harms</b> for sables during the process. All of the methods for catching and feeding this endangered animal were estimated and permitted by The Wild Protection and Nature Reserve Management of the State Forestry Administration of the People’s Republic of China.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{antibiotics}} act by inhibiting translation. These include anisomycin, cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, streptomycin, erythromycin, and puromycin. Prokaryotic ribosomes {{have a different}} structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes, and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> to a eukaryotic host's cells.|$|E

25|$|Sinclair {{pleaded not}} guilty to rape and murder. At the {{commencement}} of the trial diet Sinclair lodged two special defences, one of consent and one of incrimination, stating that any sexual activity between him and the two girls had been consensual, and that if they had come to <b>any</b> <b>harm,</b> the person responsible was Gordon Hamilton.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} {{today that he}} was a hereditary chief of the Comanche, and for decades the US and Mexican victims of his raids considered him a supernatural being because of his seeming invulnerability to <b>any</b> <b>harm.</b> Members of the Rangers, posses and the military on various occasions insisted that they shot the chief dead center without harming him.|$|E
25|$|A {{workplace}} bully or abuser {{will often}} have issues with social functioning. These {{types of people}} often have psychopathic traits {{that are difficult to}} identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> was done.|$|E

25|$|Singapore is {{relatively}} safe from seismic {{activity in the}} region, as the nearest major active faults (Sumatran fault and Sunda megathrust fault) are hundreds of kilometres away in Indonesia. However, the population and buildings are prone to being only very slightly affected by any activity as tremors, which is not uncommon, but generally does not do <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> and is limited to small amounts of swaying or vibration of objects.|$|E
25|$|None of {{the rest}} of the Confederate {{flotilla}} did <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> to the Union fleet, and most of them were sunk, either by enemy action or by their own hands. The survivors, in addition to McRae, were CSS Jackson, ram Defiance, and transport Diana. Two unarmed tenders were surrendered to the mortar flotilla with the forts. Louisiana also survived the battle, but was scuttled rather than be surrendered.|$|E

2500|$|Previously, the CIA and the Army had {{actively}} {{and successfully}} sought to withhold incriminating information, {{even as they}} secretly provided compensation to the families. One subject of Army drug experimentation, James Stanley, an Army sergeant, brought an important, albeit unsuccessful, suit. The government argued that Stanley was barred from suing under a legal doctrine—known as the Feres doctrine, after a 1950 Supreme Court case, Feres v. United States—that prohibits members of the Armed Forces from suing the government for <b>any</b> <b>harms</b> that were inflicted [...] "incident to service." ...|$|R
25|$|Koteshwar Temple. This temple is a 700-year-old {{temple of}} Lord Shiva whose shivling was on Gwalior Fort, {{but when the}} Mughals conquered it they ordered the shivling thrown out. When the troops did that, the shivling was {{automatically}} established in a field below the fort without <b>any</b> <b>harm.</b> Muslim Gazi told the emperor not to harm the shivling. In the late 18th century Scindias built a temple for that shivling, now known as Koteshwar Mahadev.|$|E
25|$|Queen Meenakshi {{required}} him to swear on the Koran that he would adhere faithfully to his engagement, and he accordingly took an oath on a brick {{wrapped up in the}} spledid covering usually reserved for that holy book.

25|$|In November 1969, Roy Norris {{was arrested}} for his first known sexual offenses: {{he was charged with}} both rape and assault with attempt to commit rape. In the latter incident, he had {{attempted}} to force his way into the car of a lone woman. Three months later, in February 1970, Norris attempted to deceive a lone woman into allowing him to enter her home. When the woman refused, he attempted to break into her house; the woman phoned the police, who arrested Norris before he had the opportunity to cause the woman <b>any</b> <b>harm.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} the Armada {{effectively}} ceded the naval initiative to England who were still able to launch expeditions to Spain without much hindrance. For {{the first time in}} English naval history, effective offshore blockades were launched with expeditions such as one led by William Monson and Richard Leveson most notably off Sesimbra in 1602. They could also defend the Channel when some months later a Spanish fleet of Galleys was defeated by an Anglo Dutch force. It was only until peace was settled that Spain could spare <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> on its colonies and its merchant ships from England's seas dogs.|$|E
25|$|These {{security}} breaches led to {{a class-action}} lawsuit against Blizzard in November 2012, claiming {{that the company was}} making a profit from the sale of Authenticator devices rather than using the money to enhance the security of their own servers, and that they failed to notify affected users about the August data breach in a timely manner. Most of the claims in the suit were summarily dismissed in favor of Blizzard in July 2013, primarily as the plaintiffs could not show <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> they suffered from these breaches, and the remaining claims related to Battle.net Authenticator promotional claims were resolved through mediation. The case was ultimately closed in February 2014.|$|E
25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, he {{must not}} leave the scene until {{it is necessary to}} call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This {{can be as simple as}} a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for <b>any</b> <b>harm</b> to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E
