25|$|On 4 October 2010, in {{a speech}} at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Osborne {{announced}} a cap on the overall <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> a family can receive from the state, estimated to be around £500 a week from 2013. It was estimated that this could result in 50,000 unemployed families losing an average of £93 a week. He also announced that he would end the universal entitlement to child benefit, and that from 2013 the entitlement would be removed from people paying the 40% and 50% income tax rates.|$|E
2500|$|McCain {{initially}} {{opposed the}} Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act, introduced by Senator Jim Webb, which provides college-tuition benefits for veterans {{in a manner}} similar to that of the original G.I. Bill for veterans of World War II. McCain supported the contention of some in the Defense Department that the original bill's provision of offering four years of full college tuition after only three years of active duty service would entice service members to leave the military sooner than they otherwise might. McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham instead introduced a competing bill, that sought to improve current Montgomery G.I. Bill benefits, but provided a lower total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> than what Webb proposed. McCain's proposal emphasized benefits for service members who were still active. McCain said: [...] McCain's alternative would have had a sliding scale of benefits to encourage retention by only offering the top level of benefits to those who stay for six years. McCain also argued that his version would involve less new bureaucracy than Webb's bill. A late May vote on the Webb bill passed 75–22, with McCain missing the vote due to being away from Washington.|$|E
