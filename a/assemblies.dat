5|$|Caesar held {{both the}} {{dictatorship}} and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48 BC, Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, {{gave him the}} power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46 BC, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his own partisans. Caesar then raised {{the membership of the}} Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. While the <b>assemblies</b> continued to meet, he submitted all candidates to the <b>assemblies</b> for election, and all bills to the <b>assemblies</b> for enactment. Thus, the <b>assemblies</b> became powerless and were unable to oppose him.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Assemblies</b> of God USA (AG), officially the General Council of the <b>Assemblies</b> of God, is a Pentecostal Christian {{denomination}} in the United States {{founded in}} 1914 {{during a meeting}} of Pentecostal ministers at Hot Springs, Arkansas. It is the U.S. branch of the World <b>Assemblies</b> of God Fellowship, the world's largest Pentecostal body.

5|$|Caesar then {{increased}} the number of magistrates who were elected each year, which created a large pool of experienced magistrates, and allowed Caesar to reward his supporters. Caesar even took steps to transform Italy into a province, and to more tightly link the other provinces of the empire into a single, cohesive unit. This process, of ossifying the entire Roman Empire into a single unit, rather than maintaining it as a network of unequal principalities, would ultimately be completed by Caesar's successor, the emperor Augustus. When Caesar returned to Rome in 47 BC, he raised the senate's membership to 900. While the Roman <b>assemblies</b> continued to meet, Caesar submitted all candidates to the <b>assemblies</b> for election, and all bills to the <b>assemblies</b> for enactment, which caused the <b>assemblies</b> to become powerless and unable to oppose him. To minimize the risk that another general might attempt to challenge him, Caesar passed a law which subjected governors to term limits. Near the end of his life, Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome might limit his ability to install his own Consuls, he passed a law which allowed him to appoint all magistrates in 43 BC, and all Consuls and Tribunes in 42 BC. This, in effect, transformed the magistrates from being representatives of the people to being representatives of the Dictator, and robbed the popular <b>assemblies</b> of much of their remaining influence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{instruct}} on-site workers {{to accomplish the}} <b>assembly</b> job fast and exactly, improve the <b>assembly</b> quality and efficiency, we proposed a management method for <b>assembly</b> technical annotation in 3 D <b>assembly</b> instruction. This method maps 3 D technical annotations to <b>assembly</b> operation and <b>assembly</b> time based on time sequence granularity, achieves the goal of showing <b>assembly</b> technical annotations based on <b>assembly</b> process. We demonstrated {{the effectiveness of this}} method with a satellite antenna feed componentâ€™s <b>assembly</b> process instance. The instance shows that this method can mark <b>assembly</b> technical annotations based on <b>assembly</b> process, and show the annotations in time sequence but not in <b>assembly</b> space. This will help on-site <b>assembly</b> workers to understand the <b>assembly</b> order fast and unambiguously, finish the <b>assembly</b> operations correctly...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Assemblies</b> of God has {{released}} statements on various issues not {{addressed in the}} Statement of Fundamental Truths. These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission, a standing committee of the General Council, which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery. Position papers are not official positions of the <b>Assemblies</b> of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery {{and approved by the}} General Council. Position statements touch on biblical, theological, and social concerns.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Assemblies</b> of God {{operates}} Gospel Publishing House, {{located in}} Springfield, Missouri, which publishes books, curriculum, and church ministry resources primarily for Pentecostals and charismatics, {{but also for}} the general evangelical market. The <b>Assemblies</b> of God publishes an official weekly magazine, the Pentecostal Evangel, and Enrichment Journal, a resource for Pentecostal ministers.|$|E
5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation {{of what it}} was to be Pentecostal. The <b>Assemblies</b> of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). On the local level, <b>Assemblies</b> of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal <b>Assemblies</b> of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E

5|$|While doctrinal {{controversy}} led to {{the withdrawal}} of ministers, the fellowship experienced growth in subsequent years. District councils were organized in various {{regions of the country}} and, where these did not exist, home missionary fields were designated to maximize evangelistic efforts. In 1917, W. Jethro Walthall led his Holiness Baptist Association of southwestern Arkansas into the <b>Assemblies</b> of God. District councils and missionary stations were established outside the U.S. also. By 1921, there were districts in Canada (see Pentecostal <b>Assemblies</b> of Canada), China, Japan (see Japan <b>Assemblies</b> of God), India (see <b>Assemblies</b> of God in India), and Egypt. Central Bible College was started {{in the basement of the}} Central Assembly of God church in Springfield, Missouri, in 1922. In 1929, the fellowship claimed 91,981 members in 1,612 churches.|$|E
5|$|With the 1834 {{constitutional}} amendment {{known as the}} Additional Act, Provincial General Councils were supplanted by the Assembleias Legislativas Provinciais (Provincial Legislative <b>Assemblies).</b> The new <b>Assemblies</b> enjoyed much greater autonomy from the national government. A Provincial Assembly was composed of 36, 28 or 20 elected deputies, the number {{depending on the size}} of the province's population. The election of provincial deputies followed the same procedure as used to elect general deputies to the national Chamber of Deputies.|$|E
5|$|A {{primary reason}} the General Council {{was formed in}} 1914 was to create {{cooperation}} in Pentecostal missionary work.

Missionary work outside of the United States is overseen by <b>Assemblies</b> of God World Missions. As of December 2009, AG World Missions was reporting 2,719 personnel worldwide.

5|$|After {{devolution}} {{began to}} take place {{in other parts of the}} United Kingdom it was planned that referendums for the regions of England would take place for their own elected regional <b>assemblies</b> as a counterweight.

However, when the proposal was rejected by the northern England devolution referendums, 2004 in the North East, further referendums were cancelled.
