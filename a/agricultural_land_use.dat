40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} forest {{conversion}} to <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> on assemblages of aquatic insects were analyzed in subtropical streams. Organisms and environmental variables {{were collected in}} six low-order streams: three streams located in a forested area, and three in areas converted to <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> We expected that the aquatic insects’ assemblage attributes would be significantly affected by forest conversion, {{as well as by}} environmental variables. Streams in converted areas presented lower species richness, abundance and proportion of sensitive insect taxa. The ANOSIM test evidenced strong difference in EPT assemblage structure between streams of forested and converted areas. The ISA test evidenced several EPT genera with high specificity to streams in forested areas and only one genus related to streams in converted areas. Thus, the impacts of the conversion of forested area to <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> have significantly affected the EPT assemblages, while environmental variables were not affected. We suggest that the effects detected can be influenced by two processes related to vegetation cover: i) lower input of allochthonous material, andii) increased input of fine sediments in streams draining converted areas...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{contribution}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> to biodiversity conservation is of utmost importance. With 38 % of earth's ice free land surface covered by crops and pastures, studying and understanding the potential conservation value of these lands is critical {{for the future of}} conservation strategies, particularly in biodiversity conservation hotspots such as Central America. My research focused on understanding {{the contribution}} of different <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and a forest fragment to bird conservation in a Costa Rican landscape. The study region is located {{at the heart of the}} Volcanica Central Talamanca Biological Corridor (VCTBC), a nation al conservation strategy aiming at reconnecting the Volcanica Central and the Talamanca Mountain Ranges. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are based on seven years of bird capture data produce d by long-term mist-netting stations operating in eight different <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> seven <b>agricultural</b> and a forest fragment. Chapter 1 comprises lessons learned during seven years of mist-netting efforts in eight <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> following a management intensity gradient. Chapter 2 focuses on bird community stability, stability understood as no changes from year to year in mean species richness and abundance of either the total population, or of resident and migratory species over a seven year period. Chapter 3 is based on an experimental study focusing on the effect of bird species in the suppression of the Coffee Berry Borer (Hypothenemus hampei), one of the most detrimental coffee pests worldwide. Results from our research highlights the importance of including <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> in biodiversity conservation planning. Agroforestry systems particularly showed potential for bird conservation in agricultural landscapes while fostering stable bird communities that are closer in composition to our reference forest fragment. Additionally, our results also showed that our landscape is capable of supporting bird species providing important pest control services. Finally, despite the value of <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> our results also highlight that our forest fragment fosters unique bird communities when compared to <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands.</b> Conservation planning at the landscape level should considered the uniqueness of these habitats and integrate efforts to conserve forests and managed <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> for biodiversity conservation, particularly in these human-dominated landscapes.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} whether arthropod richness and abundance for combined taxa, feeding guilds and broad taxonomic groups {{respond in a}} globally consistent manner {{to a range of}} agricultural land-use and management intensification scenarios. Location: Mixed land-use agricultural landscapes, globally. Methods: We performed a series of meta-analyses using arthropod richness and abundance data derived from the published literature. Richness and abundance were compared among <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> that commonly occur in agricultural landscapes and that represent a gradient of increasing intensification. These included land-use comparisons, such as wooded native vegetation compared with improved pasture, and a management comparison, reduced-input cropping compared with conventional cropping. Data were analysed using three different meta-analytical techniques, including a simple vote counting method and a formal fixed-effects/random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Arthropod richness was significantly higher in areas of less intensive <b>land</b> <b>use.</b> The decline in arthropod richness was greater between native vegetation and <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> than among different <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> These patterns were evident for all taxa combined, predators and decomposers, but not herbivorous taxa. Overall, arthropod abundance was greater in native vegetation than in <b>agricultural</b> <b>lands</b> and under reduced-input cropping compared with conventional cropping. Again, this trend was largely mirrored by predators and decomposers, but not herbivores. Main conclusions: The greater arthropod richness found in native vegetation relative to <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> types indicates that in production landscapes still containing considerable native vegetation, retention of that vegetation may well be the most effective method of conserving arthropod biodiversity. Conversely, in highly intensified agricultural landscapes with little remaining native vegetation, the employment of reduced-input crop management and the provision of relatively low-intensity <b>agricultural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> such as pasture, may prove effective in maintaining arthropod diversity, and potentially in promoting functionally important groups such as predators and decomposers...|$|R
