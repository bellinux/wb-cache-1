40|$|In {{advanced}} indirectly fired {{coal combustion}} systems and externally fired combined cycle concepts, ceramic heat exchangers {{are required to}} transfer heat from the hot combustion gases to the clean air that drives the gas turbines. For high efficiencies, {{the temperature of the}} turbine inlet needs to exceed 1, 100 C and <b>preferably</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 1, 260 C. The heat exchangers will operate under pressure and experience thermal and mechanical stresses during heating and cooling, and some transients will be severe under upset conditions. Silicon carbide-matrix composites appear promising for such applications because of their high strength at elevated temperature, light weight, thermal and mechanical shock resistance, damage tolerance, and oxidation and corrosion resistance. The development of thick-walled, tubular ceramic composites has involved investigations of different fiber architectures and fixturing to obtain optimal densification and mechanical properties. The current efforts entail modeling of the densification process in order to increase densification uniformity and decrease processing time. In addition, the process is being scaled to produce components with a 10 cm outer diameter...|$|R
