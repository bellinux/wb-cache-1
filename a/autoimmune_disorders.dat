5|$|<b>Autoimmune</b> <b>disorders</b> {{can often}} be traced to {{antibodies}} that bind the body's own epitopes; many can be detected through blood tests. Antibodies directed against red blood cell surface antigens in immune mediated hemolytic anemia are detected with the Coombs test. The Coombs test is also used for antibody screening in blood transfusion preparation and also for antibody screening in antenatal women.|$|E
5|$|MS usually {{appears in}} adults {{in their late}} twenties or early thirties but it can rarely start in {{childhood}} and after 50 years of age.

Similar to many <b>autoimmune</b> <b>disorders,</b> the disease is more common in women, and the trend may be increasing. As of 2008, globally it is about two times more common in women than in men. In children, it is even more common in females than males, while in people over fifty, it affects males and females almost equally.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{molecular}} mimicry {{is a useful}} tool in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>disorders.</b> Molecular mimicry is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow future research to be directed toward uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant. This way, future research {{may be able to}} design strategies for treatment and prevention of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>disorders.</b> The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to molecular mimicry.|$|E

25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, the level of autoantibodies is reported as a titre. This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable. Positive autoantibody titres at a dilution {{equal to or greater}} than 1:160 are usually considered as clinically significant. Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly. Although positive titres of 1:160 or higher are strongly associated with <b>autoimmune</b> <b>disorders,</b> they are also found in 5% of healthy individuals. Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of <b>autoimmune</b> <b>disorders</b> and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E
