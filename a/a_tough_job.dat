5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport had been a mistake that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E
25|$|After Misbah-ul-Haq {{retired from}} ODIs, The Pakistan Cricket board had <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> {{to do while}} {{appointing}} Misbah's successor.

While this decision was opposed by many, Azhar Ali seemed determined to take the Pakistani team right on top.|$|E

500|$|The lack of graphics, poor {{interface}} {{and controls}} {{were seen as}} {{the reasons for the}} game's difficulty. However, the reviewers also noted most of it having a role in gameplay and the argument that the text-based graphics forces players to use their own imagination, making it more engaging. Weiner wrote, [...] " [...] may not look real, but once you're hooked, it feels vast, enveloping, alive. A micro-manager's dream, the game gleefully blurs the distinction between painstaking labor and creative thrill." [...] Quintin Smith from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said, [...] "The interface has <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> to do, bless it, but getting it {{to do what you want}} is like teaching a beetle to cook." [...] Ars Technica's Casey Johnston highlighted the difficulty in performing basic actions and felt that tinkering or experimenting ended up being unproductive; she compared it to [...] "trying to build a skyscraper by banging two rocks together". She pointed out the lack of in-game tutorial and said how players can learn by themselves in other games, which are also open-ended or have intuitive mechanics, but in Dwarf Fortress, there is no autonomy [...] "even after hours" [...] of gameplay.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2012, a storyline {{involving}} Lola Pearce, {{forced to}} hand over her baby Lexi Pearce, was criticised by the charity The Who Cares?

The scenes were also condemned by the British Association of Social Workers (BASW), calling the BBC [...] "too lazy and arrogant" [...] to correctly portray the child protection process, and saying that the baby was taken [...] "without sufficient grounds to do so". Bridget Robb, acting chief of the BASW, said the storyline provoked [...] "real anger among a profession well used to a less than accurate public and media perception of their jobs [...]. EastEnders shabby portrayal of an entire profession has made <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>job</b> even tougher." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with the}} New York Daily News, Kelly stated [...] "It's an outrage. I think it disrespects all police offers." [...] Although the game was made in conjunction with two former NYPD detectives, Bill Clarke and Tom Walker (author of Fort Apache: The Bronx), and although the police force in the game is called the PDNY (as opposed to the real life NYPD), Kelly stated [...] "It's totally inappropriate. It's <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>job,</b> a dangerous job, and this undermines what police officers try to do. I'm saddened that some former members of the department are linked to that video game." [...] Lynch said of Clarke, [...] "The cop who worked on this video should look in the mirror. He makes it harder for everyone working the job." [...] Clark responded by commenting that police unions [...] "should stop worrying about video games and spend more time getting cops more than a $25,000 starting salary." ...|$|E

50|$|Given a {{well-defined}} economy 24, {{there could be}} many stable equilibrium states - some are more desirable than others from a social welfare point of view. Many factors contribute {{to the existence of}} undesirable equilibriums, among which two are crucial for underemployment equilibrium: oversupply and insufficient demand. When the labor force are overeducated for the skill level of available employment opportunities in the economy, an underemployment equilibrium will occur. Insufficient demand addresses the same issue at the macro level. When there are many fewer job opportunities than unemployed individuals, the unemployment rate is high. Moreover, well-qualified workers will face <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> <b>job</b> market and thus have to settle for jobs originally meant for less skilled individuals. “Oversupply” here refers to an excess in both labor quantity and quality.|$|R

[...] Commings was replaced by Hayden Fry, who would coach the Hawkeyes for 20 years and have the most wins of any coach in Iowa football history.|$|R
