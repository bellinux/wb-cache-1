2500|$|To derive the Carnot efficiency, {{which is}} [...] (a number less than one), Kelvin had to {{evaluate}} {{the ratio of the}} work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion {{with the help of the}} Carnot-Clapeyron equation which contained an unknown function, known as the Carnot function. The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by Joule in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1848, he {{extended}} the Carnot–Clapeyron theory still further through his dissatisfaction that the gas thermometer provided only an operational definition of temperature. He proposed an <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> {{in which a}} unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature T° of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (T−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect , whatever be the number T. Such a scale would be quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance. By employing such a [...] "waterfall", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of absolute zero about which Guillaume Amontons had speculated in 1702. [...] "Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used −267 as {{an estimate of the}} absolute zero temperature. [...] Thomson used data published by Regnault to calibrate his scale against established measurements.|$|E
2500|$|The Kelvin {{scale is}} called {{absolute}} for two reasons. One is Kelvin's, that its formal character {{is independent of}} the properties of particular materials. The other reason is that its zero is in a sense absolute, in that it indicates absence of microscopic classical motion of the constituent particles of matter, so {{that they have a}} limiting specific heat of zero for zero temperature, according to the third law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, a Kelvin temperature does in fact have a definite numerical value that has been arbitrarily chosen by tradition and is dependent on the property of a particular materials; it is simply less arbitrary than relative [...] "degrees" [...] scales such as Celsius and Fahrenheit. [...] Being an absolute scale with one fixed point (zero), there is only one degree of freedom left to arbitrary choice, rather than two as in relative scales. For the Kelvin scale in modern times, this choice of convention is made to be that of setting the gas–liquid–solid triple point of water, a point which can be reliably reproduced as a standard experimental phenomenon, at a numerical value of 273.16 kelvins. The Kelvin scale is also called the thermodynamic scale. However, to demonstrate that its numerical value is indeed arbitrary, it is useful to point out that an alternate, less widely used <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> exists called the Rankine scale, made to be aligned with the Fahrenheit scale as Kelvin is with Celsius.|$|E
2500|$|The Kelvin {{scale is}} an <b>absolute</b> {{thermodynamic}} <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> using as its null point <b>absolute</b> zero, the <b>temperature</b> at which all thermal motion ceases {{in the classical}} description of thermodynamics. [...] The kelvin (symbol: K) is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). [...] The kelvin {{is defined as the}} fraction [...] of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (exactly 0.01°C or 32.018°F).

Tables of airspeed in knots are also included because {{of the significance of}} this quantity in navigation. In addition, the data in the altitude tables have been revised to the U. S.

5000|$|The zeroth law {{establishes}} {{thermal equilibrium}} as an equivalence relationship. An equivalence relationship {{on a set}} (such as the set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium) divides that set into a collection of distinct subsets ("disjoint subsets") where {{any member of the}} set is a member of one and only one such subset. In the case of the zeroth law, these subsets consist of systems which are in mutual equilibrium. This partitioning allows any member of the subset to be uniquely [...] "tagged" [...] with a label identifying the subset to which it belongs. Although the labeling may be quite arbitrary, temperature is just such a labeling process which uses the real number system for tagging. The zeroth law justifies the use of suitable thermodynamic systems as thermometers to provide such a labeling, which yield any number of possible empirical <b>temperature</b> <b>scales,</b> and justifies the use of the second law of thermodynamics to provide an <b>absolute,</b> or thermodynamic <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> Such <b>temperature</b> <b>scales</b> bring additional continuity and ordering (i.e., [...] "hot" [...] and [...] "cold") properties to the concept of temperature.|$|R

Because the wide spectral line width of the scattered 3 He A-like signals, the longitudinal response can not be identified from the background noise in the current experimental setup. The Fermi liquid to 3 He A-like phase transition temperature Tc,aero have been inferred from the transverse NMR data only. Different from the previous 3 He in aerogel experiments, which have mainly focused on the high field transverse NMR studies of the order parameter, the current low field NMR study gives a better physical picture of the impurity scattering effect on the superfluid order parameter. The field scaling measurement of the A-like phase frequency shift is carried out for the static H 0 field at 10. 31, 20. 44 and 40. 12 Gauss with the superfluid pressurized at 27. 58 bar. For magnetic fields at 20. 44 and 40. 12 Gauss, the aerogel signal shifting away from the Larmor frequency is easily identified from the data analysis. But for magnetic field at 10. 31 Gauss, the signal is much less visible in the FFT spectrum.

A least square fit to the real time data is used to extract the normal fluid magnetic responses.
