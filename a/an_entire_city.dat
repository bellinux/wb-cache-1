5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city.</b> Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV go so far as to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

The study further revealed that a Montreal-Ottawa-Toronto system is the most economically viable section and could generate a positive net economic benefit using either diesel or electric traction.|$|R

25|$|Another {{method of}} {{overcoming}} the free rider {{problem is to}} simply eliminate the profit incentive for free riding by buying out all the potential free riders. A property developer that owned <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city</b> street, for instance, would not {{need to worry about}} free riders when erecting street lights since he owns every business that could benefit from the street light without paying. Implicitly, then, the property developer would erect street lights until the marginal social benefit met the marginal social cost. In this case, they are equivalent to the private marginal benefits and costs.|$|E

Our system consists of two major components: (1) Web-camera-based traffic monitoring and (2) network flow estimation. The traffic monitoring module features a new algorithm for computing the vehicle count and velocity from very low-resolution Web camera images, while the network flow estimation module features a traffic flow estimation algorithm at every single link, based on measurements at a limited number of links with the cameras. Using real Web cameras deployed in Nairobi, Kenya, we assessed the accuracy of our approach. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first practical framework for monitoring <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city’s</b> traffic without special expensive infrastructure and time-consuming data calibration...|$|R

25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city.</b> Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E

The building was enlarged over time showing a number of different architectural styles. It contains a large alijbe or water storage tank in the main courtyard. There are also gargoyles. During the Mexican Revolution, the building served as a barracks for Emiliano Zapata’s troops.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated electrical switch {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city.</b> The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E
40|$|Extract] The Townsville Strand was a $ 30 m {{redevelopment}} of the waterfront, {{which has}} {{stood the test}} of time. Despite some modest opposition at the time, the City Council, transformed the Strand into a manicured public parklands which continues to enjoy wide public acclaim 15 years on. Qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken by one of the authors in 2004 - 6 into community usage and attitudes toward the Strand (Transpac Consulting, 2005; 2006). In this paper, the frame shifts from the original one concerned with measures of social capital development to one that is grounded in a phenomenology of place and a socio-aesthetics of immersion in landscape. Our aim is to analyze how, through its design and landscape 'affordances', this waterfront space has successfully engaged a variety of users and managed to have a measurable impact on <b>an</b> <b>entire</b> <b>city's</b> atmospherics...|$|R
