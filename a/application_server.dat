25|$|Enterprise use of Java {{has also}} {{long been the}} main driver of open source {{interest}} in the platform. This interest has inspired open source communities to produce {{a large amount of}} software, including simple function libraries, development frameworks (e.g. the Spring Framework, Apache Wicket, Dojo Toolkit, Hibernate), and open source implementations of standards and tools (e.g. Apache Tomcat, the GlassFish <b>application</b> <b>server,</b> the Mule and Apache ServiceMix Enterprise service buses).|$|E
40|$|In multi-tier {{enterprise}} systems, <b>application</b> <b>servers</b> are {{key components}} to implement business logic and provide services. To support {{a large number}} of simultaneous accesses from clients over the Internet and intranet, most <b>application</b> <b>servers</b> use replication and/or multi-thread technologies to handle concurrent requests. While multi-processes and multi-threads enhance the processing bandwidth of servers, they may also increase the contention on <b>application</b> <b>servers.</b> This paper investigates this issue based on our internal middleware benchmark. A cost model is proposed to estimate overall performance of <b>application</b> <b>servers,</b> including the contention overhead. This model can be used to determine the optimal degree of the concurrency of <b>application</b> <b>servers</b> for a specific client load.

25|$|Wiki {{software}} {{is a type}} of collaborative software that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing web server, or as a standalone <b>application</b> <b>server</b> that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a file system, and changes to the content are stored in a relational database management system. A commonly implemented software package is MediaWiki, which runs Wikipedia. Alternatively, personal wikis run as a standalone application on a single computer. WikidPad is an example. One application, TiddlyWiki, simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.|$|E
