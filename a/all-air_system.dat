With this system, temperature and humidity control are decoupled by using desiccant wheel for moisture removal and ceiling panels for temperature control. To evaluate the system performance and the energy savings potential, another three systems: conventional <b>all-air</b> <b>system,</b> <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> with total heat recovery, and radiant cooling with air handling unit (AHU), are considered for a typical office in Hong Kong. The hourly sensible load is calculated by a building energy simulation code ACCURACY and the latent load is predicted by moisture balance in the room. Through hour-by-hour simulations, the annual energy consumptions of the four systems are calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that chilled-ceiling combined with desiccant cooling could save up to 44 % of primary energy consumption, in comparison with a conventional constant volume <b>all-air</b> <b>system.</b> More interestingly, more than 70 % of annual operating hours for desiccant regeneration could be accomplished by low-grade heat of less than 80 Â°C.

40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} is an energy-saving, {{environmentally friendly}} and healthy means of air dehumidification. A liquid desiccant-based all-air {{air conditioning system}} is studied by simulation. Two different modes of air mixing between the return air and the fresh air are compared, that is mixing before and mixing after the liquid desiccant dehumidifier, respectively. System performance and total energy consumption of the two modes under different operation conditions are obtained. The results show that mixing air after dehumidification consumes less energy than mixing air before dehumidification. Coefficient of performance (COP) of the <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> with air mixing after dehumidification is higher. The differences of COP and energy consumption between the two air mixing modes increase when the outdoor air temperature and relative humidity increase. Practical application: Liquid desiccant based <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> is quite suitable for museums, libraries and computer centres where water {{is not allowed to}} enter the space for property safety and strict thermal-hygrometric control is necessary.

40|$|While forced-air {{distribution}} systems {{remain the}} predominant approach to {{heating and cooling}} in U. S. commercial buildings, radiant systems are emerging {{as a part of}} high performance buildings. Radiant systems transfer energy via a surface that contains piping with warmed or cooled water, or a water/glycol mix and separate ventilation through a dedicated outside air system. These systems can contribute to significant energy savings due to relatively small temperature differences between the room set-point and cooling/heating source, and the efficiency of using water rather than air for thermal distribution 1. They can also offer peak demand reduction, load shifting, and improved comfort compared to conventional <b>all-air</b> <b>systems.</b> The California Energy Commission (CEC) EPIC program funded a radiant research project from 2016 - 2018 to better characterize the energy use, occupant perceptions, opportunities for improvement, and provide data and resources to increase market adoption of radiant for both heating and cooling. The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) at UC Berkeley managed the full research project titled Optimizing Radiant Systems for Energy Efficiency and Comfort. Within this project New Buildings Institute led Task 5 : Energy Analysis and Occupant Surveys of Radiant Buildings and conducted the energy analysis and CBE led the occupant satisfaction survey and assessment. The Task 5 research study included a review of the whole-building design characteristics and site energy use in 23 buildings and surveys of occupant perceptions of indoor environmental quality in 26 buildings with 1645 individuals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The growing {{interest}} in Italy for its cultural heritage and the necessity for better conservation usually require that museums be provided with appropriate HVAC systems. Control of indoor relative humidity must ensure that the vapour transfer between the materials and the ambient is such as to avoid mechanical, chemical and biological damage.

A case study concerning a simulated modern museum is presented in this paper. Using the dynamic simulation code DOE 2. 1 E and hourly climatic data (TRY), the operating costs of different <b>all-air</b> <b>systems</b> (also with dehumidification by adsorption) have been evaluated for exhibition areas and stock spaces, as well as system performance in controlling thermal-hygrometric ambient parameters...|$|R
40|$|By {{actively}} {{cooling down}} {{one or more}} surfaces in a space, water-based embedded surface cooling (radiant) systems remove heat both by convection and radiation. Therefore, unlike the case of well-mixed air distribution systems where the cooling load is purely convective, the cooling load for radiant systems is comprised of both convective and radiant components. However, in current practice, the same design cooling load calculation methods for the radiant systems are used as the convection based air systems. The purpose of this energy simulation {{study was to investigate}} if there are differences in peak zone cooling load and 24 -hour total zone cooling energy generated by <b>all-air</b> distribution <b>systems</b> in comparison to radiant cooling systems. Sensitivity studies were performed for different load and boundary conditions. Simulation results show that total zone cooling energy for the radiant cooling systems studied can be 2. 7 - 6. 5 % higher than the <b>all-air</b> <b>systems,</b> and peak zone cooling load can be in the range of 10 - 40 % higher depending on the load conditions. Future research is needed to assess the implications for design guidelines. In general, even if the total zone level cooling energy may be slightly higher for the radiant systems, there are verified advantages of using hydronic-based radiant systems such as improved plant side equipment efficiency with warmer cold water temperature, possibility of night pre-cooling and utilization of natural cooling resource, and energy efficiency in transporting heat with water compared to air.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis research is to test the applicability of a novel heat and moisture transfer panel (HAMP) in an office building to control the space humidity. A HAMP is a panel that uses a liquid desiccant to add or remove heat and moisture to or from a space. This thesis research uses the TRNSYS computer package to model an office building in four different cities representing four climatic conditions. The cities are Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Chicago, Illinois; Phoenix, Arizona; and Miami, Florida; representing cold-dry, cool-humid, hot-dry, and hot-humid climates, respectively. The HAMP is employed in the office building with a radiant ceiling panel (RCP) system. Three other HVAC systems are examined and compared to the system employing the HAMP. The systems are: a conventional <b>all-air</b> <b>system,</b> a RCP system with 100 % outdoor air, a RCP system with a parallel dedicated outdoor air system (DOAS), and the RCP system with the HAMP and 100 % outdoor air. In the latter, the HAMP covers 10 % of the ceiling area and uses lithium chloride solution as the liquid desiccant at different temperatures and concentrations. The {{results show that the}} HAMP is able to control the space humidity within the control limits in all climates. The HAMP also shows the ability to provide better humidity control than the other systems as it directly responds to the space latent loads. The HAMP is able to control the relative humidity between 26 % RH and 62 %, 24 % RH and 57 % RH, 27 % RH and 60 %, and 40 % RH and 62 % RH in Chicago, Saskatoon, Phoenix, and Miami, respectively. The HAMP is able to achieve a relative humidity of 35 % in Chicago, Saskatoon, and Phoenix for 14 %, 13 %, and 20 % of the working hours of the year, respectively. It is also able to achieve a relative humidity of 60 % in Chicago, and Miami 10 % and 55 % of the working hours of the year, respectively.

The second set of computations includes a phase change material layer between the glass window and the plastic shade. Results show substantial energy savings can be accrued using the displacement ventilation and especially the displacement ventilation with a chilled ceiling over the conventional overhead mixing ventilation system. The results also show that the addition of a PCM layer to the exterior wall can significantly decrease the cooling energy requirements...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aspect of the design of cost-effective HVAC systems today is (a) sensitivity to the cost impact of the interplay of utility demand charges, time-of-day rates, gas rates, and gas/electric utility incentive programs vis-?-vis HVAC system options; and (b) familiarity with the range of electric, gas, and electric/gas system options available {{to take advantage of the}} cost opportunities and avoid the cost penalties in specific utility situations. When these factors are fully evaluated and incorporated into HVAC design for medium-to-large buildings, it is possible to structure system arrangements that reduce energy operating costs very significantly compared to conventional <b>all-air</b> VAV <b>systems</b> and also to all-air VAV ice thermal storage systems, at a comparable first cost...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{has become}} a primary concern in {{countries}} worldwide, and is a focus of debates on national security, climate change, global economy, and the developing world. With more people in developing countries adopting the lifestyle of western countries as rapidly as possible, limited only by economic means, a tremendous increase in world's energy consumption {{in the next few}} decades seems difficult to avoid. The building sector is of particular interest, since it accounts for {{a large portion of the}} total energy market: currently in the U. S. forty percent of the total energy and seventy percent of electricity is consumed by residential and commercial buildings. Within commercial buildings, cooling equipment represents the second largest consumer of electricity. This research analyzes one option for reducing space cooling energy consumption, an advanced cooling system termed low-lift cooling system (LLCS). The system comprises thermally activated building surfaces (TABS) with water running through pipes embedded in a building's construction to serve both as cool storage and as a means of delivering the cooling effect. The LLCS utilizes model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that, based on weather and load predictions, determines the cooling strategy over next 24 hours that minimizes energy consumption. Different objectives, such as minimizing the total cost of electricity, can be achieved by modifying the objective function. Currently there is no commercially or publicly available software that allows the analysis of systems that employ MPC. The first goal of this research was to develop a computer algorithm that can simulate the LLCS performance, but also the performance of other cooling systems that employ MPC. The second goal was to analyze the LLCS performance across different U. S. climates relative to a conventional cooling system and to explore different dehumidification strategies that can be used in combination with the LLCS. This research significantly advances the knowledge of simulation and performance of the LLCS. The developed MPC algorithm enables a systematic study of primary factors influencing dynamic controls and the savings potential for an individual building. The algorithm is highly modular, enabling easy future expansion, and is sufficiently fast and robust for an implementation real buildings. The results of the analysis suggest that the electricity savings using the LLCS are up to 50 % relative to an <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> under conventional control and up to 23 % relative to an <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> under MPC. The savings were achieved through lower fan and pump transport energy and better utilization of part-load efficiencies inherent in inverter-compressor equipment, a result of the TABS technology and the optimal control. by Tea Zakula.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} solution for the current energy crisis is recovering lost energy. Indeed, in many energy systems the percentage of energy loss could exceed 60 %. To put it another way, in some applications, recovering energy is as much beneficial as finding new source of energy. Moreover, finding new concepts of energy recovery offers wider horizons to reduce energy consumption. The present work investigates new energy recovery system that combines heat recovery and energy generation using thermoelectric generators (TEG). The proposed system is a triple Thermoelectric-Energy recovery coupled system that from one hand allows to recover the heat of condenser and to reuse the lost energy of exhaust airflow of HVAC <b>all-air</b> <b>system</b> and from the other hand it permits to produce green electricity using TEG. The air of the condenser is considered the heat source, whereas the exhaust air flow is utilized as cooler. To proceed, a mathematical tool is first developed it allows to thermally simulate TEGs for different boundary conditions. The heat and cold source are then modeled where the heat transfer coefficient is determined from the Nusselt number. Furthermore, a parametric analysis is then conducted to evaluate the power generated with the new concept when the air velocity of the exhaust airflow and that of the condenser vary. It is shown that for a space cooling load of 100 Â kW, a 40 Ã 40 Â cm 2 flat plate is capable to generate 90 Â W of electrical power...|$|E
40|$|In {{the museum}} environment, the {{temporal}} stability and the spatial uniformity of the indoor microclimatic parameters are necessary {{primarily for the}} correct artwork conservation and then for the occupant thermal comfort. Therefore, a HVAC system is usually necessary. This paper above all emphasizes the integration of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. This coupled numerical approach can provide accurate information about both the HVAC system energy request and the indoor microclimatic control (temporal and spatial distribution of the parameters). Then, a case study concerning a typical museum exhibition room is examined. The annual energy request for three types of <b>all-air</b> <b>system,</b> {{as well as the}} temporal variation of indoor temperature and relative humidity, is evaluated by means of a BEPS code. Energy savings can be obtained using a system with desiccant wheel (11 %) or enthalpy wheel (9 %), compared to the base system. As regards indoor relative humidity control, this is more critical for summer conditions, and the best performance is obtained by the system with desiccant wheel. Then, the spatial microclimatic control is analyzed by means of a CFD analysis, for various thermal load conditions and different air diffusion xequipments. The best performances are obtained by using the swirling (vortex) diffusers; also the perimetrical stripes of slot diffusers show satisfactory performances. Finally, in order to evaluate the ability of air diffusion equipments to assure good ventilation effectiveness, an analysis of the mean age of air is carried out to...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{principles}} of air and heat balance and aiming at air-conditioning load time delay mechanism, the boot time for air-conditioning system operation is controlled to satisfy the demand of air-conditioned environment without wasting energy [1]. Most air-conditioning systems operate intermittently instead of 24 -hour a day. The rules of intermittent operation are related to the working environment of air-conditioning system. For example, offices, hotels, and restaurants have their own characteristics respectively; therefore, the operations at these locations vary for their different air-conditioning environment, especially the control on boot time of air-conditioning system. Time Delay of <b>All-Air</b> Conditioning <b>System</b> The <b>all-air</b> conditioning <b>system</b> refers to the air-conditioning system with both cooling and heat loads in winter and summer undertaken by air. Devices such as fan coils are arranged indoor. See Figure 1 for the calculation model for cooling balance in summer. According to the cooling balance equation in outQ = â â, it comes from Figure 1 that, the cooling capacity input by air blow 1 Q = cooling capacity output by air exhaust 2 Q +cooling loss of enclosure structure 3 Q +indoor cooling capacity accumulation 4 Q.

This is because of the minor difference between indoor and outdoor temperatures. However, we can convert it using designed cooling load.

40|$|Considerable {{electrical}} energy used to cool nonresidential buildings equipped with <b>All-Air</b> <b>Systems</b> is {{drawn by the}} fans that transport the cool air through the thermal distribution system. Hydropic Cooling Systems {{have the potential to}} reduce the amount of air transported through the building by separating the tasks of ventilation and thermal conditioning. Due to the physical properties of water, Hydropic Cooling Systems can transport a given amount of thermal energy using less than 5 % of the otherwise necessary fan energy. They are suited to the dry climates that are typical of California and been used for more than 30 years in hospital rooms. However, energy savings and peak-load characteristics have not yet been analyzed. Adequate guidelines for their design and control systems has prevented lack of their widespread application to other building types. Evaluation of theoretical performance of Hydropic Systems could be made by computer models. Energy analysis programs such as DOE- 2 do not yet have the capacity to simulate Hydropic Cooling Systems. Scope of this project is developing a model that can accurately simulate the dynamic performance of Hydropic Radiant Cooling Systems. The model can calculate loads, heat extraction rates, room air temperature and room surface temperature distributions, and can be used to evaluate issues such as thermal comfort, controls, system sizing, system configuration and dynamic response. The model was created with the LBL Simulation Problem Analysis and Research Kernel (SPARK), which provides a methodology for describing and solving the dynamic, non-linear equations that correspond to complex physical systems. Potential for Hydropic Radiant Cooling Systems applications can be determined by running this model for a variety of construction types in different California climates...|$|R
