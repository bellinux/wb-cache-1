5|$|A {{moderate}} {{storm surge}} accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, the maximum reported surge was , <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin. In Montegut, the surge breached a levee {{which was still}} damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. The storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the storm surge totaled $4.1million (2003USD). Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E

He later had serious doubts and regrets regarding this decision and reconverted back to Sikhism in 1886.|$|E
25|$|In {{plants and}} other organisms, DNA {{methylation}} {{is found in}} three different sequence contexts: CG (or CpG), CHG or CHH (where H correspond to A,T or C). In mammals however, DNA methylation is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides, with the cytosines on both strand being usually methylated. Non-CpG methylation can however be observed in embryonic stem cells, and has also been indicated in neural development. Furthermore, non-CpG methylation has also been observed in hematopoietic progenitor cells, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> mainly in a CpApC sequence context.|$|E
25|$|Vandoorne's feature race {{victory was}} the first of his GP2 Series <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> in his maiden series start and Palmer's sprint race win was the fourth of his career. The result of the races meant Palmer assumed the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 38 points, ten in front of second-placed Leal. Vandoorne was in third place, while Trummer's second-place sprint race result enabled him to settle into fourth. Nasr rounded out the top five. DAMS became the leaders of the Teams' Championship with a four-point {{advantage}} over Carlin. ART Grand Prix were a further seven points in third position, while Rapax and Racing Engineering rounded out the top five, with ten rounds left in the season.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, {{signed on}} February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican {{plenipotentiary}} representatives Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto, and Miguel Atristain, ended the war, gave the U.S. undisputed control of Texas, and established the U.S.–Mexican {{border of the}} Rio Grande. As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began to flare among {{the people of the}} state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, Ángel Trías sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with Ángel Trías, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican–American War <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.|$|E
500|$|The pH of {{the waters}} of Buffalo Creek at three sites ranges from 5.0 to 6.7. Out of six times that the pH {{of the waters}} of the creek was {{measured}} in the springs and summers of 2010 and 2012, the lowest pH, 5.0, occurred at the location BC-6 on July 27, 2012. The highest pH, 6.7, occurred at the location known as BC-5 on June 15, 2010. The average pH during that time was approximately 5.6467.

500|$|Because {{there were}} no tornado {{warnings}} before the storm (<b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> {{in an area where}} tornadoes are rare), the initial damage reports claimed an explosion had damaged a roof. Soon, however, the storm's nature and impact became apparent. Governor Ella Grasso lived just a block away from the tornado's path, though she was in Hartford {{at the time of the}} storm. She declared an 8 pm5 am curfew in the days following the tornado. About 500 National Guardsmen were activated to prevent looting and direct traffic, and the area was declared a disaster area by President Carter. FEMA trailers were provided within a few days, and were used by many residents until reconstruction or repairs could be completed. In all, at least 38 businesses were damaged or destroyed, 65 homes were completely destroyed, and at least 75 homes were damaged. Twenty-five tobacco sheds were [...] "extensively damaged". At the airport, at least 30 vintage aircraft were damaged or destroyed, as well as most of the state's National Guard helicopters. The final damage total reached $200 million (1979 USD), or $442 million in 1997 dollars.|$|E

2500|$|Ray had {{not thought}} about a trilogy while making Aparajito, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> to him only after being asked about the idea in Venice. The final {{installation}} of the series, Apur Sansar (The World of Apu), was made in 1959. A number of critics find {{this to be the}} supreme achievement of the trilogy (Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming [...] "one of the cinema's classic affirmative depiction of married life", but tragedy ensues. After Apur Sansar was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray's filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film Charulata, Ray's personal favourite). His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.|$|E
