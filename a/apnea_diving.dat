50|$|The {{sport was}} created free diver Christian Redl {{with help from}} his friend and {{training}} partner Jaromir Foukal. Redl started his career in <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> after watching the movie The Big Blue, released in 1988, starring Jean-Marc Barr, Jean Reno, and Rosanna Arquette and directed by Luc Besson. This movie inspired Redl to take his love for diving to another level and in later that year, in 1996, he attended the first world <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> championships in Nice, France. In 1998 Redl formed his own team {{to take part in}} the second world championships in free diving. In 2003 Christian Redl set his first freediving world record, but this wasn’t the end of his record breaking career. Over the course of the next decade, Redl would go on to break multiple world records paving the way for others to follow in his footsteps and break his own records. Some of his world records include in line diving under ice with a distance of 200 meter, which he achieved in 2016, and in deep dives under ice with a depth of 61 meters with a weight lasting 1 minute and 51 seconds, which was achieved in 2011.|$|E

50|$|The {{show was}} titled after the {{discipline}} of No-Limits <b>Apnea.</b> <b>Diving</b> holds {{a special place in}} Luc Besson's heart, whose parents were scuba diving instructors, and who had planned to become a marine biologist himself before a diving accident ended those plans and whose third film, The Big Blue, was all about the subject. In addition, the title was meant to give the show an international-sounding name in order to widen its appeal and was also a reference to the state of the hero, who is afflicted with a brain tumor. The writers took inspiration from other TV shows to portray the condition, chief among them Breaking Bad.|$|E
50|$|After his {{experience}} in <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> Redl took his love for underwater sports {{to the next level}} by creating Underwater Ice Hockey while also starting a school to teach people how to properly free dive. Organizer Christian Redl said: 'After diving a lot under ice, I wondered which sports had the potential to be played underneath ice and that's when the hockey game was born. The matches are very fast paced, so {{the amount of time that}} divers are under the water is not that long - plus the water is extremely cold and you can get disorientated very easily.' Furthermore, Christian Redl has seen some success in television and film with being a stuntman in television broadcasts like Medicopter 117 and Coast Guard and appearing on TV-Total Late night show with Stefan Raab in 1999. Redl’s activities in <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> and Underwater Ice Hockey has put him in a good position to be a stuntman. Another thing he has done in his film career was a little known music video called “On My Way” by DJ Friction, which involves underwater ice diving. Also, in 2002 Redl went to Roatan Island to film an advertising film for Seimens medical, which also involves diving. On top of his film career, Redl has also written some book about his life, projects, and free diving. A couple of these books are called “Free diving - My World in Pictures” in 2006 and “Mastering Boundaries through Mental Strength - Safe Diving” in 2010. One of the last achievements that stands Redl out from the crowd is that he does not confine himself to one location or hemisphere to do what he loves. He takes his love all over the world, from the North Pole: Greenland and Iceland to Antarctica where he continues to push the limits of the human body. All of these achievements are proof that anyone can take a childhood dream and make a successful career out of it.|$|E

Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine. 2011; 41 (1) : 27 - 30.) Introduction: Traditional <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> for sea harvesting for a living continues in some communities in Asia, the outcome being dependent on the total underwater working time. We studied dive and surface interval durations and daily time spent submerged by Japanese Ama and the Phillipine Bajau. Methods: Diving and surface interval durations were timed, and daily in-water working time noted for 14 female Ama (mean age 60 years) during sea-mollusc collection, and five male Bajau divers (mean age 38 years) during spearfishing, using direct observations and depth-time recorders. Results: In the Ama, mean (SD) dive duration was 38 (8) s, with mean surface interval duration of 38 (8) s, at depths of 5 - 12 metres' sea water (msw), and diving constituted 50 (4) % of the total immersed working time, which was limited to 4 h per day by fishing regulations. In the Bajau, mean dive duration was 28 (9) s, with surface intervals of 19 (8) s, at depths of 5 - 7 msw, and diving was 60 (6) % of the total working time. Diving patterns in Hegura-Ama {{were similar to those}} previously reported, with up to 2 h per day spent under water. The Bajau total working time of 2 - 9 h per day suggests that some divers may spend more than 5 h per day submerged, which is the greatest daily <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> time reported in humans. Conclusions: We conclude that natural human diving ability in these two groups of traditional apnea divers allows efficient sea harvesting at shallow depths and that the outcome {{does not seem to be}} limited by total daily apnea time...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Ultrasonographic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} transient reduction in spleen volume in relation to <b>apnea</b> <b>diving.</b> We measured spleen volume under various respiratory conditions by MR imaging to accurately {{determine the influence of}} ordinary breath holding on spleen volumetry. Materials and Methods: Twelve healthy adult volunteers were examined. Contiguous MR images of the spleen were acquired during free breathing and during respiratory manipulations, including breath holding at the end of normal expiration, breath holding at deep inspiration, and the valsalva maneuver, and spleen volume was measured from each image set based on the sum-of-areas method.

30|$|The study only {{included}} 16 individuals {{but because}} of the crossover design, with each individual examined in eight different conditions, we were able to produce highly statistically significant results. The study was not blinded to the participants or ultrasonographer but was analyzed in a blind fashion by an independent researcher. Our study did not determine the effects of depth of a dive; the effects of depth may be important because the gas density is an important determinant of breathing work [29, 30, 32]. Scores of lung comet tails have also been found to be increased at the end of apnea dives either at depth or close to surface when “struggling” inspiratory efforts developed [53]. In the latter study, a 50 -m dive apnea caused compressive reduction of lung gas volume and a very large increase in thoracic blood volume. Diaphragmatic contractions during free diving cause lowering of airways and mediastinal pressure similar to the negative transpulmonary pressure breathing seen in our study. It can be surmised that the markedly larger increase in lung comet score found in our study compared with in the <b>apnea</b> <b>diving</b> study was due to the combination of several hemodynamic consequences of negative transpulmonary pressure with larger tidal volumes and of a longer duration. We only investigated men; we are not able to comment on the effects in women. We were unable to determine the independent effects of natriuretic peptides. Right ventricular fraction area change was used instead of the ejection fraction because of the difficulties in calculating the latter by echocardiography. We did not look for the presence of patent foramen ovale in our subjects despite its hypothetical protection from pulmonary edema.|$|E

METHODS: Twenty breath-hold divers were divided into two groups: a control group (8 males and 2 females) and a chocolate group (9 males and 1 female). The control group was asked to perform a series of dives to 20  m adding up to 20  min in the quiet diving pool of Conflans-Ste-Honorine (Paris, France), water temperature was 27  °C. The chocolate group performed the dives 1  h after ingestion of 30  g of dark chocolate. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), digital photoplethysmography, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite ONOO(-)) levels were measured before and after each series of breath-hold dives. RESULTS: A significant decrease in FMD was observed in the control group after the dives (95. 28  ±  2. 9  % of pre-dive values, p    0. 05). No differences in digital photoplethysmography and peroxynitrites were observed between before and after the dives.

40|$|Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals {{have the}} {{capacity}} of breath hold (<b>apnea)</b> <b>diving.</b> Northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{have the ability to}} perform deep and long duration dives; during a routine dive, adults can hold their breath for 25 min. Neotropical river otters (Lontra longicaudis annectens) can hold their breath for about 30 sec. Such periods of apnea may result in reduced oxygen concentration (hypoxia) and reduced blood supply (ischemia) to tissues. Production of adenosine 5 ’-triphosphate (ATP) requires oxygen, and most mammalian species, like the domestic pig (Sus scrofa), are not adapted to tolerate hypoxia and ischemia, conditions that result in ATP degradation. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the differences in purine synthesis and recycling in erythrocytes and plasma of three mammalian species adapted to different environments: aquatic (northern elephant seal) (n= 11), semiaquatic (neotropical river otter) (n= 4) and terrestrial (domestic pig) (n= 11). Enzymatic activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) was determined by spectrophotometry, and activity of inosine 5 ’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and the concentration of hypoxanthine (HX), inosine 5 ’-monophosphate (IMP), adenosine 5 ’-monophosphate (AMP), adenosine 5 ’-diphosphate (ADP), ATP, guanosine 5 ’-diphosphate (GDP), guanosine 5 ’-triphosphate (GTP), and xanthosine 5 ’-monophosphate (XMP) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The activities of HGPRT and IMPDH and the concentration of HX, IMP, AMP, ADP, ATP, GTP and XMP in erythrocytes of domestic pigs were higher than in erythrocytes of northern elephant seals and river otters.

40|$|Stimulation of {{the nasal}} mucosa by {{airborne}} irritants or water evokes a pronounced bradycardia accompanied by peripheral vasoconstriction and <b>apnea.</b> The <b>dive</b> response, which includes the trigeminocardiac reflex, {{is among the most}} powerful autonomic responses. These responses slow the heart rate and reduce myocardial oxygen consumption. Although normally cardioprotective, exaggeration of this reflex can be detrimental and has been implicated in cardiorespiratory diseases, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). An essential component of the diving response and trigeminocardiac reflex is activation of the parasympathetic cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) in the nucleus ambiguus that control heart rate. This study examined the involvement of cholinergic receptors in trigeminally evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in CVNs in an in vitro preparation from rats. CVNs were identified using a retrograde tracer injected into the fat pads {{at the base of the}} heart. Application of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine significantly decreased the amplitude of glutamatergic neurotransmission to CVNs on stimulation of trigeminal fibers. Whereas nicotine did not have any effect on the glutamatergic responses, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist bethanechol significantly decreased the excitatory neurotransmission. Atropine, an mAChR antagonist, facilitated these responses indicating this trigeminally evoked brain stem pathway in vitro is endogenously inhibited by mAChRs. Tropicamide, an m 4 mAChR antagonist, prevented the inhibitory action of the muscarinic agonist bethanechol. These results indicate that the glutamatergic synaptic neurotransmission in the trigeminally evoked pathway to CVNs is endogenously inhibited in vitro by m 4 mAChRs...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{scuba diving}} {{curricula}} may apply the terms shallow-water blackout and deep-water blackout differently; deep-water blackout being {{applied to the}} final stage of nitrogen narcosis while shallow water blackout may be applied to a blackout from a deep free dive. [...] Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen. [...] Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving depressurisation and the cause may be variously attributed to either depressurisation or hypocapnia or both. This problem may stem from the origin of the term latent hypoxia {{in the context of a}} string of fatal, shallow water accidents with early military, closed-circuit rebreather apparatus prior to the development of effective oxygen partial pressure measurement. In the very different context of dynamic apnea sports careful consideration of terms is needed to avoid potentially dangerous confusion between two phenomena that actually have different characteristics, mechanisms and prevention measures. The application of the term shallow water blackout to deep dives and its subsequent association with extreme sports has tended to mislead many practitioners of static apnea and dynamic <b>apnea</b> distance <b>diving</b> into thinking that it does not apply to them even though isobaric shallow water blackout kills swimmers every year, often in shallow swimming pools.|$|R

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} {{vertebrate}} diving {{research has been}} the growing emphasis on studies directed at intraspecific variability in dive performance (see Burns and Castellini, 1996; Burns et al., 1997; MacArthur et al., 2001). To date, most of this {{research has focused on}} developmental changes in the diving behaviour and blood-muscle physiology of avian and mammalian divers (Horning and Trillmich, 1997; Ponganis et al., 1999; Noren et al., 2001). A conclusion emerging from several of these studies is that immature animals typically dive to shallower depths and remain submerged for shorter periods than adults. The superior diving ability of adults is often credited to their larger body oxygen reserves and reduced metabolic costs of diving, compared to juveniles (see Burns et al., 1997; McCafferty et al., 1998). Though allometry is often invoked to account for such differences, the gain in tissue oxygen reserves by growing young may also reflect their increased experience of diving (Ponganis et al., 1999; Noren et al., 2001). Noren et al. (2001) suggested that as young animals mature and gain experience of swimming underwater, the increased time spent in <b>dive</b> <b>apnea</b> may make an important contribution to the acquisition of adult levels of muscle myoglobin (Mb). The possibility that increased encounters with diving hypoxia contribute to boosting the oxygen storage capacity of divers presents an intriguing hypothesis that is amenable to testing. Yet few experimental studies have specifically addressed the benefits of prior dive experience to any aspect of diving capacity. In a study of the tufted duck Aythya fuligula, Stephenson et al. (1989) compared several key respiratory variables of control birds with those of dive-conditioned ducks that were required to swim 6. 0 m underwater in order to feed. Following a 6 -month training period, total body oxygen stores were similar in both groups, though the partitioning of these stores was altered significantly. These authors reported a decline in the lung-air sac oxygen reserve of dive-conditioned ducks that was offset by a commensurate gain in their blood and muscle stores. In a parallel study of immature harbor seals Phoca vitulina, Kodama et al. (1977) compared several blood indices of seals raised in a dry enclosure (‘non-divers’) with those of animal...|$|R
40|$|Underwater {{immersion}} may mimic hyperbaric conditions finally favouring some unwanted effects such as oxidative stress, {{which has}} been defined as an unbalance between pro-oxidative and antioxidant processes (1). However, although many observations suggest that inhaled oxygen under hyperbaric treatment may increase total oxidant status in humans (2), however no conclusive data are now available in apnea and self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) divers (3). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate globally oxidative balance in apnea and scuba divers in different immersions. Four apparently healthy professional divers, one apnea diver and three scuba divers were recruited. The athletes observed the appropriate programs of the immersion and the correct decompression time. Blood samples were collected from forearm vein before and after diving in three different immersions performed in three different days. Immediately after collecting the samples, oxidative balance was evaluated by performing on a dedicated photometer (FREE system) the Carratelli’s panel (Diacron International s. r. l., Grosseto, Italy) (4), which includes total oxidant status measurement by means of d-ROMs test (normal range 250 to 300 CARR U, where 1 CARR U is equivalent to 23. 51 mol/L hydrogen peroxide) (5), serum ferric reducing activity quantification by means of BAP test (optimal value > 2200 mol/L reduced iron) (6) and serum total antioxidant barrier to hypochlorous induced oxidation by means of OXY-adsorbent test (optimal value > 350 mmol HClO/L sample) (7). The results were expressed as mean ± SD. The comparison among data was performed by using the Student’s t Test. The differences were considered statistically significant for p< 0. 05. When the results of the tests before immersion were compared with that after immersion, in the apnea diver total oxidative balance did not change. In the scuba divers, d-ROMs test values remained unchanged (382. 44 ± 84. 73 CARR U vs. 385. 89 ± 78. 20 CARR U, respectively, p= 0. 77), while BAP test results significantly increased (2217, 11 ± 288, 45 mol/L vs. 2413. 56 ± 362. 93 mol/L reduced iron, respectively p= 0. 009) as well as OXY-adsorbent test values (461. 44 ± 56. 28 mmol/L vs. 517. 33 ± 81. 80 mmol/L, respectively, p= 0. 01). When the results of each diver were considered separately, before vs. after immersion, d-ROMs test result significantly increased only in one scuba. The herein reported evidence show that in apnea diver(s) repeated immersions do not change significantly oxidative balance; however no further general conclusions can be made because only one man was tested and this man showed an impaired oxidative balance at baseline. Most significantly, scuba divers showed after repeated immersion a significant increase of serum antioxidant capacity, as measured by means of both BAP test and OXY-adsorbent test; this datum, although preliminary, is in agreement with previous studies (3, 8, 9) and suggest that hyperbaric-like conditions may activate antioxidant defences in the light of the possible increase of oxidant threats. The Carratelli’s panel showed useful in the global assessment of oxidative stress in <b>apnea</b> and scuba <b>diving</b> who may be considered at risk for oxidative stress. Further studies should be performed in order to confirm the findings of this preliminary report...|$|R
40|$|Marine mammals {{live a life}} of dual {{constraints}} and must balance energetic demands (oxygen consumption) and limited O 2 availability while breath-holding. In order to overcome these dual constraints, marine mammals have developed unique physiological traits to cope with their aquatic environment, thereby taking advantage of a unique foraging niche. Extending breath-hold dive time increases the opportunity to obtain nutrients, but it can be energetically costly if marine mammals exceed the threshold for aerobic metabolism. We know relatively little about the physiological mechanisms employed by these animals that allow them to flourish in such an extreme environment. Due to the difficulty obtaining direct physiological measurements, there are gaps in knowledge for the field of diving physiology, particularly in the understanding of muscle perfusion during a dive. In order to improve our understanding of how marine mammals adjust muscle blood flow (oxygen and nutrients) during diving to increase dive time, we developed and tested a tag with oxygen sensors that attempted to measure O 2 saturation in the muscle of freely deep-diving elephant seals. The purpose of this part of the study aimed at using an archival tag and implanted sensor system to measure physiological variables in freely deep-diving Northern elephant seals. Following the sensor and data logger development, we set out to test a long-held assumption that oximeter use in marine mammals could be calibrated with terrestrial mammal blood. This was of particular importance to this study as calibrations of the oximeter data loggers in the Northern elephant seal were needed. As part of the ability of marine mammals to prolong <b>apnea</b> for <b>diving,</b> some have modified hemoglobin to change its affinity for oxygen. These polymorphisms alter the affinity for O 2, possibly by altering the folding of the protein. Alteration in the quaternary structure may also alter the optical properties of Hb. Oximeters use the change in the optical properties of oxygenated (HbO 2) and reduced Hb (HbR) to determine arterial blood O 2 saturation. Given the differences in Hb isoformss, the optical properties need to be assessed before conventional veterinary oximeters can be used on marine species. Therefore, the objective of this part {{of the study was to}} determine the absorbance spectra of HbO 2 and HbR in several species of marine mammals (killer whale, short-finned pilot whale, beluga whale, and northern elephant seals) and compare these against humans. Whole blood samples were opportunistically obtained during routine health assessment, and the Hb was isolated via a series of centrifugation, dialysis, and filtration steps. The isolated Hb was oxygenated or deoxygenated using 5 % CO 2 in 95 % O 2 or N 2, respectively. Under gas-tight conditions, the HbO 2 and HbR samples were placed in a UV-visible light spectrophotometer and the absorption spectra measured from 600 nm to 1000 nm. The absorption spectra were overlaid and compared between species. The results indicate the absorption spectra are similar between humans and the species investigated and the point where absorbance is equal for HbO 2 and HbR in all species at ~ 800 nm. The results of the Hb study allowed the possibility of properly calibrating the oximeter we surgically implanted in the Northern elephant seal. The oximeter sensor contained 3 LEDs in the visible red, near infrared (NIR), and infrared (IR) spectral regions (emitting at red: 660, NIR: 810, and IR: 940 nm, respectively) and a photo detector. The sensor was attached to the external data logger with a thin (2 - 3 mm diameter) flexible silver (Ag) cable. The external data logger was attached with epoxy to the skin and fur of the seal following implantation of the sensor. In April 2013, 5 northern elephant seals were captured from the A?o Nuevo and were instrumented with the oxygen sensor and data logger via aseptic surgical technique. Following implantation of the muscle O 2 sensor and attachment of logger and satellite and radio transmitters, the animals were allowed to recover. Every 1 - 2 hours signs of inflammation, infection, or changes in swimming behavior were documented and none were observed in any seal. After translocation, all of the seals returned to the A?o Nuevo rookery. All 5 seals implanted returned to A?o Nuevo, had the instrumentation easily and successfully removed, and showed no signs of infection, inflammation or trauma concluding that we were able to develop a surgical technique that minimized the invasiveness of implanting a small sensor into the major swimming muscle of the Northern elephant seal. Free-diving ocean data was collected from the oximeter data logger only from the last two seals implanted, however only 1 out of 5 had oximetry data. Additionally, there was difficulty in calibrating the oximeter/sensor data logger. However, GPS tracks and dive patterns were recorded and analyzed from all 5 seals. All seals were equipped with GPS tags with ARGOS satellite uplink and had similar dive patterns to one another and to previous studies. Furthermore, we were able to obtain data by the end of the field season from one seal out of five indicating that with a few adjustments to the data logger, a second field season may yield a larger sample size and more reliable data...|$|R
