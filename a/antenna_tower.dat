5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot <b>antenna</b> <b>tower</b> in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a microphone and turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, {{the station}} {{suffered}} {{what could have}} been a crippling blow; the collapse of its main antenna at the Bloomingdale transmitter site. WMAQ was able to be on the air, but not at its normal 50,000 watt power. While the main antenna was out of service, NBC found a solution with some history to it to get WMAQ back broadcasting at full power. RCA had a tower in storage in one of its New Jersey facilities that was used as part of its 1939 New York World's Fair exhibit. The tower, which originally came from NBC's WTAM in Cleveland, was shipped to Chicago and became the acting main antenna; it stands today at Bloomingdale. The station launched a new main <b>antenna</b> <b>tower</b> at Bloomingdale in 1951, which was considered to be one of the tallest structures in the US at the time.|$|E
500|$|Each {{transmitter}} {{is connected}} to a dedicated antenna, which has a height corresponding to approximately one-half of its signal's wavelength, and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional. [...] The top half of each <b>antenna</b> <b>tower</b> contains a quarter-wavelength radiating element, and the bottom half uses nine guy wires, connected to {{the midpoint of the}} tower and sloped at one-to-one from the ground—with a length of [...] times the wavelength—as additional radiating elements.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, the Oregonian Publishing Company {{launched}} Portland's {{first commercial}} radio station to feature regular broadcasting, KGW (620 AM). [...] It {{was the first}} newspaper on the West Coast to own and operate its own radio station. [...] The broadcast studios were located on the 11th floor, in the building's tower, and the transmitter was on the 13th floor, above the large clock. [...] The first test broadcast was made on March 23, 1922, and regular broadcasting began on March 25. [...] Initially, the aerials were attached to the 60-foot flagpole atop the building's roof, but later the same year, the station upgraded its signal with larger, more powerful equipment. In October, an [...] <b>antenna</b> <b>tower</b> was erected atop the tower of the building, and a [...] tower was erected atop the nearby Northwestern National Bank Building, and KGW's antenna was attached to a cable connecting the two rooftop towers. [...] In February 1926, KGW moved from the 11th floor into larger studios built on the 7th and 8th floors.|$|E

50|$|Advanced systems {{determine}} the sector {{in which the}} mobile phone is located and roughly estimate also {{the distance to the}} base station. Further approximation can be done by interpolating signals between adjacent <b>antenna</b> <b>towers.</b> Qualified services may achieve a precision of down to 50 meters in urban areas where mobile traffic and density of <b>antenna</b> <b>towers</b> (base stations) is sufficiently high. Rural and desolate areas may see miles between base stations and therefore determine locations less precisely.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} route calls to a phone, the cell towers listen for a signal sent {{from the phone}} and {{negotiate}} which tower is best {{able to communicate with}} the phone. As the phone changes location, the <b>antenna</b> <b>towers</b> monitor the signal, and the phone is [...] "roamed" [...] to an adjacent tower as appropriate. By comparing the relative signal strength from multiple <b>antenna</b> <b>towers,</b> a general location of a phone can be roughly determined. Other means make use of the antenna pattern, which supports angular determination and phase discrimination.|$|R

5000|$|Ground leases {{generally}} address <b>antenna</b> <b>towers</b> or billboards {{in which}} the landowner leases the space, or land, to the cellular provider to build the <b>tower.</b> [...] <b>Antenna</b> <b>towers</b> range between 50 to 300 feet tall. These large, free standing cellular towers can sometimes be “disguised” {{to blend in with}} the natural architecture of the building or the surrounding landscape. An example of this is a church property that may have a tower built to resemble, or in some cases built into an existing steeple. Alternatively, a property owner for another type of property may have a monopine or monopalm cellular structure. These are built to resemble pine or palm trees respectively.|$|R
