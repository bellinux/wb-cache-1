25|$|When {{the winter}} {{navigation}} committee {{appointed by the}} Senate of Finland in 1895 decided that the state-owned icebreakers would assist merchant ships only to the port of Hanko during the winter, the shipowners from Turku did not lose their faith in year-round traffic to their hometown. In 1898 they founded a joint shipping company, Isbrytare Aktiebolaget <b>Avance</b> (Icebreaker Company <b>Avance),</b> to order and maintain an icebreaker {{that would be used}} to maintain year-round traffic to the port of Turku. The new company was partially funded by the city and also received a long-term interest-free loan from the state. With total assets of 650,000 Finnish markkas (FIM) the company ordered a new icebreaker, designed by Swedish engineer C. Bagge, from the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, Germany. The total cost of the new vessel, christened <b>Avance,</b> was FIM 616,000 and in many respects she resembled the first state-owned icebreaker, Murtaja. She was completed and delivered to owners in February 1899.|$|E
25|$|In {{many ways}} <b>Avance</b> resembled the first {{state-owned}} icebreaker of Finland, Murtaja, although her bow was of improved Swedish design which increased her icebreaking capability. The {{angle of the}} stem, {{the first part of}} the ship to encounter and break the ice, was 22 degrees. Still, she was of the same outdated European design as Murtaja and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim at full load. Despite her shortcomings <b>Avance</b> was found out to be suitable for service within the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|<b>Avance</b> {{was offered}} {{to the city of}} Stockholm in 1907, but the Swedish buyers decided that she was too {{expensive}} and broke off the deal. Maintaining the icebreaker {{turned out to be more}} expensive than what was anticipated, and in 1909 the city of Turku purchased the majority of the shipping company's shares.|$|E

25|$|Apu was a Finnish {{state-owned}} steam-powered icebreaker {{built by}} Howaldtswerke in Kiel, Germany, in 1899. Initially {{owned by a}} private shipping company founded by shipowners from the Finnish city of Turku and known as <b>Avance,</b> she was later purchased by the Finnish Board of Navigation and her name was translated into Finnish. Apu remained in service until 1959, when she {{was replaced by the}} new diesel-electric Murtaja.|$|E
25|$|The {{main task}} of <b>Avance</b> was to assist ships between Turku and Stockholm {{although}} scheduled year-round shipping {{service to the}} German city of Lübeck was launched during her first year in operation and she was often needed also in the southern shipping lane passing the island of Utö. She was found out to be suitable for icebreaking in the sheltered waters within the archipelago, but her wheelhouse {{had to be made}} higher shortly after entering service to improve visibility astern.|$|E

The involved are addressed to another structure called the CUMP–Cellule d'urgence médico-psychologique (medical-psychological urgency cell); this is a resting zone, with food and possibly temporary lodging, and a psychologist {{to take care of}} the brief reactive psychosis and avoid post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

25|$|After {{the failed}} attempt to capture the small Finnish {{icebreaker}} <b>Avance</b> from the Russian revolutionaries in March 1918, Finnish captain Theodor Segersven and his men shifted their focus to the much larger Volynets. On 29 March 1918, 53 men dressed as workers boarded the icebreaker and Segersven presented a forged written order for the ship's political commissar claiming {{that he and his}} men were to be transported to Kuivasaari for construction work. When the icebreaker passed the lighthouse of Harmaja, the men broke into the ship's weapons storage and shortly afterwards the Russian crew of 116, half of them armed guards, had been taken into custody. In the evening Volynets, flying the Finnish flag under the command of Segersven, arrived in Tallinn, where she was welcomed by a group of high-ranking German officers, including Prince Henry of Prussia. On 28 April 1918 the captured icebreaker was renamed Wäinämöinen after the legendary Finnish hero. This caused some discontent with the crew who had held a naming contest while the icebreaker was moored in Tallinn and chosen the name Leijona after the Lion of Finland.|$|E

Unable to pay for the extensive repairs, the shipping company sold <b>Avance</b> to the Board of Navigation for FIM 1.58 million. She was repaired at the Ab Crichton shipyard, who was paid FIM 1.25 million for the work, and on 15 December 1923 her name was translated to Apu, meaning [...] "assistance" [...] in Finnish.|$|E

The story further increased tensions between the various factions in the government, though Urrutia asserted publicly that he had [...] "absolutely no disagreements" [...] with Fidel Castro. Urrutia attempted to distance the Cuban government (including Castro) from the growing influence of the Communists within the administration, making a series of critical public comments against the latter group. Whilst Castro had not openly declared any affiliation with the Cuban communists, Urrutia had been a declared anti-Communist since they had refused to support the insurrection against Batista, stating in an interview, [...] "If the Cuban people had heeded those words, we would still have Batista with us ... {{and all those other}} war criminals who are now running away".|$|E
