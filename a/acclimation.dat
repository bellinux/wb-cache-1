5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and <b>acclimation</b> are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with {{the municipalities of}} Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans {{for the establishment of}} a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused by the emergence of El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an <b>acclimation</b> program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Yon's caretakers took careful {{measures}} {{in order to}} avoid <b>acclimation</b> to humans so that one day he could be released back into the wild. Only three staff members were allowed to feed him directly. Other people, including center staff, were only allowed to view him via video camera monitoring. The media were also prohibited from taking direct photographs.|$|E
25|$|In 1800, the prefect {{settled in}} the city, and the {{prefecture}} occupies the episcopal palace after {{the sale of the}} property of the church. In the middle of the 19th century, the causses around Mende are planted with Austrian black pine, this national forest has continued since then. The choice of black pine was due to its ease of <b>acclimation,</b> and its robustness. The presence of this forest often protected Mende from floods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acclimation</b> is {{a process}} that is {{performed}} when adding new marine life to an aquarium, particularly for invertebrates, who lack osmoregulation. This process slowly introduces the organisms to the water composition of the new environment, preventing shock resulting from sudden changes in water chemistry. There are several different methods of doing this, including the use of a drip line, or of a measuring cup or other device to slowly mix water from the aquarium tank into a container with the new animal.|$|E
25|$|The provincial Liberal party {{nominated}} candidate William Fletcher Bredin {{as their}} candidate. He {{was a pioneer}} fur trader who was {{well known in the}} district. Bredin made history by becoming the first person acclaimed to serve in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The provincial Conservative party being very weak in organization in northern Alberta was unable to find a candidate to oppose him. This was the only electoral district during this general election that sent a candidate to Edmonton by <b>acclimation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The larva {{inside the}} egg becomes fully {{developed}} in about {{one month after}} being laid and then enters diapause to overwinter. The egg is in the overwintering stage lasting for eight or nine months. Development ceases {{in preparation for the}} winter. After an <b>acclimation</b> stage, during which the larva inside the egg reduces its water content, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. The larva inside the egg resumes activity in the spring, and reabsorbs water. The larva will then chew through the chorion of the egg and the protective hair of the egg cluster in the spring.|$|E

Andi also hands over emergency blackmail recordings Tama made of corrupt officials he dealt with, telling him to contact Officer Bunawar. Rama asks Andi to come home, but Andi refuses due to his <b>acclimation</b> to his criminal lifestyle. Andi asserts he can protect Rama {{in his role as}} a gang boss, but that Rama can't do the same for him. As he turns around and walks back to the apartment block, the trio exit to an uncertain future.|$|E
25|$|Singlet oxygen {{is highly}} reactive, {{especially}} with organic compounds that contain double bonds. The resulting {{damage caused by}} singlet oxygen reduces the photosynthetic efficiency of chloroplasts. In plants exposed to excess light, the increased production of singlet oxygen can result in cell death. Various substances such as carotenoids, tocopherols and plastoquinones contained in chloroplasts quench singlet oxygen and protect against its toxic effects. In addition to direct toxicity, singlet oxygen acts a signaling molecule. Oxidized products of β-carotene arising from the presence of singlet oxygen act as second messengers that can either protect against singlet oxygen induced toxicity or initiate programmed cell death. Levels of jasmonate {{play a key role}} in the decision between cell <b>acclimation</b> or cell death in response to elevated levels of this reactive oxygen species.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of <b>acclimation,</b> which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau's [...] "making of" [...] documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh's character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion's eyes should be dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of <b>acclimation</b> to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.|$|E

Brown also wrote, [...] "Kurt's arc was subtler this week, and thereby about 50 times more interesting. I [...] am impressed that Glee handling his <b>acclimation</b> to Dalton so truthfully." [...] Canning was similarly impressed, and called Kurt at Dalton [...] "the most solid story" [...] of the episode. There was little approval among reviewers for the [...] "canary in a cage" [...] metaphor in the scene between Kurt and Blaine {{at the end of}} the episode, with Kurt the [...] "canary" [...] in his new Dalton cage; Hankinson characterized it as [...] "super ham-fisted", and others were nearly as harsh.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Kapadia {{portrayed the}} title role of Leela in Leela, an American {{production}} directed by Somnath Sen and co-starring Deepti Naval, Vinod Khanna and Amol Mhatre. Kapadia's part—written specially for her—is that of a forty-year-old married woman and a Mumbai University professor, who, {{after the death of}} her mother, loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California. The story follows Leela's <b>acclimation</b> to her new surroundings and particularly her relationship with one of her students there, Kris (Mhatre), a young Indian-American man. Kapadia noted about working in the film, [...] "While in production, I'm all tensed up, and that is what makes me take my acting to the next level." [...] Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide wrote, [...] "Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama... intelligent, nuanced performance is the film's highlight."

2500|$|Some {{researchers}} {{prefer to}} define the term “photoinhibition” so that it contains all reactions that lower the quantum yield of photosynthesis when a plant is exposed to light. In this case, the term [...] "dynamic photoinhibition" [...] comprises phenomena that reversibly down-regulate photosynthesis in {{the light and the}} term [...] "photodamage" [...] or [...] "irreversible photoinhibition" [...] covers the concept of photoinhibition used by other researchers. The main mechanism of dynamic photoinhibition is non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy absorbed by PSII. Dynamic photoinhibition is <b>acclimation</b> to strong light rather than light-induced damage, and therefore [...] "dynamic photoinhibition" [...] may actually protect the plant against [...] "photoinhibition".|$|E
2500|$|In {{plants and}} microbes, {{changes in the}} lipid {{composition}} of cell membranes {{have been linked to}} cold tolerance. The enhanced resistance to cold treatment appears to be caused by an increased amount of fatty acid desaturases produced under cold stress transforming saturated into unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane. This effect can be reproduced artificially in genetically engineered plants. The changes in membrane lipid composition lead to a higher membrane fluidity, thus keeping the membrane from [...] "freezing" [...] at low temperatures. This [...] "lipid hypothesis of cold tolerance" [...] is less well supported in animals. In fruit flies, cold <b>acclimation</b> does not coincide with a reduced amount of saturated fatty acids, and recent genetic studies on a nematode indicate that the mechanisms involved in cold adaptation in animals may be different from those in plants and microbes.|$|E
2500|$|Due to subtle {{differences}} in length-to-weight ratios, and the discernible feeling at contact, the potential exists for a difficult transition period from metal (college) to wood (pro). To avoid this steep learning curve, {{more and more}} collegiate athletes use the summer as <b>acclimation</b> time with the tools of their future trade. The unapologetic objective of premier leagues is to prepare their amateur players for the Major League First-Year Player Draft, using the summer as a professional proving ground. [...] MLB seizes the logistical opportunity to get talent, professional-caliber equipment, and franchise representatives all in one place. The LCBL believes that such models compromise {{the spirit of the}} league's competitive nature; each game is too much like an audition or stepping stone. [...] Professional baseball is not on the horizon for every college player, in need of a summer league.|$|E
2500|$|Tissue {{residue of}} metals in {{invertebrate}} prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes. This {{may be especially}} important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). However, {{it is challenging to}} develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of organometallic compounds, no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates. A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous-exposure toxicity metrics. [...] These results indicate that whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment. [...] An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from <b>acclimation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 4 April 2011, {{a senior}} Haitian {{official}} announced that Michel Martelly {{had won the}} second round of the election against candidate Mirlande Manigat. Michel Martelly also known by his stage name [...] "Sweet Micky" [...] is a former musician and businessman. Martelly's administration was met with both anger and <b>acclimation.</b> On one hand, he and his associates were accused of being involved in money laundering and various other crimes resulting in countless demonstrations (which on many occasions would become violent). Many criticized him for the slow progression of the reconstruction phase following the recent quake, or for taking credit for projects started in previous administrations. Some disliked him for his vulgar language and risque past which didn't seem to completely go away upon taking presidency. On the other hand, many believe that he was the most productive Haitian president since the Duvalier era. Under his administration, the majority of those left homeless following the quake were given new housing. He offered free education programs to large portions of the Haitian youth as well as an income program for Haitian mothers and students. The administration launched a massive reconstruction program involving principle administration district, Champs-de-Mars, that would modernize and rehabilitate various government buildings, public places, and parks. Michel Martelly put emphasis on foreign investment and business with his slogan [...] "Haiti is Open for Business". Perhaps one of the more major contributions made for the revitalization of the Haitian economy was their push for tourists. Minister of Tourism, Stéphanie Villedrouin, embarked on various competitive tourist projects, including the development of Ile-a-Vache, Jacmel, the north, south-west, and Cotes-des-Arcadins. Tourism had risen significantly between 2012 and 2016. On 8 February 2016, Michel Martelly stepped down at the end of his term without a successor in place.|$|E

50|$|While the {{capacity}} for <b>acclimation</b> has been documented in thousands of species, researchers still {{know very little about}} how and why organisms acclimate {{in the way that they}} do. Since researchers first began to study <b>acclimation,</b> the overwhelming hypothesis has been that all <b>acclimation</b> serves to enhance the performance of the organism. This idea has come to be known as the beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis. Despite such widespread support for the beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis, not all studies show that <b>acclimation</b> always serves to enhance performance (See beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis). One of the major objections to the beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis is that it assumes that there are no costs associated with <b>acclimation.</b> However, there are likely to be costs associated with <b>acclimation.</b> These include the cost of sensing the environmental conditions and regulating responses, producing structures required for plasticity (such as the energetic costs in expressing heat shock proteins), and genetic costs (such as linkage of plasticity-related genes with harmful genes).|$|E
5000|$|... 1. The {{majority}} {{of studies have}} actually been examining developmental <b>acclimation.</b> That is, rather than acclimating an adult individual and testing, they suggest that developmental switches triggered by particular temperatures result in a different mechanism of <b>acclimation.</b> More recently, {{it has been found}} that adult <b>acclimation</b> and developmental <b>acclimation</b> lead to support for different hypotheses.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree to}} which organisms are able to {{acclimate}} is dictated by their phenotypic plasticity or the ability of an organism to change certain traits. Recent research {{in the study of}} <b>acclimation</b> capacity has focused more heavily on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity rather than <b>acclimation</b> responses.

5000|$|Initial {{experiments}} by Leroi et al., {{the first}} scientists {{to address this}} problem, tested only the beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis and not the subsequent hypotheses developed by Huey et al. [...] Colonies of E. coli were acclimated for seven generations in two different temperature conditions: 32 °C and 41.5 °C. Colonies were then competed against each other at those temperatures. He found that, agreeing with the beneficial <b>acclimation</b> hypothesis, colonies acclimated at 32 °C competed better at 32 °C. However, at 41.5 °C, colonies acclimated at 32 °C competed better as well. This led to the authors' rejection of the generality of beneficial acclimation.Huey et al. examined four previously conducted studies, applying the five competing hypotheses, and found {{that none of the}} results of the studies could be entirely explained by beneficial <b>acclimation.</b> Instead, a combination of hypotheses were required to explain the observed patterns of <b>acclimation.</b>|$|E
