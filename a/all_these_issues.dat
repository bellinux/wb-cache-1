25|$|In February 2007, HIM began {{recording}} their sixth album at Finnvox Studios, reuniting with producers Hiili Hiilesmaa and Tim Palmer. The making-of {{the album}} was plagued with problems Valo was facing in his personal life. Among other things, Valo's alcohol abuse had worsened, with him reportedly vomiting and defecating blood at one point. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> came to a head, when Valo suffered a nervous breakdown during the recording process. According to Valo, he did manage to recover, until the mixing stage, when he began drinking again. Eventually Valo {{was admitted to the}} Promises Rehabilitation Clinic in Malibu by the band's manager Seppo Vesterinen. In April 2007, HIM released Uneasy Listening Vol. 2, which peaked at number twelve in Finland. In May 2007, the band's upcoming album was pushed back from a previously announced 10 July release to September. From 25 July to 3 September 2007, HIM toured the US with Linkin Park on their Projekt Revolution Tour, which also included My Chemical Romance, Taking Back Sunday and Placebo. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, HIM held a contest for fans to win a trip to meet the band at tour's opening date in Seattle. The winners of the contest would also be featured on a forthcoming live DVD. HIM also played a number of concerts in the summer of 2007 opening for Metallica, including a show at Wembley Stadium in London, England.|$|E

500|$|There was a British reprint {{edition from}} Pembertons between 1949 and 1954. [...] These were heavily cut, with {{sometimes}} {{only one or}} two stories and usually only 64 pages, though the October and December 1952 issues both had 80 pages. [...] It was published irregularly; initially once or twice a year, and then more or less bimonthly beginning in mid-1952. [...] The issues were numbered from 1 to 18. [...] Three different Canadian reprint editions also appeared for a total of 21 or 22 issues (sources differ on the correct number). [...] Six quarterly issues appeared from Summer 1945 through Fall 1946 from Publication Enterprises, Ltd.; then another three bimonthly issues appeared, from May to September 1948, from Pines Publications. [...] Finally 12 more bimonthly issues appeared from March 1949 to January 1951, from Better Publications of Canada. [...] <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> were almost identical to the American versions, although they are half an inch taller.

40|$|Several well-studied {{issues in}} the {{particle}} swarm optimization algorithm are outlined and some earlier methods that address <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> are investigated from the theoretical and experimental points of view. <b>These</b> <b>issues</b> are the: stagnation of particles in some points in the search space, inability to change the value {{of one or more}} decision variables, poor performance when the swarm size is small, lack of guarantee to converge even to a local optimum (local optimizer), poor performance when the number of dimensions grows, and sensitivity of the algorithm to the rotation of the search space. The significance of each of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> is discussed and it is argued that none of the particle swarm optimizers we are aware of can address <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> at the same time. To address <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> at the same time, a new general form of velocity update rule for the particle swarm optimization algorithm that contains a user-definable function f is proposed. It is proven that the proposed velocity update rule guarantees to address <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> if the function f satisfies the following two conditions: (i) the function f is designed {{in such a way that}} for any input vector y in the search space, there exists a region A which contains y and f (y) can be located anywhere in A, and (ii) f is invariant under any affine transformation. An example of function f is provided that satisfies these conditions and its performance is examined through some experiments. The experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm (with an appropriate function f) can effectively address <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> at the same time. Also,comparisons with earlier methods show that the overall ability of the proposed method for solving benchmark functions is significantly better. Mohammad Reza Bonyadi, Zbigniew Michalewic...|$|R

500|$|In {{an honest}} {{description}} of the disadvantages of Florida, Stowe attempts to disabuse readers {{of the notion that}} the region is perfect. She writes, [...] "In New England Nature is an up-and-down smart, decisive, housemother that has her times and seasons and brings up her ends of life with a positive jerk" [...] and contrasts that characterization with Nature in Florida, an [...] "indulgent old grandmother, who has no particular time for any thing and does every thing when she happens to feel like it". Those who wish to live in Florida, Stowe warns, must also get to know its deficiencies: occasional freezing weather in winter, unsculptable lawns, insects and snakes, and people who disagree as they do everywhere else. Were Florida a woman, Stowe writes, she would be a dark brunette, full of jolly untidiness. Malaria is a fact of life, and Stowe cautions Northerners who may be lured to the region by tales of the mild climate to understand that temperature extremes are common, taking particular effort to address consumptives, or those afflicted with tuberculosis. Those who consider moving to the region should weigh <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> before making their decisions. In The Journal of Southern History, Susan Eacker attests that Stowe's assignment of female characteristics to Florida coincided with her own gradual admission that she may be turning into a [...] "woman's rights woman".|$|E
