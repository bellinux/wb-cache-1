5|$|The video focuses {{solely on}} lead singer, Jason Wade, {{as the rest}} of the band members do not appear in the video. The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on <b>a</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>with</b> {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade sitting back on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the films}} noir of the classic period were {{similarly}} low- and modestly budgeted features without major stars—B movies either literally or in spirit. In this production context, writers, directors, cinematographers, and other craftsmen were relatively free from typical big-picture constraints. There was more visual experimentation than in Hollywood filmmaking as a whole: the Expressionism now closely associated with noir and the semi-documentary style that later emerged represent two very different tendencies. Narrative structures sometimes involved convoluted flashbacks uncommon in non-noir commercial productions. In terms of content, enforcement of the Production Code ensured that no film character could literally {{get away with murder}} or be seen sharing <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> anyone but a spouse; within those bounds, however, many films now identified as noir feature plot elements and dialogue that were very risqué for the time.|$|E
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E

5|$|The Princess of Wales Bedroom {{is named}} after {{the wife of the}} future King Edward VII, Alexandra, Princess of Wales, who stayed at Althorp in 1863 on a visit to see the Red Earl. Although the fabric of the four-poster bed was {{designed}} in 1911, the room is largely Georgian, with deep red walls and furnishings, and contains a notable portrait of a young princess by the Spanish court painter, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. The Queen Mary Bedroom {{is named after}} Mary, the wife of King George V, who visited Althorp in 1913. It contains <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> an extremely tall structure, dated to the 18th century, draped in pea green taffet. Of particular note in the Queen Mary Bedroom are two chairs covered with needlework created by Albert, who was once the chairman of the Royal School of Needlework.|$|E

Despite being launched into the celebrity A-list, Thurman chose not to do any big-budget films for the following three years.

25|$|Especially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical {{laws are}} {{augmented}} by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates {{that a woman}} in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary niddah with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as zavah, and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression, John Brown lost his job and relocated the family to Palmer's Crossing, [...] from Hattiesburg, where he worked at a turpentine factory until he was laid off in 1938. John Brown then moved the family to Lux, Mississippi, {{to be a part of}} a sharecropper farm. During this time, Jesse Brown shared <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> his brothers and attended a one-room school [...] away. His parents were very strict about school attendance and homework, and Jesse Brown walked to school every day. The Browns also were committed Baptists and Jesse, William, and Julia Brown sang in the church choir. In his spare time, Brown also worked in the fields of the farm harvesting corn and cotton.|$|E

However, because of Homer's poor handicraft skills, the bed takes on an ominous appearance and frightens Bart, especially in the darkened room. In his first night in the new bed, far from [...] "laughing himself to sleep", Bart imagines that the face on the headboard of the bed comes to life, intoning with evil glee, [...] "if you should die before you wake...", before collapsing into evil cackling.|$|E
500|$|While most of Zhang's early films {{had been}} {{historical}} epics, Not One Less {{was one of}} the first to focus on contemporary China. The film's main theme involves the difficulties faced in providing rural education in China. When Wei Minzhi arrives in Shuiquan village, the teacher Gao has not been paid in six months and the school building is in disrepair, and chalk is in such short supply that Gao gives Wei specific instructions limiting how large her written characters should be. Wei sleeps in the school building, sharing <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> several female students. The version of the film released overseas ends with a series of title cards in English, the last of which reads, [...] "Each year, poverty forces one million children in China to leave school. Through the help of donations, about 15% of these children return to school." ...|$|E

The family later moved to 10 Danube Street, and the family's poverty meant that Whiteside had to share <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> his two brothers. He remained relatively unscathed by The Troubles as his Protestant parents kept a firm watch on their children {{to ensure that they}} did not stray far from home and that none of them became involved with Ulster loyalism. At the age of around seven he joined the Boys' Brigade, and quickly showed his natural talent for football, scoring ten goals in a game against boys almost twice his age. He was educated at Cairnmartin High School, and became famous in the Shankill area as a footballing prodigy by the age of 11.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Drake going up an {{elevator}} while Songz sings shirtless {{on the edge}} of <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> Drake laying naked on the other side looking on.

Subsequently scenes are shown of Drake and Songz riding through Toronto nightlife, along with the contemplative scenes, such as a young boy playing basketball in which Songz has an illusion that it is him, and little girl blowing a dandelion. The video ends with the skyline and a quote stating, [...] "Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere."- Barack Obama ...|$|E

It was preceded by a lyrics video released on 28 June 2012 on the same platform. The visual begins with shots of a woman smoking and female strippers pole dancing in a club. Inna enterers the building and sits down at the bar starting {{a conversation with the}} female bartender. Subsequently, the singer is seen pole dancing for a gentleman. Later in the video, she cares for a female stripper named [...] "Inndia" [...] with a scar on her face, who sits in a bathtub next to her. Inna also secretly watches how Inndia is beaten by her boss in another scene. Both manage to escape the respective room after Inna breaks a glass over the man's head.

Her dancers joined her to perform [...] "The Hook Up" [...] and a jungle inspired mix of [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U". The show continued with another video interlude featuring a spoof of paranormal-themed shows, [...] "The Onyx Zone", with the master of ceremonies doing a Rod Serling impression and introducing [...] "The Shadow Room". Spears reappeared sitting on a swing to perform [...] "Shadow". During the performance, Spears was lifted into the air above an M-shaped blue ribbon, with performers twirling in the fabric. The performance ended with Spears leaving the stage while the dancers performed to a ballet interlude in flesh colored costumes. The next section began with a video projection of two guards watching Spears in her room through security cameras. Spears appeared on a smaller stage wearing a white robe and performed [...] "Touch of My Hand" [...] in a transparent bathtub. During the performance, she took the robe off to reveal a nude body suit with crystals that resembled her [...] "Toxic" [...] music video outfit. She left the stage briefly to a wardrobe change and reappeared on the mini platform where she descended to the main stage on a pole, wearing pink lingerie and performed [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] on <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> one of her male dancers.

500|$|In 1997, writer Ivan Velez, Jr., who had {{previously}} written for the adult underground Gay Comix, reintroduced Jennifer Kale with a closely cropped [...] "butch" [...] haircut {{in the pages of}} Ghost Rider, portrayed her as related to both Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch, and said that an issue of Howard the Duck had shown Jennifer and Doctor Strange as those who initially brought Howard to Earth-616 (no such issue of Howard the Duck exists, and Jennifer and Doctor Strange did not meet until Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980)), after Howard's series had concluded). In issue #92 (January 1998), he depicted Ketch having a vision of life without Ghost Rider in which Jennifer had been in a relationship with a woman, Marie, for three years. Jennifer's first boyfriend, Jaxon, was shown in Fear #13 (April 1973) and #18 (November 1973) and Man-Thing (vol. 2) #4 (May 1980), by which point they had broken up over Jennifer's sorcery. She was shown sharing <b>a</b> <b>bed</b> <b>with</b> a chubby boyfriend named Bernard Drabble in The Legion of Night (October 1991), which was written by her creator, Steve Gerber (later writer of the GLAAD Award-nominated Hard Time), who thought making her related to both Ghost Riders was bad writing, saying that Marvel should change its name to DC for [...] "Deliverance Comics" [...] for being so inbred (he did not read the issues in question, nor was he told of Jennifer's newfound lesbianism). In Witches, Brian Patrick Walsh presents her with the attitude that having slept with women makes her a [...] "bad girl" [...] as a direct character foil to Topaz as a [...] "good girl" [...] (which does not match earlier portrayals of Topaz), and Satana as [...] "the ugly." [...] In Marvel Zombies 4, Topaz teasingly calls Jennifer [...] "girlfriend" [...] to be ironic. Her entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe now states that she is bisexual.|$|E
