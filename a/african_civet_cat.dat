Eventually, one the interpreters managed to entice some of the canoe-borne natives aboard the Portuguese ships and opened peaceful contact. The natives identified themselves as subjects of king Forosangoli (of the southern bank of the Gambia) and that he, and most other Mandinka kings along the Gambia river were all vassal subjects of the Emperor of Mali (Impatore di Melli), {{and that some of}} the local kings were willing to meet the Portuguese. Following the instructions of his interlocutors, Cadamosto sailed some 60 Italian miles up the Gambia river, reaching the residence of the Mandinka king he called Battimansa, Mandinka for [...] "king of the Batti' (probably Badibu, {{on the north side of}} the river). [...] They were well received, but disappointed at the little evidence of the large amounts of gold they had expected to find.

In medical world, all procedures that are done against the animals called animal testing. Animal testing happens in Indonesia against <b>civet</b> <b>cat</b> animal.

50|$|A 2006 phylogenetic {{study showed}} that the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> {{is closely related to}} the genus Viverra.

The authors suggested that the subfamily Viverrinae should be bifurcated into Genettinae (Poiana and Genetta) and Viverrinae (Civettictis, Viverra and Viverricula).

5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is Civettictis civetta. It is the sole member of its genus, {{and a member of}} the family Viverridae. The <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 as Viverra civetta. In 1915, the English zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock placed the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> in its own genus, Civettictis. A 1969 study noted that this civet showed enough differences from the rest of the viverrines in terms of dentition to be classified under its own genus. The generic name Civettictis is a fusion of the French civette and the Greek ictis, meaning [...] "weasel". The specific name civetta and the common name [...] "civet" [...] come from the French civette or the Arabic zabād or sinnawr al-zabād ("civet cat"). The civet has been a valued domestic animal in Africa since ancient times.|$|R

50|$|Like many mammals, the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> has {{two types}} of fur - under fur and guard hairs. The pelage of the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is coarse and wiry. The coat is unique to each individual, just like a human fingerprint. The dorsal base color of the fur varies from white to creamy yellow to reddish. The stripes, spots, and blotches which cover the animal are deep brown to black in coloration. Horizontal lines are {{prominent}} on the hind limbs, spots are normally present on the midsection of the animal and fade anteriorly into vertical stripes above the forelimbs. The tail of the <b>African</b> <b>civet</b> is black with a few white bands and the paws are completely black. The head, neck and ears are clearly marked. A black band stretches across its eyes {{like that of a}} raccoon and the coloration of its neck is referred to as a double collar because of the two black neck bands.|$|R

40|$|Almost {{half of all}} {{patients}} with community-acquired pneumonia have no identifiable aetiological agents. Our research identified a novel Group IIb coronavirus {{as the cause of}} SARS from the lung tissue of a patient who died from the atypical pneumonia in 2003. About 70 % of new emerging infectious agents originate in animals. <b>Civet</b> <b>cats</b> are the most commonly consumed wild game animal meat in winter and we found civet SARScoronavirus in caged <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> in wild animal markets. However, surveillance of wild and farmed <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> for this novel coronavirus proved fruitless, suggesting that <b>civet</b> <b>cats</b> are simply amplification hosts and not the true virus reservoir. Since the recently identified Lyssavirus, Nipah and Hendra viruses, which have emerged to cause outbreaks of human disease in the last 10 years, were found in bats, we focused on these animals as possible SARS-coronavirus reservoirs. A novel bat SARS-coronavirus highly similar to the human and civet virus was subsequently discovered. If wild animal surveillance had been performed systematically before 2003, the SARS-like coronavirus group might have been discovered and Hong Kong might have better prepared for the SARS epidemic. One year after the discovery of the SARS-coronavirus, we also found another novel Group IIa coronavirus in a patient with community acquired pneumonia returning from Shenzhen. Continuous vigilance is required in surveillance for emerging infectious diseases. For known microbes such as the influenza A H 5 N 1 strain causing the present pandemics in poultry and other birds, continuous surveillance may identify the strains with pandemic potential in humans. The results of this microbiological surveillance have clearly contributed to the epidemiological control, diagnosis and management of influenza A H 5 N 1 and SARS-coronavirus...|$|R
