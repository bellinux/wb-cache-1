The home is decorated with many of the furnishings and household tools that were most common during the frontier era. A family cemetery behind the house is the final resting place of Weiser, his wife Anna and many friendly Indian Chiefs.|$|E
25|$|Mutton {{and pork}} were more common. Poultry, both wild and {{domestic}} and fish {{were available to}} {{all but the most}} destitute. The alternative protein sources would rather have been legumes, eggs, cheese and the amino acids available in the tandem staples of bread and beer. Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to encase a hedgehog in clay <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> it. When the clay was then cracked open and removed, it took the prickly spikes with it.|$|E

Most of the structures were completed by 1697, including the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, now a National Historic Landmark. The Lower Mills saw a gristmill and manor house built on the north bank of the Neperhan River. The Philipses' aim was to make the manor a center for agriculture, which the achieved.|$|E

25|$|The borrindo is {{a simple}} hollow clay ball with three to four {{fingering}} holes, one hole slightly larger than the other three, which are smaller and of equal size to one another. The holes are arranged in an isosceles triangular form. The borrindo {{is made out of}} soft alluvial clay available in plenty everywhere in the central Indus Valley. Being of the simplest design, it is made even by children. Some adults make fine borrindos of larger size, put pottery designs on them, <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> them. These baked borrindos, with pottery designs, are the later evolved forms of this musical instrument, which appears to have previously been used in its simple unbaked form for a long time. The sound notes are produced by blowing somewhat horizontally into the larger hole. Finger tips are placed on smaller holes to regulate the notes. Its ease of play makes it popular among children and the youth.|$|E

Leeds was granted some rights of self-government and it had burgesses who were freemen.

2500|$|An {{electric}} stove {{is a large}} kitchen appliance {{that converts}} electricity into heat in order to cook <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> food. In addition to heated coils atop a stovetop range, glass-ceramic cooktops and induction stoves using electromagnetic induction {{have proven to be}} popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in homes. Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with inventing the electric cooking range in 1882. However, the first such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the United States much earlier to George B. Simpson on September 20, 1859. Simpson's patent, US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater' surface heated by an platinum-wire coil powered by batteries; is described in his own words to be useful to [...] "warm rooms, boil water, cook victuals...".|$|E

Dupont now had over 20,000 men idling along the Guadalquivir while the Spaniards massed and approached. But supplies were scarce and the Spanish peasants had deserted their fields, obliging Dupont's wearied men {{to bring in the}} harvest, grind the grain, <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> their own rations; 600 men fell ill during their fortnight's stay by drinking the putrid waters of the Guadalquivir.

Convinced of his madness, Tamora, Chiron, and Demetrius approach him, dressed as the spirits of Revenge, Murder, and Rape. Tamora (as Revenge) tells Titus that she will grant him revenge on all of his enemies if he can convince Lucius to postpone the imminent attack on Rome. Titus agrees and sends Marcus to invite Lucius to a reconciliatory feast. Revenge then offers to invite the Emperor and Tamora as well, {{and is about to}} leave when Titus insists that Rape and Murder (Chiron and Demetrius, respectively) stay with him. When Tamora is gone, Titus cuts their throats and drains their blood into a basin held by Lavinia.

2500|$|It was Freskin {{who built}} the great {{earthwork}} and timber motte-and-bailey castle in c. 1140 on boggy ground in the Laich of Moray. It was certainly in existence {{by the time the}} king came to visit in 1151. The motte was a man-made mound with steeply sloping sides and a wide and deep ditch that surrounded the base. [...] Timber buildings would have stood on its flat top and would have been further protected by a wooden palisade placed {{around the edge of the}} summit. The motte was accessed from the bailey. [...] This is a wide stretch of earth elevated above the surrounding area but not as high as the motte. [...] At Duffus, the motte would have been reached by steps set into the mound. [...] The bailey contained the buildings necessary to sustain its inhabitants – brew <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> houses, workshops and stables – as well as the living accommodation.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{nowadays}} vorschmack {{is mainly}} associated with Jewish cuisine in Russia, historically {{different versions of}} this dish (...) were known there. These were usually hot zakuski (appetizers) or breakfast dishes. A Gift to Young Housewives, a classical Russian cookbook by Elena Molokhovets, provides three recipes of hot vorschmack in its first edition (1861) and further variants were added in subsequent editions. In one recipe, meat (veal or beef), herring, white bread and onions are minced, mixed with smetana (sour cream) or cream and baked. Other recipes include only herring (without meat), {{as well as other}} ingredients, such as potatoes, eggs and apples. Even more elaborate recipes with further details on cooking techniques are given in another classical Russian cookery textbook, The Practical Fundamentals of the Cookery Art (1899–1916) by Pelageya Alexandrova-Ignatieva. It was in particular proposed to place the mixture of minced ingredients inside a kalach, cover it with grated cheese <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> it au gratin. Similar recipes also appear in Cookery (1955), a major cookbook of Soviet cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{state is}} {{better known as the}} {{producer}} of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is cajeta, a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called charamuscas. It is made with piloncillo, which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for Day of the Dead. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of melon of the same name, which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made {{in other parts of the}} state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, pulque, chile relleno, even shrimp and mole. [...] The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat <b>and</b> <b>bake</b> bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from Acámbaro, especially the type called [...] "pan grande". Other well-known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva Cuín, who, in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.|$|E
