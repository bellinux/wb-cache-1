5000|$|Increasing {{interest}} {{in studies of}} phenomena such as <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> led to a conference in 1977 in Lillestrøm, Norway with participation from scientists of seven different countries.

5000|$|According to Charles Zender, {{black carbon}} is a {{significant}} contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be “the {{most efficient way to}} mitigate Arctic warming that we know of”. The “climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0 W/m2 at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean.” [...] The “soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming.” “Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,” according to NASA scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko. As a result of this feedback process, “BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO2.” [...] When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to <b>Arctic</b> <b>Haze,</b> surface temperatures increase by 0.5 °C. Black carbon emissions also significantly contribute to Arctic ice-melt, which is critical because “nothing in climate is more aptly described as a ‘tipping point’ than the 0 °C boundary that separates frozen from liquid water—the bright, reflective snow and ice from the dark, heat-absorbing ocean.” ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT] Arctic Study of Tropospheric Aerosol and Radiation (ASTAR 2000) were {{conducted}} in March and April 2000.

During the ASTAR 2000, we carried out aerosol profile measurements with a Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) and sky radiance measurements with a Sky-radiometer at Ny-Alesund (79 N, 12 E). Svalbard. The MPL is a useful tool to observe the temporal and spatial aerosol behavior, while the Sky-radiometer measures the. sky radiance and can provide information on aerosol properties such as size distribution, scattering phase function, optical depth, Angstrom parameter, and refractive index.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2001 Since the Alaskan airshed {{north of}} the Alaska Range {{receives}} {{a substantial portion of}} its anthropogenic aerosol and gaseous pollutants through long-range transport, Alaskan air quality is influenced to an unusually high degree by the political and economic events of other countries. An understanding of the political and economic forces at work in the various circumpolar nations is key {{to an understanding of the}} observed decline in <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze,</b> the present state of Arctic air pollution, and likely future developments. It is shown in this thesis that <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> has declined in Interior Alaska over the last decade and a half.

The disequilibrium between the daughter products of 222 Rn, in conjunction with the concentrations of 7 Be in arctic aerosols can be utilized to obtain information on the residence times and sources of the <b>arctic</b> <b>haze.</b> We have carried out a pilot study to explore the feasibility of determining the residence time of aerosols from the <b>arctic</b> <b>haze.</b> Towards this, we have analyzed 10 aerosol samples from two stations, Poker Flat and Eagle, Alaska for the concentrations and activity ratios of 7 Be, 210 Po, and 210 Pb.

The effects of ozone depletion and vertical redistributions of ozone are also examined. Stratus clouds are found to provide significant protection from UV radiation exposure, but while stratospheric aerosols imply increased UVB exposure, <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> results in a decrease. A redistribution of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere tends to decrease UV exposure, but for low solar elevations an increase may occur.

Aerosol chemical compo-sition measured at Barrow, AK during the <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> season is compared for the years 1976 – 1977 and 1997 – 2008. Based on these two data sets, concentrations of non-sea salt (nss) sulfate (SO= 4) and non-crustal (nc) vanadium (V) have de-creased by about 60 % over this 30 year period. Consistency in the ratios of nss SO= 4 /ncV and nc manganese (Mn) /ncV between the two data sets indicates that, although emissions have decreased in the source regions, the source regions have remained the same over this time period.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} multi {{wavelength}} Raman lidar data from Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen have been analysed {{for the spring}} 2014 <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> season, {{as part of the}} iAREA campaign. Typical values and probability distributions for aerosol backscatter, extinction and depolarisation, the lidar ratio and the color ratio for 4 different altitude intervals within the troposphere are given.

A comparison with ground-based size distribution and chemical composition is performed. Hence the aim {{of this paper is to}} provide typical and statistically meaningful properties of Arctic aerosol, which may be used in climate models or to constrain the radiative forcing. We have found that the 2014 season was only moderately polluted with <b>Arctic</b> <b>haze</b> and that sea salt and sulphate were the most dominant aerosol species. Moreover the drying of an aerosol layer after cloud disintegration has been observed.

In altitudes between 2 and 5  km the haze season lasted longer and the aerosol properties were generally more homogeneous than closer to the surface. Above 5  km only few particles were found. The variability of the lidar ratio is discussed. It was found that knowledge of the aerosol’s size and shape does not determine the lidar ratio.
