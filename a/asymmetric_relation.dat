30|$|Small B’s {{primary concern}} in {{international}} relations is the fear and worry about assuring national security, while it is merely one of many concerns of the larger A in their <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations.</b> In the analytic framework of asymmetry, Womack argues that both the larger A and the small B can reach the mutual recognition of common interests by the exchange of what each other needs in their critical and likely unchangeable <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations.</b> If the larger states in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> understand what causes the fear and worries of small ones and in reverse, the small states try to accommodate what the larger ones need, the tension and conflicts caused by <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> can be managed and reach a solution with less dependence on coercive military forces because even in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> the costs of war and military collision are high.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> {{need not}} be total. For example, strict subset or ⊊ is asymmetric, and neither of the sets {1,2} and {3,4} is a strict subset of the other. In general, every strict partial order is asymmetric, and conversely, every {{transitive}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> is a strict partial order. Not all asymmetric relations are strict partial orders. An example of an asymmetric intransitive relation is the rock-paper-scissors relation: if X beats Y, then Y does not beat X; but if X beats Y and Y beats Z, then X does not beat Z.|$|E
5000|$|Let [...] be a (finite or infinite) set of alternatives, whose {{cardinal}} number (the number of elements) [...] {{is at least}} two.A (strict) preference is an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> [...] on :if [...] (read [...] " [...] is preferred to [...] "), then [...]We say that a preference [...] is acyclic (does not contain cycles) if for any finite number of alternatives , whenever , ,…, ,we have [...] Note that acyclic relations are asymmetric, hence preferences.|$|E
5000|$|One {{viewpoint}} on {{this question}} is that cause and effect are of {{one and the same}} kind of entity, with causality an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> between them. That is to say, it would make good sense grammatically to say either [...] "A is the cause and B the effect" [...] or [...] "B is the cause and A the effect", though only one of those two can be actually true. In this view, one opinion, proposed as a metaphysical principle in process philosophy, is that every cause and every effect is respectively some process, event, becoming, or happening. An example is 'his tripping over the step was the cause, and his breaking his ankle the effect'. Another view is that causes and effects are 'states of affairs', with the exact natures of those entities being less restrictively defined than in process philosophy.|$|E
30|$|If the {{outcomes}} of war and aggressive foreign policies in <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> cause high costs {{than those of the}} negotiation in and management of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations,</b> political agents will seek to maintain the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> by looking for what they can do for each other’s interests. From realists’ perspective therefore, asymmetry in international relations is the most crucial international factor that forces small states to choose either balancing or bandwagoning. Although whether small states choose balancing or bandwagoning is contingent on internal and external situations small states face, states are more likely to prefer the less costly to the more costly result. Unlike the dominant wisdom of conventional international relations theories, small states even actively accommodate a large power when they find rationality to create a structure to maximize their interests: security and autonomy. In addition, if political actors could attain an instrument to ensure their interests in domestic politics, the most rational choice of both political agents and actors in asymmetry will be bandwagoning rather than balancing.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain the fact that certain {{properties}} of binary relations are frequently observed in natural language while others do not appear at all. Three features of binary relation are studied: (1) The ability to use the relation to indicate nameless elements. (2) The accuracy with which the vocabulary spanned by the relation can be used to approximate the actual terms to which a user of the language wishes to refer. (3) The ease with which the relation can be described by means of examples. It is argued that linear orderings are optimal according to the first criteria while <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> are optimal according to second. From among complete and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> (tournaments) those which are transitive are optimal according to the third criterion. Copyright 1996 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R

50|$|Nobel Prize laureate Herbert A. Simon and philosopher Nicholas Rescher {{claim that}} the {{asymmetry}} of the causal relation is unrelated to the asymmetry of any mode of implication that contraposes. Rather, a causal relation is not a relation between values of variables, but a function of one variable (the cause) on to another (the effect). So, given a system of equations, {{and a set of}} variables appearing in these equations, we can introduce an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> among individual equations and variables that corresponds perfectly to our commonsense notion of a causal ordering. The system of equations must have certain properties, most importantly, if some values are chosen arbitrarily, the remaining values will be determined uniquely through a path of serial discovery that is perfectly causal. They postulate the inherent serialization of such a system of equations may correctly capture causation in all empirical fields, including physics and economics.|$|E
50|$|A {{major role}} in Bolzano’s logical theory is played by the notion of variations: various logical {{relations}} are {{defined in terms of}} the changes in truth value that propositions incur when their non-logical parts are replaced by others. Logically analytical propositions, for instance, are those in which all the non-logical parts can be replaced without change of truth value. Two propositions are 'compatible' (verträglich) with respect to one of their component parts x if {{there is at least one}} term that can be inserted that would make both true. A proposition Q is 'deducible' (ableitbar) from a proposition P, with respect to certain of their non-logical parts, if any replacement of those parts that makes P true also makes Q true. If a proposition is deducible from another with respect to all its non-logical parts, it is said to be 'logically deducible'.Besides the relation of deducibility, Bolzano also has a stricter relation of 'consequentiality' (Abfolge). This is an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> that obtains between true propositions, when one of the propositions is not only deducible from, but also explained by the other.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{actually}} subtle but interesting {{differences between the}} three most widely credited formulations of the type identity thesis, those of Place, Feigl and Smart which were published in several articles in the late 1950s. Place's notion of the identity involved in the identity thesis is derived from Bertrand Russell's distinction among several types of is statements: the is of identity, the is of equality and the is of predication. Place's version of the relation of identity in the so-called identity thesis is more accurately described as an <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> of composition. For Place, higher-level mental events are composed out of lower-level physical events and will eventually be analytically reduced to these. To the objection that [...] "sensations" [...] do not mean {{the same thing as}} [...] "mental processes", Place could simply reply with the example that [...] "lightning" [...] does not mean the same thing as [...] "electrical discharge" [...] since we determine that something is lightning by looking and seeing it, whereas we determine that something is an electrical discharge through experimentation and testing. Nevertheless, [...] "lightning is an electrical discharge" [...] is true since the one is composed of the other. Similarly, [...] "clouds are water vapor" [...] means that [...] "clouds are composed of droplets of water vapor" [...] but not vice versa.|$|E
30|$|Another {{critical}} factor regarding {{the difficulty in}} managing bilateral asymmetric relationship is the global enlargement of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> {{as a consequence of}} internationally entangled security politics. As the larger A’s security concerns become more comprehensive and complicated and accordingly, its security strategy multifaceted, a clear-cut pattern of asymmetry between two countries turns into a convoluted asymmetry relations. For example, a bilateral asymmetric relationship between China and the Philippines in the region of Southeast Asia develops into a triangular asymmetry as the US involves with global security purposes. In the case of the triangular <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations,</b> the formulation of stable asymmetric relationship will be a more challenging task as the South China Sea disputes display: the Philippines needs to pay attention to not only the China but the US and in a same vein, China should pay attention to the US as well as the Philippines.|$|R

40|$|<b>Asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> among {{stakeholders}} create {{challenges in}} participatory evaluation processes. Power and conflict may hinder equal and genuine communication {{about the value}} of the practices evaluated. Guidelines to deal with these sociopolitical challenges are scarce and usually focus on the need for evaluators to remain distant or to handle resistance. In this article we discuss the use of a specific interpretation of responsive evaluation as an approach to foster dialogues among stakeholders in politically laden contexts. We aim to illustrate how <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> can be dealt with constructively, focusing on inclusion of marginalized groups, mutual learning and good dialogue. Two reflective case narratives are presented of responsive evaluation projects in settings with marginalized groups (client councils in elderly care and psychiatric clients with severe drug abuse).

40|$|To assess {{understanding}} of the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation,</b> the subjects were given six questions for living thing and food categories: "Are dogs (or bananas) all animals (or fruits) ?", "Are animals (or fruits) all living things (or food) ?", and "Are dogs (or bananas) all living things (or food) ?" for the inclusion questions, and "Are animals (or fruits) all dogs (or bananas) ?", "Are living things (or food) all animals (or fruits) ?", and "Are living things (or food) all dogs (bananas) ?" for the no-inclusion questions. When the subjects made the positive answer ("Yes") to the inclusion question and the negative answer ("No") to the corresponding no-inclusion question, they were assumed to understand the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation.</b> The subjects were judged to reach the weak criterion when they made the asymmetric answer {{to any one of}} the three relations. The subjects were judged to reach the strong criterion when they made the asymmetric answers to all relations. Although 3 rd-graders and students could understand the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> very well for two crireria, 5 -yr. -olds were more difficult to understand the relation for the strong than for the weak criteria, which suggest that 5 -yr. -olds have capacity to understand the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> but their understanding is unstable because of incomplete knowledge about hierarchical relations. Developmental changes in understanding the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> were more {{similar to those of the}} no-inclusion than to those of the inclusion relations, which suggest that difficulitv to understand the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> in young children is due to understand the no-inclusion relation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature of {{relationship}} between price and trading volume for 50 Indian stocks. Firstly the contemporaneous and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> between price and volume are examined. Then we examine the dynamic relation between returns and volume using VAR, Granger causality, variance decomposition (VD) and impulse response function (IRF). Mixture of Distributions Hypothesis (MDH), which tests the GARCH vs. Volume effect, is also studied between the conditional volatility and volume. The results {{show that there is}} positive and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relation</b> between volume and price changes. Further the results of VAR and Granger causality show that there is a bi-directional relation between volume and returns. However, the results of VD imply weak dynamic relation between returns and volume which becomes more evident from the plots of IRF. On MDH, our results are mixed, neither entirely rejecting the MDH nor giving it an unconditional support. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} discursive attributive metonymy. This {{linguistic}} phenomenon is clearly opposed to lexical metonymy as it occurs only in discourse {{and as such}} has some distinguishing features: non-frequency, denotation of a situation, semantic discord between the modifier and the modified noun and expressiveness. This research attempts to provide a comprehensive analysis of the functioning mechanism of discursive attributive metonymy. The findings reveal that metonymic transferences in adjectives are based on different types of contiguity between objects and their attributes {{and in some cases}} such contiguity is contextually determined. The functioning mechanism involves <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations</b> between syntactic and semantic functions of an attribute and a syntagmatic shift. Also, in attributive metonymy there is recategorization, i. e. adjectives sometimes change their lexico-grammatical class. In terms of cognitive linguistics, the functioning mechanism is based on the mapping of different mental spaces resulting in conceptual integration and blending. In fictional discourse attributive metonymy is a means to create new occasional meanings and expressiveness.

40|$|Recently, {{cooperative}} {{game theory}} {{has been applied to}} various economic allocation problems in which players are not fully anonymous but belong to some relational structure. One of the most developed models in this respect are communications situations or (symmetric) network situations in which players can only cooperate if there are sufficient communication links in the communication network. Another class of applications considers situations in which the players are hierarchically ordered, i. e. {{they are part of a}} structure of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>relations.</b> Examples are auctions, airport games, sequencing situations, the water distribution problem and hierarchically structured firms.
