25|$|Vaporized PbCl2 {{molecules}} have a bent {{structure with}} the Cl-Pb-Cl angle being 98° and each Pb-Cl bond distance being 2.44Å. Such PbCl2 is emitted from internal combustion engines that use ethylene chloride-tetraethyllead additives for <b>antiknock</b> purposes.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene and its {{derivatives}} are <b>antiknock</b> agents used in {{the fuel}} for petrol engines; they are safer than tetraethyllead, previously used.

25|$|The safety {{data sheet}} for {{unleaded}} gasoline shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts, including benzene (up to 5% by volume), toluene (up to 35% by volume), naphthalene (up to 1% by volume), trimethylbenzene (up to 7% by volume), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (up to 18% by volume, in some states) and about ten others. Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities, with LD50 of 700–2700mg/kg for simple aromatic compounds. Benzene and many <b>antiknocking</b> additives are carcinogenic.|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{separation}} (RS) is {{the combination}} of a chemical (catalytic) reaction and a separation technique. For reactive distillation (RD), the reaction is combined with distillation. Rapid development of RS is the result of growing environmental demands and increasing energy costs. Several processes are performed using RD, such as esterifi-cation, etherification (fuel <b>antiknocks),</b> and hydrodesulphurisation. Other RS techniques also develop rapidly. However, the success has not come without some serious prob-lems. The heterogeneous proton catalysts still do not meet the requirements of many processes. The column internals with a built-in catalyst are rather sparse and expensive and their characteristics are not studied well enough. Therefore intensive studies are still being performed. This study presents a brief summary of the processes realisable with the usage of reactive distillation, catalysts, and column internals. Some interesting re-search results and application examples are also quoted...|$|R
25|$|In the US it {{has been}} used in {{gasoline}} at low levels since 1979, replacing tetraethyl lead as an <b>antiknock</b> (octane rating) additive to prevent engine knocking. Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing tailpipe emissions from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional <b>antiknock</b> properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with isobutane and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E
25|$|As a {{gasoline}} (petrol) additive, benzene increases the octane rating and reduces knocking. As a consequence, gasoline often contained several percent benzene before the 1950s, when tetraethyl lead replaced {{it as the}} most widely used <b>antiknock</b> additive. With the global phaseout of leaded gasoline, benzene has made a comeback as {{a gasoline}} additive in some nations. In the United States, concern over its negative health effects and the possibility of benzene's entering the groundwater have led to stringent regulation of gasoline's benzene content, with limits typically around 1%. European petrol specifications now contain the same 1% limit on benzene content. The United States Environmental Protection Agency introduced new regulations in 2011 that lowered the benzene content in gasoline to 0.62%.|$|E
40|$|The methods {{proposed}} {{to meet the}} 1975 Standards of the Clean Air Act for mobile sources are alternative <b>antiknocks,</b> exhaust emission control devices, and alternative engine designs. Technology surveillance analysis applied to this situation {{is an attempt to}} anticipate potential public and environmental health problems from these methods, before they happen. Components of this analysis are exhaust emission characterization, environmental transport and transformation, levels of public and environmental exposure, and the influence of economics on the selection of alternative methods. The purpose of this presentation is to show trends {{as a result of the}} interaction of these different components. In no manner can these trends be interpreted explicitly as to what will really happen. Such an analysis is necessary so that public and environmental health officials have the opportunity to act on potential problems before they become manifest...|$|R
30|$|Worldwide, about 27 % {{of primary}} energy {{is used for}} {{transportation}}, thus transportation fuels are promising targets to be replaced for a renewable source {{as well as for}} a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Antoni et al. 2007). At the end of the 19 th century, Henry Ford, and Nicholas Otto built engines that could run on ethanol. Then which better candidate than ethanol? Table 1 shows the amounts of vehicles in the world has already reached 1 billion units, and the US has by far the largest vehicle per habitant ratio in the world. The last century witnesses the rise, fall and the rebirth of ethanol (Solomon et al. 2007). Unfortunately, different factors played for the demand for alcohol to decrease and left only as an octane enhancer during and after the Great War. Despite health concerns the discovery of tetraethyl lead as <b>antiknocking</b> agent {{in the beginning of the}} 20 ’s, almost complete discontinued ethanol use in the car industry till the mid 70 ’s.|$|R
40|$|A proton transfer-reaction mass {{spectrometer}} (PTR-MS) onboard a mobile laboratory {{was used to}} conduct emission measurements at eight gas stations in Beijing during the CAREBeijing 2008 campaign. Benzene, toluene, C 8 -, C 9 -aromatics, methanol, MTBE, butenes and pentenes were the major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detected during the measurements. An inter-comparison between the PTR-MS and an on-line GC/MS/FID system was also conducted and the result showed good agreement between the two instruments (Interception 0. 92). A Gaussian point source plume model was applied to evaluate the VOCs emission rates. The results showed that on average about 4. 5 mt of gasoline were emitted from gas stations in Beijing per day. The estimated emission factor (EF) for gas stations due to refueling processes was about 0. 5 kg t − 1, which was significantly lower than a value of 2. 49 kg t − 1 obtained in 2002, indicating a successful implementation of vapor recovery system in the gas stations of Beijing. On average, about 18 ppbv of benzene has been detected at one gas station, {{twice as much as}} the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommended safe chronic exposure level and implying a potential public health concern. MTBE and aromatics were found to be the major <b>antiknocking</b> additives used in gasoline supplied in Beijing. Our results reveal that emissions from gas stations represent an important source for VOCs in megacity Beijing and need to be properly included in emission inventories to assess their roles in photochemical ozone production and secondary organic aerosol formation. Furthermore, promoting methanol-blended fuel in Beijing can be an effective way to reduce toxic air pollutants emission...|$|R

At General Motors, Thomas also worked on a process for extracting bromine from sea water, and with Midgely on making synthetic rubber from isoprene. Thomas left General Motors in 1924 for a job as a research chemist, a joint venture between GM and Esso to make and sell tetraethyllead gasoline additives.|$|E
500|$|Further {{evidence}} of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Mechanisms of harm were better understood, lead blindness was documented, and the element was phased out of public use in the United States and Europe. The United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in 1878 and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in 1898; as a result, a 25-fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from 1900 to 1944 was reported. The last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an <b>antiknock</b> agent, a practice that originated in the United States in 1921. [...] It was phased out in the United States and the European Union by 2000. Most European countries banned lead paint—commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance—for interiors by 1930.|$|E
500|$|A {{graduate}} of Transylvania College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Thomas {{worked as a}} research chemist at General Motors [...] {{as part of a}} team researching <b>antiknock</b> agents. This {{led to the development of}} tetraethyllead, [...] which was widely used in motor fuels for many decades until its toxicity led to its prohibition. In 1926, he and Carroll A. [...] "Ted" [...] Hochwalt co-founded Thomas & Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, with Thomas as president of the company. It was acquired by Monsanto in 1936, and Thomas would spend the rest of his career with Monsanto, rising to become its president in 1950, and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965. He researched the chemistry of hydrocarbons and polymers, and developed the proton theory of aluminium chloride, which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions, publishing [...] a book on the subject in 1941.|$|E
40|$|Glycerol ethers {{have the}} {{potential}} to be used as additives with biodiesel as it can be easily blended and can improve fuel performance. It also facilitates easier passing of fuel through injector. Addition of glycerol ether increases the cetane number and improves the <b>antiknocking</b> property. Glycerol ethers are produced by reacting glycerol with tert-butanol (TBA). To initiate the etherification reaction between two alcohols (glycerol and tert-butanol) on solid acid catalyst, acidity of catalyst is one of the primary requirement since the production of protonated molecules in the reaction mixture is crucial. In this work, acidic solid catalysts were developed by the impregnation of heteropolyacids (HPA, H 3 PW 12 O 40) on SBA- 15 support. The SBA – 15 was prepared by hydrothermal method using P 123 polymer, HCl, water and tetra ethyl ortho silicate (TEOS). Textural properties of the support were determined using N 2 – physisorption method and {{it was found that the}} surface area, pore volume and average pore diameters were 819 m 2 /g, 1. 14 cc/g and 5. 02 nm, respectively. The pore volume can accommodate higher amount of HPA. HPA is acidic in nature and impregnation of HPA on support can develop the acidic functional groups. Generally, HPA is highly soluble in alcohol and addition of Cesium (Cs) can exchange the proton from HPA and inhibit the solubility by the formation of CsxH 3 -xPW 12 O 40. Three different catalyst samples were prepared by changing the Cesium (x) wt% (for x = 1. 5, 2. 2 and 2. 9) on SBA- 15 using incipient wetness method. These samples were dried at 120 ˚C for 2 hours and then calcined at 300 ˚C for 3 hours. The catalysts were characterized by N 2 physisorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis (inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, ICP-MS), thermogravimetric/differential thermal analyzer (TG/DTA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD). The progressive reduction in textural properties of the support with HPA loading is identified in BET-Surface area. The enhancement of functional groups is indicated in FTIR. And also the change in crystalline nature is identified in XRD. The screened catalyst was used for etherification of glycerol. Etherification of glycerol with TBA was performed in 100 ml autoclave and the product consists of mono, di and tri-tert butyl glycerol ethers along with some unreacted glycerol. The effects of various reaction parameters such as temperature, catalyst loading and molar ratio (glycerol/TBA) were studied to obtain an optimized condition for etherification of glycerol. Maximum conversion 76 % of glycerol was achieved at the conditions of 120 °C, 1 MPa, 1 : 5 molar ratio (glycerol/TBA), 3 % (w/v) catalyst loading and 800 rpm for 5 hours. The kinetic studies were performed and a mathematical model was developed using Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. The reaction rate followed second order kinetics and the activation energy of 78 kJ/mol for the reaction signifies that the reaction was kinetically controlled...|$|R
40|$|Functionalized ion-exchange resins are polymer-based {{materials}} {{that can be}} used as catalysts, {{in a wide variety of}} chemical reactions, to achieve highly selective formation of desired products at cost-effective rates. Among these catalysts, sulfonic macroreticular ion-exchange resins have become critical in major industrial processes, such as the etherification of isoolefins to obtain branched ethers. The production of branched ethers, which are oxygenated <b>antiknocking</b> additives used in commercial gasoline formulation, became massive after the phase out of lead-based compounds in the 1990 s. Among the ethers which are used nowadays, the most relevant ones, in terms of their global market share, are methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE). These ethers are industrially obtained under mild conditions (i. e., at relatively low temperature and pressure) by means of the catalytic reaction between 2 -methylpropene (isobutene) and methanol or ethanol, respectively, over sulfonic macroreticular ion-exchange resins. On the other hand, the use of reactants obtained from renewable feedstocks to produce fuel components is convenient, since it allows reducing the carbon footprint of transportation fuels in a context in which the global vehicle fleet is growing. In this sense, the trend has been to use biomass-derived ethanol as an alternative to carbon-based alcohols. Nevertheless, this option has generated concerns regarding its competition with the food supply chain. Alternatively, the use of other alcohols, such as 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol, which can also be obtained through fermentative processes, is becoming more attractive, given that they would not compete with food supplies. Etherification of isobutene with these alcohols would produce heavier ethers (i. e., propyl tert-butyl ether, PTBE, and butyl tert-butyl ether, BTBE, respectively), which have potential benefits as gasoline additives. Nowadays, this is one of the alternatives at hand to achieve an actual improvement of the gasoline formulation in the short- midterm. Even though the industrial-scale production of MTBE and ETBE is today widely spread, relevant physicochemical aspects regarding ion-exchange resins have not been completely understood. Therefore, studies aimed at providing a deeper insight into the catalytic behavior of these materials are of interest. The present PhD thesis contains several studies related to the liquid phase syntheses of MTBE, ETBE, PTBE, and BTBE. In the first place, an investigation was carried out aimed to determine the chemical equilibrium composition and thermodynamic properties of the liquid-phase syntheses of the mentioned reactions. Secondly, a study was performed regarding the products distribution and the conditions that favor side reactions taking place along with etherification reactions. On the other hand, in order to further understanding the catalytic behavior of sulfonic macroreticular ion-exchange resins, relations were established between the catalytic activity of sixteen different resins and their most relevant properties, taking into account the reaction media properties, in the four reaction systems. Also, the viability of an integrated process to obtain, simultaneously, ETBE and BTBE over sulfonic macroreticular ion-exchange resins was studied. In this sense, individual and simultaneous processes were compared, a catalytic screening study was carried out to determine the most suitable catalyst and the effect of temperature and initial reactants composition on the ethers formation, in terms of conversion, selectivity and reaction rate, was discussed. Finally, a kinetic study of three of the studied reaction systems is provided. These are the individual syntheses of PTBE and BTBE and the simultaneous syntheses of ETBE and BTBE over AmberlystTM 35. A mechanistic kinetic model, in terms of components activities, was proposed for each studied reaction and it was found that the most likely reaction mechanism is an Eley-Rideal mechanism in which the surface reaction step is the rate-determining step. Les resines de bescanvi iònic funcionalitzades són materials polimèrics que s’utilitzen com a catalitzadors en una gran varietat de reaccions químiques. Entre aquests catalitzadors, les resines sulfòniques han assolit una importància cabdal en processos industrials molt rellevants, com ara l’eterificació d’isoolefines per obtenir èters ramificats, els quals, s’utilitzen com a additius oxigenats en la formulació de gasolines comercials. D’èters ramificats, se’n pot destacar el metil terc-butil èter (MTBE) o l’etil terc-butil èter (ETBE), que s’obtenen per reacció entre isobutè i metanol o etanol, respectivament, utilitzant resines de bescanvi iònic sulfòniques macroreticulades com a catalitzadors. Alternativament, l’ús d’ 1 -propanol i 1 -butanol produeix propil terc-butil èter (PTBE) i butil terc-butil èter (BTBE). Tot i que la producció d’MTBE i ETBE està molt estesa, hi ha aspectes de la naturalesa fisicoquímica dels processos catalítics en què participen les resines que continuen sense comprendre’s completament. En conseqüència, calen estudis que aportin nous coneixements en aquest sentit. És per això, doncs, que aquesta tesi inclou diversos estudis relatius al comportament catalític de resines de bescanvi iònic sulfòniques macroreticulades en les reaccions de síntesi en fase líquida d’MTBE, ETBE, PTBE i BTBE. Pel que fa a l’estudi sobre l’equilibri químic d’aquestes reaccions, s’han pogut determinar les propietats termodinàmiques corresponents i s’han pogut estimar els increments d’entalpia i entropia de formació dels èters resultants. En relació amb la formació de subproductes en aquests processos, s’ha pogut concloure que totes les reaccions secundàries es veuen afavorides per un increment de la temperatura d’operació. També s’han establert relacions entre les propietats dels catalitzadors i el nivell d’activitat catalítica que presenten i s’ha determinat que la capacitat àcida i el volum expansible de la fase gel de les resines determinen l’activitat catalítica que presenten. Quant a la producció simultània d’ETBE i BTBE, s’ha comprovat que el procés de síntesi simultània de tots dos èters presenta avantatges significatius respecte de la producció de cada èter individualment. Finalment, l’anàlisi cinètica de les reaccions estudiades ha permès determinar que el mecanisme de reacció més probable és del tipus Eley-Rideal i que l’etapa controlant del procés de síntesi és la de reacció en superfície...|$|R

2500|$|The first {{automotive}} combustion engines, so-called Otto engines, {{were developed}} {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century in Germany. The fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas. With a boiling point near 85°C (octanes boil about 40°C higher), it was well suited for early carburetors (evaporators). The development of a [...] "spray nozzle" [...] carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels. Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios, but early attempts were blocked by knocking (premature explosion of fuel). In the 1920s, <b>antiknock</b> compounds were introduced by Thomas Midgley Jr. and Boyd, specifically tetraethyllead (TEL). This innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline. In the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels, and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors. The 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline. These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other <b>antiknock</b> compounds. Subsequently, low-sulfur gasoline was introduced, in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems.|$|E
