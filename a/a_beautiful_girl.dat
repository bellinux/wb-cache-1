25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. It showed <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> in riding habit reclining against {{the neck of}} a horse which is on its knees among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and the juxtaposition of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics; some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject. The picture gained the alternative title of 'The Pretty Horsebreaker'.|$|E
25|$|Ikeda drew inspirations from Kaibutsu-kun and has {{incorporated}} some references later {{into the}} first serialization of the Rosario + Vampire manga. In an interview at Lucca Comics 2012, Ikeda said he is {{a big fan of}} Tim Burton and was inspired by his works, including The Nightmare Before Christmas, and particularly Edward Scissorhands because the monster has a sensitive soul. He had also researched various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. He started with his passion for vampires, and the concept of <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> vampire with a crucifix around her neck and then created the school of monsters, Tsukune, and others afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements.|$|E

One morning, he wakes up from a dream of <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about Mars professing [...] "his love for <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> who {{occupies}} his dreams". Megan Vick for Billboard carries on with her explanation [...] "Mars professes his love..."When you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while/ 'Cause girl you're amazing, {{just the way you}} are". She concludes, [...] "Mars' lyrics aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin". Tim Byron of The Vine said {{the song is}} [...] "effective – the repeated lines {{at the start of the}} verses are catchy". Consequence of Sound's Kevin Barber described the song [...] "Mars sticks to the song’s name and insists that he wouldn’t want to change anything about his particular gal.You believe him, too.

500|$|The song has {{received}} positive reviews by music critics. Digital Spy's Nick Levine gave the song {{four out of}} five stars and described it as a [...] "huge-hearted urbany piano ballad" [...] and compared it to [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] by Alicia Keys with a similar sound as the Keys song. In her review for Billboard, Megan Vick wrote: [...] "Over a breezy piano and vaguely hip-hop breakbeat, Mars professes his love for <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> who occupies his dreams [...] Mars pens lyrics that aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their own skin. With its steady, danceable pulse and singalong chorus, Mars has created a feel-good jam that should establish him as a solo contender in his own right." [...] Nima Baniamer from Contactmusic.com felt that [...] "there is nothing about the single that makes Bruno Mars stand out from all the other RnB artists dominating the charts at the moment", and said, [...] "The song never builds to any climax and it simply falls a bit flat, coming across quite corny and cheesy." ...|$|E
500|$|During 1957 Gielgud {{directed}} Berlioz's The Trojans at Covent Garden {{and played}} Prospero at Drury Lane, but the production {{central to his}} career over the late 1950s and into the 1960s was his one-man show The Ages of Man. He first appeared in this in 1956 and revived it every year until 1967. It was an anthology of Shakespearean speeches and sonnets, compiled by George Rylands, in which, wearing modern evening clothes on a plain stage, Gielgud recited the verses, with his own linking commentary. He performed it all over Britain, mainland Europe, Australasia and the US, including a performance at the White House in 1965. He found there were advantages to performing solo: [...] "You've {{no idea how much}} easier it is without a Juliet. When there's <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> above you on a balcony, or lying on a tomb with candles round her, naturally the audience look at her the whole time, and Romeo has to pull out all the stops to get any attention." [...] His performance on Broadway won him a Special Tony Award in 1959, and an audio recording in 1979 received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. He made many other recordings, both before and after this, including ten Shakespeare plays.|$|E
500|$|The singer penned the autobiographical song [...] "The Outside" [...] as {{an outlet}} at age twelve, {{the year she}} began writing her own songs. Like {{many of the other}} songs she wrote early on, the song {{describes}} the unhappiness and loneliness Swift felt when her love of country music alienated her from her peers. Swift wrote [...] "Tied Together with a Smile" [...] the day she learned one of her best friends was bulimic, a fact which shocked her. She recalled, [...] "How can somebody that seems so strong have such a horrible, horrible weakness? Something that is killing her." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Tied Together with a Smile" [...] describe <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> trying to hide her inner turbulence and mourn that [...] "You're tied together with a smile/But you're coming undone". Swift commented, [...] "I always thought that one of the biggest overlooked problems American girls face is insecurity." [...] She wrote [...] "Should've Said No" [...] according to [...] "something really, really dramatic and crazy happening to [...] and [...] needing to address it in the form of music". The song was a last minute addition to Taylor Swift: Swift had written it two days before mastering was scheduled and booklets were about to be printed; she then called her producer and completed the song overnight.|$|E

He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and classmates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the one thing is common among all artists, singers, painters, etc., is 'pain,' especially, via a heartbreak. JJ jokingly tells himself that since he hasn't yet seen bad times, he won't {{be able to reach}} his idol's (Jim Morrison) level of fame. JJ accidentally sees <b>a</b> <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> rehearsing before a dancing contest called [...] "Shut Up & Dance" [...] when he and his friends go to venue, where the contest is about to start. He goes inside only to see this girl's performance, even though he initially refuses to go inside the auditorium. He watches the performance of Heer Kaul (Nargis Fakhri), a Kashmiri Pandit from St. Stephens College, and overhears that she is the [...] "perfect heartbreaking machine". Since JJ wanted to succeed, and he remembers the word of Khatana telling him that pain, especially from heartbreak, is the way to become an artist, he decides to propose to Heer, but he suffers humiliation, which he deciphers as the perfect method for receiving the heart-break needed to achieve stardom. However, over time, JJ and Heer will become good friends, often going on fun, nasty, naughty, and spicy adventures together and sometimes engaging in behavior which the conservative JJ thinks is risky.|$|E
