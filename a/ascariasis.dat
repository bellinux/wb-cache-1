25|$|About 0.8 to 1.2 {{billion people}} {{globally}} have <b>ascariasis,</b> {{with the most}} heavily affected populations being in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. This makes <b>ascariasis</b> {{the most common form}} of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. As of 2010 it caused about 2,700 deaths a year, down from 3,400 in 1990.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{intestinal}} nematodes cause diseases affecting human beings, including <b>ascariasis,</b> trichuriasis and hookworm disease. Filarial nematodes cause filariasis.|$|E
25|$|Severe <b>ascariasis</b> is {{typically}} a pneumonia, as the larvae invades lungs, producing fever, cough and dyspnoea during {{early stage of}} infection.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascariasis</b> {{may result}} in allergies to shrimp and dustmites due to the shared antigen, tropomyosin; {{this has not been}} {{confirmed}} in the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010 <b>Ascariasis</b> caused about 2,700 {{directly}} attributable deaths, {{down from}} 3,400 in 1990. The indirectly attributable deaths {{due to the}} malnutrition link may be much higher.|$|E
25|$|In some {{severe cases}} of <b>ascariasis</b> {{the numbers of}} Ascaris worms can cause {{intestinal}} obstruction requiring emergency surgery. The obstruction {{may be due to}} a collected mass of worms or to a twisting of the intestine. During the surgery the worms may be manually removed.|$|E
25|$|Transmission {{comes through}} {{municipal}} recycling of wastewater into crop fields. This {{is quite common}} in emerging industrial economies and poses serious risks for local crop sales and exports of contaminated vegetables. A 1986 outbreak of <b>ascariasis</b> in Italy was traced to irresponsible wastewater recycling used to grow Balkan vegetable exports.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{that are}} used to kill roundworms are called ascaricides. Those {{recommended}} by the World Health Organization for <b>ascariasis</b> are: albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate. Other effective agents include tribendimidine and nitazoxanide. Pyrantel pamoate may induce intestinal obstruction in a heavy worm load. Albendazole is contraindicated during pregnancy and children under two years of age. Thiabendazole may cause migration of the worm into the esophagus, so it is usually combined with piperazine.|$|E
25|$|Soil-transmitted {{helminthiasis}} (STH) {{is a type}} of helminth infection (helminthiasis) {{caused by}} different species of roundworms. It is caused specifically by those worms which are transmitted through soil contaminated with faecal matter and are therefore called soil-transmitted helminths. Three types of soil-transmitted helminthiasis can be distinguished: <b>ascariasis,</b> hookworm infection and whipworm infection. These three types of infection are therefore caused by the large roundworm A. lumbricoides; the hookworms Necator americanusor Ancyclostoma duodenale; and by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura respectively.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascariasis</b> is {{a disease}} caused by the {{parasitic}} roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides. Infections have no symptoms in more than 85% of cases, especially {{if the number of}} worms is small. Symptoms increase with the number of worms present and may include shortness of breath and fever {{in the beginning of the}} disease. These may be followed by symptoms of abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Children are most commonly affected, and in this age group the infection may also cause poor weight gain, malnutrition, and learning problems.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that intestinal nematode infections cause 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) to be lost, of which hookworm infections {{account for more than}} 3 million DALYS and ascaris infections more than 1 million. There are also signs of progress: The Global Burden of Disease Study published in 2015 estimates a 46 percent (59 percent when age standardised) reduction in years lived with disability (YLD) for the 13-year time period from 1990 to 2013 for all intestinal/nematode infections, and even a 74 percent (80 percent when age standardised) reduction in YLD from <b>ascariasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{appearance}} of eggs in stools is 60–70 days. In larval <b>ascariasis,</b> symptoms occur 4–16 days after infection. The final symptoms are gastrointestinal discomfort, colic and vomiting, fever, and observation of live worms in stools. Some patients may have pulmonary symptoms or neurological disorders during migration of the larvae. There are generally {{few or no}} symptoms. A bolus of worms may obstruct the intestine; migrating larvae may cause pneumonitis and eosinophilia. Adult worms have a lifespan of 1–2 years which means that individuals may be infected all their lives as worms die and new worms are acquired.|$|E

2500|$|Many, but not all, of {{the worms}} {{referred}} to as helminths belong {{to the group of}} intestinal parasites. An infection by a helminth is known as helminthiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, helminth infection or intestinal worm infection. The same naming convention applies to all helminths whereby the ending [...] "-asis" [...] (or in veterinary science the ending [...] "-osis") {{at the end of the}} name of the worm is added to signify the infection with that particular worm, for example Ascaris is the name of a particular helminth, and <b>ascariasis</b> is the name of the infectious disease caused by this helminth.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ascariasis</b> of STH {{is caused}} by the large {{roundworm}} A. lumbricoides. [...] It is estimated to be the most widespread STH, affecting approximately 1 billion people. The victims constitute about half of the populations in tropical and subtropical areas. Most conditions are mild and often show little or no symptoms. Heavy infections however are debilitating, causing severe intestinal blockage and impair growth in children. Children, compounded with malnutrition, are most infected, with the most common age group being 3 to 8 year olds, with an annual death of about 20,000. Children are more susceptible due to their frequent exposure to contaminated environment such as during playing, eating raw vegetables and fruits, and drinking wastewater.|$|E
2500|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually incidental when the host passes a worm in the stool or vomit. [...] The eggs {{can be seen}} in a smear of fresh feces examined on a glass slide under a microscope and there are various techniques to concentrate them first or increase their visibility, such as the ether sedimentation method or the Kato technique. The eggs have a characteristic shape: they are oval with a thick, mamillated shell (covered with rounded mounds or lumps), measuring 35-50 micrometer in diameter and 40-70 [...] in length. [...] During pulmonary disease, larvae may be found in fluids aspirated from the lungs. White blood cells counts may demonstrate peripheral eosinophilia; this is common in many parasitic infections and is not specific to <b>ascariasis.</b> On X-ray, 15–35cm long filling defects, sometimes with whirled appearance (bolus of worms).|$|E
