25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. <b>Another</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make every woman who wore it irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Schoonzicht's arrival on Deshima, Thunberg was {{appointed}} head surgeon of the trading post. To {{still be able}} to collect specimen of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg soon began to systematically construct networks with the interpreters by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician was in town who seemed {{to be able to help}} the local doctors cure the Dutch disease, <b>another</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> syphilis. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more and more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimen by himself.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} Celtic world Anu {{was the mother}} goddess and {{considered}} to be the mother of all the gods; the Tuatha de Danann. Other references say that she is the mother earth goddess or the Goddess of fertility. On the Cork Kerry border are two mountains called the Paps of Anu (pap is <b>another</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> breast.) On the top of each mountain are stone structures or cairns that when viewed from a distance make the two mountains look like a pair of breasts. Anu was known, in the Celtic World, by several similar names: Danu or Don being the most popular alternatives. She was a Mother-Goddess, the wife of the Sun God, Belenos, and {{considered to be the}} ancestor of all the Gods, the Tuatha dé Danann, who found themselves obliged to reside in the Otherworld when Miled brought the Celts to the British Isles. She still looks down on us from the night's sky where she appears as Llys Don, better known as the constellation of Casseopeia.|$|E

[...] In that context, the Balm of Gilead is a resin used for medicinal purposes (suggesting, perhaps, that the narrator needs to be healed after the loss of Lenore). He also refers to [...] "Aidenn", <b>another</b> <b>word</b> <b>for</b> the Garden of Eden, though Poe uses it to ask if Lenore has been accepted into Heaven.|$|E

Aan 't werp (at the warp) is also possible.
