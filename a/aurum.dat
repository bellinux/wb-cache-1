5|$|The deities' ongoing battles prompt {{an alien}} race called the <b>Aurum</b> to invade Earth for its resources. In response, the warring deities strike a brief ceasefire and unite {{alongside}} the self-proclaimed Sun God Pyrrhon {{in order to}} fight the <b>Aurum.</b> However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power and prove himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the <b>Aurum</b> Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the <b>Aurum</b> Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the <b>Aurum</b> {{to the far side}} of the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|In September 2008, a {{book about}} the Diagram Prize was {{published}} by <b>Aurum</b> Press entitled How to Avoid Huge Ships and Other Implausibly Titled Books. With an introduction written by Joel Rickett, the book was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the prize. It featured a collection of book covers from winners and runners-up from previous years. A follow-up book was released in October 2009, entitled Baboon Metaphysics And More Implausibly Titled Books, including an introduction by Bent.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's body. On his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been profiting off the wars against the Underworld Army, Forces of Nature, <b>Aurum,</b> and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years after}} the <b>Aurum</b> invasion, Pit is {{revealed}} to be trapped inside a ring with no clear memory of what lead to his predicament. Using hosts {{to make his way}} to a ruined city, he meets up with Magnus, who reveals that Palutena's army has turned against humanity and that Pit's body is attacking humans. Using Magnus' body, Pit defeats his body and repossesses it. Viridi then flies him to Palutena's capital of Skyworld which has been reduced to ruins: Viridi reveals that the Lunar Sanctum was a prison holding the Chaos Kin, a soul-devouring creature that escaped when Pit destroyed the base. The Chaos Kin has possessed Palutena and caused her to become deranged. After obtaining the Lightning Chariot, Pit breaks through the defensive barrier around Skyworld's capital and defeats Palutena. The Chaos Kin then steals her soul, leading to both Pit and Dark Pit pursuing the Chaos Kin into its dimension, the Chaos Vortex, to retrieve Palutena's soul. To save Dark Pit from a final attack from the defeated Chaos Kin, Pit overuses his Power of Flight, burning his wings and nearly dying in the process.|$|E

25|$|Strabo {{reports a}} story told {{in his time}} of a semi-legendary {{treasure}} – the <b>aurum</b> Tolosanum, fifteen thousand talents of gold and silver – {{supposed to have been}} the cursed gold looted during the sack of Delphi and brought back to Tolosa (modern Toulouse, France) by the Tectosages, who were said to {{have been part of the}} invading army.|$|E
25|$|Another {{effect of}} Julian's {{political}} philosophy {{was that the}} authority of the cities was expanded {{at the expense of the}} imperial bureaucracy as Julian sought to reduce direct imperial involvement in urban affairs. For example, city land owned by the imperial government was returned to the cities, city council members were compelled to resume civic authority, often against their will, and the tribute in gold by the cities called the <b>aurum</b> coronarium was made voluntary rather than a compulsory tax. Additionally, arrears of land taxes were cancelled. This was a key reform reducing the power of corrupt imperial officials, as the unpaid taxes on land were often hard to calculate or higher than the value of the land itself. Forgiving back taxes both made Julian more popular and allowed him to increase collections of current taxes.|$|E
25|$|Roland Perry {{also kept}} his {{freelance}} journalism going, and this peaked when he covered three US Presidential Campaigns (1976-Jimmy Carter; 1980-Ronald Reagan; 1984-Ronald Reagan). He wrote primarily for leading {{newspapers and magazines}} in the UK, including The Times and The Sunday Times. This led {{to a series of}} political articles for Penthouse Magazine UK, and a documentary on the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 The Programming of the President. Perry further wrote a book, Hidden Power: The Programming of the President, which was published by <b>Aurum</b> Press in 1984 in the UK, and Beaufort Books in the US. At this time, he wrote another political book for French publishers Robert Laffont and Bonnel. Despite having the dreary title Elections sur Ordinateur (Elections on Computer) it was well received in France. It covered the marketing of political candidates in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Noctis Lucis Caelum, {{the crown prince}} of Lucis and the sole playable character who lost his father in the Niflheim invasion, and his fiancée Lunafreya Nox Fleuret, an Oracle and a former princess of Tenebrae. Noctis is accompanied on his journey by three others: Gladiolus Amicitia, Noctis’ bodyguard; Ignis Scientia, a prodigy military tactician and Noctis’ advisor; and Prompto Argentum, a friend of Noctis from a lower social class. Guest characters include Cor Leonis, a legendary warrior of Lucis who acts as a guardian to Noctis’ party, and Iris Amicitia, Gladiolus’ sister. Other key characters are Regis Lucis Caelum CXIII, king of Lucis and Noctis’ father, Gentiana, Lunafreya's attendant; and Cid Sophiar and his granddaughter Cindy <b>Aurum,</b> mechanics who maintain the party's car. The empire of Niflheim is ruled by Emperor Iedolas Aldercapt. Aldercapt's allies include Ardyn Izunia, the imperial chancellor and the game's main antagonist; Ravus Nox Fleuret, Lunafreya's brother and the high commander of the imperial army; Verstael Besithia, the empire's head researcher; and Aranea Highwind, a mercenary dragoon in service to Niflheim.|$|E
25|$|All papal coins, {{with rare}} exceptions, bear {{the name of}} the pope, preceded (until the time of Paul II) by a Greek cross, and nearly all of the more ancient ones bear, either on the obverse or on the reverse, the words S. PETRUS, and some of them, the words S. PAULUS also. From Leo III to the Ottonian dynasty, the coins bear {{the name of the}} Holy Roman Emperor {{as well as that of}} the pope. After the sixteenth century the coat of arms of the pope alone {{frequently}} appears on pontifical coins. There are also found images of the Saviour, or of saints, symbolical figures of men or of animals, the keys (which appear for the first time on the coins of Benevento) etc. From the sixteenth century to the eighteenth, Biblical or moral phrases are added, in allusion to the saint or to the symbol that is stamped upon the coin, e.g. MONSTRA TE ESSE MATREM, SPES NOSTRA, SUB TUUM PRÆSIDIUM, TOTA PULCERA, SUPRA FIRMAM PETRAM, DA RECTA SAPERE (during the Conclave), UBI THESAURUS IBI COR, CRESCENTEM SEQUITUR CURA PECUNIAM, HILAREM DATOREM DILIGIT DEUS, PRO PRETIO ANIMÆ, FERRO NOCENTIUS <b>AURUM,</b> IN SUDORE VULTUS, CONSERVATÆ PEREUNT, TOLLE ET PROIICE, etc. Sometimes allusion is made to an historical event, as the acquisition of Ferrara, or the deliverance of Vienna from the Turks(1683), or to some concession of the pope to his subjects, or to a jubilee year. From the time of Clement X the coins struck at Rome bear a minute representation of the coat of arms of the prelate in charge of the mint, a custom that obtained until 1817. The only instance of a Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church stamping his coat of arms on the coins during the lifetime of the pope is that of Cardinal Francesco Armellini Pantalassi de' Medici, under Adrian VI, in the case of four grossi.|$|E

500|$|After Manning Drive, {{the freeway}} widens to six lanes and {{continues}} clockwise through northeast Edmonton past 153Avenue {{to a second}} crossing of the North Saskatchewan River. [...] Four lanes cross the river southbound and three northbound on [...] bridges. [...] A pedestrian crossing was again included; it is slung underneath the southbound bridge and ties into the existing pathway system. The seven lane freeway rises from the river valley into the Clover Bar area, crossing <b>Aurum</b> Road to a major interchange at Yellowhead Trail, crossing into Strathcona County.|$|E
500|$|Yellowstone is {{the largest}} geyser locale, {{containing}} thousands of hot springs, and approximately 300 to 500 geysers. It is home to half of the world's total number of geysers in its nine geyser basins. It is located mostly in Wyoming, USA, with small portions in Montana and Idaho. Yellowstone includes the world's tallest active geyser (Steamboat Geyser in Norris Geyser Basin), {{as well as the}} renowned Old Faithful Geyser, Beehive Geyser, Giantess Geyser, Lion Geyser, Plume Geyser, <b>Aurum</b> Geyser, Castle Geyser, Sawmill Geyser, Grand Geyser, Oblong Geyser, Giant Geyser, Daisy Geyser, Grotto Geyser, the Fan & Mortar Geysers, & [...] the Riverside Geyser, all in the Upper Geyser Basin which alone contains nearly 180 geysers.|$|E
500|$|The roads travels {{primarily}} through suburban residential {{areas in the}} south and west of the city, and rural farm lands and wetlands in the north. [...] The eastern section of the road separates the Sherwood Park portion of Refinery Row and other industrial and commercial developments in Edmonton to the west, from the balance of Sherwood Park to the east. [...] At its widest point east of Edmonton between Whitemud Drive and Sherwood Park Freeway, Anthony Henday Drive is eight total lanes wide which includes three main travel lanes in each direction plus a fourth lane allowing traffic to merge onto and exit from the roadway. [...] The highest number of through lanes is seven, between <b>Aurum</b> Road and 153Avenue in northeast Edmonton. [...] Most of the road is paved with asphalt, except for an experimental [...] concrete segment in southwest Edmonton, the first of its type in the province. [...] Alberta Transportation intended for the section to have lower long-term maintenance costs, but only six years after construction it required significant repairs. Concrete was not considered for subsequent sections of the road, but overall it was deemed to be a successful experiment that would net long term savings.|$|E
500|$|Tellurium (Latin tellus meaning [...] "earth") was {{discovered}} in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Zlatna, near today's city of Alba Iulia, Romania. This ore was known as [...] "Faczebajer weißes blättriges Golderz" [...] (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Facebánya, now Fața Băii in Alba County) or antimonalischer Goldkies (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to Anton von Rupprecht, was Spießglaskönig (argent molybdique), containing native antimony. In 1782 Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, who was then serving as the Austrian chief inspector of mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore did not contain antimony but was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, Müller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish-like odor; that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. Nevertheless, {{he was not able}} to identify this metal and gave it the names <b>aurum</b> paradoxium (paradoxical gold) and metallum problematicum (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.|$|E
