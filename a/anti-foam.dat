50|$|A {{defoamer}} or an {{anti-foaming agent}} is a chemical additive that reduces and hinders {{the formation of}} foam in industrial process liquids. The terms <b>anti-foam</b> agent and defoamer are often used interchangeably.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to produce baths with bubbles simultaneously in {{and on top of}} the water (as in a poured beer), but the combination has not been popular. Mechanical aeration of a foam bath may produce much more foam than is sought—the Internet is replete with first hand accounts and sometimes photographs of such experiences—and many mechanically aerated baths are hot tubs which are shared and not drained between uses and so are desired to be kept free of non-maintenance materials. Mechanically aerated baths for tissue debridement of burn victims typically have added anti-foaming agents to counteract the film-forming properties that some medicinal additives have as a side effect, but the <b>anti-foam</b> is sometimes omitted or reduced for children to give them more of a pleasant distraction during debridement. Bath fizzies that also foam tend to produce disappointingly little foam when allowed to do so from their own fizz, and aeration of the water loses the gas from the fizz.|$|E

40|$|The Use of <b>Anti-Foam</b> Polypropylene Glycol for The Evaporation of Liquid Radioactive Waste That Contains Detergent]Radiation {{work clothes}} washing {{operation}} in Radioactive Waste Treatment Plant Batan, Puspiptek, Serpong raises 133, 7 m 3 of liquid waste containing detergent concentration of 1, 496 g/l, {{the activity of}} at least 10 - 6 Ci/m 3, and the main radioactive elements in the waste is Cs- 137. Afterward, the waste mixed with other similar liquid waste from reactors and fabrication facilities radioisotopes, then processed through evaporation. When evaporation was running, emergence of foam can cause carry-over that led to distillate contaminated. In order to prevent foam that may cause carry-over, it 2 ̆ 7 s needed <b>anti-foam</b> to defuse foam. <b>Anti-foam</b> material {{that can be used}} in the process of evaporation of liquid radioactive waste containing detergents are silicone oil and polyethylene glycol [1, 3]. <b>Anti-foam</b> material other than silicon oil and polyethylene glycol is polypropylene glycol [2, 3]. Polypropylene glycol is more viscous than the silicone oil and polyethylene glycol so that tend to insoluble which means polypropylene glycol more effective to reduce the amount of foam as polypropylene glycol layer formed on the surface of the foam does not support liquid foam, better than the silicone oil and polyethylene glycol [4]. Ethylene glycol was considerably toxic compared propylene glycol.

This study uses simulated waste with Cs- 137 activity 14, 8 Bq / ml, the content of dry extract 5 g / l, and the variation of the detergent concentration 0, 1247 g/l; 0, 1496 g/l; 0, 187 g/l; 0, 374 g/l; 0, 748 g/l; dan 1, 496 g/l. The results of this study is the use of <b>anti-foam</b> in the process of evaporation on the detergent concentration 0, 1247 g / l to 0, 187 g / l, very effective, because the distillate activity without the use of <b>anti-foam</b> and <b>anti-foam</b> provides a significant difference.

Results {{indicated that this}} <b>anti-foam</b> agent (AFA) increased gas holdup in the waste simulant by about a factor of four and, counter-intuitively, that the holdup increased as the non-newtonian simulant shear strength decreased (apparent viscosity decreased).

The testing contributed to the evaluation of large scale mass transfer of hydrogen in nuclear waste tanks. Due to its radioactivity, the waste was chemically simulated, and due to flammability concerns oxygen was used in lieu of hydrogen. Different liquids were used to better understand the mass transfer processes, where each of the fluids was saturated with oxygen, and the oxygen was then removed from solution as air bubbled up, or sparged, through the solution {{from the bottom of the}} column. Air sparging was supplied by a single tube which was co-axial to the column, the decrease in oxygen concentration was recorded, and oxygen measurements were then used to determine the mass transfer coefficients to describe the rate of oxygen transfer from solution. Superficial, average, sparging velocities of 2, 5, and 10 mm/second were applied to each of the liquids at three different column fill levels, and mass transfer coefficient test results are presented here for combinations of superficial velocities and fluid levels...|$|E

CHP flue gas flow rates were ranging from about 40. 000 Sm 3 /h to 60. 000 Sm 3 /h and the CO 2 content was about 3. 5 vol%. Minimum specific reboiler duties (SRD) of respectively 4. 0 MJ/kg CO 2 and 3. 7 MJ/kg CO 2 were obtained for the aqueous 30 wt% MEA solvent system without and with the addition of <b>anti-foam</b> solution. A minimum SRD of 3. 4 MJ/kg CO 2 was obtained for the aqueous 40 wt% MEA solvent system. Lower SRD and absorber liquid to gas (L/G) ratios were obtained with higher concentration MEA solvents. Increased absorber packing heights resulted in lower SRD. Variation in flue gas supply flow rates and corresponding variations in solvent flow rates, i. e. constant L/G ratios, did not yield any significant variations in SRD. Decreased flue gas supply temperatures resulted in lower SRD. For any future large scale post-combustion capture (PCC) amine plant, engineering aspects such as the flue gas supply temperature and instrumentation monitoring CO 2 content in the flue gas must be evaluated to avoid the chemical equilibrium pinch behavior.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis aimed at controlling the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed cross-linking of bovine α lactalbumin {{and the implications of}} this cross-linking for the foam stabilizing properties. Attention is also given to microreactors and their potential to control the enzymatic cross-linking of proteins. The proportion of cross-linked α lactalbumin dimers, oligomers and polymers could be directed by variations in ionic strength, pH, H 2 O 2, and temperature. Covalent α lactalbumin dimers were proteolytic digested. FTMS analysis of the peptide mixture resulted in the unambiguous identification of a Tyr 18 Tyr 50 dityrosine cross-link. Structural modeling of the α lactalbumin dimer indicated that favorite electrostatics direct the selectivity of the cross-linking reaction and, hence, the formation of an intermolecular cross-link. The formation of the Tyr 18 -Tyr 50 cross-link suggests that further cross-linking of α lactalbumin dimers enables the formation of linear polymers. A microreactor system was set up to obtain control over the reaction conditions to cross-link proteins. The enzymatic cross-linking of α lactalbumin was analyzed as a function of enzyme and substrate(s) feed. The increase in absorption at 318 nm due to dityrosine formation was found to be directly correlated to the decrease in monomeric α lactalbumin and was shown to be a good tool to monitor the cross-linking reaction. The α lactalbumin oligomers produced were investigated for their foam stabilizing properties.
