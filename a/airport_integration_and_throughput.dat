40|$|Verde is an {{environmentally}} responsible commercial transport seating 150 dual-class passengers, designed {{in response to}} the 2008 - 2009 Request for Proposal from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Undergraduate Team Aircraft Design Competition. While the airline industry faces increasing pressures from the cost of fuel and the responsibility of environmental impact, the next generation of this aircraft class must operate more efficiently and address those environmental needs. Therefore, all design decisions for Verde focused first on reducing fuel burn, second on reducing emissions, then noise, and finally on maintaining flyaway cost, <b>airport</b> <b>integration,</b> <b>and</b> passenger comfort. The final design utilizes several green technologies such as an unducted fan engine cycle, biofuel, and use of advanced yet reusable materials to achieve these goals. Much of the design process focused on trying to increase the main wing aspect ratio which required the need to balance structural weight, aerodynamic performance benefits, <b>and</b> <b>airport</b> <b>integration.</b> This fuel-burn-centered philosophy yielded significant improvements, including a fuel block burn for the typical 500 nmi mission of 38. 1 lb/seat and an 10 % improvement in operating cost compared to current operations...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, biology and {{biotechnology}} have witnessed an extraordinary development spanning genomics, proteomics, and metabolics. This progress was so rapid and definite that {{it not only}} {{changed the face of}} modern biology, but indeed altered the way day-to-day business is done in biology and related fields. This scientific advancement came with a need for concurrent technological advances. In this context, the ability to interface sophisticated devices with relevant biological microenvironments has emerged as a critical challenge. Already, novel biomaterials are on the horizon that promise to fulfill the rigid criteria of being both biocompatible under the conditions of a versatile range of biological applications and compatible with the increasing demands for miniaturization, <b>integration,</b> <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of future device architectures. As currently employed solvent-based polymer coatings are increasingly reaching their limits, a range of unconventional materials, such as vapor-based polymer coatings, are discussed as attractive alternatives. One of the main features of vapor-based polyreactions is their versatility in synthesizing both simple and complex polymers with relative ease and at generally low temperatures. The advantages of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique also include control of the composition and architecture of the resulting materials, high accuracy, solvent-free environments, excellent adhesion, and the ability to accommodate custom-tailored surface modifications. For further illustration, selected examples of polymer-based surface engineering approaches using vapor-based polyreactions are discussed in this review. For instance, reactive coating technology uses CVD polymerization to deposit a wide range of chemically functionalized polymer coatings on various substrate materials. Its simplicity in providing chemically reactive groups and its applicability to three-dimensional geometries (e. g. for microfluidics) enables exact tailoring of surface properties and the preparation of biologically relevant microenvironments. CVD-based reactive coatings are compatible with soft lithographic processes allowing for patterning of proteins, DNA, cytokines, and mammalian cells.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{applicability}} of lean accounting <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> accounting in a company with considerable investments in advanced manufacturing technology (AMT). Design/methodology/approach – The paper compares lean accounting <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> accounting with the traditional accounting system the company is using today. The authors investigate the differences between the three alternative approaches and use a case study approach to illustrate the effects of applying different modern accounting approaches in a complex manufacturing setting. Findings – Pair-wise comparisons of the three approaches provide some interesting cost information as to the role of bottlenecks and value streams. Research limitations/implications – The specific results of this study are limited to the case company, but can hopefully contribute to further research on how to combine lean <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> accounting for mixed manufacturing environments, involving both value streams and bottlenecks. Practical implications – Lean <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> accounting provide other perspectives on cost information to traditional accounting, and can therefore be used in combination.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} transport QoS in unreliable networks that focuses on tradeoffs rather than guarantees.

Therefore, we focus on QoS tradeoffs between qualitative parameters such as order and reliability, and quantitative parameters such as delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput.</b> A major theme of our work is that there is "no free lunch"; improvements in reliability and order come at a cost of worsening delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput.</b> Our research has two goals: (1) to understand and characterize the nature of these tradeoffs via analysis, simulation a [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The topological {{characteristics}} of an IEEE 802. 16 mesh network including the tree’s depth {{and degree of}} its nodes affect the delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of the network. To reach the desired trade-off between delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput,</b> all potential trees should be explored to obtain a tree with the proper topology. Since the number of extractable tree topologies from a given network graph is enormous, we use a genetic algorithm (GA) to explore the search space and find a good enough trade-off between per-node, as well as network-wide delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput.</b> In the proposed GA approach, we use the Pruefer code tree representation followed by novel genetic operators. First, for each individual tree topology, we obtain expressions analytically for per-node delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput.</b> Based on the required quality of service, the obtained expressions are invoked in the computation of fitness functions for the genetic approach. Using a proper fitness function, the proposed algorithm is {{able to find the}} intended trees while different constraints on delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of each node are imposed. Employing a GA approach leads to the exploration of this extremely wide search space in a reasonably short time, which results in overall scalability and accuracy of the proposed tree exploration algorithm...|$|R

40|$|A {{wireless}} network in which packets are broadcast {{to a group}} of receivers through use of a random access protocol is considered in this work. The relation to previous work on networks of interacting queues is discussed and subsequently, the stability <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> regions of the system are analyzed and presented. A simple network of two source nodes and two destination nodes is considered first. The broadcast service process is analyzed assuming a channel that allows for packet capture and multipacket reception. In this small network, the stability <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> regions are observed to coincide. The same problem for a network with N sources and M destinations is considered next. The channel model is simplified in that multipacket reception is no longer permitted. Bounds on the stability region are developed using the concept of stability rank <b>and</b> the <b>throughput</b> region of the system is compared to the bounds.

Although researchers have already done a lot of theoretic analysis on transmission delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> in WSNs, very few of them gave the real sensor test results. In this master thesis, an experimental platform for wireless sensor networks has been designed and implemented. The purpose of building this platform is to find out the systems and environment factors that have impacts on the transmission delay <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of single hop and multi-hop wireless sensor networks. With this platform, we can combine the theory analysis with real field tests and give more reliable analysis on the performance analysis problem. The platform is based {{on one of the most}} popular operating system for sensor networks –Contiki OS and the Maxfor CM 5000 sensor motes. On this experimental platform, several groups of simulation tests and field tests in single hop, multi-hop and multi-path sensor networks have been implemented.

40|$|The {{study was}} necessitated {{by the fact}} that the {{throughput}} rates of accounting students studying at distance learning institutions in South Africa are disturbingly low when compared to students studying at residential universities. Bearing in mind the magnitude of the University of South Africa’s (Unisa’s) market share of accounting students in South Africa, it was pivotal to comprehend the unique challenges related to retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of these students. This thesis reports on a case study of the use of mobile phones in an Accounting module by applying the theories of didactic conversation and transactional distance to understand the retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> rates of the Accounting students in an open distance learning (ODL) environment. Considering the landscape of accounting education in South Africa, the specific challenges faced by accounting students at Unisa and the recent scholarly discourse on retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> of distance education students, this study contributes to the limited theoretical understanding of students’ retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> rates in an Accounting module at Unisa. This theoretical understanding has been obtained through combining the transactional distance theory of Moore (1973) and the didactic conversation of Holmberg (1982) in a single conceptual framework. By applying this framework, this thesis makes an original contribution to the deepening understanding of the retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> rates of accounting students in an ODL environment. The study has shown that retention <b>and</b> <b>throughput</b> rates can be improved through the lessening of the transactional distance between facilitator and student and by improving the quality and extent of the two-way didactic conversation in the learning process.
