5|$|In August 804, Harun {{dispatched}} another raid {{under his}} general Ibrahim ibn Jibril. The Arabs crossed into Asia Minor through the Cilician Gates and raided freely. Nikephoros {{set out to}} meet them, but was forced to return before he could do so, due to some unspecified event <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> (Warren Treadgold surmises news of a possible conspiracy). On his march home, however, the Arabs launched a surprise attack at Krasos in Phrygia and defeated his army. According to al-Tabari, the Byzantines lost 40,700 men and 4,000 pack animals, while the Emperor himself was wounded three times. The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor confirms that the imperial army lost many men and that Nikephoros was almost killed himself; saved only by the bravery of his officers.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1940, No. 605 {{moved on}} {{rotation}} to Croydon Aerodrome {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Walter Churchill. McKellar scored a further four victories in a single mission on 9 September. McKellar attacked with the sun <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> with his Squadron, save for one Section which was left to provide top cover against Bf 109s. The attack was made head-on to break up the German bomber formation which consisted of a large mass of He 111s. He destroyed three He 111s with a single, 12–second burst. The first He 111 exploded. It damaged a second which rolled over and dived down into the ground. McKellar then moved his fire to a third. Its port wing snapped off. He then destroyed a Bf 109 in the afternoon giving him a fourth success.|$|E
5|$|Soult {{was in a}} dilemma. He {{could not}} defend both the {{important}} southwestern port of Bordeaux and Toulouse. He decided that trying to hold Bordeaux would put the Garonne Estuary <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> {{and that it would}} be difficult to obtain food in that area. Therefore, the French marshal determined to operate to the east in the direction of Toulouse. On 2 March, the Allies clashed with the French at Aire-sur-l'Adour in a combat that cost the French about 250 men killed and wounded, including 12 officers, and 100 captured. Hippolita Da Costa sent his Portuguese brigade to attack a strong position. When it was repulsed with losses of five officers and 100 men, Da Costa failed to rally the soldiers and was replaced in command. British losses were 156 killed and wounded in the 2nd Division. After this action with Hill, Harispe abandoned Aire. Soult withdrew to a position between Maubourguet and Plaisance where his army was left alone for ten days.|$|E

25|$|These recount how Enoch {{was taken}} up to Heaven and was {{appointed}} guardian of all the celestial treasures, chief of the archangels, and the immediate attendant on God's throne. He was subsequently taught all secrets and mysteries and, with all the angels <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> fulfils of his own accord whatever {{comes out of the}} mouth of God, executing His decrees. Much esoteric literature like the 3rd Book of Enoch identifies Enoch as the Metatron, the angel which communicates God's word. In consequence, Enoch was seen, by this literature, and the Rabbinic kabbala of Jewish mysticism, as having been the one which communicated God's revelation to Moses, in particular, the dictator of the Book of Jubilees.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battles}} on the 14th, {{a large number}} of {{refugees}} appeared at Erfurt. At first they were refused entrance, but later the gates were opened and soon the city thronged with at least 12,000 demoralized soldiers. Attempts were made by some officers to return the troops to their regiments, but the men refused to cooperate. By noon on the 15th, Murat was near Erfurt with the leading elements of his cavalry. General-Major von Jung-Larisch stood in battle line in front of the city. His position was poor, with the Gera River <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> so he ordered his infantry to retreat into the city. Murat's horsemen charged and drove Jung-Larisch's cavalry back across the river, capturing an artillery battery. Losses for this action are not given.|$|E

25|$|New England won {{the coin}} toss and drove 63 yards in 14 {{plays for the}} winning field goal, with Brady {{completing}} eight consecutive passes for 45 yards, including a 20-yard completion to J. R. Redmond and a 6-yard pass to Patten at the Raiders' 22-yard line on fourth down and 4 to keep the drive alive. While Vinatieri's game-tying kick had the wind <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> this drive was into {{the wind and the}} Patriots wanted to move closer. Following five runs from Antowain Smith for 15 yards and one from Brady for 2, and after a drive of more than eight minutes, Vinatieri and Walter cleared snow away from where the ball would be spotted. Vinatieri then gave New England its first lead of the game, making a 23-yard field goal to win.|$|E
25|$|Under Ney's command, Loison {{participated in}} the {{successful}} Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo from 26 April through 9 July. When the VI Corps advanced into Portugal after its victory, it encountered Robert Craufurd's Light Division near the small Portuguese fortress of Almeida. Unwisely, Craufurd decided to resist the French with the Côa River <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Seizing his chance, Ney hurled Loison's division at the British and Portuguese light infantry in the Battle of the Côa on 24 July 1810. The French foot soldiers, {{with help from the}} 3rd Hussar Regiment, quickly crumpled Craufurd's left flank. Part of the Light Division stampeded, but the troops quickly rallied and the division barely managed to escape across the lone bridge. Ney then tried to storm the span, but the attack failed with heavy losses. The Allies reported 308 casualties, while French losses numbered 531. The Siege of Almeida lasted from 25 July to 27 August. On the latter day, a lucky hit blew up the main powder magazine, killing 600 Portuguese troops and wounding 300 more. The 4,000 surviving members of the garrison quickly surrendered.|$|E
25|$|Following Lin's Winter campaign, Mao {{wanted him}} to attack targets farther south, but Lin {{disagreed}} {{because he did not}} want to leave a strong enemy <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and he believed the defeat of a strong city would force Chiang to abandon the Northeast. By May 25, 1948, the Northeastern Field Army had completely encircled Changchun, including its airfield, and for the rest of the siege the Nationalist commander, Zheng Tongguo, depended entirely on supplies airdropped into the city. On May 19, Lin submitted a report to Mao in which he expected heavy casualties. By July 20 the siege was at a stalemate, and Lin deferred to Mao, allowing some of his army to attack Jinzhou farther south, beginning the Liaoshen Campaign. When Chiang airlifted reinforcements to defend Jinzhou, Lin ordered his army to abandon the siege and return to Changchun, but Mao disagreed and overruled him, and Lin was ordered to engage the defenders in a decisive confrontation. On October 14, the Northeast Field Army began its assault on Jinzhou with 250,000 men and the bulk of Lin's artillery and armour. After nearly 24 hours of fighting, Lin's forces were victorious, suffering 24,000 casualties but capturing the enemy commander, Fan Hanjie, and 90,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

Khudair was a {{fisherman}} from Sitra {{who lived in a}} ramshackle house. He had three sons: Hassan (21), Jaffar (14) and Ahmed (9), as well as an 18-year-old daughter. Jaffar said: [...] "I was with my father in Pearl Roundabout when they attacked. We were asleep at first, when I woke up, I started moving away, but my father told me to endure, stay and not fear. Then we heard screams and rushed there. For a few seconds he spoke to the security forces, asking them to stay away from women and children, but they shot him in the chest. He fell to the ground and I couldn't see him after tear gas cloud covered the place." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1846, Fillmore was {{involved}} in the founding of the University of Buffalo, and became its first chancellor; he served until his death in 1874. [...] He had opposed the annexation of Texas, and spoke against the subsequent Mexican-American War, seeing it as a contrivance to extend slavery's realm. Fillmore was angered when President Polk vetoed a river and harbors bill that would have benefitted Buffalo, and wrote, [...] "May God save the country for it is evident the people will not". New York governors at the time served a two-year term, and Fillmore could have had the Whig nomination in 1846, had he wanted it. [...] He actually came within one vote of it while maneuvering to get the nomination for his supporter, John Young, who was elected. [...] A new constitution for New York state provided that the office of comptroller was made elective, as were the attorney general and some other positions that were formerly chosen by the state legislature. Fillmore's work in finance while Ways and Means chairman made him an obvious candidate for comptroller, and he was successful in getting the Whig nomination for the 1847 election. With a united party <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> Fillmore won by 38,000 votes, the largest margin a Whig candidate for statewide office would ever have in New York.|$|E

[...] His point total was the highest of any athlete at the meet.

2500|$|By {{the evening}} of 4 August, Wellesley's army was safe on the south bank of the Tagus at Arzobispo. But Cuesta stubbornly refused to retreat. When Mortier's vanguard {{appeared}} before him, the Spanish general lashed out at it and drove it back. Believing that he was facing both Cuesta and Wellesley, Mortier became cautious and called for assistance from Soult. During the entire day of the 5th, Cuesta foolishly offered battle with the bridge of Arzobispo <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> yet Mortier held back. By 6 August when both Soult and Mortier were massed for battle, they found their quarry had withdrawn across the Tagus. As it happened, {{this was the only}} opportunity that the French had for inflicting great damage on the Spanish army. As historian Charles Oman wrote, [...] "Soult's best chance was gone before he was even aware of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 23 April in the Battle of Ratisbon, there was another wild cavalry melee between 56 squadrons of Austrian {{horsemen}} and the French cavalry of Nansouty, Saint-Sulpice and Louis-Pierre Montbrun.

At the Battle of Aspern-Essling on 21–22 May, the division of Saint-Sulpice reached the battlefield late on the first day as Napoleon found himself with 31,400 soldiers facing 100,000 Austrians with a river <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> Reinforced in the night to 50,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry and 144 guns, Napoleon ordered an advance by his infantry and cavalry on the Austrian center. This attack pressed back the Austrians until their army commander Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen led forward the Reserve Corps. Despite a series of cavalry charges, the French were pushed back into their small bridgehead and forced to retreat that night.|$|E
