25|$|A {{combustor}} is {{a component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} <b>a</b> <b>burner,</b> combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E

25|$|Act One {{told the}} story of DNA as a thing that makes human {{different}} and understand each other, Act two {{told the story}} of how children use their dream to imagine, Act three {{told the story of}} how Youths use dream to express themselves, Act four told the story of how family support become an inspiration for athletes and coaches to achieve success in sports. While Act 5, the conclusion told the story of how Singaporean athletes welcome, make friends and unite with the athletes other country of Southeast Asia regardless of language, race and belief. Soon after the last act, the torch of the Games was carried into the stadium from a dragon boat across the Kallang basin by several Singapore’s former and current generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. The current sportsmen are Clement Teo of Dragon Boat, Liang Xiaoyu of Badminton, Muhammad Naqib Asmin of Athletics, Gabriel Yang of Judo, Dinah Chan of Cycling, Enrico Marican of Hockey, Shanti Pereira of Athletics, Derek Wong Zi Liang of Badminton, while the former sportsmen are Annabel Pennefather of Hockey, Prema Govindran of Athletics and Wong Shoon Keat of Badminton. The cauldron was lit by former football sportsman, Fandi Ahmad and his son and current football sportsman, Irfan Fandi. The cauldron’s design was inspired by the DNA which represents the unity of nations, communities and individuals of Southeast Asia. It is made of stainless steel, 19.2-metre-high and has a LED screen on it that displays information such as the time and weather during the Games. It also has <b>a</b> <b>burner</b> that able to project a 1.5m- to 4m-high flame and 11 bars within the structure that represent the different countries participating at the Games. A colourful fireworks display then erupted over the skyline surrounding the National Stadium, signalling the official commencement of the Games. The ceremony concludes with the President leaving the stadium.|$|E

2500|$|After cooking paella, {{there is}} usually a layer of toasted rice {{at the bottom of}} the pan, called socarrat in Spain.

40|$|Experiments and {{numerical}} simulations {{were conducted}} to investigate {{the effects of the}} burner diameter on the flame structure and extinction limit of counterflow non-premixed methane flames in normal gravity and microgravity. Experiments were performed for counterflow flames with a large inner diameter (d) of 50 mm in normal gravity to compare the extinction limits with those obtained by previous studies where <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> (d < 25 mm) was used. Two-dimensional (2 D) simulations were performed to clarify the flame structure and extinction limits of counterflow non-premixed flame with a three-step global reaction mechanism. One-dimensional (1 D) simulations were also performed with the same three-step global reaction mechanism to provide reference data for the 2 D simulation and experiment. For microgravity, the effect of the burner diameter on the flame location at the centerline was negligible at both high (ag = 50 s− 1) and low (ag = 10 s− 1) strain rates. However, <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> flame (d = 15 mm) in microgravity showed large differences in the maximum flame temperature and the flame size in radial direction compared to <b>a</b> large <b>burner</b> flame (d = 50 mm) at low strain rate. In addition, for normal gravity, <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> flame (d = 23. 4 mm) showed differences in the flame thickness, flame location, local strain rate, and maximum heat release rate compared to <b>a</b> large <b>burner</b> flame (d = 50 mm) at low strain rate. Counterflow non-premixed flames with low and high strain rates that were established in <b>a</b> large <b>burner</b> were approximated by 1 D simulation for normal gravity and microgravity. However, a counterflow non-premixed flame with a low strain rate in <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> could not be approximated by 1 D simulation for normal gravity due to buoyancy effects. The 2 D simulations of the extinction limits correlated well with experiments for small and large burner flames. For microgravity, the extinction limit of <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> flame (d = 15 mm) was much lower than that of <b>a</b> large <b>burner</b> flame when ag ≤ 20 s− 1. For normal gravity, the extinction limit of <b>a</b> small <b>burner</b> flame (d = 23. 4 mm) was also much lower than that of the large burner flame when ag ≤ 35 s− 1.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. One {{of the problems of}} natural gas pressure reduction stations (City Gate Stations; CGS) is blocking the gas passage due to reduction of temperature in the regulator. In order to prevent this problem, gas is heated in a gas heater before pressure dropping. The gas heater includes, gas passage pipes, intermediate fluid and hot fluid passage pipes. Hot fluid is combustion products of <b>an</b> atmospheric <b>burner</b> and has high thermal energy. Since utilizing of porous media technology has many advantages in combustion systems, the idea of applying this type of burners instead of conventional burners has been widely considered. In this study, replacing of <b>an</b> atmospheric <b>burner</b> with <b>a</b> porous <b>burner</b> in the gas heater of a CGS has been studied numerically. First, by modelling the gas heater with <b>an</b> atmospheric <b>burner,</b> the values of produced heat fluxes at the different equivalence ratios have been studied. The results of these simulations determine the condition which leads to maximum efficiency of combustion in the atmospheric burner. The results indicate that maximum thermal efficiency of the atmospheric burner is obtained in 60 percent of the primary air. In the next step, by modelling the gas heater with <b>a</b> porous <b>burner</b> at various sizes and various equivalence ratios, produced heat fluxes were calculated and compared with those of the atmospheric burner. According to the results, although the gas heater of the pressure reduction station has not been designed for <b>a</b> porous <b>burner,</b> but utilizing <b>a</b> porous <b>burner</b> instead of the atmospheric burner, causes the thermal performance of the heater to increase. The increase of thennal performance at lean equivalence ratios is higher. ej 201...|$|R
