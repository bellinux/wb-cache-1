5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running back. His style of power running was an ideal fit for Parcells' offensive strategy <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> with chattering fear. High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E

5|$|During Euro 2008, new Dutch manager Marco van Basten {{changed the}} side's {{formation}} to 4–2–3–1, preferring the midfield trio of Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt, with Robben left to battle {{for a position}} with Robin van Persie on the wing. In the group match against France, which the Netherlands won 4–1, Robben was brought on at half-time. He dragged {{the ball out of}} reach of a defender near the half-way line and paced his way ahead of three defenders, then crossed straight to Van Persie, who powered a shot into the goal past France goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. At 2–0, Thierry Henry scored a goal for France, making it 2–1, but almost directly after the restart, Robben was played through by Sneijder <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> at the France goal and was forced into an acute angle, but despite the angle, he shot the ball into the net past Coupet.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs made a {{good start}} to the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression, batted consistently. He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring Australian Imperial Forces cricket team and centuries {{in each of the}} three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season. His rescheduled benefit match raised £1,670, money he used to open a sports shop in London. The shop was {{successful}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> it until just before his death. The additional income gave him considerable financial independence. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first class matches, more than anyone else, at an average of 60.32. After a winter working in his shop, his good form continued into 1920. Four of his eleven first-class centuries came in consecutive innings in June, and he totalled 2,827 runs at 58.89. He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|The {{background}} of the Spanish Civil War {{dates back to the}} end of the 19th century, when the owners of large estates, called latifundia, held most of the power in a land-based oligarchy. The landowners' power was unsuccessfully challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors. In 1868 popular uprisings led to the overthrow of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the short-lived First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. After the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, Carlists and anarchists emerged in opposition to the monarchy. Alejandro Lerroux helped bring republicanism to the fore in Catalonia, where poverty was particularly acute. Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909. After the First World War, the working class, the industrial class, and the military united in hopes of removing the corrupt central government, but were unsuccessful. Fears of communism grew. A military coup brought Miguel Primo de Rivera to power in 1923, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> Spain as a military dictatorship. Support for his regime gradually faded, and he resigned in January 1930. There was little support for the monarchy in the major cities, and King Alfonso XIII abdicated; the Second Spanish Republic was formed, whose power would remain until the culmination of the Spanish Civil War. Monarchists would continue to oppose the Republic.|$|E

Sires lost that election by a 71% to 26% margin. Sires left the Republican Party in 1994 and became a registered independent. Sires rejoined the Democratic Party in 1998. Just three years later, he became Speaker.|$|E
25|$|Texas won {{the coin}} toss and elected to defer their {{possession}} {{to the second}} half. UT therefore kicked off to Iowa, who went on offense. The Hawkeyes drove 77yards for a touchdown. Texas was unable to score, and returned the ball to Iowa. Iowa's Drew Tate threw a pass to Andy Brodell, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> 63yards for a touchdown. Texas {{was able to get}} some points on the board when walk-on placekicker Ryan Bailey made a 27-yard field goal to make the score 14–3 {{at the end of the}} first quarter.|$|E

When visiting his father, the two often went to the movies—which Dean says led to his love of film. His childhood was a difficult one, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> away from home when he was 16 years old. He graduated from Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, in 1986.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition {{at the end of}} his first term, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> for reelection unopposed, the only president other than Washington to do so. A single elector from New Hampshire, William Plumer, cast a vote for John Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in the Electoral College. He did so because he thought Monroe was incompetent. Later in the century, the story arose that he had cast his dissenting vote so that only George Washington would have the honor of unanimous election. Plumer never mentioned Washington in his speech explaining his vote to the other New Hampshire electors.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Kyffin Freeman, {{owner of}} the Herne Bay Argus, formed the Hampton-on-Sea Estate Association Limited in 1879 with £60,000 capital in £10 shares, but only sold 398 shares. He built a bandstand, built {{foundations}} for reading rooms and planned tennis courts, a miniature golf course, an archery green and a recreation ground. He organised a sports day with free teas and amusement rides, but too many visitors arrived <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> out of teas. With builder Thomas Richard Geelong Hoe he planned a housing estate, and a Hampton-on-Sea nameboard was put up at Herne Bay railway station in expectation of this, but then he died in 1880. The company was eventually dissolved in 1905.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas Cooke (February 3, 1717September 14, 1782) was a {{governor}} of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations during the American Revolutionary War, and after Rhode Island became a state, he continued in this position {{to become the first}} Governor of the State of Rhode Island. Born in the maritime town of Providence, he early in life followed the sea, eventually becoming a Captain of ships. This occupation led him to become a merchant, becoming highly successful in this endeavor, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> a distillery and rope-making business as well.

25|$|Edwin Hubble {{was born}} to Virginia Lee Hubble (née James) (1864–1934) and John Powell Hubble, an {{insurance}} executive, in Marshfield, Missouri, and moved to Wheaton, Illinois, in1900. In his younger days, he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities, although he did earn good grades in every subject except for spelling. Edwin was a gifted athlete playing baseball, football, basketball, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> track in both high school and college. He played a variety of positions {{on the basketball court}} from center to shooting guard. In fact Hubble even led the University of Chicago's basketball team to their first conference title in 1907. He won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906.|$|E
25|$|Teamed with Brazilian Wilson Fittipaldi Júnior for the 1973 season, Reutemann {{scored two}} podium {{finishes}} and {{seventh in the}} Drivers' Championship. For 1974, the Gordon Murray-designed Brabham BT44 was a vast improvement and the team finished a close fifth in the Constructors' Championship. Reutemann took the first three victories of his F1 career at South Africa, Austria and the United States. He might have won the first race {{of the year in}} Argentina, too, but the Brabham team apparently failed to properly fuel his car <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> out of fuel with less than two laps to go while safely in the lead. Though he matched Drivers' Champion Emerson Fittipaldi's win total, inconsistent performances in the other races left Reutemann sixth in the season standings.|$|E
25|$|In week 8, the Lions {{hosted the}} St. Louis Rams. The Rams {{got on the}} board first {{in the first quarter}} with a 41-yard field goal by Josh Brown. In the second quarter, the Lions' Matthew Stafford threw an {{interception}} into the end zone to James Butler but he was tackled by running back Kevin Smith for a Lions safety. Near halftime, the Rams performed a successful fake field goal when kicker Josh Brown passed it to Daniel Fells <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> it in 36 yards for a touchdown. Both teams went scoreless in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Lions’ QB Matthew Stafford ran it in himself from 4 yards out for a TD, and tied it up with a 2-point conversion catch by Maurice Morris. The Rams took the lead near the end though with a 25-yard run by Steven Jackson.|$|E

25|$|At Cook's {{original}} landing {{contact was}} made with the local Australian Aboriginal inhabitants. As the ships sailed into the harbour, they noticed Aborigines on both of the headlands. At about 2 pm they put the anchor down near a group of six to eight huts. Two Aborigines, a younger and an older man, {{came down to the}} boat. They did not accept the offer of gifts from Cook, whose lack of knowledge of Aboriginal custom may have prevented him from behaving acceptably in such exchanges. A musket was fired over their heads, which wounded the older man slightly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> towards the huts. He came back with other men and threw spears at Cook's men, although they did no harm. They were chased off after two more rounds were fired. The adults had left, but Cook found several Aboriginal children in the huts, and left some beads with them as a gesture of friendship.|$|E

Between 1962 and 1966 he was seconded to the National Trades Union Congress, and then worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs. He was with the Security and Intelligence Division of the Defence Ministry when the Laju incident happened in 1974, and was among the government officers who agreed to accompany terrorists who had bombed petroleum tanks to Kuwait to secure the release of civilian hostages and ensure the terrorists' safe passage.

But in the second quarter the Irish came out firing and less than a minute into the 2nd Brady Quinn handed the ball to Darius Walker <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>ran</b> it in 10-yds for the Touchdown making it 7-3 Notre Dame. After a Defensive stop by the Irish they got the ball back and on 9 plays drove down field topping it off with Quinn throwing a 13-yd pass to Jeff Samardzija for the Irish's 2nd TD, but Gioia missed the PAT making the score 13-3 Notre Dame.
