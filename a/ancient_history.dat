These various sets were very popular and could be purchased together (commentary and prints) or individually. The prints were usually hung on walls or bound into books.|$|E
50|$|When {{people today}} read <b>ancient</b> <b>histories,</b> {{confusion}} sometimes {{results from the}} fact that in earlier ages historical characters changed their names more often than is common for people to do today, and ancient historians often told earlier stories using later names.|$|R

40|$|Arnason and Raaflaub’s edited volume, The Roman Empire in Context: Historical and Comparative Perspectives, is {{the fifth}} volume in a series {{entitled}} The <b>Ancient</b> World: Comparative <b>Histories.</b> The overarching aim of the series is to bring a comparative perspective to studies of <b>ancient</b> <b>histories,</b> and earlier titles focus either on content or geography. This is the only volume to date that focuses on a specific civilization, and Rome is of course significant enough to merit its own volume...|$|R

5|$|All the {{buildings}} are interconnected through steps and stairways made in rocks. There are a few rickety wooden bridges along the paths and stairways also to cross over.

The Monasteries have <b>ancient</b> <b>history</b> of occupation by monks, as hermitages.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus Siculus (c.a. 90 BC–c.a. 30 BC), another Greek writer, {{wrote in}} Book IV of his Bibliotheca Historica that the Campanian plain was called fiery (Phlegrean) {{because of the}} peak, Vesuvius, which had spouted flames like Etna and showed signs of the fire that had burnt in <b>ancient</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's <b>ancient</b> <b>history,</b> after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, organisms that continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E

5|$|Awarded a {{scholarship}} to Oxford, Williams read Greats (pure Classics followed by <b>Ancient</b> <b>History</b> and philosophy) at Balliol. Among his influences at Oxford were WS Watt, R Meiggs, RM Hare, Elizabeth Anscombe, Eric Dodds, Eduard Fraenkel, David Pears and Gilbert Ryle. He shone {{in the first part}} of the course, the pure classics (being particularly fond of writing Latin verses in the style of Ovid) and graduated in 1951 with a congratulatory first in the second part of the course and a prize fellowship at All Souls.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is relatively}} common, resulting {{in more than}} 20,000 emergency room visits {{a year in the}} United States. It is {{the most common type of}} fatal poisoning in many countries. In the United States non-fire related cases results in more than 400 deaths a year. Poisonings occur more often in the winter, particularly from the use of portable generators during power outages. The toxic effects of CO have been known since <b>ancient</b> <b>history.</b> The realization that hemoglobin was affected by CO was determined in 1857.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of an {{extensive}} formal education, Brock appreciated its importance. As an adult, he spent much time reading {{in an attempt to}} improve his education. He read many works on military tactics and science, but he also read <b>ancient</b> <b>history</b> and other less immediately practical topics. At the time of his death, he owned a modest library of books, including classic works by Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Samuel Johnson.|$|E
50|$|The Book of Llandaff places Tewdrig's {{story in}} the {{territory}} of the historical Kingdom of Gwent (the southeastern part of modern Monmouthshire), though it states that he was a king of Glywysing.

5|$|Herodotus has {{documented}} that the Qedarites were {{called upon to}} assist Cambyses II of the Persian empire in his invasion of Egypt in 525 BCE. The Qedarites and Nabataens were known to enjoy close relations, even engaging as wartime allies against the Assyrians. It {{is possible that the}} Qedarites were eventually incorporated into the Nabataen state which emerged as the strongest Ishmaelite presence in northwestern Arabia c. the 2nd century CE. In The Cambridge <b>Ancient</b> <b>History,</b> some of the (Arab) Nabataens mentioned by Diodorus in his retelling of events that took place in 312 BCE are said to be Qedarites.|$|E
5|$|The Møntergården {{cultural}} history museum of Odense {{is one of}} the most notable remaining Renaissance buildings of the city, built in 1646 by the nobleman Falk Gøye. It has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in Odense, and is named after the narrow street Møntestræde adjacent to the building, where a coin workshop once operated in around 1420.
