25|$|Following the {{homecoming}} halftime festivities, Seth Armbrust blocked an Eastern Michigan punt, <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> {{it up for}} a touchdown. At this point, Kyle McMahon began to move the Eagles, scoring on their next two possessions, including a TD pass to Kinsman Thomas for 77 yards. Mallett would respond with a 55-yard bomb to Cobi Hamilton, and Davis capped the drive two plays later {{to make it a}} 56-13 game. After another EMU score, Mallett would find Lucas Miller for a sixteen-yard score. EMU would tack on another score, but the Razorbacks prevailed in a 63-27 rout.|$|E
25|$|Pressed by Wrede's 7th Bavarian Infantry Regiment, {{plus two}} of Hügel's Württemberg battalions, Radetzky {{conducted}} an orderly retreat on the Siegenburg road, {{covered by the}} grenzers and Kienmayer's grenadiers under General-Major Konstantin Ghilian Karl d'Aspré. He managed to shepherd the V Armeekorps trains safely through Pfeffenhausen before the Bavarians cut him off. Wrede pursued aggressively <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> up many prisoners but failed to capture the bridge, which the Austrians burned. Even so, the Bavarians kept up the pressure, crossing the shallow Große Laber at 11:00 PM to attack. Radetzky fell back to a hill called the Hornbach where his rear guard skirmished with the Bavarians into the early morning hours.|$|E

Sepak takraw is {{a game in which}} a rattan ball is kept in the air without using hands. A traditional game played during the rice harvest season was throwing gasing, which are large tops weighing around , which are thrown by unfurling a rope <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> off the ground while spinning. They are known to be able to spin for over an hour. Other sports are dragon dancing and dragon-boat racing.

500|$|Both {{newspapers}} {{went into}} gradual decline under their new proprietors. James Gordon Bennett, Jr.—"a swaggering, precociously dissolute lout who rarely stifled an impulse"—had a mercurial reign. He launched the New York Telegram, an evening paper, {{in the late}} 1860s and kept the Herald the most comprehensive source of news among the city's newspapers. [...] Bennett also bankrolled Henry Morton Stanley's trek through Africa to find David Livingstone, <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> the competition on the Battle of Little Big Horn. However, Bennett ruled his paper with a heavy hand, telling his executives {{at one point that}} he was the [...] "only reader of this paper": [...] "I am the only one to be pleased. [...] If I want it turned upside down, it must be turned upside down. [...] I want one feature article a day. If I say the feature is black beetles, black beetles it's going to be." [...] In 1874, the Herald ran the infamous New York Zoo hoax, where {{the front page of the}} newspaper was devoted entirely to fabricated story of animals getting loose at the Central Park Zoo.|$|E

500|$|Mother India, {{its star}} Nargis, and the {{director}} Khan received many awards and nominations. Nargis won the Filmfare Best Actress Award in 1958 {{and became the first}} Indian to receive the Best Actress award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in present-day Czech Republic. Mother India won the Filmfare Award for Best Film <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> several other Filmfare awards including Best Director for Khan, Best Cinematographer for Faredoon Irani, and Best Sound for R. Kaushik. In 1958, the film became India's first submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was chosen as one of the five nominations for the category. The international version, 120 minutes long, was sent for the Oscars. Additionally, this version had English subtitles, and dropped Mehboob Productions' logo, which featured the Communist hammer and sickle, to appease the Academy. The 120-minute version was later distributed in the US and UK by Columbia Pictures. The film came close to winning the Academy Award, but lost to Federico Fellini's Nights of Cabiria by a single vote. Khan was utterly disappointed at not winning the award. [...] "He had seen the other films in the fray and believed Mother India was far superior to them" [...] recalled Sunil Dutt years later. It also won two awards at the 5th National Film Awards in 1957: an All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film and Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Hindi.|$|E
2500|$|Campese regards his {{performance}} in Australia's 1994 Test against Western Samoa one of his four best performances for the Wallabies (along with the 1984 and 1988 Barbarian matches and the 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand). Australia defeated Western Samoa 73-3, in which Campese scored a try. Campese scored the first try of the Test when, while about to be tackled into touch, he executed a chip kick, followed it through, <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> the ball off the ground {{for one of his}} greatest tries. Peter Jenkins in Wallaby Gold would later report that, [...] "Campese on the wing was dynamic..." ...|$|E

[...] However, Constable Krempkau, mistakenly believing that Campbell had shot him, then fired his pistol twice at Campbell before losing consciousness from loss of blood. [...] Krempkau's first bullet struck Campbell's gun and broke his right wrist, while the second hit him in the foot. [...] Campbell screamed in pain <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> up his gun from the ground with his left hand. [...] Stoudenmire whirled from Hale and instantly fired at Campbell who dropped his gun again, grabbed his stomach and collapsed onto the ground. [...] Stoudenmire walked slowly toward Campbell and coldly glared at him. [...] In agony, Campbell yelled, [...] "You big son of a bitch! You murdered me!" [...] Stoudenmire said nothing. [...] Both Campbell and Krempkau died within minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage consisted of four spruce Warren girders, fabric covered behind the engine. [...] The pilot's cockpit {{was at the}} trailing edge of the wing and behind there was a deep, rounded fabric covered decking. [...] Immediately in front of the pilot's cockpit was an extra fuselage bay containing the passenger's position, placed over the centre of gravity so that the trim would not be disturbed by their presence or absence. [...] The fuel tanks of the Kite were in the wing roots, again to minimise changes in trim. [...] The mounting for the Pobjoy Niagara engine, constructed of square section steel tube, started immediately in front of the passenger compartment. [...] The 90hp (67kW) 7-cylinder radial engine was a development of the earlier Pobjoy R; [...] two notable features were that it was very compact, with a diameter of only 26 in (660mm) and that it was geared down with a gearbox that off-set the propeller shaft vertically. [...] The result was a very neat cowling with Pobjoy's characteristic front ring and trade mark baffle. [...] The exhaust exited from shallow individual cowls <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> channels. [...] The Pobjoy drove a two-bladed propeller.|$|E
2500|$|In 1892, when Charles F. Lummis {{was visiting}} Acoma {{he listened to}} the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. [...] Their access to the top was on the {{southern}} side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a [...] "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone {{on either side of the}} fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end[...] The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. [...] In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. [...] One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the [...] "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down <b>and</b> <b>scooped</b> up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.|$|E
