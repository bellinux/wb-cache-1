25|$|A {{person may}} be a citizen of Namibia at birth either through {{operation}} of Article 4(2) (jus sanguinis, i.e. descent from a Namibian citizen) or a restricted form of jus soli (Article 4(1), birth in Namibia to a citizen parent or to <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> is ordinarily and legally resident in the country).|$|E
25|$|Children born in New Zealand (or {{on board}} a ship or {{aircraft}} registered in New Zealand) on or after 1 January 2006 will acquire New Zealand citizenship by birth only if {{at least one parent}} is a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident (including Australian citizens). Children born to <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> is a permanent resident of the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau also qualify.|$|E
25|$|Philippine {{nationality}} law {{is currently}} {{based upon the}} principle of jus sanguinis and, therefore, descent from <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> is {{a citizen of the}} Republic of the Philippines is the primary method of acquiring national citizenship. Birth in the Philippines to foreign parents does not in itself confer Philippine citizenship, although RA9139, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000, does provide a path for administrative naturalization of certain aliens born in the Philippines. Filipinos of mixed ethnic origins are still referred to today as mestizos. However, in common parlance, mestizos are only used to refer to Filipinos mixed with Spanish or any other European ancestry. Filipinos mixed with any other foreign ethnicities are named depending on the non-Filipino part.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer term at Meadowbank School for Girls, the most prestigious prep school in England, Miss Bulstrode, the popular but aging headmistress, has {{no reason to believe that}} the {{challenges}} facing her on parent's day will be more than the occasional irate or inebriated parent. She scarcely listens when Mrs Upjohn, <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> <b>who</b> just happened to have worked in military intelligence, looks out of the window and notices on the school campus someone whom she recognises and whose presence at the school apparently surprises but does not alarm her. Mrs Upjohn is still talking but the crucial moment has passed. After Mrs Upjohn leaves, Miss Bulstrode has a sudden feeling that she has missed something to which she should have paid attention but then dismisses the notion.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{related to}} the {{territory}} may in theory be eligible to claim the British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC status) through a personal connection to the areas (i.e., birth on the territory before 1983, or born after 1983 to <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> were born on the territory before 1983); but unlike most other British Overseas Territories, there is no provision in the 2002 amendment of the British Nationality Act 1981 by which British citizenship (with the right of abode in the United Kingdom) can either be claimed through automatic entitlement or be applied for by means of registration, from or through a sole personal connection to the Base Areas. (In comparison, the 2002 act bestowed British citizenship on all other BOTCs.) Hence non-British and non-military personnel with the connection to the territory can only {{live and work in}} the UK through their EU (Cypriot) citizenship and not through their BOTC status.|$|E
500|$|A {{single parent}} (also termed lone parent or sole parent) is <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> cares {{for one or}} more {{children}} without {{the assistance of the}} other biological parent. Historically, single-parent families often resulted from death of a spouse, for instance in childbirth. [...] Single-parent homes are increasing as married couples divorce, or as unmarried couples have children. Although widely believed to be detrimental to the mental and physical well being of a child, this type of household is tolerated.|$|E

The first is a 15th-century Polish lament of Mary, mother of Jesus, the second a message written on the wall of a Gestapo cell during World War II, and the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings. The first and third movements are written from the perspective of <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> <b>who</b> has lost a child, and the second movement from that of a child separated from a parent. The dominant themes of the symphony are motherhood and separation through war.|$|E
