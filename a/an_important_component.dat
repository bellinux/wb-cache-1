The cathedral and the Viking Ship Museum attract more than 100,000 visitors per year although 20 years ago there were some 200,000 visits to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that}} the occupying Nazi German {{administration}} fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E

His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).|$|E

Ionized selenium (Se+24) {{is one of the}} active mediums used in X-ray lasers.|$|E
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> {{of the sound}} of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E

5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, {{in a private}} house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved in 1923. This {{was followed by}} several studies of long-chain fatty acids, which are <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the {{structure of}} phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that {{is closely related to}} porphyrin molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll.|$|E

The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark forms <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the {{commercial}} gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently {{pose a threat to}} U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance, one example being the requests to end the export of ball bearings (<b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E

5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Boston's harbor {{activity}} was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (adopted during the Napoleonic Wars) and the War of 1812. Foreign trade returned after these hostilities, but Boston's merchants had found alternatives for their capital {{investments in the}} interim. Manufacturing became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the city's economy, and the city's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid-19th century. Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods {{and led to a}} proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E
5|$|Complement, <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>component</b> for serology, {{was first}} {{isolated}} from {{the blood of the}} guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure {{is similar to that of}} humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.|$|E
