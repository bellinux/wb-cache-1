5|$|The {{point at}} which Mars's geocentric {{longitude}} is 180° different from the Sun's is known as opposition, which is near the time of closest approach to Earth. The time of opposition can occur as much as 8.5 days away from the closest approach. The distance at close approach varies between about 54 and about 103millionkm due to the planets' elliptical orbits, which causes comparable variation in angular size. The last Mars opposition occurred on May 22, 2016 at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 76millionkm. The next Mars opposition occurs on July 27, 2018 at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 58millionkm. The average time between the successive oppositions of Mars, its synodic period, is 780 days; {{but the number of}} days between the dates of successive oppositions can range from 764 to 812.|$|E

5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E

5|$|Thebe is the {{outermost}} {{of the inner}} Jovian moons, and orbits Jupiter at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 222,000km (3.11 Jupiter radii). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.018, and an inclination of 1.08° relative to the equator of Jupiter.

5|$|At 20:30 {{the parents}} left 5A to dine {{with their friends}} in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas {{restaurant}}, located {{on the other side}} of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 82 metres (295ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Cape Esperance, the Japanese Army opted to reinforce its troops on Guadalcanal. To protect their transport convoy from enemy air attack, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent Haruna and Kongō, escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, to bombard the American air base as Henderson Field. Because of their high speeds, these two battleships could bombard the airfield and then withdraw before being subjected to air attack from either land-based warplanes or American aircraft carriers. On the night of 13 – 14 October, these two battleships shelled the area of Henderson Field from <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> , firing 973 14-inch high-explosive shells. In the most successful Japanese battleship action of the war, the bombardment heavily damaged both runways, destroyed almost all of the U.S. Marines' aviation fuel, destroyed or damaged 48 of the Marines' 90 warplanes, and killed 41 Marines. A large Japanese troop and supply convoy reached Guadalcanal on the next day.|$|E

5|$|Oberon orbits Uranus at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 584,000km, {{being the}} {{farthest}} {{from the planet}} among its five major moons. Oberon's orbit has a small orbital eccentricity and inclination relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 13.5days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Oberon is a synchronous satellite, tidally locked, with one face always pointing toward the planet. Oberon spends {{a significant part of}} its orbit outside the Uranian magnetosphere. As a result, its surface is directly struck by the solar wind. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere are struck by the magnetospheric plasma, which co–rotates with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below).|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic habitable zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of habitable planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E

5|$|The moat was {{situated}} at <b>a</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 20m {{from the outer}} wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide {{and as much as}} 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts for filling the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E
