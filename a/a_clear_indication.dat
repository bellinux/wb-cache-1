5|$|The party spent a {{total of}} 11days {{traversing}} the North China Plain via the Grand Canal before reaching Tongzhou District, {{where there was a}} large warehouse depot adjunct to the capital city. From there they left their courier ships and traveled by donkey and foot towards the capital Beijing, where they lodged at the Central Courier Hostel. The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing. Choe was not sad to leave the sights of Beijing behind, as he found the people there to be obsessed with business and cared little for agriculture or farming, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of his Confucian-oriented values.|$|E
5|$|In the east, however, Manuel's {{achievements}} {{are more}} ambiguous. He suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176 against the Turks. Manuel was marching against Konya, the Turkish capital, when his forces were ambushed; the ensuing defeat has since entered {{the popular imagination}} as a legendary disaster. Exaggerated accounts of the battle often describe {{the destruction of the}} entire Byzantine army, and with it the end of Byzantine power and influence. However, the modern consensus among Byzantine historians is that, while the Battle of Myriokephalon was a serious humiliation for the emperor, it was certainly not a catastrophe. Nor was it in any way equivalent to the Battle of Manzikert over a century earlier. In fact, much of the emperor's army emerged from the battle without serious damage. Units involved in the battle are well documented as campaigning in Asia Minor the following year. The imperial frontier remained unmoved for the remainder of Manuel's reign, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> that the Turks were unable to gain any advantage from their victory. In 1177, the Byzantines inflicted a major defeat on a large Turkish force at Hyelion and Leimocheir in the Meander valley.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, the pretender Mustafa {{appeared}} before the Great Council, and was given a gift of 150 ducats for his services. On 4 June a new duke and captain were elected for Thessalonica, Paolo Contarini and Andrea Donato, after the first three pairs chosen all declined the post, despite the fine attached to refusal; <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of the unwillingness of the Venetian nobles to undertake the unprofitable and perilous task. On 1 July, Mocenigo attacked the Ottoman ships at Gallipoli, but although he led his flagship {{to break through the}} palisade protecting the Ottoman anchorage, the other Venetian vessels did not follow, forcing Mocenigo to withdraw with heavy casualties. Even now, however, Venice would not commit its full force to the conflict: when Suriano, as a proponent of the hawkish faction, proposed to arm a fleet of 14 ships and engage in a more decisive policy against the Ottomans in January 1430, the proposal was voted down, even though it was rather modest and clearly inadequate to force the Sultan to come to terms. Instead, the Great Council instructed the new captain-general, Silvestro Morosini, to seek the mediation of the Byzantine Emperor for a settlement on the lines of the previous agreements.|$|E

40|$|Changes {{in climate}} {{variability}} and, in particular, changes in extreme climate events {{are likely to}} be of far more significance for environmentally vulnerable regions than changes in the mean state. It is generally accepted that sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) {{play an important role in}} modulating rainfall variability. Consequently, SSTs can be prescribed in global and regional climate modelling in order to study the physical mechanisms behind rainfall and its extremes. Using a satellite-based daily rainfall historical data set, this paper describes the main patterns of rainfall variability over southern Africa, identifies the dates when extreme rainfall occurs within these patterns, and shows the effect of resolution in trying to identify the location and intensity of SST anomalies associated with these extremes in the Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean. Derived from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the results also suggest that, for the spatial pattern accounting for the highest amount of variability, extremes extracted at a higher spatial resolution do give <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>indication</b> regarding the location and intensity of anomalous SST regions. As the amount of variability explained by each spatial pattern defined by the PCA decreases, it would appear that extremes extracted at a lower resolution give <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>indication</b> of anomalous SST regions.

The drawings, for the most part, are not original designs. They are drawn from buildings and artworks that he saw on his travels. In order that they might be utilised as designs for students, they were carefully annotated by a skilled calligrapher and placed into a leather portfolio.

25|$|The {{story of}} the unique {{friendship}} that grew between Quanah and the Burnett family is addressed in the exhibition of cultural artifacts that {{were given to the}} Burnett family from the Parker family. The presentation of a cultural relic as significant as Quanah’s war lance was not done lightly. It is <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of the high esteem to which the Burnett family was regarded by the Parkers. The correspondence between Quanah and Samuel Burk Burnett, Sr. (1849–1922) and his son Thomas Loyd Burnett (1871–1938), expressed mutual admiration and respect. The historical record mentions little of Quanah until his presence in the attack on the buffalo hunters at Adobe Walls on June 27, 1874. Fragmented information exists indicating Quanah had interactions with the Apache at about this time.|$|E

Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning. Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{polished}} and complex {{nature of the}} Aeneid (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Because this poem was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the Aeneid is more complete than most classical epics. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} debate whether Virgil intended to rewrite and add to such lines. Some of them would be difficult to complete, and in some instances, the brevity of a line increases its dramatic impact (some arguing the violent ending as a typically Virgilian comment on the darker, vengeful side of humanity). However, these arguments may be anachronistic—half-finished lines might equally, to Roman readers, have been <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of an unfinished poem and have added nothing whatsoever to the dramatic effect.|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} scalability law (USL) is an {{analytic model}} used to quantify application scaling. It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and Gustafson linearized scaling as special cases.

25|$|Gregory next {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Germany. In 718, he was approached by an Anglo-Saxon missionary, Winfrid, who proposed undertaking missionary work in Germany. Gregory agreed, and after changing his name to Boniface, commissioned him in May 719 to preach in Germany. After hearing of the work that had been done so far, in 722 Gregory summoned Boniface back to Rome to answer rumours concerning Boniface’s doctrinal purity. Interestingly, at this face to face meeting, Boniface complained that he found Gregory’s Latin difficult to understand, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> that Vulgar Latin had already started to evolve into the Romance languages. After examining Boniface’s written profession of faith, Gregory was satisfied enough that he made Boniface a bishop in November 722, and returned him to Germany to continue his mission. Continued successes saw Gregory write to Boniface in December 724 to offer his congratulations, followed in November 726 by a response to Boniface’s questions about how to structure the newly emergent churches in Germany.|$|E
25|$|In July 1990, the Jamaat al Muslimeen, {{an extremist}} Black Muslim group with an {{unresolved}} grievance {{against the government}} over land claims, tried to overthrow the NAR government. The group held {{the prime minister and}} members of parliament hostage for five days while rioting shook Port of Spain. After a long standoff with the police and military, the Jamaat al Muslimeen leader, Yasin Abu Bakr, and his followers surrendered to Trinidadian authorities. Having had the matter referred back to the local courts by the Privy Council with <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of a view that the amnesty was valid, in July 1992, the High Court upheld the validity of a government amnesty given to the Jamaat members during the hostage crisis. Abu Bakr and 113 other Jamaat members were jailed for two years while the courts debated the amnesty's validity. All 114 members were eventually released. Subsequent to this, the UK Privy Council deemed the amnesty invalid but expressed the view that it would be improper to re-arrest the 114 accused.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 {{it became}} soon {{clear that the}} {{coalition}} would end its offensive activities in Afghanistan no later than {{by the end of}} 2014. With five infantry battalions now at its disposal, RC-N proceeded to secure the gains scored thus far. Fierce fighting - though less frequent in total due to the now-strong coalition presence - continued throughout 2011, with the Talibans' focus of operations shifting towards Baghlan province for a time until it came to a near-halt in late 2011. While this was regarded by some observers as <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>indication</b> of the German success in the region, the insurgents continued to show their strength from time to time; perhaps their most humiliating blow dealt to the Germans took place on May 28, 2011 when Major General Markus Kneip, NATO's highest-ranking officer {{in the northern part of}} Afghanistan, was seriously wounded in an attack. Two soldiers of Kneip's entourage and several Afghans were also killed that day. Kneip is the highest ranking WIA of the Afghanistan War.|$|E
