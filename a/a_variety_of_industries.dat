5|$|Claiborne {{was born}} the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn, an {{alderman}} and lord mayor from King's Lynn, Norfolk, who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved in <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries,</b> including the salt and fish trades, and Sarah Smith, {{the daughter of a}} London brewer. The family name was spelled alternately as Cleburn, Cleyborne, or Claiborne. William Claiborne, who was baptized in 1600, was the younger of two sons. The family's business was not profitable enough to make it rich, and so Claiborne's older brother was apprenticed in London, becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and, eventually, the tobacco trade.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the federal and state governments left Philadelphia, but the city continued for some years to be the country's cultural and financial center.

Philadelphia {{became one of the first}} U.S. industrial centers with <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries,</b> the largest being textiles. It had many economic and family ties to the South, with southern planters maintaining second homes in the city and having business connections with banks, sending their daughters to French finishing schools run by refugees from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), selling their cotton to textile manufacturers, which in turn sold some products to the South, for instance, clothing for slaves. At {{the beginning}} of the American Civil War, there were many southern sympathizers, although most city residents became firmly Union as the war went on.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean economy, {{given its}} pre-monetary nature, {{was focused on}} the {{redistribution}} of goods, commodities and labor by a central administration. The preserved Linear B records in Pylos and Knossos indicate that the palaces were closely monitoring <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> and commodities, the organization of land management and the rations given to the dependent personnel. The Mycenaean palaces maintained extensive control of the nondomestic areas of production through careful control and acquisition and distribution in the palace industries, and the tallying of produced goods. For instance, the Knossos tablets record c. 80,000-100,000 sheep grazing in central Crete, and the quantity of the expected wool from these sheep and their offspring, as well as how this wool was allocated. The archives of Pylos display a specialized workforce, where each worker belonged to a precise category and was assigned to a specific task in the stages of production, notably in textiles.|$|E

25|$|The US and European {{refractories}} {{industry had}} {{a crisis in}} 2000–2003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining refractory consumption per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures. Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker Refractories by RHI AG and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics, and away from brick. The major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from China. Almost {{all of the above}} refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption; the rest is used by <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries,</b> such as cement.|$|E

25|$|Polyelectrolytes are {{polymers}} whose repeating units bear an electrolyte group. Polycations and polyanions are polyelectrolytes. These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), {{making the}} polymers charged. Polyelectrolyte properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts. Like salts, their solutions are electrically conductive. Like polymers, their solutions are often viscous. Charged molecular chains, commonly present in soft matter systems, play a fundamental {{role in determining}} structure, stability and the interactions of various molecular assemblies. Theoretical approaches to describing their statistical properties differ profoundly from those of their electrically neutral counterparts, while technological and industrial fields exploit their unique properties. Many biological molecules are polyelectrolytes. For instance, polypeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and DNA are polyelectrolytes. Both natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in <b>a</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|E

Other examples would be ATKCorporation, which operates three ammunition and ammunition components plants in Lewiston. Two are sporting and one is defense contract. The Lewis-Clark valley has an additional independent ammunition components manufacturer and the Chipmunk rifle factory until it was purchased in 2007 by Keystone Sporting Arms and production was moved to Milton, Pennsylvania. Four of the world's six welded aluminum jet boat (for running river rapids) manufacturers are in the Lewiston-Clarkston, WAvalley. Wine grapes were grown between Kendrick and Juliaetta in the Idaho Panhandle by the French Rothschilds until Prohibition. In keeping with this, while there are no large wineries or breweries in Idaho, there are numerous and growing numbers of award-winning boutique wineries and microbreweries in the northern part of the state.|$|E
500|$|Carr Hill by 1820 was {{a modern}} and populous village, {{situated}} on hill, still isolated from Gateshead and Felling. <b>A</b> <b>variety</b> <b>of</b> <b>industries</b> had developed alongside Warburton's pottery and were prospering; a flint glass manufacturer, under {{the management of}} Alexander Elliot, three corn mills- Carr Hill Mill, Felling Windmill and St John's Mill (the latter built after an earlier mill was destroyed by a mysterious fire in 1824)– and a fire brick kiln. There were also three inns and [...] "some neat houses occupied by respectable families". [...] By 1840 Carr Hill Reservoir had been built and, under {{the management of the}} Newcastle Water Company was the major water supplier for residents in Carr Hill, Sheriff Hill and Windy Nook, and freestone quarries, similar to Kells' Quarry in Windy Nook, were producing Newcastle Grindstone of excellent quality. In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms. By the mid-19th century Carr Hill Reservoir was {{in the hands of the}} Whittle Dean Water Company, and in 1883 was converted into a 10-million imperial gallon (45 million l; 12 million US gal) open reservoir.|$|E
