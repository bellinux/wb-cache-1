40|$|RuPeng 15 Powder (RPP 15) is a herbal multicompound {{remedy that}} {{originates}} from traditional Tibetan medicine and possesses <b>antigout,</b> anti-inflammatory, and antihyperuricemic properties {{based on the}} traditional conceptions. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic effect of PRP 15 in rat gouty arthritis induced by monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. In the present study, we found that treatment with RPP 15 (0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 [*]g/kg) in rats with gouty arthritis induced by MSU crystals significantly attenuated the knee swelling. Histomorphometric and immunohistochemistry analyses revealed that MSU-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and the elevated expressions of nuclear transcription factor-κB p 65 (NF-κB p 65) in synovial tissues were significantly inhibited, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) result showed that MSU-induced high levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) in synovial fluid were reduced by treatment with RPP 15 (0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 [*]g/kg). We conclude that RPP 15 may be a promising candidate {{for the development of}} a new treatment for gout and its activity of <b>antigout</b> may be partially related to inhibiting TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 8, and NF-κB p 65 expression in the synovial tissues...|$|E

To date, the association between antidiabetic agents and glycemic control in this specific patient population is not well established. Purpose: This study aimed to identify antidiabetic regimens {{as well as other}} factors that associated with glycemic control in T 2 DM patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients and methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study involved 242 T 2 DM inpatients and outpatients with renal complications from January 2009 to March 2014 and was conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital in Malaysia. Glycated hemoglobin (A 1 C) was used as main parameter to assess patients’ glycemic status. Patients were classified to have good (A 1 C < 7 %) or poor glycemic control (A 1 C ≥ 7 %) based on the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. Results: Majority of the patients presented with CKD stage 4 (43. 4 %). Approximately 55. 4 % of patients were categorized to have poor glycemic control. Insulin (57. 9 %) was the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic medication, followed by sulfonylureas (43 %). Of all antidiabetic regimens, sulfonylureas monotherapy (P< 0. 001), insulin therapy (P= 0. 005), and combination of biguanides with insulin (P= 0. 038) were found to be significantly associated with glycemic control. Other factors including duration of T 2 DM (P= 0. 004), comorbidities such as anemia (P= 0. 024) and retinopathy (P= 0. 033), concurrent medications such as erythropoietin therapy (P= 0. 047), a-blockers (P= 0. 033), and <b>antigouts</b> (P= 0. 003) were also correlated with A 1 C. Conclusion: Identification of factors that are associated with glycemic control is important to help in optimization of glucose control in T 2 DM patients with renal complication.

40|$|Hyperuricemia is a {{risk factor}} for not only gout, but also to a variety of {{disorders}} that affect the vital organ systems of the human body. The xanthine oxidase (XO) is the key enzyme in the production of uric acid and its inhibition can inhibit hyperuricemia. Although, XO inhibitor allopurinol is widely prescribed <b>antigout</b> agent but its use is not without any side effects. Previously, we described the synthesis of four novel thiadiazolopyrimidin- 5 -one analogues as effective XO inhibitors and molecular docking studies also confirmed this. When these analogues were tested in potassium oxonate treated rats, their serum uric acid and creatinine levels were dropped significantly from 4. 85 ± 0. 03 mg/dl to 1. 21 ± 0. 01 mg/dl and 0. 92 ± 0. 02 mg/dl to 0. 40 ± 0. 02 mg/dl respectively. Among the pyrimidine analogues tested, 6 a was most potent. Histological examinations of both liver and kidney tissues exhibited severe necrosis in oxonate treated rats and pyrimidine analogues could significantly attenuate this with a correlative inhibitory profile of hepatic XO from the same rats. Our results demonstrate antihyperuricemic effect of novel thiadiazolopyrimidin- 5 -one analogues in oxonate treated rats, which can be further explored not only as <b>antigout</b> therapeutics but also in other systems where hyperuricemia is the driving cause of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Xanthine oxidase (XO) is {{a complex}} metalloflavoprotein, the {{overproduction}} of which usually leads to a pathological condition called gout.

Abnormal production of this superoxide (reactive oxygen species) is responsible for a number of complications including inflammation, metabolic disorder, cellular aging, reperfusion damage, atherosclerosis, and carcinogenesis. In this paper, we report the synthesis of N-substituted analogs of thiazolidinedione derivatives as effective and new class of XO inhibitors and also as antioxidant agents. Among all the compounds in the series, compound 2 i produced relatively better activity against human milk XO (72 inhibition), which was also supported by docking studies...|$|E

We found that pretreatment with HG in rats with gouty arthritis could significantly attenuate the ankle joint swelling, and this beneficial <b>antigout</b> effect might be mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) production in synovial fluid as well as nuclear transcription factor-κB p 65 (NF-κB p 65) protein expression in synovial tissue. Moreover, metabonomic analysis demonstrated that 5 and 6 potential biomarkers associated with gouty arthritis in plasma and urine, respectively, which were mainly involved in energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and gut microbe metabolism, were identified.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine and}} {{quantify}} {{the relation between}} purine intake {{and the risk of}} recurrent gout attacks among gout patients. METHODS: The authors conducted a case-crossover study to examine associations of a set of putative risk factors with recurrent gout attacks. Individuals with gout were prospectively recruited and followed online for 1 year. Participants were asked about the following information when experiencing a gout attack: the onset date of the gout attack, clinical symptoms and signs, medications (including <b>antigout</b> medications), and presence of potential risk factors (including daily intake of various purine-containing food items) during the 2 -day period prior to the gout attack. The same exposure information was also assessed over 2 -day control periods. RESULTS: This study included 633 participants with gout. Compared with the lowest quintile of total purine intake over a 2 -day period, OR of recurrent gout attacks were 1. 17, 1. 38, 2. 21 and 4. 76, respectively, with each increasing quintile (p for trend < 0. 001). The corresponding OR were 1. 42, 1. 34, 1. 77 and 2. 41 for increasing quintiles of purine intake from animal sources (p for trend < 0. 001), and 1. 12, 0. 99, 1. 32 and 1. 39 from plant sources (p= 0. 04), respectively. The effect of purine intake persisted across subgroups by sex, use of alcohol, diuretics, allopurinol, NSAIDs and colchicine. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings suggest that acute purine intake increases the risk of recurrent gout attacks by almost fivefold among gout patients. Avoiding or reducing amount of purine-rich foods intake, especially of animal origin, may help reduce the risk of gout attacks. Sydney Medical Schoo...|$|E
40|$|Background: The prevalence, {{clinical}} patterns, and causative drugs of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADR) vary {{among the}} different populations previously studied. Aim: To determine the prevalence, the clinical patterns of drug eruptions, and the common drugs implicated, particularly in severe cADR such as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) in our population. Methods: We analyzed the database established for all cADR seen {{by the department of}} Dermatology from January 2001 till December 2010. Results: A total of 362 cADR were seen among 42 170 new clinic attendees, yielding an incidence rate of 0. 86 %. The most common reaction pattern seen was maculopapular eruption (153 cases) followed by SJS/TEN (110 cases) and DRESS (34 cases). Antibiotics was the most commonly implicated drug group (146 cases) followed by anticonvulsants (81 cases) and <b>antigout</b> drugs (50 cases). The most frequently implicated drug was allopurinol (50 cases). Carbamazepine, allopurinol, and cotrimoxazole were the three main causative drugs of SJS/TEN accounting for 21. 8 %, 20. 9 %, and 12. 7 %, respectively, of the 110 cases seen, whereas DRESS was mainly caused by allopurinol (15 cases). Mortality rates for TEN, SJS, and DRESS were 28. 6 %, 2. 2 %, and 5. 9 %, respectively Conclusions: The low rate of cADR with a high proportion of severe reactions observed in this study was probably due to referral bias. Otherwise, the reaction patterns and drugs causing cADR in our population were similar to those seen in other countries. Carbamazepine, allopurinol, and cotrimoxazole were the three main causative drugs of SJS/TEN in our population...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} if {{and to what}} extent records obtained from PBM pharmacy claims differ from source documents obtained directly from pharmacy providers. This study also sought to explore possible associations between patient, pharmacy benefits, and pharmacy provider characteristics and the likelihood a patient would have missing prescription claims. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design which included a sample of 1, 484 patients residing in a single state with a common pharmacy benefit. Profiles describing all prescriptions filled in a pharmacy between January 1, 2002 through June 30, 2002 of these patients were requested directly from their pharmacy providers. Logistic regression was used to explore the factors associated with a person receiving a prescription that did not appear on the PBM claims. Results: Of the 1, 484 eligible recipients sampled, profiles were obtained for 323 (22 %) persons and there were analyzable profiles for 315 (21 %) persons. There were a total of 2, 977 prescriptions filled for the 315 subjects. Of those 2, 977 prescriptions, 207 (7. 0 %) were missing from the claims files indicating that 93 % were captured. Only prescription volume consistently influenced the likelihood a patient would have a missing prescription from the PBM claims (OR = 1. 08; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 12). Conclusion: Claims obtained from pharmacy benefit companies capture approximately 93 % of prescription records when verified with records obtained from pharmacy providers. The rate of missing records from PBM claims {{does not appear to be}} meaningfully influenced by most finance based pharmacy benefit design features. However, certain classes of drugs such as iron products, digoxins, diuretics, sulfonylureas, and <b>antigout</b> may have incomplete claims records compared to other classes of drugs. Higher prescription utilizers are more likely to have prescription records filled that are not captured by PBMs. These conclusions should be interpreted in light of the modest usable response rate from pharmacy providers of 22 % and the unknown generalizability of these patients utilizing one particular PBM from 2002 in the state of Georgia...|$|E
