5000|$|Muscatel {{is a type}} of wine {{made from}} muscat grapes. The term is now {{normally}} used in the United States to refer to a fortified wine made from these grapes rather than just any wine made from these grapes. This fortified muscatel became popular in the United States when, at the end of prohibition, {{in order to meet the}} large demand for wine, some poor strains of muscat grapes (used normally for table grapes or raisins) mixed with sugar and cheap brandy were used to produce what has since become infamous as a wino wine. This kind of fortified wine has, in the United States, damaged <b>the</b> reputation of <b>all</b> muscat-based wines and <b>the</b> term <b>muscatel</b> tends no longer to be used for these [...] "better" [...] wines in the United States. In other markets <b>the</b> term <b>Muscatel,</b> or Moscatel, refers to a wide range of sweet wines based on these grapes.|$|R

[...] The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled, [...] The question he proceeded in extenso to unfold: [...] "Resolved--The sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach [...] Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech." [...] This simple proposition he expounded, word by word, [...] Until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard. [...] Even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain-- [...] The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain. [...] Beginning at a period before Creation's morn, [...] He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn. [...] As down the early centuries of pre-historic time [...] He tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme, [...] And Whisky Bill, prosaic soul! proclaiming him a jay, [...] Had risen and like an earthquake, [...] "reeled unheededly away," [...] And a late lamented cat, when opportunity should serve, [...] Was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve, [...] A noise arose outside--the door was opened with a bang [...] And old Ebenezer Fink was heard ejaculating [...] "G'lang!" [...] Straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink [...] An ancient ass--the property it was of Mr. Fink. [...] Its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread, [...] Silent through silence moved amain that stately quadruped! [...] It stopped before the orator, and in the lamplight thrown [...] Upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone. [...] Then spake old Ebenezer: [...] "Gents, I heern o' this debate [...] On w'ether v'ice or y'ears is best the mind to elevate. [...] Now 'yer's a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme: [...] He has 'em both, I'm free to say, oncommonly extreme.

5000|$|The València plains {{are known}} for their olive, mulberry, ilex, algaroba, orange, and palm trees, with the {{appearance}} of an [...] "immense garden". Such is the fertility of the soil, that two and three crops in the year are generally obtained, and the greater part of the land returns eight per cent. The rice crops are the most valuable, and are chiefly produced in the tract which is irrigated by the Albufera, a large lake in the neighbourhood of València. Rice being the principal food of the lower classes, the crop is generally consumed in the province, {{with the exception of a}} small quantity which finds its way into Castile and Andalusia. The other chief product is the white mulberry, once the source of great wealth: it was worked in the silk-factories of València. In 1828, the produce of silk from the vega of València amounted to one million of pounds yearly, the greater part of which was exported in its raw state, but the produce has greatly increased since, owing to demands from the manufacturers of Lyon and other towns in the south of France. The province of València is a notable producer of satins, silk ribbons, and velvets. The export of fruit from Valencia is also considerable, particularly of raisins. The raisins are of two kinds, <b>the</b> <b>muscatel,</b> and an inferior and smaller raisin, called pasa de legia. The export of figs, oil, and wine from the province and ports of València is also considerable, with a wine known as Beni Carlo, which as of 1843 was shipped to Cette. Mercury, copper, sulphur, arsenic, argentiferous lead, iron, coal, etc. are among the mineral products, but they are procured only in small quantities. Today, tourism is a major source of income, with the city of Valencia and the resort towns along the coast being the primary earners during the summer months.|$|R
2500|$|In the 18th century, Chile {{was known}} mostly for its sweet wines made from <b>the</b> Pais and <b>Muscatel</b> grapes. To achieve {{a high level}} of {{sweetness}} the wines were often boiled which concentrated the grape must. Following his shipwreck off the coast at Cape Horn, Admiral John Byron (Grandfather of the poet Lord Byron) traveled across Chile and came back to England with a glowing review of Chilean Muscatel comparing it favorably to Madeira. The 19th century wine writer André Jullien was not as impressed, comparing Chilean wines to a [...] "potion of rhubarb and senna".|$|R
