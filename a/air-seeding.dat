40|$|International audienceWater {{transport}} {{in plants}} {{is based on}} a metastable system as the xylem "works" at negative water potentials (ψ). At critically low ψ, water columns can break and cause embolism. According to the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis, this occurs by air entry via the pits. We studied the formation of embolism in dehydrating xylem sections of Juniperus virginiana (Cupressaceae), which were monitored microscopically and via ultrasonic emission analyses. After replacement of water by air in outer tracheid layers, a complex movement of air-water menisci into tracheids was found. With decreasing ψ, pits started to aspirate and the speed of menisci movements increased. In one experiment, an <b>air-seeding</b> event could be detected at a pit. The onset of ultrasonic activity was observed when pits started to close, and ultrasonic emission ceased at intense dehydration. Experiments clearly indicated that predictions of the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis are correct: At low ψ, pit mechanisms to prevent air entry failed and air spread into tracheids. ψ fluctuations caused complex movements of air-water menisci and pits, and at low ψ, <b>air-seeding</b> caused ultrasonic emissions.

40|$|The cohesion-tension {{theory of}} water {{transport}} states that hydrogen bonds hold water molecules together {{and that they}} are pulled through the xylem under tension. This tension could cause transport failure in at least two ways: collapse of the conduit walls (implosion), or rupture of the water column through <b>air-seeding.</b> The objective of this research was to elucidate the functional significance of variations in tracheid anatomical features, earlywood to latewood ratios and wood densities with position in young and old Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine trees in terms of their consequences for the safety factors for tracheid implosion and <b>air-seeding.</b> For both species, wood density increased linearly with percent latewood for root, trunk and branch samples. However, the relationships between anatomy and hydraulic function in trunks differed from those in roots and branches. In roots and branches increased hydraulic efficiency was achieved at the cost of increased vulnerability to <b>air-seeding.</b> Mature wood of trunks had earlywood with wide tracheids that optimized water transport and had a high percentage of latewood that optimized structural support. Juvenile wood had higher resistance to <b>air-seeding</b> and cell wall implosion. The two safety factors followed similar axial trends from roots to terminal branches and were similar for both species studied and between juvenile and mature wood...|$|E
40|$|The pit {{membrane}} in bordered pits of conifer tracheids {{is characterized}} by a porous margo and central thickening (torus), which is traditionally considered to function as an impermeable safety valve against <b>air-seeding.</b> However, electron microscopy based on 33 conifer species, including five families and 19 genera, reveals that pores occur in the torus of 13 of the species studied. The pores have a plas-modesmatal origin with an average diameter of 51 nm and grouped arrangement. Evidence for embolism spreading via pores in tori is supported by the pore sizes, which cor-respond relatively well with the pressure inducing cavita-tion. Predictions based on earlier correlations between pit structure and cavitation resistance were only weakly sup-ported for species with punctured tori. Moreover, species with punctured tori are significantly less resistant to cavita-tion than species with non-punctured tori. Nevertheless, absolute pore diameters must be treated with caution and correlations between theoretical and measured <b>air-seeding</b> pressures are weak. Because most pores appear not to traverse the torus but are limited to one torus pad, only complete pores would trigger <b>air-seeding.</b> Embolism spreading through a leaky torus is not universal across gym-nosperms and unlikely to represent the only <b>air-seeding</b> mechanism.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that species-specific pit properties such as pit membrane thickness, pit membrane porosity, torus-to-aperture diameter ratio and pit chamber depth influence xylem vulnerability to cavitation. Despite the indisputable importance of using mean pit characteristics, considerable variability in pit structure within a single species or even within a single pit field should be acknowledged. According to the rare pit hypothesis, a single pit that is more air-permeable than many neighboring pits is sufficient to allow <b>air-seeding.</b> Therefore, any irregularities or morphological abnormalities in pit structure allowing <b>air-seeding</b> should be associated with increased vulnerability to cavitation. Considering the currently proposed models of <b>air-seeding,</b> pit features such as rare, large pores in the pit membrane, torus extensions, and plasmodesmatal pores in a torus can represent potential glitches. These aberrations in pit structure could either result from inherent developmental flaws, or from damage caused to the pit membrane by chemical and physical agents. This suggests the existence of interesting feedbacks between abiotic and biotic stresses in xylem physiology...|$|E

The data presented confirm that Sphagnum hyalocysts can embolize by <b>air-seeding</b> when the pressure difference across the air-water meniscus is given by ΔP = 0. 3 /D (derived from the capillary equation), where ΔP is the pressure difference across the meniscus (megapascal), and D is the diameter (micrometer) of the pore through which the air bubble enters...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{hydraulic}} conductivity occurs in stems {{when the water}} in xylem conduits is subjected to sufficiently negative pressure. According to the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis, this loss of conductivity occurs when air bubbles are sucked into water-filled conduits through micropores adjacent to air spaces in the stem. Results in {{this study showed that}} loss of {{hydraulic conductivity}} occurred in stem segments pressurized in a pressure chamber while the xylem water was under positive pressure. Vulnerability curves can be defined as a plot of percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity versus the pressure difference between xylem water and the outside air inducing the loss of conductivity. Vulnerability curves were similar whether loss of conductivity was induced by lowering the xylem water pressure or by raising the external air pressure. These results are consistent with the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis of how embolisms are nucleated, but not with the nucleation of embolisms at hydrophobic cracks because the latter requires negative xylem water pressure. The results also call into question some basic underlying assumptions used in the determination of components of tissue water potential using “pressure-volume” analysis...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims Various {{correlations}} {{have been}} identified between anatomical features of bordered pits in angiosperm xylem and vulnerability to cavitation, suggesting that the mechanical behaviour of the pits may play a role. Theoretical modelling of the membrane behaviour has been undertaken, but it requires input of parameters at the nanoscale level. However, to date, no experimental data have indicated clearly that pit membranes experience strain at high levels during cavitation events. Methods Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used in order to quantify the pit micromorphology of four tree species that show contrasting differences in vulnerability to cavitation, namely Sorbus aria, Carpinus betulus, Fagus sylvatica and Populus tremula. This allowed anatomical characters {{to be included in}} a mechanical model that was based on the Kirchhoff–Love thin plate theory. A mechanistic model was developed that included the geometric features of the pits that could be measured, with the purpose of evaluating the pit membrane strain that results from a pressure difference being applied across the membrane. This approach allowed an assessment to be made {{of the impact of the}} geometry of a pit on its mechanical behaviour, and provided an estimate of the impact on <b>air-seeding</b> resistance. Key Results The TEM observations showed evidence of residual strains on the pit membranes, thus demonstrating that this membrane may experience a large degree of strain during cavitation. The mechanical modelling revealed the interspecific variability of the strains experienced by the pit membrane, which varied according to the pit geometry and the pressure experienced. The modelling output combined with the TEM observations suggests that cavitation occurs after the pit membrane has been deflected against the pit border. Interspecific variability of the strains experienced was correlated with vulnerability to cavitation. Assuming that <b>air-seeding</b> occurs at a given pit membrane strain, the pressure predicted by the model to achieve this mechanical state corresponds to experimental values of cavitation sensitivity (P 50). Conclusions The results provide a functional understanding of the importance of pit geometry and pit membrane structure in <b>air-seeding,</b> and thus in vulnerability to cavitation...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to water-stress induced {{cavitation}} is {{an important}} indicator of drought tolerance in woody species and {{is known to be}} intimately linked to the anatomy of the xylem. However, the actual mechanical properties of the pit membrane are not well known and the exact mode of <b>air-seeding</b> by which cavitation occurs is still uncertain. We examined the relationship between cavitation resistance and bordered pit structure and function in 40 coniferous species. Xylem pressure inducing 50 % loss of hydraulic conductance (P 50, a proxy for cavitation resistance) varied widely among species, from − 2. 9 to − 11. 3 MPa. The valve effect of the pit membrane, measured as a function of margo flexibility and torus overlap, explained more variation in cavitation-resistance than simple anatomical traits such as pit membrane, pit aperture or torus size. Highly cavitation resistant species exhibited both a high flexibility of the margo and a large overlap between the torus and the pit aperture, allowing the torus to tightly seal the pit aperture. Our results support the hypothesis of seal capillary-seeding as the most likely mode of <b>air-seeding,</b> and suggest that the adhesion of the torus to the pit border may be the main determinant of cavitation resistance in conifers...|$|E
40|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} {{in the nature of}} limitations on maximum tree height, the mechanisms governing ultimate and species-specific height limits are not yet understood, but they likely involve water transport dynamics. Tall trees experience increased risk of xylem embolism from <b>air-seeding</b> because tension in their water column increases with height because of path-length resistance and gravity. We used morphological measurements to estimate the hydraulic properties of the bordered pits between tracheids in Douglas-fir trees along a height gradient of 85 m. With increasing height, the xylem structural modifications that satisfied hydraulic requirements for avoidance of runaway embolism imposed increasing constraints on water transport efficiency. In the branches and trunks, the pit aperture diameter of tracheids decreases steadily with height, whereas torus diameter remains relatively constant. The resulting increase in the ratio of torus to pit aperture diameter allows the pits to withstand higher tensions before <b>air-seeding</b> but at the cost of reduced pit aperture conductance. Extrapolations of vertical trends for trunks and branches show that water transport across pits will approach zero at a heights of 109 m and 138 m, respectively, which is consistent with historic height records of 100 – 127 m for this species. Likewise, the twig water potential corresponding to the threshold for runaway embolism would be attained at a height of ≈ 107 m.

40|$|A tracheid-level {{model was}} used to {{quantify}} the effects of differences in wood microstructure between coastal and interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Fran-co var. menziesii and var. glauca) wood on larger scale proper-ties like hydraulic conductivity. The model showed that tra-cheid length, the ease of flow through a bordered pit and effective tracheid diameter can all limit maximum hydraulic conductivity. Among the model parameters tested, increasing bordered pit conductivity and tracheid length resulted in the greatest increase in maximum conductivity in both the inland and coastal ecotypes. A sensitivity analysis of the uncertainty between parameters governing flow through the bordered pit and <b>air-seeding</b> potential showed that, although decreased pit flow resistance increased maximum hydraulic conductivity, in-creased cavitation led to lower conductivity over time. The benefits of {{increasing the number of}} bordered pits depended on the intensity of the meteorological driving function: in drier en-vironmental conditions, wood with fewer pits was more con-ductive over time than wood with more pits. Switching the bor-dered pit characteristics between coastal and interior wood indicated that the conductivity time course of coastal and inte-rior wood was primarily governed by differences in the number of bordered pits and not differences in tracheid dimensions. The rate at which tracheids refilled had little effect on the con-ductivity time course of either coastal or interior wood during the first two summers when the wood was highly saturated, but had a marked influence in subsequent years once the cavitation profile stabilized. Our work highlights the need for more em-pirical work on bordered pits to determine whether variation in their number and properties is related to changing environmen-tal conditions. In addition, a detailed simulation model of a bordered pit is needed to understand how variation in pit prop-erties affects the relationship between ease of flow through a bordered pit and its potential for facilitating <b>air-seeding...</b>|$|E
40|$|As {{the working}} width of sowing {{implements}} increases, {{the use of}} conventional mechanical seed drills, with hoppers above all the implement working width, has reachedits limits. Any further increase of the working width (more than 4 - 6 m) or the coupling of conventional additional apparatus is expensive, complex and time-consuming. <b>Air-seeding</b> appears thus as the best solution to solve this problem. One storage hopper is able to supply the working width of 24 m or more. However, it should be noticed that to ensure uniform crop growing, a machine needs an accurate, technical solution to ensure seeding material to be distributed across the full implement working width. Indeed, low transversal distribution accuracy {{is one of the}} most important shortcomings of modem air-seeders. Even if <b>air-seeding</b> has been used for more than 50 years, few developments have been carried out on divider headers responsible for distribution accuracy. This paper deals with a study on the influence of divider head geometry and functioning conditions on the seed's distribution accuracy. The first part concerns the study of the influence of the air velocity and the material flow rate on the distribution accuracy. A second study deals with the influence of the outlet closing, of different outlet pipes lengths, of distribution head tightness, of the angle position of distribution heads. Finally the influence of the structural elements such as the pipe elbow, the tower configurations, the tower height and the cone shape deflectors' implementation on the divider lid is proposed. Moreover, observation of the seed's behaviour is undertaken using a high-speed camera system. These experimental results allowed for proposals of hypothesis about the parameters influencing the final result.

40|$|Summary When {{vulnerability}} curves {{are used}} to assess the susceptibility of plants to drought, the water potential corre-sponding to 50 % loss of conductivity is frequently used as a measure of susceptibility. However, this value does not distin-guish between different patterns of conductivity loss, such as a rapid loss over a narrow water potential range versus a gradual decline in conductivity. We have applied an exponential sig-moidal equation to vulnerability curves obtained from four closely related Eucalyptus clones differing in drought toler-ance. The coefficients of the equation were evaluated and sta-tistically compared among the clones. If the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis of cavitation is accepted, these coefficients have biological relevance. One of the coefficients describes the position of the curve on the water potential axis and is equiva-lent to the water potential corresponding to 50 % loss of con-ductivity. This coefficient could reflect the size of the largest pit pore per xylem vessel. Another coefficient is related to the slope of the conductivity loss, and could reflect the range in maximum pit pore size per vessel...|$|E
40|$|Summary Roots of {{hardwoods}} {{have been}} shown to be more vulnerable to xylem cavitation than stems. This study exam-ined whether this pattern is also observed in a conifer species. Vulnerability to cavitation was determined from the pressure required to inject air into the vascular system of hydrated roots and stems, and reduce hydraulic conductance of the xylem. According to the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis for the cavitation mechanism, these air pressures predict the negative xylem pressure causing cavitation in dehydrating stems. This was evaluated for stems of Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.). The air-injection method was applied to roots and stems of different sizes and positions in Douglas-fir trees. Roots, especially smaller roots with a xylem diameter 8 mm diameter). Within the shoot system, smaller stems ( 8 mm diameter). There was no correlation between tracheid diameter and mean cavitation pressure within root or stem systems, despite larger tracheid diameters in roots (23. 3 ± 3. 9 mm) than in stems (9. 2 ± 1. 6 mm). Smaller safety margins from cavitation in roots may be beneficial in limiting water use during mild drought, and in protecting the stem from low xylem pressures during extreme drought...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{kinetics}} of embolus formation and {{collapse in the}} tracheids of Thuja occidentalis L. stem segments. Radial wood sections were trimmed to 4 mm long paralleling the tracheids by 1 mm wide and 0. 1 mm thick. They were observed under a dissecting microscope at 128 x while sections were dehydrated and rehydrated. During dehydration, cavitations resulted {{in the formation of}} emboli in tracheids, but we concluded that the cavitated tracheids did not immediately fill with air at atmospheric pressure. This conclusion was based on the time required for the emboli to collapse after the rewetting of the dehydrated segment. By hypothesis, the time for the emboli to collapse should be proportional to the amount of air in the emboli. The time for all the emboli to collapse was a linear function of the dehydration time for times up to 15 min. For dehydrations greater than 80 min, the time for collapse after rewetting was constant, and we concluded that the tracheids have saturated with air by 80 min of dehydration. The kinetics of embolus formation is discussed in terms of the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis for cavitation, and collapse is discussed in terms of the physics of gas dissolution and diffusion. Embolus formation and dissolution in intact herbaceous and woody plants should follow the same physical laws...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods were}} {{evaluated}} for using centrifugal force {{to measure the}} occurrence of cavitation {{as a function of}} negative pressures in xylem. The general protocol was to measure the hydraulic conductivity of xylem segments (stem or root pieces) before and after centring them on a centrifuge rotor and spinning them about their long axis to generate negative xylem pres-sure. The percentage decrease in conductivity from the initial to final measurement was used to quan-tify the embolism resulting from cavitation during spinning. In one approach, segments were spun with their ends exposed to air. This method could only be used when xylem conduits were much shorter than the segment. Results from an angiosperm [Betula occi-dentalis) and a gymnosperm {Abies lasiocarpa) corre-sponded to previous observations of embolism caused by air dehydration where negative pressure was meas-ured with the pressure chamber. Results also agreed with embolism caused by injection of air into the xylem, in support of the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis for cavitation. In a second approach, segments were spun in a rotor designed to keep the segment ends immersed in water during spinning. This gave the same results as for non-immersed segments. Immersing the segment ends allowed measurements on any material, regardless of conduit length, as demonstrated for roots of B. occi-dentalis. The chief advantage of the centrifugal force method is the rapidity and precision with which any desired xylem pressure can be imposed...|$|E
40|$|Clones of Hevea {{were studied}} {{in an attempt}} to {{discover}} the reasons for differences in the hydraulic perform-ance of xylem. Differences between clones were deter-mined, including hydraulic conductivity and conduit width and length distributions. However, it has proved difficult to reconcile anatomical differences with physiological performance for use in future plant breeding programmes. When leaf relative water content (RWC) had been reduced from about 95 % to 85 %, the hydraulic con-ductivity of petioles decreased sharply to about 40 % of the initial value. This value corresponded with xy-lem sap tensions of 1. 8 - 2. 0 MPa. Acoustic detection experiments revealed that this reduction in hydraulic conductivity coincided with the greatest occurrence of cavitation. It seems inescapable that the reduction in hydraulic conductivity was caused by embolization; thereafter gas bubbles blocked the flow of water inside many of the conduits. There was some indication that eventually such bubbles might be dissolved, because the hydraulic conductivity increased again if speci-mens were fully rehydrated. Apparently, the incidence of cavitation coincides with the entry of gas bubbles via ultramicroscopic pores into the conduits through the walls according to the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis. When a petiolate leaf is tested in a pressure chamber it is impossible to make satisfactory measurements of a balancing pressure beyond c. 1. 8 - 2. 0 MPa, because air bubbles, mixed with sap and escaping from the conduits, form a per-sistent froth. Xylem transport in Hevea seems to be disrupted relatively easily under water stress which is a feature of other tropical species adapted to rainforest-type environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanism}} of water-stress-induced xyletn embolism was studied in three species of conifers: Abies balsamca (L.) Mill., Picea rtibens Sarg. and. /uniperus virginiana L. Each species showed a characteristic relationship between xylem tension {{and the loss}} of hydraulic conductivity by air etnbolistn. Abies balsamea and Picea rubens began to etnbolize at tensions between 2 and 3 MPa and were com-pletely non-conducting between 3 and 4 MPa. Juni-perus virginiana was least vulnerable, beginning to etnbolize at 4 and still tetaining apptoxitnately 10 % conductivity at 10 MPa. As wilh a previous study of the vessel-bearitig Aeer saccharum Marsh., a brief perfusion of btanch segnienls with an oxalic acid and calciutn solution (10 and 0. 1 mol m ', respectively) iticteased the vulnerability of the xylem to embolism; ihis was especially pronounced in Abies balsamea.

40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis predicts that xylem embolism resistance is linked directly to bordered pit functioning. We tested this prediction in trunks, roots, and branches at different vertical and radial locations in young and old trees of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Dimensions of bordered pits were measured from light and scanning electron micrographs, and physiological data were from published values. Consistent with observations, calculations showed that earlywood tracheids were more resistant to embolism than latewood tracheids, mainly from earlywood having stretchier pit membranes that can distend and cover the pit aperture. Air seeding that occurs in earlywood appears to happen through gaps between the torus edge and pit border, {{as shown by the}} similar calculated pressures required to stretch the membrane over the pit aperture and to cause embolism. Although bordered pit functioning was correlated with tracheid hydraulic diameter, pit pore size and above all pit aperture constrained conductivity the most. From roots to branches and from the trunk base to higher on the trunk, hydraulic resistance of the earlywood pit membrane increased significantly because of a decrease {{in the size of the}} pit aperture and size and number of margo pores. Moreover, overall wood conductivity decreased, in part due to lower pit conductivity and a decrease in size and frequency of pits. Structural and functional constraints leading to the trade-off of efficiency against safety of water transport were also demonstrated at the individual pit level, with a positive correlation between pit membrane resistance on an area basis and the pressure differential required to cause membrane stretching, a characteristic that is essential for pit aspiration...|$|E

In present day farming energy and agronomic efficiencies are both important factors. As the working-width of implements has increased, <b>air-seeding</b> is the best solution for the sowing of cereal crops. One of the problematic areas is {{the design of the}} air-delivery system, particularly if the pneumatic conveying system is wrongly dimensioned. The flow of seeding material during conveying must be high and regular enough for a high-speed seeding. There are three parameters that ensure the conveying of seeding material in a pipe: air velocity, flow concentration and pipe diameter. It is demonstrated that the outlets of the divider heads are the most critical part of the conveying system. Outlet pipes relatively small diameters and must allow for the highest seeding rates without clogging. It was hypothesised that the air velocity in outlet pipe may be used as an input data for designed a completed conveying system.

40|$|Background and Aims: According to the <b>air-seeding</b> hypothesis, {{embolism}} vulnerability in xylem elements {{is linked}} directly to bordered pit structure and functioning. To elucidate the adaptive potential of intervessel pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate intervessel pits in A. marina and scalariform intervessel pits in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: Vestured pits without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute pit apertures may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide pit apertures and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its outer pit apertures were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in intervessel pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their intervessel pits. Within species, intervessel pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter. Further research on pit formation and function has to clarify the large variations in intervessel pit size within trees and even within single vessels...|$|E
