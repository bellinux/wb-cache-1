25|$|DNA detection: the {{compound}} ethidium bromide, in aqueous solution, {{has very little}} fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. Ethidium bromide may be carcinogenic – an arguably safer alternative is the dye SYBR Green.|$|E

2500|$|Agarose gels do {{not have}} a uniform pore size, but are optimal for {{electrophoresis}} of proteins that are larger than 200 kDa. <b>Agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> can also be used for the separation of DNA fragments ranging from 50 base pair to several megabases (millions of bases), the largest of which require specialized apparatus. The distance between DNA bands of different lengths is influenced by the percent agarose in the gel, with higher percentages requiring longer run times, sometimes days. [...] Instead high percentage agarose gels should be run with a pulsed field electrophoresis (PFE), or field inversion electrophoresis.|$|E

Under the name homidium, it has been commonly used since the 1950s in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle, a disease caused by trypanosomes.

50|$|As RNA {{integrity}} {{has long}} been known to be a problem in molecular biology studies, there are a few methods that have been used historically to determine the integrity of RNA. The most popular {{has long been}} <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> with ethidium bromide staining, allowing one to visualize the bands from the rRNA peaks. The height of the 28S and 18S bands can be compared to each other, with a 2:1 ratio indicating non-degraded RNA. While this method is very cheap and easy, there are several issues with this method, primarily its subjectivity, leading to inconsistent, non-standardized RNA quality assessments, and the large amounts of RNA that are needed to visualize it on an agarose gel, which can be problematic if there is not much RNA to work with. There are also a number of different problems that can arise from <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis,</b> such as poor loading, uneven running, and uneven staining that lead to increased variability in the accuracy of using <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> to determine RNA integrity.

50|$|Restriction mapping is {{a method}} in which {{structural}} information regarding a segment of DNA is obtained using restriction enzymes. Restriction enzymes are enzymes that help cut segments of DNA at specific recognition sequences. The basis to restriction mapping involves digesting (or cutting) DNA with restriction enzymes. The digested DNA fragments are then run on an <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> using <b>electrophoresis,</b> which provides one with information regarding the size of these digested fragments. The sizes of these fragments help indicate the distance between restriction enzyme sites on the DNA analyzed, and provides researchers with information regarding the structure of DNA analyzed.|$|R

Consistently, molecules nicked by exposure to UV radiation trap more readily than unexposed ones. The critical trapping tension at the vertex is estimated to be 15 pN, a force sufficient to melt nicks bent around gel fibers, and, according to our model, trap a molecule.
