40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} process parameters by the solid-liquid interface position, thermal gradient angle and the <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> The effects of the process parameters on the solid-liquid interface position, thermal gradient angle and the <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> were simulated by ProCAST using LMC(Liquid Metal Cooling) and HRS(High Rate Solidification) processes. The results show that HRS process is little affected by the mold thickness, the dominant heat transfer factor in HRS is radiation from the mold surface, and the dominant heat transfer factor in LMC either mold thermal conductivity or mold-metal interface heat transfer; increasing furnace temperature is beneficial to increase the axial thermal gradient; the withdrawal rate {{is the most important}} process parameter which significantly affects the thermal field during solidification, as the withdrawal rate increases, the <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> first increases and then decreases, therefore, it is necessary to apply different withdrawal rates for different alloys.

40|$|The {{effect of}} applied axial and radial thermal {{gradients}} and an axial {{static magnetic field}} on the macrosegregation profiles of Bridgman-grown GeSi alloy crystals has been assessed. The axial thermal gradients were adjusted by changing the control setpoints of a seven-zone vertical Bridgman furnace. The radial thermal gradients were affected by growing samples in ampoules with different thermal conductivities, namely graphite, hot-pressed boron nitride (BN), and pyrolytic boron nitride (PBN). Those samples grown in a graphite ampoule exhibited radial profiles consistent with a highly concave interface and axial profiles indicative of complete mixing in the melt. The samples grown in BN and PBN ampoules had less radial variation. Axial macrosegregation profiles of these samples fell between the predictions for a completely mixed melt and one where solute transport is dominated by diffusion. All of the samples were grown on Ge seeds. This resulted {{in a period of}} free growth until the Si concentration in the solid was in equilibrium with the Si concentration in the liquid. The length of crystal grown during this period was inversely proportional to the applied <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> Several samples were grown in an axial 5 Tesla magnetic field.

The effectiveness of the methods was based on bearing bulk temperature and <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> reductions during air delivery. The first method utilized direct impingement of air on the inner surface of a hollow test journal during operation. The second, less indirect method achieved heat removal by blowing air inside the test journal to simulate air flowing axially through a hollow, rotating shaft. The third method emulated the most common approach to removing heat by forcing air axially through the bearing s support structure. Internal bearing temperatures were measured with three, type K thermocouples embedded in the bearing that measured general internal temperatures and axial thermal gradients. Testing was performed in a 1 atm, 260 C ambient environment with the bearing operating at 60 krpm and supporting a load of 222 N. Air volumetric flows of 0. 06, 0. 11, and 0. 17 cubic meters per minute at approximately 150 to 200 C were used. The tests indicate that all three methods provide thermal management but {{at different levels of}} effectiveness. Axial cooling of the bearing support structure had a greater effect on bulk temperature for each air flow and demonstrated that the thermal gradients could be influenced by the directionality of the air flow. Direct air impingement on the journal's inside surface provided uniform reductions in both bulk temperature and thermal gradients. Similar to the direct method, indirect journal cooling had a uniform cooling effect on both bulk temperatures and thermal gradients but was the least effective of the three methods...|$|E
40|$|The preform-to-fiber thermal {{drawing method}} is a {{versatile}} process {{that allows the}} fabrication of polymer or glass-based fibers with complex multimaterial internal structures, which grant them functions ranging from optical transmission to chemical detection. However, while {{a wide range of}} materials have been successfully drawn in various phases - such as metals, semiconductors, and ferroelectric polymers - the overall structure of the fiber is typically axially-invariant and the incorporation of heterogeneous materials with isotropic microstructures such as porous domains has remained elusive thus far. In this thesis we investigate the use of in-fiber phase separation as a means to control the microstructure of different components within thermally-drawn fibers. In particular we propose a novel method based on controlled phase separation of a polymer solution that we use to embed isotropically porous polymeric domains inside multimaterial fibers. We achieve this by thermal-drawing a hollow polymer preform filled with a liquid polymer solution in its core. We later apply this method to the fabrication and characterization of scaffolds for neural regeneration. In addition, we show that the same principle {{can also be used to}} draw a functional lithium-ion fiber battery; a fiber device capable of electrochemical energy storage.

40|$|Bismuth Silicate, Bi 12 Si 020, is a {{body-centered cubic}} oxide exhibiting {{non-linear}} optical preperties which {{make it a}} target for many applications including optical information processing. This project is to investigate and resolve some critical issues associated with the Bridgman growth of BSO under the microgravity conditions, which {{can be divided into}} three phases according to the subject in each phase. (1) The wetting behavior between BSO and the confinement material, platinum, is critical in a Bridgman type of growth (Chap 3). The sessile drop method combined with a drop shape analysis was used to measure and compute the three-phase contact angles and the surface tensions ofBSO melts under varying partial pressure of oxygen (P 02). The contact angle changed from 45 ° to less than 15 ° as P 02 increased from 104 atm to 10 - 2 atm, however, the surface tension of BSO melts (- 200 mJ/m 2) showed no dependence on P 02. Based on the partial wetting conditions, platinum confinements for the growth of BSO with and with out gravity were designed. (2) Thermal characteristics in a Bridgman system, specifically the distribution and the stability of the axial and radial thermal profile within the charge, are critical for the establishment of desirable growth environment (Chap 4). In this phase of study, the thermal characterization of a modified vertical Bridgman system for growth of BSO were conducted by measuring the axial and radial temperature distribution in a semitransparent dummy charge made of fused silica which has comparable thern 1 a] and optical properties as BSO. A modified control method, in which two control thermocouples are placed in the gradient zone, was proved effective in stabilizing the <b>axial</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient.</b> Thermal radiation was found to have a significant role in determining the temperature distribution inside the semitransparent charge. Use of a metallic confmement around the charge was able to reduce the influence of the external thermal radiation, and generated the typical transition of isothermal profile from convex to planar, then to concave along the axial direction in the charge. The effect of the remaining thermal radiation through the metallic shield caused the asymmetry of the axial thermal profile and resulted iri a high position (close to the hot zone) of the planar isotherm. (3) Three ground-based growth experiments were conducted in this phase using the proposed ampoule design and growth conditions (Chap 5). Single crystals with desirable interface morphology were obtained, which confirmed the effectiveness of the thermal characterization. The position of the interface shifted during the growth due to the end effects of a short charge. The solution to this problem is to use a longer charge and/or to place the two control thermocouples closer to each other. Embrittlement of platinum happened when the ampoule was sealed during the growth. To avoid this problem, a dynamic airflow system should be constructed in the VB furnace, and the ampoule should be left open during the growth process. Interesting solid phase inclusions with unknown identities were found in one VBgrown crystal. The origin of such inclusions, as well as their correlation to the growth conditions, is remained as the subjects for the future work.

We then introduced a new way to manipulate the position of nanoparticles by translating the position of thermostats with desirable <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> Compared to nanomanipulation using a scanning tunneling microscope or an atomic force microscope, our method for nanomanipulation has a great advantage by not requiring a direct contact between the probe and the object...|$|R
