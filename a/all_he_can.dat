He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and measurement result. After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel. Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis each was measured in. They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.|$|E

Jeremy also set up a website, [...] www.freegordon.com, in a bid to raise awareness and support of the case for Gordon.

That you're {{no more than a}} whore, you just have a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry.

His death helped Ernest repair his {{relationship}} with his sister-in-law, as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angrier over Ernest's objections to the Danish match. The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert's death left Ernest [...] "wretched", noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, in which her mother Princess Louise [...] "had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers"; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter [...] "You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I am always alarmed when I think of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix".

[...] He added that since Oliver made a serious surgical error, his colleagues had lost trust in his medical capability. When a train crash occurred, he was forced to take control of AAU. Anderson explained: [...] "He's not fully qualified and that's <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> think about. He's struggling." [...] When he saved a patients life, Oliver thought he should keep his job. However, he was then told that Penny had died, news that would [...] "change Oliver's life forever." [...] Following Penny's death, Craig-Brown stated that [...] "whether he's good enough to stay in medicine will be [...] big storyline." [...] The series explored how Oliver coped with her death through a flashback episode. Henry, who plays Hanssen, observed that Oliver's return to work saw him make multiple mistakes and [...] "hit rock bottom". Oliver tried to resign from Holby, though before he left he responded to a dangerous RTA call and saved a patient's life. When he was summoned by Hanssen about his resignation, he was given [...] "fatherly advice", and the senior doctor [...] "turned a blind eye" [...] to Oliver's confession. Henry explained that Hanssen [...] "doesn’t think a good doctor should lose his chance at a career in medicine", after learning Oliver risked his own life on the job.|$|E

Later in the day Bakiyev was reported to have flown into exile to the Kazakhstani city of Taraz. it was said that he would continue negotiations on a settlement to the crisis from exile. The interim government responded to this by calling his departure a [...] "deportation," [...] saying he had allegedly submitted a request to resign amid reports indicating that Baktybek Kaliyev, a former defence minister, had been arrested. The interim government also said it would seek Bakiyev's transfer to a Kyrgyz or international court for trial at a later date. Kazakhstan, as the chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, confirmed Bakiyev's departure saying it was an important step towards preventing civil war. It added that joint efforts between themselves and Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama had fostered such an agreement. Bakiyev submitted a hand-written resignation letter saying [...] "I tender my resignation in these tragic days as I understand the full scale of my responsibility for the future of the Kyrgyz people." [...] The interim president allegedly said [...] "he had become a source of instability ... they could no longer tolerate that." [...] She added that most of his entourage was still in the country and that she would press ahead with bringing Bakyiev to trial. On 20 April, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko said his country had afforded Bakiyev and three members of his family [...] "the protection of our state, and personally of the president." [...] On 21 April, in a statement from Minsk, Bakiyev said he still considers himself the country's president and pledged to do <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> to return the country to its [...] "constitutional field."

Only death can stop me." [...] He then called on the international community not to support the interim government. [...] "Everyone must know the bandits who are trying to take power are the executors of an external force and have no legitimacy. I call on leaders of the international community: do not set a precedent and do not recognise this gang as the legitimate authorities." [...] Russia consequently rejected this assertion on the grounds that he had already tendered his resignation saying [...] "this document cannot be rejected by a verbal [...] statement." [...] He also accused the Russians of being annoyed with his allowing the Manas air base to continue operating for the Americans and NATO to supply their forces in the Afghan war. [...] On 23 April, Bakiyev backtracked on his vow to return to power, but claimed his resignation is invalid because the new government is failing to protect his family as was promised.|$|E
