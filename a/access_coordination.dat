The planned collaboration will allow the two hospitals to work even more closely together to improve healthcare quality and access, coordinate care and improve efficiency for their patients through shared resources and managing the flow of patients between the two facilities. The affiliation will combine a financially sound community hospital with a high-quality tertiary academic medical center to improve healthcare delivery and education in the rapidly changing landscape of healthcare reform. It will help both hospitals move toward creating an “accountable care organization,” with a network of hospitals, community physicians, shared best practices and electronic medical records.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of Internet applications requiring dynamic and possibly mobile access to Internet resources {{can take advantage of}} an approach based on autonomous mobile agents. However, mobility introduces peculiar issues related to the modeling and management of the agents' coordination activities. This paper introduces context-dependent coordination as a framework for the design {{and development of}} Internet applications based on mobile agents, and shows how it can be supported by a proper coordination infrastructure. Context-dependent coordination is centered on the notion of programmable coordination media, as the software abstraction via which an agent in an Internet site can access to local resources and coordinate with local agents. Programmability {{stems from the fact that}} the behavior of the media can be fully configured to influence agents' coordination activities. This enables local administrators to configure coordination media so as to enact site-dependent coordination policies, and mobile agents to configure the <b>accessed</b> <b>coordination</b> media to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the media themselves. Several application examples shows that exploiting context-dependent coordination promotes a clear separation of concern in design and development, and can make applications more modular and easier to be maintained.

We investigate design strategies and compare the two approaches in a prototype object storage system using a parallel read/modify/write benchmark.

THe current ATM paradigm for B-ISDN inherits a lot from the telecommunications environment but ironically enough its first applications {{are expected to be}} the broadband (ATM) LAN and the interconnection of LANs over wide areas.

Since 802. 11 uses the random <b>access</b> Distributed <b>Coordination</b> Function (DCF) mechanism to access the medium, collisions can occur when two or more stations want to transmit data simultaneously. The challenge of rate adaptation schemes is to adapt the physical transmission rate based on channel-related losses, i. e. collisions should not influence {{the choice of the}} rate. In this paper we propose a new rate adaptation algorithm that behaves like Auto Rate Fallback (ARF), but makes use of the RTS/CTS handshake, when necessary, to decide whether the physical transmission rate should be changed. Main advantages of this algorithm are its simple implementation and the good performance it attains in presence of collisions. We evaluate the performance of this new rate adaptation algorithm, comparing it with other well known algorithms, by using the new NS– 3 simulator. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{studies in}} above literatures are {{specified}} on single channel, which necessitate the multichannel <b>access</b> <b>coordination</b> to extend to multichannel industrial WSNs. To exploit the multichannel diversity, the authors in [21] propose a multichannel superframe scheduling mechanism for cluster-tree topology network based on IEEE 802.15. 4 protocol. It allocates each cluster with one orthogonal channel to avoid inter-cluster interference. The superframe is still defined on single channel. A fixed priority packet transmission method based on WirelessHART is proposed in [22] for multichannel multihop networks. To meet the delay constraint, each sensor determines the transmission order of packets with {{the consideration of}} their remaining hops to the destination. Multiple channels are used to support parallel transmissions over multiple routing paths to reduce the end-to-end delay of packet delivery. In [23], the authors considered the multipriority multichannel access in cognitive radio environment. Similar to [15], high-priority traffics are allowed to preempt transmission chances of low-priority traffics. The authors in [24] proposed a distributed priority-aware multichannel access scheme based on weighted congestion game, where higher priority traffics are assigned with larger weight coefficients, thus to acquire more spectrum resource.|$|E

More precisely, the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer introduces two medium <b>access</b> <b>coordination</b> functions, the mandatory DCF and the optional Point Coordination Function (PCF) (an additional mechanism, RTS/CTS, is defined in the IEEE 802.11 standard to solve the hidden terminal problem and to adequately handle the transmission of long messages. For further details, please refer to [1]). DCF is the basic IEEE 802.11 mechanism, where stations perform a so-called backoff procedure before initiating a transmission. When a station wants to transmit, it first senses the medium (carrier sensing); if the medium remains idle during a specific time interval called DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space) it immediately starts the transmission. Otherwise, the station selects a random time called backoff time. The duration of this time interval is a multiple of the Slot Time (ST), which is a system parameter {{that depends on the}} characteristics of the physical layer (PHY).

In such environments, heterogeneity in demand patterns of the secondary users can lead to constant changes in the interference levels, and thus can {{be a source of}} volatility to the utilities of the users. In this paper, we consider secondary users to be service providers that provide downlink services. We formulate the spectrum sharing problem as a non-cooperative iterated game of power control where service providers change their power levels to fix their long-term average rates at utility-maximizing values. First, we show that in any iterated 2 x 2 game, the structure of the single-stage game dictates the degree of control that a service provider can exert on the long-term outcome of the game. Then we show that if service providers use binary actions either to access or not to access the channel at any round of the game, then the long-term rate can be fixed regardless of the strategy of the opponent. We identify these rates and show that they can be achieved using mixed Markovian strategies that will be clearly identified in the paper...|$|E
