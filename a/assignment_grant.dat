30|$|PDCCH carries {{downlink}} scheduling {{assignments and}} uplink scheduling grants. The information {{fields in the}} scheduling <b>assignments</b> and scheduling <b>grants</b> include resource allocation information, transport format information, and HARQ information. Since there is no HARQ mechanism in PDCCH {{and the failure of}} PDCCH transmission will directly lead to failure of subsequent PDSCH transmission, the BLER target is set to 1 % for the purpose of reliable PDCCH transmission. The MCS for transmission of PDCCH payload is QPSK modulation with four different effective coding rates of 2 / 3, 1 / 3, 1 / 6, and 1 / 12, corresponding to aggregation level of 1, 2, 4, 8 CCEs, respectively. A user in favorable radio channel conditions may require just 1 CCE with QPSK 2 / 3. Adaptive coding can be used to aggregate 2, 4, or even 8 CCEs with lower effective coding rate, thus improving the PDCCH coverage for users in worse radio channel conditions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The University of Florence (Italy) {{offers some}} {{scholarships}} {{every year to}} eligible freshmen: eligibility is based on merit and economic needs. The number of grants awarded is usually constrained by a fixed budget: not all students applying for a grant receive one. Applicants are ranked {{on the basis of}} an economic indicator, that depends in a deterministic way on family income, property and personal assets, and family structure, and only a varying percentage of high-ranking applicants receive a grant. The amount of aid received varies with the value of their economic indicator. We investigate whether the grant is an effective tool to prevent students from low-income families from dropping out of higher education. We show which causal parameters can be identified from available information: under mild assumptions, the <b>grant’s</b> <b>assignment</b> rule can be exploited to estimate the grant’s effects at different values of the economic indicators. Preliminary results for two cohorts of freshmen seem to suggest that the grants have significant effects, reducing the dropout probability, although some grant's amounts are too low to prevent low-income students from dropping out. 1.

The station, owned by UHF pioneer Robert Rounsaville {{was one of}} about 150 UHF stations to give the new high-band spectrum a try. The TV station, which had one camera, shared {{a house in the}} northeast Atlanta area of Buckhead with WQXI radio. The radio station constantly promoted it's TV sister station in an effort to build an audience. However, UHF converters were rare prior to the All-Channel Receiver Act and programming (largely old movies, a Saturday-evening barn dance and shots of the radio DJ spinning records) was nearly unwatchable. The station signed off after less than six months on the air on March 15, 1955 (the WQXI callsign was later used on now-sister station WXIA-TV from 1968 to 1974). Despite being off the air the call letters were changed to WATL-TV in early 1956.

40|$|This article uses data {{obtained}} from Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] to calculate the refugee claim grant rates of individual IRB adjudicators. The data reveals that, in 2006, grant rates varied significantly across adjudicators. Some adjudicators accorded refugee status in virtually all cases they heard, others granted refugee status rarely, if at all. The article explores several explanations offered by the IRB for refugee claim grant rate variations. These explanations relate to patterns in case assignment due to adjudicator specialization in particular types of cases from particular regions of the world. The author contends that while patterns in case <b>assignment</b> do affect <b>grant</b> rates, they do {{not account for the}} full variations evident in the data. Rather, outcomes in refugee adjudication appear to hinge, at least in part, on the identity of the adjudicator assigned. The author draws three main conclusions from the data on refugee adjudication in 2006. First, further empirical research should be undertaken to verify {{the results of the study}} and to identify specific features of adjudicator identity that affect refugee claim outcomes. Second, the appointment process for IRB adjudicators should be carefully scrutinized in light of grant rate disparities. Third, given both the grant rate disparities and the life and death stakes involved in refugee adjudication, it is imperative there be opportunities to meaningfully review negative first instance refugee determinations. To this end, the government should immediately implement the provisions in Canada’s immigration legislation that establish a Refugee Appeal Division at the IRB...|$|R

He believes that whatever we do badly to nature will come back to us at some point. In between assignments and with this philosophy in mind, Badessi dedicated ten years taking nudes in dramatic landscapes, showing how close we are to nature. In 2000, the prestigious Swiss publishing company Edition Stemmle, released his first book, SKIN, which featured a foreword written by Sondra Gilman, Founder and Chairperson of the photography committee at the Whitney Museum in New York. A few solo shows presenting some of this work had previously taken place in Paris, but in the years to follow the publication of the book, more exhibitions opened in the United States and abroad. At the same time, his photographs became part of numerous important collections and he received several prestigious awards and grants. During this transitional phase of his career, Badessi decided to focus on the fine art aspects of photography and only accepted commercial <b>assignments</b> that would <b>grant</b> him total control over the images. The campaign he produced for Charles Jourdan (2004) is the perfect example of Badessi’s desire to create and nurture an image from its concept to its final phase. The success of the Charles Jourdan project was a great challenge, because for two decades, Guy Bourdin had generated a large amount of stunning photographs for the brand that have become iconic images. To bring his own vision, Badessi played with eroticism and mythological symbolism, creating memorable visuals that are in the permanent collection of le Musée de la publicité - Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris. That same year, one of the photographs “The Abduction of Ganymede 1” made the headlines for an article in the New York Times.|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the U. S. Supreme Court, in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (PICS), invalidated {{the student}} {{assignment}} policies of Seattle, Washington and Jefferson County, Kentucky. The Court {{ruled that the}} government has a compelling interest to promote diversity, while simultaneously arguing that racial balance and diversity should be considered different and separate goals. Thus, the PICS decision sent mixed messages to school districts across the country. To help school districts navigate the legally uncertain environment, the federal government created a small, one-time competitive grant called the Technical Assistance for Student <b>Assignment</b> Plan (TASAP) <b>grant.</b> The grant was designed in a way that gave school districts significant discretion over the types of technical assistance and the consultants that would support their projects. Eleven school districts received funding from the TASAP grant. The districts faced common challenges, in particular, financial austerity, declining enrollments, and pressure to reduce achievement gaps between racial and socioeconomic groups. The most common topics of technical assistance were public engagement, including marketing and community forums, and geospatial analysis. Most of the districts that used TASAP funds to continue existing policies maintained an emphasis on diversity. On the other hand, most of the districts that used TASAP to help change their student assignment policies moved away from diversity as a priority. Districts that had expressed a commitment to diversity in their TASAP applications could not necessarily sustain those commitments in the face of competition with other local interests and needs. Federal management of the grant did not provide leverage on districts to ensure that the local work remained true to its initial goals. federal government did not insist that diversity remain a priority. We present six recommendations for future federal diversity policy, based on the TASAP experience: 1. 	Construct a more deliberate theory of change so that all elements of the grant, including the proposal evaluation criteria and funded activities, are aligned. 2. 	Solicit grant proposals {{for a longer period of}} time. 3. 	Include inter-district approaches to diversity 4.
