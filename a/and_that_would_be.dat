Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the end of our contribution... They would shout back at us <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically {{of the things that they}} are doing.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stages of French colonization, the {{execution}} of criminal justice in New France were rather arbitrary.

25|$|The best-known {{period in}} the history of Yorghan Tepe is by far one of the city of Nuzi in the 15th-14th centuries BC.

25|$|The 1983 Hildt Amendment or Hildt Agreement (named after Seattle City Council member Michael Hildt) {{struck a}} balance between farmers and craftspeople in the daystalls. The {{agreement}} set rules that would last for ten years from August 1, 1983, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> successively renewable for further terms of five years. The precise formula it laid out stood for over 15 years, and it set the precedent for today's allocation of daystalls, in that it gave craftspeople priority in the North Arcade and farmers priority elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Remarkable is {{the absence}} of {{peripheral}} burials for the members of the royal family. Indeed, no mastaba or pyramid of a queen dating to Sahure's time has been discovered as of 2012 in the immediate vicinity of Sahure's pyramid. This is in rupture with a tradition dating back at least to pharaoh Sneferu <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> followed by Sahure's successors. Consequently, Sahure's consort queen Meretnebty, is only attested through carved reliefs found in the high temple. The reason for this absence is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous {{as a result of the}} strike.|$|E

Macy, commenting on {{the slow pace of}} filming the script, said [...] "we would do a quarter-page--some days, an eighth of a page. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a full 12-hour day." ...|$|E
500|$|The artwork {{for both}} Oral Fixation albums was {{inspired}} by Eve, the first woman; Shakira said she wanted [...] "to attribute to Eve one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> her oral fixation" [...] and that [...] " [...] that [...] been a very oral person.

The first volume's cover sees Shakira holding a baby girl in her arms; the artwork for the second album shows a nude Shakira (covered by tree branches), with the infant sitting in the tree.

500|$|Initial {{planning}} for the Pinto began {{in the summer of}} 1967; was recommended by Ford's Product Planning Committee in December 1968; and approved by Ford's Board of Directors in January 1969. Ford President Lee Iacocca wanted a 1971 model that weighed less than 2,000 pounds <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> priced at less than $2,000. The Pinto product development, from conception through delivery, was completed in 25 months, when the automotive industry average was 43 months; the Pinto project was the shortest production planning schedule in automotive history up to that time. Some development processes usually conducted sequentially were conducted in parallel. Machine tooling overlapped with product development, which froze the basic design. Decisions which threatened the schedule were discouraged. The attitude of Ford management was to develop the Pinto as quickly as possible. Iacocca ordered a rush project to build the car, and the Pinto became known internally as [...] "Lee's car." [...] The Pinto's bodywork was styled by Robert Eidschun.|$|E
500|$|Scientists {{continued}} {{to search for}} new synthetic dyes that would be effective on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more colorfast on wool and silk than the early anilines. [...] Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens. [...] These were followed by acid dyes for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880. [...] The work on indigo {{led to the development}} of a new class of dyes called vat dyes in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for vegetable fibres. [...] Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate, which could not be colored with any existing dyes. [...] Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics. [...] Reactive dyes for both wool and cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s, and are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing.|$|E
