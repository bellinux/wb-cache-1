Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further {{over the next few}} days due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment.</b> PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories.

5|$|A non-tropical area of low pressure, first noted {{over the}} Gulf Stream on August7, entered the southeastern Gulf of Mexico and {{organized}} into a tropical depression about 120mi (190km) west of Fort Myers, Florida, by 18:00UTC on August10. As {{the newly formed}} cyclone moved west-northwest, a nearby upper-level low imparted high wind shear and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment,</b> and the depression degenerated into a remnant low twelve hours later without attaining tropical storm intensity. Upon degeneration, the low moved into the Gulf Coast of the United States and conducted a clockwise loop. It emerged into the Gulf of Mexico again on August16, where the disturbance nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall in Mississippi the next day. The remnants dissipated over the southeastern portion of the state on August18.|$|E

However, the thunderstorm activity decreased markedly on September6, primarily from dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment,</b> and it weakened to tropical depression status for the last time. In one forecast, Kristy was predicted {{to move into the}} area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, or west of 140°W. However, the depression was unable to maintain organized convection around its center for a few days, and Kristy degenerated into a remnant low on September8. The low turned to the southwest, degenerating into a tropical wave on September9 about 1500miles (2400km) southeast of the island of Hawaii, or about 1600miles (2600km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The remnant disturbance continued westward, and initially Kristy was believed to have developed into Tropical Depression Two-C in the central Pacific Ocean; however, post-season analysis concluded the systems were separate.|$|E

40|$|<b>Air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> {{is defined}} as the {{exchange}} of air between the atmosphere and flowing water. Also called self-aeration, the continuous exchange between air and water is most important for the biological and chemical equilibrium on our planet. <b>Air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> is observed in chemical, coastal, hydraulic, mechanical and nuclear engineering applications {{as well as in the}} natural environment such as waterfalls, mountain streams and river rapids, and breaking waves on the ocean surface. The resulting "white waters " provide some spectacular effects. The <b>entrainment</b> of <b>air</b> bubbles may be localised at a flow discontinuity or continuous along an air-water free-surface: i. e., singular and interfacial aeration respectively. At a flow singularity, the air bubbles are entrained locally at the impinging perimeter and advected in a region of high turbulent shear stresses. The interfacial aeration is the <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> process along an air-water interface which is parallel to the flow direction. The onset of <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> may be expressed in terms of the tangential Reynolds stress and the fluid properties. Once self-aeration takes place, the distributions of void fraction may be modelled by some analytical solutions of the advective diffusion equation for air bubbles. The microscopic structure of turbulent bubbly flows is complex and a number of examples are discussed. The results reveal the turbulent nature of the complex two-phase flows and the complicated interactions between entrained air bubbles and turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In open channels, the {{transition}} from a rapid to fluvial flow is called a hydraulic jump. It is characterised by large scale turbulence, <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> and energy dissipation. The author has investigated the <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> at hydraulic jumps with partially developed inflow conditions. The air-water flow is characterised by a turbulent shear region with a large air content which contributes to the enhancement of the air-water interface area and air-water gas transfer in the hydraulic jump. A new gas transfer model is presented. Based upon physical evidence, the model enables to predict the dissolved gas contents and water quality downstream of hydraulic jumps with partially developed inflows...|$|R
5|$|By September 23, Jeanne {{had begun}} a slow westward motion, with its {{previously}} well-defined eye becoming ragged. It moved slowly over waters it traversed {{just four days}} prior, causing upwelling; this is the process in which a stationary storm causes the water temperatures to decrease by bringing the cooler, deeper waters to the surface. As a result, Jeanne weakened to a minimal hurricane midday on September 23, though it was forecast to re-intensify and attain major hurricane status. By early on September 24, the winds had decreased to 80mph (130km/h); its convection weakened in intensity, and the eyewall eroded due to dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment.</b> However, as Jeanne moved toward an area of warmer waters, deep convection redeveloped around the eye. Its favorable upper-level environment allowed the outflow to become better defined, with a large eye and nearby dry air being the primary restraining factors for development. At 1200UTC on September 25, Jeanne attained major hurricane status, and two hours later it made landfall on Abaco Island.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{designation}} as a named storm, Carlos drifted generally north-northwestward while {{embedded within}} a weak steering regime. The cyclone struggled {{with a combination of}} northerly wind shear and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment,</b> limiting the storm's associated deep convection to the eastern quadrant. By early on June13, however, a ragged eye became evident on visible satellite imagery as the upper-level environment became increasingly conducive for intensification, and Carlos was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale at 12:00UTC. Deep convection became increasingly symmetric about the eye, and the cyclone reached its initial peak intensity six hours later with winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, early on June14, the presentation of Carlos began to deteriorate as a result of upwelling and the ingestion of dry air; the eye became obscured and banding features decreased as evident on satellite imagery, while the eyewall became increasingly ill-defined on radar. At 00:00UTC on June15, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm about 75mi (120km) west-southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} of a tropical wave and another elongated trough {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September14 about 375mi (605km) east of Chetumal, Mexico. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Karl six hours later and continued to strengthen until moving ashore near Rio Huach, Mexico, with winds of 65mph (100km/h) at 12:45UTC on September15. Although the storm's winds diminished over land, the structure of the storm actually improved, allowing Karl to quickly become a hurricane by 18:00UTC on September16 once emerging over the Bay of Campeche. A period of rapid deepening brought the cyclone to its peak of 125mph (205km/h) early on September17, the only major hurricane on record in the Bay of Campeche. Increasing shear and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> caused Karl to weaken slightly, but it retained winds of 115mph (185km/h) while making landfall just north of Veracruz, Mexico by 16:45UTC on September17. The system weakened rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, falling to tropical storm intensity by 00:00UTC on September18, weakening to a tropical depression six hours later, and dissipating about 85mi (140km) southeast of Veracruz by 12:00UTC.|$|E

5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2010 season developed from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on October24. The wave pushed west, organizing into a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on October29 and into Tropical Storm Tomas six hours later while located {{a few hundred}} miles east of Barbados. The cyclone turned northwest after formation while continuing to intensify, moving over Barbados by 09:00UTC on October30 with winds of 70mph (110km/h); as such, Tomas became the latest storm in a calendar year to strike the Windward Islands. The system reached hurricane intensity three hours later, and by 20:00UTC, attained its peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) while moving across St. Lucia. After moving into the Caribbean, a sharp increase in wind shear and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> caused Tomas to dramatically weaken, and the storm fell to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on November3. Fluctuating atmospheric conditions allowed Tomas to strengthen and oscillate between a tropical storm and hurricane as it curved through the Windward Passage and into the Atlantic. By 00:00UTC on November8, the cyclone succumbed to an increasingly unfavorable regime and became an extra{{tropical cyclone}}. The storm rotated around a broader low in the western Atlantic before being absorbed by a larger extratropical low south of Newfoundland early on November11.|$|E
5|$|The {{most intense}} {{hurricane}} {{of the season}} began as a tropical wave that organized into a tropical depression southeast of Cabo Verde early on September8. Initial organization was fast-paced, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Igor six hours after formation. Igor moved west to west-northwest for several days while embedded within the monsoon trough. Increased vertical shear caused the cyclone to temporarily weaken to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC on September9, but it re-attained tropical storm intensity {{the next day and}} further strengthened to a hurricane by 00:00UTC on September12. After rapid intensification and a subsequent eyewall replacement cycle, Igor attained its peak with maximum sustained winds of 155mph (250km/h) by 00:00UTC on September15. Inner core changes continued after peak, and Igor continued as a Category4 hurricane for several days until increased shear and dry <b>air</b> <b>entrainment</b> forced a consistent weakening trend early on September17. The system recurved north-northeast while passing within 60mi (95km) of Bermuda as a minimal hurricane. It eventually made landfall near Cape Race, Newfoundland with winds of 85mph (140km/h) by 15:00UTC on September21 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone three hours later. The extratropical low was absorbed by a larger such system between Greenland and Labrador on September23.|$|E

Traditionally, physical studies are conducted using a Froude similitude which implies drastically smaller laboratory Reynolds numbers than in the corresponding prototype flows. Basic dimensional analyses are developed for both singular and interfacial aeration processes.

Recent studies of local air–water flow properties highlight that turbulence levels, entrained bubble sizes and interfacial areas are improperly scaled based upon a Froude similitude even in large-size models operating with the so defined Reynolds numbers up to 5 E+ 5.

Key features are the intense free-surface aeration of both prototype and laboratory systems and the macro-roughness caused by the stepped cavities. Herein the <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> and turbulence were investigated in a stepped spillway model, to characterise the interplay between <b>air</b> bubble <b>entrainment</b> and turbulence, and the complicated interactions between mainstream flow and cavity recirculation motion. New experiments were conducted in a large steep stepped chute (θ= 45 °, h= 0. 10 m, W= 0. 985 m). Detailed two-phase flow measurements were conducted for a range of discharges corresponding to Reynolds numbers between 2 × 10 and 9 × 10. The total pressure, air-water flow and turbulence properties were documented systematically in the mainstream and cavity flows. Energy calculations showed an overall energy dissipation of about 50 % regardless of the discharge. Overall the data indicated that the bottom roughness (i. e. stepped profile) was a determining factor on the energy dissipation performance of the stepped structure, {{as well as on the}} longitudinal changes in air-water flow properties.

The A. thaliana ecotype Col- 5 was transformed with a functional 2 -oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase (BniGSL-ALK) that converts 3 -methylsulfinylpropylglucosinolate and 4 -methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate to 2 -propenylglucosinolate and 3 -butenylglucosinolate, respectively. This transformation results in a change in the glucosinolate hydrolysis profile where 3 -butenylisothiocyanate, 2 -propenylisothiocyanate and 5 -vinyloxazolidine- 2 -thione are produced in contrast to the wild-type plant where 4 -methylsulfinylbutylisothiocyanate is the main product. Performance of B. brassicae was affected negatively by transforming Col- 5 with BniGSL-ALK in terms of mean relative growth rates. In a series of behavioral bioassays, naïve D. rapae females were able to discriminate between B. brassicae infested and uninfested Col- 5 plants transformed with BniGSL-ALK, with parasitoids showing a preference for B. brassicae infested plants. By contrast, naïve D. rapae females were unable to discriminate between aphid infested and uninfested Col- 5 plants. Subsequent <b>air</b> <b>entrainments</b> of B. brassicae infested Col- 5 plants transformed with BniGSL-ALK further confirmed the presence of 3 -butenylisothiocyanate in the headspace.

At low air velocities (Re= 1500), the curtain was found to detach, leading to extremely high entrainment rates.
