The actual name is reportedly {{an homage to}} the Star Trek PADD, a fictional device very similar in appearance to the iPad. The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Jobs at an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.|$|E

The review was introduced by a few liner notes by <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> officer Derek Taylor. The US cover contained a fictitious illustrated biography by Dan Davis of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, in which the ensemble's battle with the Blue Meanies was compared to three other epic struggles {{in the history of the}} English-speaking world: Beowulf's struggle to save the Heorot mead hall, King John's signing of the Magna Carta and Thomas Jefferson's writing of the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

25|$|On April 28, 2004, iTunes Music Store marked {{its first}} anniversary with 70 million songs sold, clear {{dominance}} in the paid online music market and a slight profit. The store also offers hundreds of movie trailers and music videos, {{in an attempt to}} boost soundtrack sales. In the conference, Steve Jobs reiterated that a subscription service is still not in the interest of customers and reported that only 5 million of the 100 million songs offered in the Pepsi giveaway campaign were redeemed, which he blamed on technical problems in Pepsi distribution. According to an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> release dated August 10, 2004, iTunes Music Store was the first store to have a catalog of more than one million songs. Also, iTunes Music Store at that point maintained a 70 percent market share of legal music downloads.|$|E
500|$|Apple re-entered the mobile-computing {{markets in}} 2007 with the iPhone. Smaller than the iPad, but {{featuring}} {{a camera and}} mobile phone, it pioneered the multi-touch finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's iOS mobile operating system. By late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years. Such speculation mostly talked about [...] "Apple's tablet"; specific names included iTablet and iSlate. The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Steve Jobs at an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> conference at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Following a year {{of highly}} publicised peace campaigning by the Lennons in 1969, <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> officer Derek Taylor was {{concerned}} that they had exhausted the media's interest in their causes. On 4 February 1970, Lennon and Ono donated a large plastic bag full of their hair, along with Apple's poster for the new single, to north London-based black power activist Michael X, {{in return for a}} pair of Muhammad Ali's bloodstained boxing shorts. The [...] "final proof" [...] of the Lennons' [...] "overexpose", according to Taylor, was that there was a large press turnout for the event yet [...] "nobody printed anything".|$|E

500|$|Pre-orders were so {{high for}} the third-generation iPad that later orders were quoted {{shipping}} times of [...] "two to three weeks" [...] after the order was placed. Apple said that [...] "customer response to the new iPad has been off the charts and the quantity available for pre-order has been purchased." [...] Despite the delayed shipping, many users chose to purchase the iPad online instead of waiting {{in line at the}} Apple Store. Approximately 750 people waited outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City for the product's release. According to an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> release, three million units were sold in the first three days. The iPad was purchased mainly by a younger, male demographic. Most of the buyers were either [...] "die-hard Apple fans" [...] or had previously purchased an iPad. An Apple retailer in Dayton, Ohio, claimed that the demand for the tablet was [...] "chaotic" [...] and claimed that its launch was [...] "drastically more significant than the iPad 2 launch." [...] By Q2 of 2012, Apple would hit an all-time high, claiming 69.6 percent of the global tablet market.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} problems within the Beatles' Apple business empire became another divisive issue at this time. From summer 1968 until {{the appointment of}} Allen Klein as business manager in March 1969, McCartney was a regular presence at Apple's central London headquarters, calling staff meetings and urging financial restraint. While noting that all the individual Beatles were demanding employers, <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> officer Derek Taylor later described McCartney as [...] "the bossiest of the bossy"; according to Tony Bramwell, Apple Records' head of promotions, Lennon and partner Yoko Ono inflicted [...] "their own reign of terror". On 18 January, Disc magazine published what author Peter Doggett describes as [...] "a heroin-fuelled monologue" [...] by Lennon {{in which he said}} of Apple's finances: [...] "If it carries on like this, all of us will be broke in the next few months." [...] While McCartney sought to appoint his in-laws, New York lawyers Lee and John Eastman, as the band's business advisors, Lennon's outburst attracted the attention of the less conservative Klein. The latter effectively became the Beatles' manager when Harrison and Ringo Starr also chose to put their faith in his tough approach to business. Refusing to acknowledge Klein as his representative, McCartney later cited this division as the first [...] "irreconcilable difference" [...] among the four Beatles, leading to the band's break-up in April 1970.|$|E
2500|$|In early September 2007, an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> {{release for}} the new iPod touch, related iPod updates, and iPhone price cut was {{entitled}} [...] "The Beat Goes On", {{the title of the}} Beatles' last press release before splitting up. Although Beatles content was still unavailable from the iTunes store, each Beatle's solo work could be accessed and downloaded on this service. Paul McCartney was quoted in Rolling Stone as saying that their catalogue would be released through digital music stores such as iTunes {{in the first quarter of}} 2008, but this did not happen until 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{appeared}} {{as the final}} track on That's the Way God Planned It, released in August 1969. Titled [...] "That's the Way God Planned It (Parts 1 & 2)", this version extended to 5:34 in length compared to the 3:22 edit on the single.

2500|$|In 1997, {{the year}} Steve Jobs {{returned}} to Apple, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell was {{asked how he}} would fix Apple. Dell responded: [...] "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders". This angered Jobs, due to Dell's success with its online store originally built by NeXT, Jobs' former business that Apple acquired to bring Jobs back. A team of Apple and NeXT employees spent several months building an online store that {{would be better than}} Dell's. On November 10, 1997, Steve Jobs announced the online store at an <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> event, and during his keynote speech, he said: [...] "I guess what we want to tell you, Michael, is that with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order manufacturing, we're coming after you, buddy." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" [...] evolved out of song {{fragments}} that Lennon {{wrote in}} Rishikesh. According to MacDonald, this working method {{was inspired by}} the Incredible String Band's songwriting. The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best half of two takes edited together. Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites, {{while the rest of the}} band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right. <b>Apple's</b> <b>press</b> officer Derek Taylor made an uncredited contribution to the song's lyrics.|$|R
50|$|Many {{works of}} art from the Midwinter Fair can still be seen at Golden Gate Park today. Some of the sculptures {{remaining}} include the <b>Apple</b> Cider <b>Press,</b> Roman Gladiator, Prayer Book Cross, Doré Vase and two sphinxes. The Doré Vase, created by French sculptor Gustave Doré, is an eleven-foot bronze sculpture that speaks to the valued process of winemaking. The <b>Apple</b> Cider <b>Press,</b> a monument created by American artist Thomas Shields Clarke, {{was said to be}} a working cider fountain during the fair. Both the Doré Vase and the <b>Apple</b> Cider <b>Press</b> can be seen in front of the De Young museum today. The third sculpture was traditionally called Roman Gladiator. This bronze sculpture, created by George Geefs in 1884, has been identified as Leonidas, King of Sparta. It was exhibited at the 1894 Midwinter Fair, and then moved to the spot where Michael de Young turned the first spade of dirt to begin construction of the fair. The Prayer Book Cross, created by Ernest Coxhead, is a 57-foot sandstone Celtic cross that was a gift from the Church of England to commemorate the first Anglican service held in the English language in California.|$|R
2500|$|When RCA {{had asked}} if there was {{anything}} special he wanted as a signing premium, Nilsson asked for his own office at RCA, being used to working out of one. In the weeks after the <b>Apple</b> <b>press</b> conference, Nilsson's office phone began ringing constantly, with offers and requests for interviews and inquiries about his performing schedule. Nilsson usually answered the calls himself, surprising the callers, and answered questions candidly. (He recalled years later the flow of a typical conversation: [...] "When did you play last?" [...] "I didn't." [...] "Where have you played before?" [...] "I haven't." [...] "When will you be playing next?" [...] "I don't.") Nilsson acquired a manager, who steered him into a handful of TV guest appearances, and a brief run of stage performances in Europe set up by RCA. He disliked the experiences he had, though, and decided to stick to the recording studio. He later admitted this was a huge mistake on his part.|$|E
