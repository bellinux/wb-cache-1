In 2005, Paramore signed with the New York City-based Fueled by Ramen and released their debut album entitled <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling. Three singles were released from the album, {{but none of them}} charted. The album did not chart in the Billboard 200 either, although it peaked at number thirty in the Billboard Top Heatseekers. <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling received Gold certification in the United Kingdom and in July 2014 the RIAA certified the album Gold in the United States.|$|E

They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> {{is that it is}} based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.|$|E

There was clearly an important element here of Alfred exercising his dominance; however, the source material provides no hint as to the wider implications of this in terms of territory or otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Initially, <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling only charted on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking {{at number}} 30 in September 2006. After {{the success of}} their second studio album Riot! (2007), the album sales {{gradually}} built. Although it never charted on Billboard 200, it did manage to take number eight on the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2009. <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling only reached number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, but still received gold certification in 2009 by the British Phonographic Industry for shipping over 100,000 copies. It was then certified in Australia in 2012, where it went gold for shipments of over 35,000 units despite never reaching an Australian chart. In 2014, the album was certified gold in the United States for shipments of over 500,000 copies. Initially, none of the singles managed to chart, but after the success of Riot!, [...] "Pressure" [...] was able to peak at number 62 on the Billboard Digital Songs chart. In 2016, the recording was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).|$|E
500|$|Typically, Farro {{would write}} the music while Williams wrote the lyrics. On occasion, Farro would {{contribute}} lyrics as well. [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was composed by Williams, Farro, and Taylor York. It {{was the first}} song they wrote together. Many of the lyrics in <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling which {{are not related to}} Davis' departure deal with the bad relationship and divorce of Williams' parents. The band's influences varied in sound during the album's recording. Williams claimed influence from metal bands Underoath and Failure, and from pop rock band The Academy Is... Davis said the band were heavily influenced by Slipknot.|$|E

500|$|According to Wallace, [...] "for us Aspasia herself {{possesses}} and can possess {{almost no}} historical reality". Hence, Madeleine M. Henry, Professor of Classics at Iowa State University, maintains that [...] "biographical anecdotes that arose in antiquity about Aspasia are wildly colorful, almost completely unverifiable, and {{still alive and}} well in the twentieth century". She finally concludes that [...] "it is possible to map only the barest possibilities for [...] life". According to Charles W. Fornara and Loren J. Samons II, Professors of Classics and history, [...] "it may well be, for <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> that the real Aspasia was more than a match for her fictional counterpart".|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Paramore, {{released}} on July 26, 2005 under the Atlantic-distributed Fueled by Ramen in the United States. The production {{was led by}} James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick Trevisick, and Roger Alan Nichols. All songs were written by vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Josh Farro. The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, which occurred {{a few days after}} arriving in Orlando, served as the album's main theme. This theme was reflected especially in the album's cover and title. Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been labeled a [...] "scene classic".|$|E
500|$|Hayley Williams was {{originally}} signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 {{as a solo}} pop singer. However, Williams resisted the label's solo-career wishes, saying she did not envision herself as [...] "the next Madonna". As a result, she formed Paramore with Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. In her short solo career, Williams recorded some demos, which were later re-recorded with the band for a [...] "more authentic" [...] sound. However, the band was almost fired because the label thought they [...] "were terrible." [...] Williams and Farro wrote two new songs, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] and [...] "Hallelujah", which saved the group from being fired. The former song became the fifth track on <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling, while [...] "Hallelujah" [...] was saved for their sophomore album Riot! (2007).|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{variously}} called <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling a pop punk, emo, or pop rock album. Trevor Kelley at Alternative Press categorized {{the music}} on the album as [...] "vaguely emo, but mostly mall-punk". Tom Whitson of Click Music defined {{the music on}} the album as emo with [...] "pop-punk beats", drawing comparisons from Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy. The Allmusic Neil Z. Yeung referred to the album as a [...] "formulaic" [...] pop punk album, complete with [...] "head-bobbing drums, straightforward riffs, and a midtempo sameness throughout". In a retrospective Alternative Press review by Tyler Sharp, the album {{was referred to as}} what would have been [...] "just another pop-rock effort that ultimately fell short in the face of its true potential" [...] if not for the band's later success. Gigwise reviewer David Renshaw also drew comparisons to Lavigne, but believed that the songs on the album were inferior to that of Lavigne's.|$|E
500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> Connotations is a masterpiece. But one thing is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well (just great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E
500|$|<b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Kelley stated [...] "it's obvious that someone has done Williams wrong" [...] from the lyrics in the album's the songs, and noted its similarity to Lavigne's previous studio album Under My Skin (2004). Tony Pascarella of The Trades said that [...] "these passionate, rocking tracks are what make this Tennessee group so talented [...] Paramore is a band you may not yet have heard of, but look {{for them to make}} a major splash in the very near future." [...] He also praised Williams' voice as [...] "a rich, powerful voice that rarely makes a mistake on this stunning debut." [...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list. In a tenth-anniversary review from Alternative Press, Tyler Sharp wrote that the album evolved into [...] "a scene classic" [...] after the band's gradual rise to mainstream popularity in later years.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{production}} {{took place}} in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards radio, the band's A recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. Initially, the album received mixed reviews by music critics, who however praised the voice of Hayley Williams. The album had a weak domestic commercial performance: it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboards Heatseekers Chart. It reached No. 4 on the UK Rock Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach No. 51 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a gold certification by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its following records, <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles from the album were released: [...] "Pressure", [...] "Emergency" [...] and [...] "All We Know". None of the singles managed to reach any major chart, although [...] "Pressure" [...] was certified gold by the RIAA in 2016 after the band found commercial success with subsequent releases.|$|E
500|$|Paramore {{released}} <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling on July 26, 2005 in the United States. According to Paramore's A at Atlantic Records, Steve Robertson, {{the promotion}} strategy behind {{the album was}} that the band would start small and slowly build through word of mouth instead of giving the debut album a major radio promotional push. In his own words, Robertson [...] "wanted kids to discover the band without it being shoved down their throats." [...] In September 2005, a special Japanese edition containing a previously unreleased song [...] "O Star" [...] was made available. In January 2009, the album was released on vinyl for the first time. On May 19, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released exclusively on iTunes with live versions of [...] "Pressure" [...] and [...] "Here We Go Again", and the music videos for all the singles. A 10th anniversary edition of the album was released on December 4, 2015 on vinyl, which contains [...] "O Star" [...] and [...] "This Circle" [...] as bonus tracks; this version was limited to 4,000 copies. The album featured three singles: [...] "Pressure", [...] "Emergency" [...] and [...] "All We Know".|$|E
500|$|Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe listed [...] "The Only Exception" [...] as the {{highlight}} of Brand New Eyes, crediting the song as being an [...] "essential". Hirsh said that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] is [...] "probably {{the best place to}} start" [...] with the album, describing Williams' vocals as [...] "forging a connection" [...] rather than [...] "simply spitting out her feelings"; he also praised the other band members for locking in at a [...] "sympathetic simmer". Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic felt that [...] "The Only Exception" [...] had similarities to [...] "The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot" [...] by Brand New. Freeman stated that on Paramore's <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling, [...] "My Heart" [...] was a [...] "blunt and obvious song" [...] that focused on a [...] "climax to be emotional", but with [...] "The Only Exception", Paramore have [...] "figured out that it doesn't have to finish loud to incite a reaction in the listener". He also noted that the song shows that Williams' lyrics have [...] "definitely improved". Jesse Catalodo of Slant felt that the lyrics to [...] "The Only Exception" [...] may be [...] "irredeemably over-the-top" [...] but its [...] "vocal melodies are the stuff of perfect pop".|$|E

2500|$|Paramore {{traveled}} back to Orlando, Florida, but {{shortly after}} arriving, Jeremy Davis left the band, citing personal reasons. The remaining {{four members of}} Paramore continued with the album, writing [...] "All We Know" [...] about his departure, and later deciding to base <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling around the concept. The album artwork also reflected Paramore's grief as Hayley Williams explains, [...] "The couch {{on the cover of}} <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> is Falling with no one there and the shadow walking away; it's all about Jeremy leaving us and us feeling like there's an empty space." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{released}} its debut album <b>All</b> <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> Is Falling in 2005, with the album reaching number eight on the UK Rock Chart and number thirty on Billboards Heatseekers Chart.
