5|$|By 1966, Reynolds {{had grown}} weary of touring and Stewart wanted {{to strike out}} on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber {{developed}} <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>exit</b> <b>strategies</b> of buyout {{funds in}} their portfolio companies following Initial Public Offerings. We use a data set of 222 buyout-backed IPOs in the United States between 1999 and 2008 including hand-collected data about each exit process {{to draw up}} a detailed road map of buyout investors’ divestment processes. Using this data, we document timing and aggressiveness of the <b>exit</b> <b>strategies,</b> and analyze to which degree a multitude of possible determinants influence the choice for <b>a</b> given <b>exit</b> <b>strategy.</b> Our results show that buyout funds stay invested in their portfolio companies for a substantial period of time after the IPO, and that the choice for <b>a</b> given <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> depends not only on characteristics of each respective portfolio company, but also on the financial success of the deal {{from the perspective of the}} buyout investor...|$|R

2500|$|His time in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{led him to}} {{conclude}} that the Dayton Agreements would only be fully implemented if and when Bosnia and Herzegovina would be able to surmount what he identified as “double dependency syndrome” : the international organisations present in Bosnia had come to be dependent on SFOR as much as the Bosnian people had come to be dependent on the international community and its support. He had the opportunity to develop this concept at an OSCE Seminar held in Sofia, Bulgaria, on “Cooperation among International Organisations and Institutions: Experience and Prospects in South-Eastern Europe” in May 17, 1999: “Mr. Luis Sampaio, Political Advisor with NATO/SFOR, noted that civilian and military implementation showed a fundamental difference of pace. [...] SFOR is the best example of the new NATO. [...] Any SFOR success or failure will affect NATO, and the longer SFOR stays in Bosnia the greater the perception of failure. [...] We need <b>an</b> <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> for SFOR and agreement on what conditions would allow its departure.

Although no single <b>exit</b> <b>strategy</b> can be applied universally since each should be responsive to local conditions, there are core elements that should be included.
