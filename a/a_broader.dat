5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians to refer to <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is {{not considered to be}} part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

5|$|Like other Hawaiian honeycreepers, the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor.

5|$|One {{approach}} to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize self-sufficiency particularly in food production. These principles, on <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> scale, underpin {{the concept of}} a bioregional economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology.|$|E
5|$|The C center {{produces}} a characteristic {{infrared absorption spectrum}} with a sharp peak at 1344 cm−1 and <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> feature at 1130 cm−1.

5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles.

As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
