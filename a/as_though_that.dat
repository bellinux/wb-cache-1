500|$|Falle {{convinced}} five of {{her friends}} who came from dysfunctional homes to join her in prostitution. Falle said that she and the other girls she knew her age who had gone into prostitution had felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>that</b> was their only remaining option. She said they all tried to stay free of pimps, organized crime, and drugs, but eventually succumbed. Falle later said, [...] "We were prey for every paedophile, pervert, pimp and drug dealer that was out there." [...] The man who had recruited Falle in Chinatown became her pimp. Adults began advertising Falle's sexual services in newspapers. Falle engaged in both indoor and outdoor prostitution, working as an escort, in strip clubs, and at massage parlours. At the legal establishments where she engaged in prostitution, escort drivers engaged in organized crime, selling guns, alcohol, cocaine, and stolen goods and pimping children in massage parlours.|$|E

2500|$|Pliny then {{details the}} {{practices}} of Christians (sections 7-10): he says that they meet on a certain day before light where they gather and sing hymns to Christ as to a god. They all bind themselves by oath, [...] "not to some crimes", says Pliny, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>that</b> is {{what he would have}} expected; rather, they pledge not to commit any crimes such as fraud, theft, or adultery, and subsequently share a meal of [...] "ordinary and innocent food". Pliny says, however, that all of these practices were abandoned by the Christians after Pliny forbade any political associations (hetaeriai or “fraternities”). These clubs were banned because Trajan saw them as a “natural breeding ground for grumbling” about both civic life and political affairs. One such instance of a banned club was a firemen’s association; likewise, Christianity was seen as a political association that could be potentially harmful to the empire. However the Christians seem to have willingly complied with the edict and halted their practices.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the words, [...] "And {{they shall}} make an Ark," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Shalom taught that God {{said that all}} should come and occupy {{themselves}} with the Ark so that they all might merit the Torah. Rabbi Simeon taught {{that there are three}} crowns – the crown of Torah, the crown of priesthood, and the crown of royalty; but the crown of a good name surpasses them all. The table is the crown of kingship, of which [...] says, [...] "And make thereto a crown of gold round about." [...] The altar is the crown of priesthood, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make unto it a crown of gold round about." [...] And the Ark is the crown of the Torah, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make upon it a crown of gold round about." [...] The word for [...] "crown" [...] (zer, [...] ) can also be read as zar (stranger), to teach that if a person has merit, it becomes like a crown, but if a person does not have merit, then it becomes alien to that person. Of the other furnishings, Scripture says, [...] "And you shall make," [...] whereas of the Ark, [...] says, [...] "And they shall make," [...] to teach that the crown of the Torah stands above all; when a person acquires the Torah, it is <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>that</b> person has acquired all the rest.|$|E
