5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'. Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> 'British' by sharing in the war effort.|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

25|$|In many cultures, {{inability}} to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, {{a degree of}} rejection (or <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment.

25|$|The {{quality of}} sleep may be {{evaluated}} from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to {{how difficult it}} is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.|$|E

[...] Erhard's foreword notes: [...] "although this book dramatizes the highlights of the training and attempts to give you the vicarious experience of being at a training, this is a book, and the est experience cannot result from reading any book".|$|E
500|$|Since then, Anole's sexual {{orientation}} has been handled more openly, being directly {{referred to as}} [...] "gay." [...] When discussing further story development of Anole's sexuality during their run on New X-Men, Yost and Kyle stated {{that they had no}} plans to further cover the issue, emphasizing that Anole would be able to work out any issues he had regarding his sexuality or his lack of reconciliation with his former mentor Northstar by covering them off-panel with teammate Rockslide. [...] Anole would later confront a rehabilitated Northstar in the X-Men: Divided We Stand vignette [...] "Blend In," [...] revealing that contrary to Jean-Paul's assumptions, he experienced no difficulties being accepted as a mutant or gay from his family or residents of his hometown, and instead experienced posttraumatic stress disorder and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> used and abandoned after his time with the X-Men.|$|E

500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But {{a sense of loss}} you feel {{but at the same time}} you don't know what it is you have lost, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter than everybody else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality." [...] A soundtrack album for the first season was released on iTunes on December 11, 2015, and the single [...] "Whatcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)" [...] from the second season was released on March 18, 2016.|$|E
500|$|In revisiting {{the film}} in the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films {{generally}} age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, {{but in the case}} of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly. Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what you can remember of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present. Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being [...] "badly written", in turn describing the dialogue as [...] "flowery" [...] and possessing a [...] "picture postcard" [...] sensibility. Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes [...] "never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> [...] "created" [...] or [...] "directed", but rather having emerged [...] "steaming from the crowded kitchen", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.|$|E
50|$|Most {{recorded}} English uses of {{the word}} generous up to and during the sixteenth century reflect <b>an</b> aristocratic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>of</b> noble lineage or high birth. To be generous was literally a way of complying with nobility.|$|R

2500|$|... "Only {{the true}} self can be {{creative}} {{and only the}} true self can feel real."

2500|$|Another form of {{spontaneous}} OBE is the near-death experience (NDE). Some subjects report having had an OBE {{at times of}} severe physical trauma such as near-drownings or major surgery. Near-death experiences may include subjective impressions of being outside the physical body, sometimes visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of ego and spatiotemporal boundaries. Typically the experience includes such factors as: <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> dead; a feeling of peace and painlessness; hearing of various non-physical sounds, an out-of-body experience; a tunnel experience (the sense of moving up or through a narrow passageway); encountering [...] "beings of light" [...] and a God-like figure or similar entities; being given a [...] "life review", and a reluctance to return to life.|$|E
2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} {{as much as}} he did. He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I told myself that, being much less expensive, I would have a go myself." [...] He also said that the best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it".|$|E
