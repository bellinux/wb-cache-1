25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse is a feat of {{imagination}} scarcely ever recorded. It's breathtaking. Somehow, a bold assurance of intention {{has met with}} <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> experimenting with sound to expand an already formidable group of songs into pure, open-minded ambiguity. The flesh of the song will balloon out or contort into unimaginable patterns; indecipherable echoes volley between {{the walls of the}} recording; glassy, splintered tones pierce the luxuriant sheen of the mix. Repeated listens trick the sense of balance; tremendous risks are taken.|$|E

The review in The Times {{said it was}} [...] "an eminently readable account...written with an incredible lightness of touch that belies the very serious issues." [...] In the Montreal Gazette, Bryan Demchinsky called Wright eloquent and the book [...] "a brief, trenchant essay." [...] Diane Barlee in Skeptic magazine, said Wright is a [...] "remarkably gifted wordsmith whose talent makes turgid facts not only digestible, but also generates <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> more" [...] and commented [...] "A Short History of Progress is an important, well-crafted book, however, I can't promise that it will change your life." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{his first}} few appearances, it was {{reported}} that Criss had been confirmed as a series regular for the remainder of season two and for season three of Glee. This was based on comments by Murphy, who said: [...] "Darren has become such a sensation in one week, which I love. I think there's <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> him and a positive relationship role model. He’ll definitely continue through the year and longer." [...] However, the actor later denied that his role had been upgraded and said: [...] "It's never really been officially confirmed to me. I think the option is there and that they want to keep Blaine around." [...] Murphy revealed that Blaine may join New Directions during the third season. Criss hoped that this would not come to pass, as he enjoys being at Dalton Academy, but conceded: [...] "it's not my call. I'm happy to serve whatever story they want." [...] For the third season of Glee, Criss was promoted to a series regular, and Blaine did join New Directions when he transferred to McKinley High to be with Kurt.|$|E
500|$|While {{arranging}} {{dates for}} the band's world tour, Epstein {{agreed to a}} proposal by journalist Maureen Cleave for the Beatles to be interviewed separately {{for a series of}} articles that would run in London's Evening Standard newspaper in March 1966. Cleave's observations reflected the band members' more sophisticated personalities beyond the simplistic portrayals that were commonplace at the time. Of the two principal songwriters, she found Lennon to be intuitive, lazy and dissatisfied with fame and his surroundings in the Surrey countryside, while McCartney conveyed confidence and <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> knowledge and new creative possibilities. In his book Revolver: How the Beatles Reimagined Rock 'n' Roll, Robert Rodriguez writes that, whereas Lennon had been the Beatles' dominant creative force before Revolver, McCartney now attained an approximately equal position with him. In a further development, Harrison's interest in the music and culture of India, and his study of the Indian sitar, had inspired him as a composer. According to author Ian Inglis, Revolver is widely viewed as [...] "the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter".|$|E
500|$|In StarCraft II, Kerrigan {{launches}} {{an attack}} on the Terran Dominion colonies. At first, her motives seem to be revenge - however, later it is discovered that she is pursuing various pieces of a Xel'naga artifact of great power. Coincidentally, these are the same artifacts that Jim Raynor is pursuing at the request of his recently freed friend Tychus Findlay and his benefactor, the Moebius Foundation. Raynor's forces and Kerrigan constantly bump heads throughout this pursuit, with Kerrigan displaying her now trademark character traits of arrogance and <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> power. Raynor soon learns from Valerian Mengsk, son of Arcturus Mengsk and the real face behind the Moebius Foundation, that the Xel'naga artifacts he has been pursuing, when pieced together, have the power to return Kerrigan to her human form. [...] At one point, Zeratul suddenly appears on board Raynor's ship and hands to him a crystal containing memories from his recent ventures. The memories on the crystal chronicle Zeratul's campaign to discover the truth behind an ancient Xel'naga prophecy, a quest which leads him to run into Kerrigan many times in the process. It is through these memories that Raynor learns just {{how important it is to}} ensure that Kerrigan does not perish, for she is the chosen person to help win the coming battle against the Protoss-Zerg hybrids. Through Zeratul's crystal, Raynor is also granted the vision of a possible future, one without Kerrigan, where the Protoss are rendered extinct shortly after the Terrans are annihilated. After seeing this vision, Raynor mounts an invasion on Char in collaboration with Dominion forces to eliminate the Zerg forces on the planet. The Xel'naga artifact releases an energy blast that wipes the Zerg infection clean off the planet. When Raynor and Findlay seek Kerrigan in the ruins, she is found to have mostly returned to her human form, with only her hair remaining Zerg-like. However, Raynor is forced to kill Findlay when he attempts to assassinate Kerrigan, under orders from his [...] "benefactor", who is revealed to be Arcturus Mengsk. Raynor then carries the weakened Kerrigan over the ruined battlefield to safety.|$|E

2500|$|At sixteen Clairmont was a lively, voluptuous brunette {{with a good}} {{singing voice}} and <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> recognition. Her home life had become {{increasingly}} tense as her stepfather William Godwin sank deeper into debt and her mother's relations with Godwin's daughter Mary became more strained. Clairmont aided her stepsister's clandestine meetings with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had professed a belief in free love and soon left his own wife and two small children to be with Mary. When Mary ran away with Shelley in July 1814, Clairmont went with them. Clairmont's mother traced the group to an inn in Calais but couldn't make Clairmont go home with her. Godwin needed the financial assistance that the aristocratic Shelley could provide.|$|E

60|$|Less for her {{own sake}} than for mine, Mrs Monnerie and I scoured London for amusement, {{even though she was}} irritated a little by my {{preference}} for the kind which may be called instructive.

60|$|I {{think that}} any one who will {{carefully}} examine the By-laws (I have placed all of the important ones before the reader), will arrive at the conclusion that of late years the master-passion in Mrs. Eddy's heart is <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> power and glory; and that while her hunger for money still remains, she wants it now for the expansion and extension it can furnish to that power and glory, rather than {{what it can do}} for her towards satisfying minor and meaner ambitions.|$|E

[...] Once more in my black, with two thicknesses of veil canopying my head, as if I were a joint of meat in the Dog Days, I settled myself on Pollie's arm, and--in the full publicity of three o'clock in the afternoon--off we went.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not always}} want, insanity, or sin that drives women to desperate deaths; often it is a dreadful {{loneliness}} of heart, <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> home and friends, worse than starvation, a bitter sense of wrong in being denied the tender ties, the pleasant duties, the sweet rewards that can make the humblest life happy; a rebellious protest against God, who, when they cry for bread, seems to offer them a stone. Some of these impatient souls throw life away, and learn too late how rich {{it might have been}} with a stronger faith, a more submissive spirit. Others are kept, and slowly taught to stand and wait, till blest with a happiness the sweeter for the doubt that went before.|$|E

60|$|Of equal power? For {{the present}} only. When Leo XIII. passes to his rest another Infallible will ascend his throne; others, and yet others, {{and still others}} will follow him, and be as infallible as he, and decide {{questions}} of doctrine {{as long as they}} may come up, all down the far future; but Mary Baker G. Eddy is the only Infallible that will ever occupy the Science throne. Many a Science Pope will succeed her, but she has closed their mouths; they will repeat and reverently praise and adore her infallibilities, but venture none themselves. In her grave she will still outrank all other Popes, be they of what Church they may. She will hold the supremest of earthly titles, The Infallible--with a capital T. Many in the world's history have had <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> such nuggets and slices of power as they might reasonably hope to grab out of an empire's or a religion's assets, but Mrs. Eddy is the only person alive or dead who has ever struck for the whole of them. For small things she has the eye of a microscope, for large ones the eye of a telescope, and whatever she sees, she wants. Wants it all.|$|E
60|$|A {{marvelous}} woman; with <b>a</b> <b>hunger</b> <b>for</b> power such as {{has never}} {{been seen in the}} world before. No thing, little or big, that contains any seed or suggestion of power escapes her avaricious eye; and when once she gets that eye on it, her remorseless grip follows. There isn't a Christian Scientist who isn't ecclesiastically as much her property as if she had bought him and paid for him, and copyrighted him and got a charter. She cannot be satisfied when she has handcuffed a member, and put a leg-chain and ball on him and plugged his ears and removed his thinker, she goes on wrapping needless chains round and round him, just as a spider would. For she trusts no one, believes in no one's honesty, judges every one by herself. Although we have seen that she has absolute and irresponsible command over her spectral Boards and over every official and servant of her Church, at home and abroad, over every minute detail of her Church's government, present and future, and can purge her membership of guilty or suspected persons by various plausible formalities and whenever she will, she is still not content, but must set her queer mind to work and invent a way by which she can take a member--any member--by neck and crop and fling him out without anything resembling a formality at all.|$|E
