5|$|Manhattan {{press agent}} Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) {{has been unable}} to gain {{mentions}} for his clients in J.J. Hunsecker's (Burt Lancaster) influential, nationally syndicated newspaper column of late because of Falco's failure to make good on <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> break up the romance between Hunsecker's younger sister Susan (Susan Harrison) and musician Steve Dallas (Martin Milner), an up-and-coming jazz guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy. This {{can be done by}} printing money and injecting it into the domestic economy via open market operations. There may be <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation.|$|E
50|$|A {{unilateral}} contract can be contrasted with a bilateral contract, {{where there is}} <b>an</b> exchange of <b>promises</b> between two parties. For example, when (<b>A)</b> <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> sell her car and (B) <b>promises</b> <b>to</b> buy the car.|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> Mother Earth, Narakasura {{was allowed}} to enjoy a long reign. At last Vishnu was born as Krishna. Aditi, who was a {{relative}} of Krishna's wife Satyabhama (believed to be an Avatar of Bhudevi - Narakasura' mother), approached Satyabhama for help. When Satyabhama heard of the Narakasura's ill treatment of women and his behaviour with Aditi, she was enraged. Satyabhama approached Lord Krishna for permission to wage a war against Narakasura. <b>As</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> the Devas and Aditi, Krishna attacked the great fortress of Narakasura, riding his mount Garuda with wife Satyabhama.Lord Krishna used the Narayanastra and the Agneyastra against the army of Narakasura.The battle was furiously fought. Narakasura possessed 11 Akshauhinis that he unleashed on Lord Krishna. However, the Lord slew them all with little effort. Lord Krishna also killed Mura, Narakasura's general. Thus Krishna is called 'Murāri' (the killer of Mura).|$|R
50|$|Moore notes a {{reversal}} of gender roles in Starbuck's <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> return for Anders. In his view it is more traditional in stories for <b>a</b> man <b>to</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> rescue <b>a</b> woman.|$|R
5|$|The missile {{strikes on}} al-Qaeda's Afghan {{training}} camps, aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden, damaged the installations and inflicted an uncertain number of casualties; however, bin Laden {{was not present}} at the time. Following the attacks, the ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over bin Laden, and the regime instead strengthened its ties with the al-Qaeda chief.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a {{transfer}} student from England, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable {{to use the}} Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.|$|E
5|$|Although {{membership}} in the Klan was limited to men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E

5|$|An {{account of}} the war by the Byzantine Theophylact Simocatta sentimentalises the reasons behind the conflict, {{claiming}} it originated with Alboin's vain courting and subsequent kidnapping of Cunimund's daughter Rosamund, that Alboin proceeded then to marry. The tale is treated with scepticism by Walter Goffart, who observes that it conflicts with the Origo Gentis Langobardorum, where she was captured only {{after the death of}} her father. The Gepids obtained the support of the Emperor in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> cede him the region of Sirmium, the seat of the Gepid kings. Thus in 565 or 566 Justinian's successor Justin II sent his son-in-law Baduarius as magister militum (field commander) to lead a Byzantine army against Alboin in support of Cunimund, ending in the Lombards' complete defeat.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Thai government’s {{department}} of irrigation met {{the demands of}} Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with cautious optimism. To circumvent the issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced {{plans to build a}} series of dams on Burma's Salween River along its border with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son Province.|$|E

5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving was his way of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> liquidate his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result of economic and political pressure from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as the legitimate ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and his young son, Abu Bakar.|$|E
5|$|Since Louis had fathered no sons, the {{expectation}} that he would bequeath Hungary, Poland, and his claims to the Kingdom of Naples and Provence to his daughters made them desirable spouses {{for members of the}} European royal families. Before Mary's first birthday, her father made <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, that Mary would marry the emperor's second son, Sigismund of Luxembourg. Louis confirmed his promise in a deed in June 1373. Mary and Sigismund were closely related, because her paternal grandmother, Elizabeth of Poland, was the sister of his great-grandfather, Casimir III of Poland. Pope Gregory XI issued the dispensation necessary for their marriage on 6December 1374. The leading Hungarian and Polish lords confirmed Louis's promise of Mary's and Sigismund's marriage on 14April 1375.|$|E

5|$|The Labour party {{conference in}} Manchester on 21–24 September {{occurred}} {{days after the}} Scottish referendum result. Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections on the deficit and immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
5|$|With {{the third}} edition of Erasmus's Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included. An often {{repeated}} {{story is that}} Erasmus included it, because he felt bound by <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> include it if a manuscript was found that contained it. When a single 16th-century Greek manuscript subsequently had been found to contain it (Codex Montfortianus), Erasmus included it, though he expressed doubt as to {{the authenticity of the}} passage in his Annotations. Henk Jan de Jonge, a specialist in Erasmian studies, stated that there is no explicit evidence that supports this frequently made assertion concerning a specific promise made by Erasmus. The real reason to include the Comma by Erasmus, was his care for his good name and for the success of his Novum Testamentum.|$|E
5|$|A {{bipartisan}} {{group of}} MPs formed a Conciliation Committee in early 1910 and proposed a Conciliation Bill {{that would have}} brought the vote to a million women, {{so long as they}} owned property. While the bill was being discussed, the WSPU put in a temporary truce on activity. The bill failed that November when Asquith's Liberal government reneged on <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> allow parliamentary time to debate the bill. A WSPU delegation of around 300 women tried to present him with a petition, but were prevented from doing so by an aggressive police response; the suffragettes, who called the day Black Friday, complained of assault, much of which was sexual in nature. Davison was not one of the 122 people arrested, but was incensed by the treatment of the delegation; the following day she broke several windows in the Crown Office in parliament. She was arrested and sentenced to a month in prison. She went on hunger strike again and was force-fed for eight days before being released.|$|E

5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1457, a large Ottoman {{army was}} seen {{approaching}} Albania. Skanderbeg {{sent a letter to}} Calixtus informing him of the Ottoman arrival and the dire need for military aid. The pope responded with <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> send a fleet to Albania – even though the enemy was on land – but it did not arrive. Skanderbeg was thus left to fight the oncoming Ottoman army alone. Mehmed II had placed Isak Bey Evrenoz and Hamza Kastrioti in command of the force. Isak bey was an experienced commander who had crushed John Kastrioti's rebellion in 1430 and led the Ottoman counterattack at the Siege of Berat. Hamza brought along with him several disaffected Albanian nobles and personal knowledge of the tactics they could expect from Skanderbeg. In total, Ottoman forces numbered between 50,000 and 80,000 men. Armies of this size were usually commanded by the sultan himself so rumors spread that Mehmed was leading the campaign. In contrast, Skanderbeg had between 8,000 and 10,000 men to stand in opposition.|$|E

The film had a limited release, and was critically and commercially unsuccessful. She then starred in the comedy film So Undercover, appearing as an FBI agent who is required to go undercover at a college sorority. It was also reported on August 2, 2011, by Contact Music that Cyrus had signed on to star in an untitled comedy in which she plays a woman who breaks <b>a</b> <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> God. It was later announced that Cyrus would star in the film Family Bond, portraying a girl who tracks down her estranged spy father in an attempt to save her kidnapped mother.|$|E
