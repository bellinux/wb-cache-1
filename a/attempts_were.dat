5000|$|Sandqivst's second <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> disqualified {{since his}} cube was broken {{twice in the}} same <b>attempt.</b> This <b>was</b> a {{violation}} of the competition rules and the <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> stopped at that point.|$|R
5000|$|Sandford's father {{stated that}} the {{assassination}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> entirely {{out of character for}} his son and suggested that Sandford had been [...] "put up to do it or blackmailed," [...] or that the <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "cry for help". His mother also suggested that the <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> a bid for help. His grandmother suggested Sandford <b>was</b> <b>attempting</b> suicide by cop.|$|R
5|$|He was hated by his persecuted {{enemies and}} even {{by some of}} his own countrymen. Although <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to assassinate him, none were successful. Hitler had {{numerous}} bodyguard units over the years which provided security.|$|E
5|$|Lewis also {{revealed}} that Beane repeatedly tried to trade for Youkilis before Youkilis reached the major leagues, but his <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> blocked by then-Red Sox GM Theo Epstein.|$|E
5|$|Multiple escape <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made {{throughout}} the history of the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E
50|$|In 1499 another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to restore}} Siberian dynasty to Kazan throne. Uraq {{attempted}} to establish Agalaq as Kazan khan. The <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> repelled.|$|R
60|$|One more <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made by Rotherby to interfere, {{but this}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> {{disposed}} of by Wharton, who had constituted himself entirely {{master of the}} proceedings.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{position}} of the ball for <b>attempts</b> <b>is</b> different in the two games. Point-after-touchdown <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> snapped from the following points (as of the 2015 season):.|$|R
5|$|There {{were rumors}} of plots {{and even of}} his escape, but in reality no serious <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made. For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome of the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.|$|E
5|$|A Maralinga cleanup {{operation}} codenamed Operation Brumby {{was conducted}} in 1967. <b>Attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to dilute the concentration of radioactive material by turning over and mixing the surface soil.

5|$|About 900years ago, <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to {{introduce}} eastern blood into the Icelandic, {{resulting in a}} degeneration of the stock. In 982AD the Icelandic Althing (parliament) passed laws prohibiting the importation of horses into Iceland, thus ending crossbreeding. The breed has now been bred pure in Iceland for more than 1,000years.|$|E
50|$|Each penal {{provision}} in the Norwegian criminal code specifies if it is criminal to aid and abet. Further, when the <b>attempt</b> <b>is</b> criminal, participating in that <b>attempt</b> <b>is</b> criminal.|$|R
5000|$|Failed <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "false starts" [...] if, for example, {{not even}} a {{complete}} chorus or verse is recorded; longer almost-complete <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "long false starts." ...|$|R

The second failed <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> in 1561, when 8,000 Ottomans {{under the command of}} Malkoč-beg attacked the castle. The third <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> in 1574, when Ferhat-paša Sokolović tried to capture the castle by treachery. Another attempt in 1576 by Kapidži-paša also failed.|$|R
5|$|Another {{month of}} {{discussion}} and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made {{to alter the}} Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money. Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back {{in the direction of}} his Virginia plan.|$|E
5|$|By 1906, erosion {{had become}} {{apparent}} {{at the base}} of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.|$|E
5|$|Dodington was {{the site}} of the Buckingham Mine where copper was extracted. The mine was {{established}} before 1725 and followed earlier exploration at Perry Hill, East Quantoxhead.

50|$|An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made {{to map the}} Audenried Tunnel in 1971. However, the <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> aborted after 1300 ft due to the {{presence}} of debris that was impassible. Plans were made in 1974 to plug the tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|A 2005 review {{observed}} that suicide <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> increased {{in those who}} use SSRIs as compared to placebo and compared to therapeutic interventions other than tricyclic antidepressants.

5000|$|Note: From 2004 through 2009, {{only one}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> {{permitted}} in Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series racing. Starting from 2010 through 2015, {{a maximum of}} three <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> permitted. But from 2016 to present, NASCAR allows the use of NASCAR Overtime.|$|R
5|$|For centuries {{there has}} been a general market held each Friday in the Market Place. The market has been in decline for some years and in 2010 <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to {{revitalise}} it. However, after initial interest, the number of stallholders slowly decreased. In recent months a number of suitcase traders have been supporting the market on a regular basis and this has attracted local interest.|$|E
5|$|Fossett tried {{six times}} {{over seven years}} for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 {{million of his own}} money; his sixth and {{successful}} attempt was commercially sponsored. Two of the <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri. Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, rushing <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made {{by running}} backs Da'Rel Scott (14for 174yards), Morgan Green (10 for 72yards), and Davin Meggett (10 for 35yards).

5|$|Other federal {{government}} agencies also worked to undermine organizations, {{such as the}} CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke their tax exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> made to deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.|$|E
5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> {{made by the}} local council to demolish Jaywick, but there was resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were unhappy about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Prior to selection, the Maralinga {{site was}} {{inhabited}} by the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara Aboriginal people, {{for whom it}} had a great spiritual significance.

50|$|A further <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> made on {{his life}} in November with the Bandbox Plot, in which a hat-box, armed with loaded pistols to be {{triggered}} by a thread within the package was sent to him; the assassination <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> forestalled by the prompt intervention of Jonathan Swift.|$|R
