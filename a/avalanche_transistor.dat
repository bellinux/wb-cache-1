The performance of various instruments is compared and the principles of operation of different automatic systems are discussed.

40|$|A transistorized, neutron {{time-of-flight}} spectrometer {{has been}} designed and built for measurement of the energy of neutrons generated {{with the aid of}} the McGill cyclotron. Circuitry of the type used in fast coincidence measurements has been used, with <b>avalanche</b> <b>transistors</b> as fast discriminators and limiters. The intrinsic electronic resolution is considerably better than one nanosecond. The spectrometer was used to examine the radio frequency structure of proton pulses generated by the cyclotron. This was found to vary greatly with operating conditions and to depend greatly on the stability of the radio frequency oscillator. The short-term width at half height was 4 nanoseconds when the accelerating voltage applied to the dees was 7 kV, and the mean value of this quantity for long runs was 5 - 7 nanoseconds. With a flight path of 25 feet, the energies of neutrons or protons between 30 and 80 MeV can thus be measured. The total cross sections for neutrons of calcium, potassium and copper were measured in the range 30 to 100 MeV and found to confirm existing measurements except in the case of calcium.

40|$|Short over-all time delay, {{low time}} jitter, and {{excellent}} long-term reliability {{are among the}} desirable features designed into a pulse generator that produces a 2 -MW output pulse 30 nsec after {{the application of a}} 1 -V signal at its 50 -ohm input connector. The 10 -kV output pulse can be used to trigger simultaneously several spark gaps of the type used in spark-chamber pulse modulators. The 10 {sup 8 } power gain of the spark-gap-trigger amplifier is achieved by four stages of amplification packaged in a 5 - 1 / 4 inch rack-mount chassis that operates directly from a 117 -V line. The individual stages, each selected to give minimum time delay for a given power gain at their respective power levels are: <b>avalanche</b> <b>transistors,</b> planar triode, grounded-grid planar triode, and a triggered-spark gap. The techniques used for the last stage, a spark gap triggered by a corona light, are of particular interest since the same techniques are applicable to obtaining short time delays and long-term reliability from the larger spark gaps that the amplifier was designed to trigger. During 10 months of operation, there have been no failures and no adjustments necessary in any of the seven spark-gap trigger amplifiers used in various spark-chamber experiments at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California (UCLRL) in Berkeley...|$|R
40|$|A {{qualitative}} model {{describing the}} "anomalous" {{features of the}} conductivity of polymer nanocomposites, in particular, switching to the conducting state in relatively thick (tens of microns or more) of flexible PVC films is considered. In previously published experimental results, change of conductivity by 10 or more orders of magnitude occurred both {{in the absence of}} external influences (spontaneously), and under the influence of an applied electric field, as well as other initiating factors (such as uniaxial pressure). In a model of hopping conduction mechanism it is shown, that switching in the conduction states under the action of external field significantly (by orders of magnitude) below threshold can be associated with a high-resistance state instability that results from the sequence of "shorting" (reversible soft breakdown) of narrow insulating gaps between regions with relatively high conductivity. Increasing the field strength in the remaining insulating gaps ultimately leads to the formation of a conducting channel between the external electrodes and switching conductivity of the composite film sample in a state of high conductivity. This cascade model is essentially based on the transition from the usual description of the charge tunneling through single independent insulating gap to take into account correlations between adjacent gaps. In the frame of developed model other "anomalies" such as exponential dependence of the resistance on the sample thickness, pressure, and other influences can be qualitative explained. An analogy of the model with a cascading breakdown of <b>avalanche</b> <b>transistors</b> is also considered. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
