5|$|Coming off {{his fourth}} championship, the 34-year-old Niedermayer {{contemplated}} retirement. Remaining undecided on his future as the 2007–08 season began, {{he failed to}} report to the team and was suspended by the Ducks as <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b> Pronger replaced him as captain, and Niedermayer remained undecided until early December when he finally chose to return. He appeared in only 48 games that season, scoring 25 points, but played in his fourth All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to become law a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor is similar to the Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal assent. In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of royal assent is usually <b>a</b> <b>formality,</b> whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>formality,</b> {{a person}} must state a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense. The police will issue the permit {{in up to}} 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue if the applicant has a valid gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is valid for 12 months.|$|E
5|$|Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had {{his first}} success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have {{influenced}} his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but Reginald Spooner was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, J.W.H.T.Douglas became captain. Fender {{was included in the}} team, and the press regarded his selection as <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 435 {{members of}} the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by {{majority}} rule {{at the beginning of}} each session of the United States Congress, who serves until the end of the Congress. Typically, the election is <b>a</b> <b>formality,</b> as the majority party's members vote as a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority leader, or minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.|$|E

5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe and in the Middle East. Their power finally reached a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} <b>a</b> <b>formality</b> until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Bouncing back, Buffalo {{won their}} next five games. Against Army, Buffalo {{reversed}} {{the result of}} the Western Michigan game, coming back from a two-touchdown deficit to win in overtime. Handling conference opponents Ohio and Miami (Ohio) with relative ease, Buffalo continued conference play by beating Akron in a four-hour, four-overtime slugfest, 43–40, in Akron's final football game at the Rubber Bowl. In their next game, against Bowling Green, the Bulls found themselves down 21–0 midway through the third quarter, but still managed to come back for their third overtime win of the season. With the win, Buffalo clinched the MAC East championship and ensured that they would have their first winning regular season since moving to Division I-A; the final regular season game, a 24–21 loss to Kent State, was only <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b> The Bulls finished the regular season with an overall record of 7–5, 5–3 within the conference.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor {{maintains}} a voting custom that dates {{to at least}} around 1905. In addition to its customary general election, held at the same day in every municipality in New York, the village has a nonpartisan caucus, a town meeting-style forum to determine officeholders. The system of the People's Caucus is largely unique to the village, and {{has been described as}} an extension of the New England town hall concept. The People's Caucus, officially formed in 1946, chooses candidates by majority vote two months before the village election, where the candidates usually run unopposed, turning the election into <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b> The caucus is open to citizens of 18 years or over who have lived in the village for at least a month; voter registration is not required. Voters and candidates do not declare party affiliations, instead candidates present their platforms in early January of each year, and weeks later the caucus meets again to vote.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, {{more recent}} {{theories}} now hold that, if the Egyptian kingdom was divided, the division happened peacefully. Egyptologists such as Michael Rice, Francesco Tiradritti and Wolfgang Helck {{point to the}} once palatial and well preserved mastaba tombs at Sakkara and Abydos belonging to high officials such as Ruaben and Nefer-Setekh. These are all dated from the reign of Nynetjer to that of Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty. Egyptologists consider the archaeological record of the mastabas' condition and the original architecture as proof that the statewide mortuary cults for kings and noblemen successfully {{took place during the}} entire dynasty. If true, their preservation is inconsistent with the theory of civil wars and economic problems during Peribsen's reign. Rice, Tiradritti and Helck think that Nynetjer decided to leave a divided realm because of private or political reasons and that the split was <b>a</b> <b>formality</b> sustained by Second Dynasty kings.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí {{received}} a council of war trial, with {{no possibility of}} a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was <b>a</b> <b>formality.</b> José Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried—an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofresí was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought {{that the reason for}} the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofresí trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established.|$|E
