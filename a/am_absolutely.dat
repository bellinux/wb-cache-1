[...] The Mondale campaign {{hoped that}} her selection would change a campaign {{in which he was}} well behind; in addition to attracting women, they hoped she could attract ethnic Democrats in the Northeast U.S. who had abandoned their party for Reagan in 1980. Her personality, variously described as blunt, feisty, spirited, and somewhat saucy, was also viewed as an asset. [...] In turn, Mondale accepted the risk that came with her inexperience.|$|E

[...] She also praised Owen's proposal scene, giving it an [...] "A". Later, she praised their marriage, saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>absolutely</b> loving the stronger-than-ever lady-bond between these two this season. Is it because they're both married now?

Having served in Iraq, he returned to the UK to take up a staff post in April 2009 as chief of staff to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but the appointment was short-lived as, in October 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan at short notice to establish a force reintegration unit, {{part of an effort to}} persuade Taliban fighters to rejoin society by offering alternatives to fighting, such as jobs and training—a role for which he was hand-picked by U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal, then commander of all troops in Afghanistan. Barrons defended the controversial scheme in interviews, saying that it was not [...] "about buying insurgents off the battlefield" [...] and that [...] "the idea is that you get the whole community benefiting and turning against the insurgency".
