30|$|Predicting human {{mobility}} flows {{at different}} spatial scales is {{challenged by the}} heterogeneity of individual trajectories and the multi-scale nature <b>of</b> transportation networks. <b>As</b> <b>vast</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> digital traces of human behaviour become available, an opportunity arises to improve mobility models by integrating into them proxy data on mobility collected {{by a variety of}} digital platforms and location-aware services. Here we propose a hybrid model of human mobility that integrates a large-scale publicly available dataset from a popular photo-sharing system with the classical gravity model, under a stacked regression procedure. We validate the performance and generalizability of our approach using two ground-truth datasets on air travel and daily commuting in the United States: using two different cross-validation schemes we show that the hybrid model affords enhanced mobility prediction at both spatial scales.|$|R

40|$|Experts' {{remarkable}} {{ability to}} recall meaningful domain-specific material {{is a classic}} result in cognitive psychology. Influential explanations for this ability {{have focused on the}} acquisition of high-level structures (e. g., schemata) or experts' capability to process information holistically. However, research on chess players suggests that experts maintain some reliable memory advantage over novices when random stimuli (e. g., shuffled chess positions) are presented. This skill effect cannot be explained by theories emphasizing high-level memory structures or holistic processing of stimuli, because random material does not contain large structures nor wholes. By contrast, theories hypothesizing the presence of small memory structures-such as chunks-predict this outcome, because some chunks still occur by chance in the stimuli, even after randomization. The current meta-analysis assessed the correlation between level of expertise and recall of random material in diverse domains. The overall correlation was moderate but statistically significant ([Formula: see text]), and the effect was observed in nearly every study. This outcome suggests that experts partly base their superiority on <b>a</b> <b>vaster</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> small memory structures, in addition to high-level structures or holistic processing...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that in the past small firms have initiated <b>a</b> <b>vaster</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> disruptive innovations than their large counterparts. Scholars have attributed this predominance of SMEs to their organizational simplicity, fostering the entrepreneurial impulsiveness in which radical innovations are often rooted. Accordingly, monitoring the SME share in innovative activities has been high on policymakers' agendas. Since a few decades, patent statistics have been an important indicator of innovation. However, measuring the contribution of SMEs is challenging given the lack of business information in patent documents and the thus required linkage to external financial and ownership information. In the current publication a two-stage methodology is presented to arrive at reliable indicators of the SME contribution in corporate patenting. Stage 1 comprises the matching of patents in a patent database to companies in a financial database, followed by the classification of the patents according to firm size. Stage 2 implies additional external information sources in order to address missing data, especially with respect to ownership. Results suggest that actual SMEs account for approximately 1 out of every 5 patent applications filed by companies from the European Union. nrpages: 62 status: publishe...|$|R
