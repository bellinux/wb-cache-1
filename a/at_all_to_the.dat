5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening and}} credits {{sequences}} of most anime television episodes {{are accompanied by}} Japanese pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{justifications for}} DADT {{have been subjected}} to increasing suspicion and outright rejection by the early 21st century. Mounting evidence obtained from the integration efforts of foreign militaries, surveys of U.S. military personnel, and studies conducted by the DoD gave credence to the view that the presence of open homosexuals within the military would not be detrimental <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> armed forces. A DoD study conducted on the behest of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in 2010 supports this most.|$|E
25|$|Mysteriously, {{this work}} was a fresco of her father's Cluj University, which Rădulescu may not have {{attended}} <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> backdrop of the Great Depression and political convulsions.

The student-narrator takes part in the strike of 1932, where she meets recruiters for both the Romanian Communist Party and the fascist Iron Guard (including {{a glimpse of the}} agitator Bănică Dobre). The autofictional Rădulescu informs the reader that she prefers the Guard, but attends meetings of the far-left, during which communist activists imply that the difference between them and the fascists is a minor one.|$|E

25|$|A {{new trend}} in the heated {{controversy}} between First Nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts to the original descendants. An example of this occurred June 21, 2005, when community members and elders {{from a number of}} the 10 Algonquian nations in the Ottawa area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near Maniwaki, Quebec, to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods — some dating back 6,000 years. It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region. The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin. Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area.|$|E
25|$|Since monotremes, {{egg-laying}} mammals, {{are considered}} to represent one of the evolutionarily oldest groups of mammals, they {{have been subject to}} special interest in the study of mammalian sleep. As early studies of these animals could not find clear evidence for REM sleep, it was initially assumed that such sleep did not exist in monotremes, but developed after the monotremes branched {{off from the rest of}} the mammalian evolutionary line, and became a separate, distinct group. However, EEG recordings of the brain stem in monotremes show a firing pattern that is quite similar to the patterns seen in REM sleep in higher mammals. In fact, the largest amount of REM sleep known in any animal is found in the platypus. REM electrical activation does not extend <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> forebrain—suggesting that platypods do not dream. The average sleep time in a 24-hour period of a platypus is said to be as long as 14 hours; though this may be because of their high-calorie crustacean diet.|$|E

[...] We then constructed the first two acts in what we hoped was a manner faithful to Poe, as his climax would run only a short time on the screen." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Tomas Gonzalez-Torres, the Lead EVA Officer, and Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch both {{explained}} that the spare RSU would not impact {{the life of the}} telescope, as it had been fully refurbished on the ground with two of the three improvements incorporated in newer models. [...] "I would say the difference in the projected longevity of the observatory in the out years is very small. We don't see this is a significant detriment <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> observatory. This was a tremendous accomplishment for us." [...] Burch noted. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that due to the length of the spacewalk, and the resulting slip in the timeline, the crew's sleep shift would have to be moved an hour later, to allow them to get the proper amount of rest, {{and the rest of the}} docked timeline would also be shifted forward an hour.|$|E

500|$|Although the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] skit and {{the scenes}} {{in which it was}} {{prepared}} were all scripted, Carell and Ryan improvised several of the moments including Michael's [...] "Yay!" [...] cheer upon getting an answer right, the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees are angry, and Michael's Indian accent. Carell improvised with several different accents on the set, with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film, although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit. Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told not to laugh or react <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E
500|$|Historian Hugh Ross {{argued that}} in gaining the nomination, Willkie [...] "gave {{exceptional}} promise of being a winner. There were ample precedents from American political history in which a minority party, queasy over prospects for survival, bypassed professional leadership in order to entrust its political fortunes to a man without political experience. [...] In most of the previous instances, the nomination {{had gone to a}} military man. In 1940, it went to a businessman." [...] Richard Moe, in his book on the 1940 election, suggested that the nomination of Willkie left long-lasting scars on the Republican Party, with conservatives angered by the success of its Eastern Establishment wing; [...] "whatever else it did, Philadelphia gave birth to the bitter proprietary division within the Republican Party, one accentuated by ideology and geography, that would define the party for decades to come." [...] Among those converted from isolationism by Willkie's oratory, and who worked intensely on the Willkie campaign in Michigan, was Gerald R. Ford, who wrote many years later in his memoirs, [...] "I now realize that my participation did not make much difference <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political fate of Wendell Willkie.

500|$|The first {{peoples of}} the Kootenay River valley were the Ktunaxa people (often {{referred}} to as Kootenai) from whom the river's name derives. Ktunaxa creation myths state that their people were created by the Quilxka Nupika (supreme being) and have always lived in the region; one reads [...] "I have created you Kootenai people to look after this beautiful land, to honor and guard and celebrate my Creation here." [...] However, many historians {{believe that they are}} descended from Great Plains tribes that were driven out of their historic territory by the Blackfeet in the 16th century. The Ktunaxa are considered quite isolated from other Pacific Northwest and Great Plains tribes. Their language is an [...] "isolate", which is only distantly related (if <b>at</b> <b>all)</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Salishan languages spoken by tribes of the Lake Pend d'-Oreille area. They were semi-nomadic people and inhabited a large area of the Kootenay valley from the headwaters to Kootenay Lake. Four villages provided their shelter in the winter, while {{in the rest of the}} year, they traveled between fishing, hunting and berry-picking areas. The northern Ktunaxa hunted buffalo, while the southerners mainly fished. Notably, the Ktunaxa were the first tribe west of the Rockies to capture and use feral European-introduced horses for their own use.|$|E
