40|$|Although {{litigation}} involving {{sexual orientation}} and gender identity discrimination claims has generated considerable public attention in recent years, lesbian and transgender bodies <b>and</b> <b>sexualities</b> still remain largely invisible in Anglo-American courts. While such invisibility is generally attributed to social norms {{that fail to}} recognize lesbian and transgender experiences, the capacity to ‘not see’ or ‘not know’ queer bodies <b>and</b> <b>sexualities</b> also involves wilful acts of ignorance. Drawing from R v Hornick (2002) a Canadian case involving the police raid of a women’s bathhouse, this paper explores how lesbian and transgender bodies <b>and</b> <b>sexualities</b> are actively rendered invisible via legal knowledge practises, norms and rationalities. I argue that limited knowledge and limited thinking not only regulate the borders of visibility and belonging, but play {{an active part in}} shaping identities, governing conduct and producing subjectivity...|$|R

He can be gay one minute, hetero the next, etc.” The comment upset many fans, for it suggests that Deadpool’s sexuality is linked to his mental disorder.|$|E

Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, stereotyping, objectification (especially sexual objectification), oppression, and patriarchy.|$|E

40|$|Although {{young people}} in Zimbabwe are {{becoming}} sexually active {{at a very early}} age, there is no unified body of knowledge on how they regard sex <b>and</b> construct <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> relationships. In many circumstances adolescence sexual agency is denied and silenced. This study explored adolescents’ discourses on sexuality, factors affecting adolescent <b>sexuality,</b> <b>and</b> sexual health. Fusing a social constructionist standpoint and an active view of agency, we argue that the way male adolescents perceive <b>and</b> experience <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> construct sexual identities is mediated by the sociocultural context in which they live in and their own agency. Although adolescents are mistakenly regarded as sexual innocents by society, we argue that male adolescents are active social agents in constructing their own sexual realities and identities. At the same time, dominant structural and interactional factors have a bearing on how male adolescents experience <b>and</b> generate <b>sexuality...</b>|$|R
