5|$|Until 2008, Kosovo did {{not have}} a flag of its own. However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags were flown in Kosovo. Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo (then an <b>autonomous</b> <b>province)</b> were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia. If a nationalist flag were flown, such as Albanian, Serbian or Croatian, a person could go to prison for doing it.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 500,000 Volksdeutsche living in Yugoslavia before the war, about half were evacuated, 50,000 died in Yugoslav concentration camps, 15,000 {{were killed by}} the Partisans and about 150,000 were deported to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. They were also stripped of their property. By 1948, only 55,337 Volksdeutsche remained in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina, an <b>autonomous</b> <b>province</b> of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia.|$|E
5|$|The first general {{outline of}} the post-1945 borders of Croatia {{was made by the}} Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia on 24 February 1945. Some issues {{regarding}} the border, such as Baranja, were left unresolved. The newly established <b>Autonomous</b> <b>Province</b> of Vojvodina, a part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia since April 1945, sought to establish its border with the Socialist Republic of Croatia along the Drava River, thus including Baranja, the Danube and along the Vukovar–Županja line. To counter the claims made by Vojvodina, Croatian authorities staked counterclaims in the areas of Vukovar, Vinkovci, Baranja and in the area of Sombor.|$|E

5|$|The {{flag of the}} Grand Duchy of Posen, a Polish-populated <b>autonomous</b> <b>province</b> of the Kingdom of Prussia {{created in}} 1815, was a red-and-white {{horizontal}} bicolor. Its colors {{were taken from the}} duchy's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an inescutcheon of the Polish White Eagle. With Germany's increasingly anti-Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colors, the red-and-white flag of Posen was replaced in 1886 with a white-black-white horizontal triband. No other part of Poland during the time of Partitions used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors.|$|E
5|$|After al-Adil I {{seized the}} throne in Cairo {{and with it}} the sultanate of the Ayyubid oligarchy, the period of rivalry between Damascus and Cairo to become capital of the Ayyubid empire commenced. Under al-Adil and al-Kamil, Damascus {{continued}} as an <b>autonomous</b> <b>province</b> whose ruler reserved the right to designate his own heir, but during as-Salih Ayyub's rule, military campaigns against Syria reduced Damascus to a vassal of Cairo. In addition, Ayyub established new rules both in administration and government in order to centralize his regime; he conferred the most prominent positions of the state to his close confidants, instead of his Ayyubid relatives. His wife Shajar al-Durr, for example, managed the affairs of Egypt while he was in Syria. Ayyub officially delegated his authority to his dead son Khalil and made al-Durr act formally on Khalil's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of troops {{deployed}} by the belligerents vary considerably. Croatian forces have been estimated from under 100,000 to 150,000, but most sources put the figure at about 130,000 troops. ARSK troop strength in the Sectors North and South was estimated by the HV prior to Operation Storm at approximately 43,000. More detailed HV estimates of the manpower by individual ARSK corps indicated 34,000 soldiers, while Serb sources quote 27,000 troops. The discrepancy is usually reflected in literature as an estimate of about 30,000 ARSK troops. The ARBiH deployed approximately 3,000 troops against the ARSK positions near Bihać.

5|$|YUG, IOP, SCG. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (officially the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes until 1929) participated as Yugoslavia (YUG) in five Games {{before the}} Second World War. The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also participated using the Yugoslavia (YUG) designation, for all Games between 1948–1988. Because of United Nations {{sanctions}} in Security Council Resolution 757, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games. They were {{not permitted to}} compete in team sports such as basketball, handball, or water polo, and the Olympic flag was used in medal ceremonies. Athletes from the Republic of Macedonia competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games because their NOC had not been formed. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later State Union of Serbia and Montenegro), consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games of 1996 and 2000 as Yugoslavia (YUG), and at the Games of 2004 as Serbia and Montenegro (SCG). In 2008 and 2012, the former republics of Yugoslavia were represented by six successor NOCs. In 2016, the <b>autonomous</b> <b>province</b> of Kosovo became the seventh successor NOC.|$|E
5|$|Exercising its {{sovereignty}} {{once again on}} 29 October 1918, the Sabor decided on independence from Austria–Hungary and formation of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The council of the newly established state voted to form the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; however, the Sabor never confirmed that decision. The 1921 constitution defining the new kingdom as a unitary state, and the abolition of historical administrative divisions, effectively ended Croatian autonomy for {{the time and the}} Sabor did not convene until the 1940s. The Cvetković–Maček Agreement of August 1939 established the <b>autonomous</b> <b>Province</b> of Croatia, or Banovina of Croatia, in which the Yugoslav government retained control of defence, internal security, foreign affairs, trade, and transport, while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown-appointed ban (Viceroy or governor). Before any elections were held, the establishment was made obsolete with the beginning of World War II and the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia which banned all political opposition. In 1942, three sessions of an unelected Sabor were held in the Independent State of Croatia; these were held between 23 February and 28 December 1942, when it was formally dissolved. The assembly had no real power as the state was under the direct rule of (the fascist) Ante Pavelić.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, major {{reforms to}} Yugoslavia's {{constitution}} occurred.

5|$|The Hungarian {{occupation}} of Yugoslav territories {{consisted of the}} military occupation, then annexation, of the Bačka, Baranja, Međimurje and Prekmurje regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Kingdom of Hungary during World War II. These territories had all been under Hungarian rule prior to 1920, and had been transferred to Yugoslavia {{as part of the}} post-World War I Treaty of Trianon. They now form part of several states: Yugoslav Bačka is now part of Vojvodina, an <b>autonomous</b> <b>province</b> of Serbia, Yugoslav Baranja and Međimurje are part of modern-day Croatia, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day Slovenia. The occupation began on 11 April 1941 when 80,000 Hungarian troops crossed the Yugoslav border in support of the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia that had commenced five days earlier. There was some resistance to the Hungarian forces from Serb Chetnik irregulars, but the defences of the Royal Yugoslav Army had collapsed by this time. The Hungarian forces were indirectly aided by the local Volksdeutsche, the German minority, which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90,000 Yugoslav troops. Despite only sporadic resistance, Hungarian troops killed many civilians during these initial operations, including some Volksdeutsche. The government of the newly formed Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, subsequently consented to the Hungarian annexation of the Međimurje area, which dismayed the Croat population of the region.|$|E
