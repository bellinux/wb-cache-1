The use of this kind of systems can be expanded for several applications, for example in implantable devices inside the human body where it is impossible to use wires.

The optimal distance from the sediment lifting device {{to the bottom of the}} pond is 10 - 15 cm. In addition, adjusting the length of the connecting rod and the direction of the traction rope allows the SMWM to work in a pond water area greater than 80 %. The analysis of water quality in Wuchang bream (Parabramis pekinensis) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) culture ponds using the SMWM resulted in decreased NH 3 (+) -N and available phosphorus concentrations and increased TP concentrations. The TN content and the amount of available phosphorus in the sediment were reduced. In addition, the fish production showed that the SMWM enhanced the yields of Wuchang bream and silver carp by more than 30 % and 24 %, respectively.

40|$|A sensor, {{generally}} {{composed of}} <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>a</b> sensing <b>device,</b> a transducer, and a signal processor, behaves {{like any other}} dynamic system. A damage in any of its components can cause unexpected deviations in the sensor measurements from the actual values. Due to its increasing importance in system diagnosis and controls, a faulty sensor {{may lead to a}} process shut down or even a fatal accident in safety-critical systems. One of the the challenge is to detect and isolate a fault in the sensor from one in the monitored system once abnormal behaviors are observed in the measurements. This work first tackles such a challenge in a single-input-single-output system by tracking the dynamic response and the associated gain factor of the sensor and the monitored system. Inspired by the fact that sensor measurements depict the dynamics of the monitored plant and the sensor, a subspace identification approach is proposed to detect, isolate, and accommodate a sensor failure under regular operation conditions without additional hardware components. In order to deal with the increased complexity in a multiple-input-multiple-output system, an approach is then proposed to identify the underlying relations in a nonlinear dynamic system with a set of linear models, each capturing the system dynamics in the representative operating regime. Evaluated based on the minimum description length principle, the proposed approach identifies the most correlated system inputs for the target output and the associated model structure using genetic algorithm. An approach is finally developed to detect and isolate sensor faults and air leaks in a diesel engine air path system, a highly dynamic multiple-input-multiple-output system. The proposed approach utilizes analytical redundancies among the intake air mass flow rates and the pressures in the boost and intake manifolds. Without the need for a complete model of the target system, fault detectors are constructed in this work using the growing structure multiple model system identification algorithm. Given the addition information on operation regime from the identified model, the proposed approach evaluates both the global and local properties of the generated residuals to detect and isolate the potential sensor and system faults...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring {{techniques}} in ‘proximal sensing’ coupled to image analysis insights are assuming {{an increasingly important}} role {{in a variety of}} discipline including ecology, forestry, geology, geography, urban planning, archeology, and civil engineering. In this context, the technique based on the acquisition and analysis of hyperspectral images appears the most suited for landscape classification and evolution over time. At the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering, an effective methodology for classifying landscapes according to the reflectance characteristics of the materials on the surface has been developed. It is based on the use of two complementary innovative experimental devices and appropriate software for acquiring and analyzing hyperspectral images. The first device is based on the use of three interference filters covering the ranges 400 - 720 nm (VIS), 650 - 1100 nm (NIR) and 850 - 1800 nm (MIR) and comprises one frame grabber with three Camera Link inputs and a trigger signal generator to tune the filter frequency, one solid state disk array of 1 Tbyte, two CMOS Dalsa- 4 M 60 cameras (coupled to the VIS and NIR filters) and one Xenics InGaAs camera (coupled to the MIR filter), one thermal camera, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> for all <b>devices</b> and a processing computer for controlling the entire system and acquiring images of the thermal camera via a USB port. The second device employs the same equipments describe above but for the use of two spectrometers instead of three filters, the first spectrometer centered in the visible range (400 nm to 1000 nm, VIS), the second one centered in the near infrared range (from 900 nm to 1800 nm, MIR). The VIS spectrometer is mounted in front of the CMOS camera while the MIR one is mounted in front of the InGaAs camera. The other CMOS camera, equipped with standard lens, is used for georeferencing lines acquired with the spectrometers. In fact, the latter system simultaneously acquires the spectra of a line. Multiple images must be acquired to reconstruct a two-dimensional scene from the combination of several lines. The systems developed have very unique and qualifying characteristics, mainly related to the low cost if compared to other systems available on the market, high spectral resolution, high spatial and temporal resolution, easy portability, both systems have been engineered {{so that they can be}} transported by ultralight airplanes. It is suitable for monitoring areas of extension ranging from small to large. In the latter case a large number of images have to be acquired and joined into one large image without using ground control points. This can be automatically done through a specific software that calculates the correspondences by maximizing the photometric consistency among images through correlation operations. The software accounts for rotations, translations and object size changes in consecutive images. The platforms have been employed for field surveys aimed at acquiring hyperspectral images of objects placed at a distance of some hundreds of meters with the equipment mounted on the fixed stand (usually located uphill) or on aircrafts allowing low altitude flights. The most significant results have been obtained in the fields of vegetation recognition, detection of diseases and abnormalities in the spectral signatures of plant species (organic citrus on the Lentini Plains), identification and characterization of landfills, highlighting the spectral inhomogeneity they are associated with and the variations induced on land and on adjacent vegetation...|$|R
