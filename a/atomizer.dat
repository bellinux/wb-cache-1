40|$|Abstract. Twin-fluid <b>atomizers</b> {{underwent}} a significant development {{during the last}} few decades. They are common in many industrial applications such as fuel spraying, melt atomization and food processing. This paper is focused on the evaluation of four different twin-fluid <b>atomizers.</b> The aim is to compare the quality of sprays generated by various <b>atomizers</b> with similar dimensions and in the same operating regimes. A phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) were used to measure spray characteristics such as velocity and size of the droplets. Measured data were used to compare droplet size distribution and to evaluate steadiness of the spray. Visualisations were made to support measured data and to clarify the principles of primary atomization and its influence on the spray. ...|$|R
