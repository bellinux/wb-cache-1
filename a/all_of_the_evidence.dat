5|$|While {{preparing}} for Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) baby shower, her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken), invites {{a woman named}} Lizzy Gill to help Scully around her apartment. Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill tampers with her pregnancy medications. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied with the research conducted at Zeus Genetics in Germantown, kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire at Zeus Genetics, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Dr. Lev is connected to Scully's former obstetrician, Dr. Parenti. While searching Dr. Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses. They confront Dr. Parenti, who denies everything.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges {{surrendered}} to the Romans in March or early April of 175. Their prince, Banadaspus, had attempted peace in early 174; however, the offer was refused, and Banadaspus was deposed by the Iazyges and replaced by Zanticus. The terms of the peace treaty were harsh: the Iazyges were required to provide 8,000 men as auxiliaries and release 100,000 Romans they had taken hostage, and forbidden from living within ten Roman miles (roughly 9miles or 15km) of the Danube. Marcus had intended to give even harsher termsit is said by Cassius Dio {{that he wanted to}} entirely exterminate the Iazyges,but was distracted by the rebellion of Avidius Cassius. Of the 8,000 auxiliaries, 5,500 of them were sent to Britannia, to serve with the Legio VI Victrix, suggesting that the situation there was serious; {{it is likely that the}} British tribes, seeing the Romans being preoccupied with war in Germania and Dacia, had decided to rebel. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that the Iazyges' horsemen were an impressive success. The 5,500 sent to Britain were not allowed to return home, even after their 20-year term of service had ended. After Marcus Aurelius had beaten the Iazyges, he took the title of Sarmaticus, in accordance with the Roman practice of victory titles.|$|E
5|$|With <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders {{pointing}} to Doakes as the killer, {{the case is}} closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets {{with her at the}} aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through a small window and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E
50|$|After the two spies are captured, they {{discover}} a suspicious voice-mail sent by Sasaura to Takekawa, which was recorded at 5:30 AM. Conan hears sounds of waves, some metallic clicking sounds and a man's {{voice in the}} record. Agasa calls him to inform that the paint wasn't from Hotaka, but from a sightseeing cruise, which left Maizuru Harbor and passed by Wakasa Shipyard. Conan deduces that the victim's body was dragged along the cruise from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Harbor. After revising <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences,</b> Conan realizes he has been misled.|$|R

None of the hair, blood, or fingerprint samples collected at the crime scene were consistent with Ferguson or Erickson, and no traces of the victim's blood were found in the vehicle Ferguson was driving the night of the murder. Ferguson was convicted of second-degree murder and robbery and sentenced to 40 years in prison.|$|E
25|$|His kindly {{relationship}} to Harry abruptly changes in Goblet of Fire. When Harry {{emerges from the}} Triwizard Tournament's third task after having seen the rebirth of Voldemort, Fudge refuses to believe it. He is worried about the fallout of announcing Voldemort's return, marking {{the end of the}} Wizarding world's years of peace, and the sudden outbreak of gloom and terror; hence he decides to merely ignore <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> rather than accept the truth. J. K. Rowling has since stated that Fudge's behaviour mirrors that of Neville Chamberlain in the lead-up to World War II.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report also {{describes}} {{the impact of}} climate change on food security. Projections suggested {{that there could be}} large decreases in hunger globally by 2080, compared to the (then-current) 2006 level. Reductions in hunger were driven by projected social and economic development. For reference, the Food and Agriculture Organization has estimated that in 2006, the number of people undernourished globally was 820 million. Three scenarios without climate change (SRES A1, B1, B2) projected 100-130 million undernourished by the year 2080, while another scenario without climate change (SRES A2) projected 770 million undernourished. Based on an expert assessment of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> these projections were thought to have about a 5-in-10 chance of being correct.|$|E
50|$|Pancholi had {{his first}} {{prominent}} Bollywood role with a supporting role in Feroz Khan's Dayavan (1988) opposite Vinod Khanna and Madhuri Dixit. Later that year, he collaborated with K.C. Bokadia in Kab Tak Chup Rahungi opposite Amala. This was his first lead role in Bollywood and established him as a lead actor in the industry. His next notable release that year was Qatil, in which he starred opposite Sangeeta Bijlani. Pancholi essayed <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> a lawyer's son who stood up against <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> death penalty and imprisonment and proved himself guilty on <b>the</b> murder <b>of</b> a prostitute but was trapped when a friend betrayed him by removing <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences.</b> Both films flopped {{at the box office}} but he received critical acclaim for his performance.|$|R

25|$|Much, but not <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> {{used against}} the accused, was {{spectral}} evidence, or {{the testimony of the}} afflicted who claimed to see the apparition or the shape of the person who was allegedly afflicting them. The theological dispute that ensued about the use of this evidence was based on whether a person had to give permission to the Devil for his/her shape to be used to afflict. Opponents claimed that the Devil was able to use anyone's shape to afflict people, but the Court contended that the Devil could not use a person's shape without that person's permission; therefore, when the afflicted claimed to see the apparition of a specific person, that was accepted as evidence that the accused had been complicit with the Devil.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Martian {{meteorite}} ALH84001, {{a specimen}} {{that is much}} older than the majority of Martian meteorites that have been recovered so far, received considerable attention {{when a group of}} NASA scientists led by David S. McKay reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> McKay's team cited as evidence of life were found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.|$|E
25|$|Book Nine {{introduces}} {{the details of}} Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was {{known to have been}} completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> points against Dmitri; the only other person in the house {{at the time of the}} murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.|$|E

500|$|Vogel's {{theory has}} not had any {{traction}} among mainstream historians. Nuclear historians Lawrence Badash and Richard G. Hewlett, in an article from 1993, took issue both with Vogel's alleged evidence of weapons effects residues as well as Vogel's proposed timetable {{for the production of}} the bomb itself. [...] "It is impossible that {{there would have been no}} noticeable effects that later would have been identifiable as nuclear," [...] they wrote. [...] "Yet rescue and investigating personnel combed the area immediately after the blast, and the ammunition depot, which was quickly rebuilt, is in use today. These activities, without any reported injuries resulting from residual radioactivity, clearly indicate that only conventional explosives were detonated." [...] They criticized Vogel for being [...] "silent" [...] about <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> against his theory, and found the persistence in the propagation of the Vogel theory in the media [...] "even in the face of evidence to the contrary" [...] as exemplifying [...] "...the process by which conspiracy theories and other astounding knowledge claims gain popular attention." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the report}} was {{published}} on 3 September 2002, it was condemned by {{a wide variety of}} Bosnian and international figures.

It's utterly false, and it flies in the face of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy." [...] He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as [...] "frankly, disgusting." [...] Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as [...] "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice." [...] Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as [...] "a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region." [...] The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of Miroslav Deronjić; in their verdict, the judges called it [...] "one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The five doctors {{examined}} Terri Schiavo's medical records, brain scans, the videos, and Terri herself. Drs. Cranford, Greer, and Bambakidis {{testified that}} Terri Schiavo {{was in a}} persistent vegetative state. Drs. Maxfield and Hammesfahr testified {{that she was in}} a minimally conscious state. As part of the court-ordered medical exam, six hours of video of Terri Schiavo were taped and filed at the Pinellas County courthouse. The tape included Terri Schiavo with her mother and neurologist William Hammesfahr. The entire tape was viewed by Judge Greer, who wrote, Terri [...] "clearly does not consistently respond to her mother". From that six hours of video, the Schindlers and their supporters produced six clips showing reactions and emotions, totaling less than six minutes, and released those clips to public websites. Judge Greer ruled that Terri Schiavo was in a PVS, and was beyond hope of significant improvement. The trial court order was particularly critical of Hammesfahr's testimony, which claimed positive results in similar cases by use of vasodilation therapy, the success of which is unsupported in the medical literature. This ruling was later affirmed by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, which stated that [...] "this court has closely examined <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> in the record," [...] and [...] "we have... carefully observed the video tapes in their entirety." [...] The court concluded that [...] "...if we were called upon to review the guardianship court's decision de novo, we would still affirm it."
