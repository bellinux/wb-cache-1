5|$|Alien Rage is a first-person shooter {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360 (through Xbox Live Arcade), and PlayStation 3 (through PlayStation Network). Alien Rage was {{developed}} by Polish developer CI Games, then known as City Interactive, using Unreal Engine 3. The game has single-player and competitive multiplayer modes. In its single player campaign, players <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> control of an elite soldier named Jack. Jack is sent to destroy a mining facility and the aliens within it after the aliens turned against and killed the humans that they had shared the facility with.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{separate}} from Marge and Lisa and attend a sumo match. When a wrestler steals Homer's pretzel, he and Bart knock him out, {{then when the}} Emperor of Japan, Akihito, congratulates Homer, he throws him into a dumpster of worn mawashi. As a result, he and Bart <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> jail until Marge pays the bail. Consequently, the only money the family has left is a one-million yen bill, which Lisa loses in the wind after Homer created an origami crane from it.|$|E
5|$|The EPA has {{initiated}} several air quality requirements that help reduce ground-level ozone {{that leads to}} urban heat islands. In the Clean Air Act, one of the EPA's chief policies, there are certain regulations that <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to ensure the state's emissions stay below a certain level. Included in the Clean Air Act, all states must set forth a State Implementation Plan (SIP) {{which is designed to}} guarantee all states meet a central air quality standard.|$|E

5|$|Each pupil is {{assigned}} to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil's house can be indicated to others by optional colour-related clothing. If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that the}} {{resistor}} {{is exactly the}} same in the time domain and the -domain. The sources <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements.

25|$|When the snails {{have laid}} their eggs, the pots <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a nursery where the eggs will hatch. The young snails {{are kept in}} the nursery for about 6 weeks, and then moved to a {{separate}} pen, as young snails do best if kept with other snails of similar size. Eight hours of daylight is optimal for young snails.|$|E

50|$|In 1976 {{during the}} United States Bicentennial, long waits {{in line and}} a whole morning spent were commonplace due to large numbers in Washington, and a {{color-coded}} ticket distribution system <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place.

25|$|Slot limits <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> {{action to}} help protect certain fish in given area.

Slot Limits vary from lake to lake depending on what local officials believe would produce the best outcome for managing fish populations.|$|E
25|$|Fisheries {{management}} {{draws on}} fisheries science {{in order to}} find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management {{is often referred to as}} a governmental system of (hopefully appropriate) management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance.|$|E

25|$|Railbanking is {{preserving}} railroad rights-of-way {{for possible}} future use. Railbanking leaves the tracks, bridges, and other infrastructure intact, relieving the railroad operating company from responsibility of maintenance and taxation. Often the tracks <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> custody {{of a state}} transportation agency, who then seeks a new operator for possible rehab or reactivation. This helps ensure the possibility of future restored rail service when new economic conditions may warrant resuming operation.|$|E
25|$|Kotlety (minced cutlets, meatballs), {{are small}} pan-fried meat balls, not {{dissimilar}} from Salisbury steak {{and other such}} dishes. Made primarily from pork and beef (sometimes also from chicken or fish), they are easily made and require little time. Ground beef, pork, onions and bread <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a bowl and mixed thoroughly until it becomes relatively consistent. Once this effect is achieved, balls are formed and then put into a hot frying pan to cook.|$|E
25|$|This {{refrigeration}} method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating dry ice. Perhaps {{the simplest}} {{example of this}} is a portable cooler, where items <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a traditional ice-cream maker). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below freezing.|$|E
