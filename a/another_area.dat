It also covers judicial fines, setting forth a fine of 46 marks as the penalty for committing murder. The author of the work criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy. It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>area</b> of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

5|$|As {{the route}} heads east, it passes Pine View Cemetery and several local businesses. At an {{intersection}} with Glenwood Avenue (CR34), the county's internal designation for NY254 becomes CR70, whereafter the route passes over Halfway Brook {{and under the}} Gerald B. Solomon Bikeway Bridge– {{a part of the}} Warren County Bikeway. The highway progresses southeasterly upon intersecting NY9L as NY254 turns due southeast to avoid Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport. Along this stretch, NY254 heads through undeveloped land before entering <b>another</b> <b>area</b> of commercial development as it approaches the outskirts of Hudson Falls. Here, the route meets NY32 at Highland Avenue before intersecting Lower Warren Street (here unsigned NY911E) {{on the banks of the}} Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was <b>another</b> <b>area</b> where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|In South Dayton, NY322 {{is known}} as Pine Street as it {{proceeds}} through the village.

5|$|On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, {{destined for}} All Nippon Airways. The {{aircraft}} was the 91st 767-300ER {{ordered by the}} Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to <b>another</b> <b>area</b> in the Everett factory which occupied {{about half of the}} previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.|$|E
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was <b>another</b> <b>area</b> between strongpoints.

Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred yards to the left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E

5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. <b>Another</b> <b>area</b> of contention is the relationship between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{the poor}} was <b>another</b> <b>area</b> that was {{expanded}} by the ACLU. In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that welfare benefits for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes <b>another</b> <b>area</b> to be loaded. Clicking on the edge of an outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E

5|$|While the river, its valley, and {{the rail}} line proceed south from North Cohocton, NY21 {{turns to the}} northeast, {{ascending}} out of the valley and finally crossing the county line, at this point bordering Ontario County. The route meanders across <b>another</b> <b>area</b> of hilly, undeveloped terrain {{to the village of}} Naples, home to the north end of NY53 and the south end of NY245. NY21 meets the two routes at opposite ends of the community, with NY53 terminating south of the village center and NY245 beginning to its north. Naples also serves as NY21's entrance to the Finger Lakes region; the village itself is located in the southernmost part of the Canandaigua Lake valley.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subtropical}} depression {{exited the}} Mozambique Channel, <b>another</b> <b>area</b> of convection {{formed in the}} region on January8, which fluctuated in intensity for several days. A passing cold front increased convection further on January12, which split off a cutoff low-pressure area. Two days later, a subtropical disturbance formed offshore Beira, Mozambique, classified due to the extratropical origins and lack of centralized convection. The system remained nearly stationary, with the convection extending well to the east. On January16, the MFR reclassified {{the system as a}} tropical depression after the thunderstorms increased near the center, the increasing organization due to moderate but decreasing wind shear. By that time, the depression had begun an eastward movement, but soon turned to the south in the weakness between two high-pressure areas. Late on January16, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alda after the convection organized into a central dense overcast. Also that day, the JTWC began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 12S. This marked an unusually late start for the first named storm, at the time the third-latest on record.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>area</b> {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or {{decline in the}} late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
