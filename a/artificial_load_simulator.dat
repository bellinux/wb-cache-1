So far, {{the investigation of the}} mechanical and kinematic behavior of the basic unit of the spine, a motion segment, is predominantly a domain of in vitro experiments on spinal <b>loading</b> <b>simulators.</b> Most existing approaches to measure spinal stiffness intraoperatively in an in vivo environment use a distractor.

The objective of our study was to develop and validate an apparatus, that allows to perform intraoperative in vivo measurements to determine both the applied force and the resulting motion in three dimensional space. The proposed setup combines force measurement with an instrumented distractor and motion tracking with an optoelectronic system. As the orientation of the applied force and the three dimensional motion is known, not only force-displacement, but also moment-angle relations could be determined. The validation was performed using three cadaveric lumbar ovine spines. The lateral bending stiffness of two motion segments per specimen was determined with the proposed concept and compared with the stiffness acquired on a spinal <b>loading</b> <b>simulator</b> which was considered to be gold standard.

40|$|AbstractLoad {{simulator}} is a {{key test}} equipment for aircraft actuation systems in hardware-in-the-loop-simulation. Static loading is an essential function of the <b>load</b> <b>simulator</b> and widely used in the static/dynamic stiffness test of aircraft actuation systems. The tracking performance of the static loading is studied in this paper. Firstly, the nonlinear mathematical models of the hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>simulator</b> are derived, and the feedback linearization method is employed to construct a feed-forward controller to improve the force tracking performance. Considering {{the effect of the}} friction, a LuGre model based friction compensation is synthesized, in which the unmeasurable state is estimated by a dual state observer via a controlled learning mechanism to guarantee that the estimation is bounded. The modeling errors are attenuated by a well-designed robust controller with a control accuracy measured by a design parameter. Employing the dual state observer is to capture the different effects of the unmeasured state and hence can improve the friction compensation accuracy. The tracking performance is summarized by a derived theorem. Experimental results are also obtained to verify the high performance nature of the proposed control strategy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the high {{performance}} force control of hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>simulator.</b> Many previous works for hydraulic force control are based on their linearization equations, but hydraulic inherent nonlinear properties and uncertainties make the conventional feedback proportional-integral-derivative control not yield to high-performance requirements. In this paper, a nonlinear system model is derived and linear parameterization is made for adaptive control. Then a discontinuous projection-based nonlinear adaptive robust force controller is developed for hydraulic <b>load</b> <b>simulator.</b> The proposed controller constructs an asymptotically stable adaptive controller and adaptation laws, which can compensate for the system nonlinearities and uncertain parameters. Meanwhile a well-designed robust controller is also developed {{to cope with the}} hydraulic system uncertain nonlinearities. The controller achieves a guaranteed transient performance and final tracking accuracy in the presence of both parametric uncertainties and uncertain nonlinearities; in the absence of uncertain nonlinearities, the scheme also achieves asymptotic tracking performance. Simulation and experiment comparative results are obtained to verify the high-performance nature of the proposed control strategy and the tracking accuracy is greatly improved...|$|R

The system is highly nonlinear and includes {{delays in the}} control loop and extraneous force disturbance from load.

Contrasted with the conventional-BP-networks-based controllers, the proposed algorithm is more efficient without the localminimal problem. This controller is robust, efficient and simple. The structure invariance principle is used to reduce the extraneous force, but in fact, this method does not work well due to the modeling error and the speed error produced by the speed sensor.

40|$|AbstractExperiments to {{investigate}} bone's physiological adaptation to mechanical loading frequently employ models that apply dynamic loads to bones in vivo {{and assess the}} changes in mass and architecture that result. It is axiomatic that bones will only show an adaptive response if the applied <b>artificial</b> <b>loading</b> environment differs in a significant way from that to which the bones have been habituated by normal functional loading. It is generally assumed that this normal loading is similar between experimental groups. In {{the study reported here}} we found that this was not always the case. Male and female 17 -week-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice were housed in groups of six, and a single episode (40 cycles) of non-invasive axial loading, engendering 2, 200 με on the medial surface of the proximal tibiae in sample mice, was applied to right tibiae on alternate days for two weeks. This engendered an adaptive increase in bone mass in females, but not males. Observation revealed the main difference in behaviour between males and females was that males were involved in fights 1. 3 times per hour, whereas the females never fought. We therefore housed all mice individually. In females, there was a similar significant osteogenic response to loading in cortical and trabecular bone of both grouped and individual mice. In contrast, in males, adaptive increases in the loaded compared with non-loaded control bones was only apparent in animals housed individually. Our interpretation of these findings is that the frequent vigorous fighting that occurs between young adult males housed in groups could be sufficient to engender peak strains and strain rates that equal or exceed the stimulus derived from <b>artificial</b> <b>loading.</b> This indicates the importance of ensuring that physical activity is consistent between groups. Reducing the background level of the naturally engendered strain environment allows adaptive responses to <b>artificial</b> <b>loading</b> to be demonstrated at lower loads...|$|R
