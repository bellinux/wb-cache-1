We show that scatter characteristics, immunophenotyping and <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counting are well preserved, particularly in the lymphocyte population. Nevertheless, a general increase in membrane permeability, evaluated by propidium iodide (PI) uptake, was observed in TransFixR-treated leukocyte subsets. Ultrastructural observations show selective morphological preservation (up to 10 days of storage) of lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, of monocytes.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{a method}} for performing <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> counts of lymphocyte populations with a flow cytometer. In this method, TruCount, test tubes that contain a known number of brightly fluorescent polystyrene beads are provided by the manufacturer. Whole anticoagulated blood is accurately pipetted into the tubes and mixed with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies, the erythrocytes are lysed, and this mixture is analyzed on the flow cytometer. Absolute counts of lymphocyte subsets are calculated by determining the ratio of beads to the cell population of interest and then multiplying this ratio {{by the number of}} beads in the tube. We found this method to be reproducible. The values we obtained by the TruCount method were 5 to 10 % higher than those obtained by conventional methods (flow cytometry and automated hematology) used to determine absolute numbers of cells.

40|$|The {{enumeration}} {{of absolute}} levels of cells and their subsets in clinical samples is of primary importance in {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) + individuals (CD 4 + T- lymphocyte enumeration), in patients who are candidates for autotransplantation (CD 34 + hematopoietic progenitor cells), and in evaluating leukoreduced blood products (residual white blood cells). These measurements share a number of technical options, namely, single- or multiple-color cell staining and logical gating strategies. These can be accomplished using single- or dual-platform counting technologies employing cytometric methods, Dual-platform counting technologies couple the percentage of positive cell subsets obtained by cytometry and the <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> count obtained by automated hematology analyzers to derive the absolute value of such subsets. Despite having many conceptual and technical limitations, this approach is traditionally considered as the reference method for <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> count enumeration. As a result, the development of single-platform technologies has recently attracted attention with several different technical approaches now being readily available. These single-platform approaches have less sources of variability. A number of reports clearly demonstrate that they provide better coefficients of variation (CVs) in multicenter studies and a lower chance to generate aberrant results. These methods are therefore candidates for the new gold standard for <b>absolute</b> <b>cell</b> assessments. The currently available technical options are discussed in this review together {{with the results of}} some cross-comparative studies, Each analytical system has its own specific requirements as far as the dispensing precision steps are concerned.

Twenty-eight patients with Crohn's disease including 14 patients with previously untreated and very short-standing disease (group CD 1) and 14 patients with long-standing and/or previous drug treated disease (group CD 2) were compared with 28 sex and age-matched normals as well as with 13 patients with acute inflammatory bowel disease (group D). Patients in group D and inactive patients of group CD 1 showed a significant absolute lymphocytosis due to an increase in both the three B cell subsets and the T cells, without changes in the null cells. While the proportion of T cells was normal, there was a significant relative B lymphocytosis and a relative null cytopenia in these patients. Active CD 1 patients, however, showed significantly lower absolute lymphocyte and T cell numbers. In group CD 2, there was a significant absolute lymphopenia caused by an equal decrease in B and T cells.

Previous published studies showed that the <b>absolute</b> <b>cells</b> number of monocytes or lymphocytes in peripheral blood or yet the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes displayed the ability to predict the risk of active TB. In the present study we evaluated the ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes variation and we also analyzed the ex-vivo expression of CD 64 on monocytes as tools to identify biomarkers for discriminating TB stages. Significant differences were found when the average ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes of active TB patients was compared with latent TB infection (LTBI) subjects, cured TB and healthy donors (HD). By the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis the cut-off value of 0. 285, allowed the discrimination of active TB from HD, with a sensitivity of 91. 04 % and a specificity of 93. 55 % (95 % of confidence interval: 0. 92 - 0. 99). The ROC curve analysis comparing TB patients and LTBI groups, led to a sensitivity and the specificity of the assay of 85. 07 % and 85. 71 %, respectively (95 % of confidence interval: 0. 85 to 0. 96). The upregulation of CD 64 expression on circulating monocytes in active TB patients could represent an additional biomarker for diagnosis of active TB.
