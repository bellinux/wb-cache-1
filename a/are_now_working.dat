5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Fort Lauderdale is the Osborne Reef, an {{artificial}} reef made of discarded tires that {{has proven to be}} an ecological disaster. The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent to provide habitat for fish while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the U.S. Army, Navy and Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt Island {{is owned}} by the city but was leased to the state of New York's Urban Development Corporation for 99 years in 1969. Most of the {{residential}} buildings on Roosevelt Island are rental buildings. There is also a cooperative (Rivercross) and a condominium building (Riverwalk). One rental building (Eastwood) has left New York State's Mitchell-Lama Housing Program, though current residents are still protected.

25|$|The Fonds régional d'art contemporain of Picardie (FRAC Picardie), {{created in}} 1983, aims the {{promotion}} of contemporary art in partiular through dissemination actions. As early as 1985, FRAC Picardie had specialised its action {{in the field of}} the design and its contemporary dimensions. It is also interested in the media, on and off paper, since artists <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> through the video medium. This allowed it to acquire a good reputation in France and abroad. In 30 years, the FRAC has brought together a unique collection of a thousand drawings which include major names of contemporary art, such as Basquiat, Dubuffet, Oppenheim, Twombly, Matta, Manessier, etc. Since 2001, discussions are underway to construct a new building to accommodate the fonds and its collections.|$|E
25|$|As McCoy's {{investigation}} progresses, he {{is framed}} {{for the murder}} of a civilian by the corrupt Lt. Guzza, who has been assisting the replicants in an effort to prevent them from revealing his activities. Forced into hiding, McCoy explores the underbelly of LA, and makes contact with the replicant twins Luther and Lance, former genetic designers for the Tyrell Corporation, who <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> to extend their own lifespans, {{as well as those of}} all other replicants. From them, McCoy receives a detailed report containing evidence of Guzza's corruption. Using this information, he blackmails Guzza, and forces him to set his falsified record straight. They meet in the city sewers for the exchange, where Guzza is wounded by replicant gunfire. At this point, the player can either run away or kill Guzza.|$|E

25|$|To prevent {{more people}} from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and {{is placed in}} a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, both of whom <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up {{becoming}} captured, although he states that {{he has managed to}} convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris' execution, but Peter, in return for Tris' rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells her that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless take hold of it, it would certainly be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Galitsky's {{followers}} sing his praise. Skula and Yeroshka <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> as gudok-players. They {{entertain the}} followers and all sing of how Galitsky {{and his men}} abducted a young woman and how she pleaded {{to be allowed to}} return to her father without being dishonoured. The prince arrives and sings of how, if he were Prince of Putivl, he would drink and feast all day while dispensing judgment and have the prettiest maidens with him all night (Galitsky's Song). The treasury would be spent on himself and his men while his sister would be praying in a monastery. A group of young women beg the prince to restore their abducted friend. He threatens them and drives them away, saying how she now lives in luxury in his quarters and does not have to work. The prince returns to his rooms having sent for wine for his followers. The gudok players and the prince's followers mock the women. They wonder what might happen if Yaroslavna hears of what happens, but then realise she would be helpless with all her men gone to war. They sing of how they are all drunkards and are supported by Galitsky. The men decide to go to the town square to declare Galitsky the Prince of Putivl, leaving just the two drunk musicians behind.|$|E
500|$|Castiel {{continues}} to appear throughout the season, {{at one point}} sending Dean {{back in time and}} later tasking him and his brother Sam with stopping witches from breaking another seal. He returns with fellow angel Uriel {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "I Know What You Did Last Summer", seeking to kill Anna Milton, a fallen angel with the ability to [...] "hear" [...] the communications between angels. In the following episode, [...] "Heaven and Hell", Anna uses an ancient Enochian sigil to send the angels away, though they manage to track them down later. Once there, Castiel expresses regret at having to kill Anna. Before they can carry out their duty, however, they are confronted by the demon Alastair and two of his minions. A fight ensues, and Castiel is nearly defeated in the battle by Alastair. He is saved by Dean, and they in turn are rescued when Anna regains her powers. Although Uriel nearly vents his frustration on Dean, Castiel stops him, and the two leave. Castiel later becomes suspicious of Uriel and confronts him in [...] "On the Head of a Pin". Uriel admits he and certain other angels <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> together to free Lucifer, having grown weary of never hearing from God and jealous of His favoritism for humanity. He asks Castiel to join him, but Castiel refuses and attacks him. Uriel eventually overpowers Castiel, but is killed by Anna before he can strike the finishing blow. During this time, the orders he is getting from Heaven of questionable morality and the influence of Anna cause him to start to have doubts about Heaven's plans. He later returns in [...] "The Monster At the End of This Book" [...] to explain Chuck's role as a Prophet and later when Dean calls him to help save Sam. [...] Castiel informs Dean he can't interfere due to how important Prophets are, but he impresses upon Dean how the archangel protecting a Prophet will intervene if said Prophet is in trouble to secretly let him know a way to save Sam.|$|E

2500|$|On February 2, 2007, Michael Govan, with Koons, {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a -tall Koons sculpture featuring an operational 1940s locomotive suspended from a crane. The sculpture would be located at the entrance on Wilshire Boulevard, between the Ahmanson Building and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. By 2011, after [...] "the fundraising climate soured and Koons’ California fabricator, Carlson & Co, {{went out of business}} after completing a $2.3-million feasibility study" [...] and a $25 million estimated cost, Govan said [...] "We don't have a final method of construction, and I don't have a final fundraising plan." [...] Koons said they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>working</b> with the German fabricator Arnold, outside of Frankfurt, to do an additional engineering study, and Govan says he has committed to spending half a million dollars for that study.

[...] The Guardian was extremely positive in its review, saying it [...] "spends 45 minutes doing the last thing you expect it to."
