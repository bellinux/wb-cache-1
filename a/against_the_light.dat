5|$|McCabe's {{most highly}} rated innings {{came in the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. England {{compiled}} 8/658 before declaring late on the second day, and McCabe had toiled for 21 overs without success. McCabe arrived at the crease with the dismissal of Bradman at 2/111 to join Brown, and after two unsuccessful appeals <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> he was 19 {{at the close of}} play after 35 minutes of batting with the total at 3/138, having seen Brown dismissed for 48. McCabe had struck three boundaries by this stage, two cut shots and an on drive, and had survived a final spell from fast bowler Ken Farnes without a sightscreen, accompanied by nightwatchman Frank Ward.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{decided to}} use the medium roller to flatten out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break {{immediately}} after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.|$|E

40|$|Illegal {{pedestrian}} behaviour {{is common}} and is reported {{as a factor}} in many pedestrian crashes. Since walking is being promoted for its health and environmental benefits, minimisation of its associated risks is of interest. The risk associated with illegal road crossing is unclear, and better information would assist in setting a rationale for enforcement and priorities for public education. An observation survey of pedestrian behaviour was conducted at signalised intersections in the Brisbane CBD (Queensland, Australia) on typical workdays, using behavioural categories that were identifiable in police crash reports. The survey confirmed high levels of crossing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> or close enough to <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> that they should legally have been used. Measures of exposure for crossing legally, <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> and close to <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> were generated by weighting the observation data. Relative risk ratios were calculated for these categories using crash data from the observation sites and adjacent midblocks. Crossing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> and crossing close to <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> both exhibited a crash risk per crossing event approximately eight times that of legal crossing at signalised intersections. The implications of these results for enforcement and education are discussed, along with the limitations of the study...|$|R

5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E

Thus, if he were destroyed, they would lose their power, ending the war.

It was uncharted territories for both clubs, and it was Warrandyte that batted first and nervously crawled to 9/120. Steve Pascoe made 42 of them, before a pivotal last wicket stand of 70 between John McCartin and Stan Davis that would go down in folklore. Davis then claimed 5/33 to rout the {{opposition}} for 128, and give the club a 62 run first innings lead midway through the 3rd and final day. Warrandyte looked to then bat out the day and claim a comfortable win, but after collapsing to be all out for 96, Wantirna South had 25 overs to score 159 runs in fading light. Fielding was almost impossible as dark clouds closed {{in on the ground}} and infielders were forced to scream out the direction of the ball to outfielders unable to pick up its flight. Davis refused to appeal <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> preferring to play the game out to a finish, and when the opposition finished on 8/131, Warrandyte prevailed by 28 runs, claiming their first ever top grade premiership.|$|E

They also retained extensive knowledge of technology and weaves from their time that far outclass the current world's knowledge and subsequently, they are formidable creatures, viewing most modern Aes Sedai as laughably weak. In competition with each other for the Dark One's favor, the Forsaken distrust and fight each other as much as anyone else. The Forsaken refer to themselves as the Chosen.

25|$|Australia {{elected to}} field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley. Miller {{dismissed}} Edrich and Graveney {{and ended with}} 2/39 from 28overs as England were bowled out for 167. However, it was his relationship with umpire Chester that garnered more attention. After a series of declined appeals and a barrage of short-pitched bowling at the English batsmen, Miller broke the stumps and appealed for a runout with the batsman more than a metre out of his ground, but Chester said not out. Angered, Miller appealed four more times for the wicket. Miller made only five in the first innings, to leave Australia at 3/84. However, Australia recovered to reach 266 and take a 99-run lead. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall launched a short-pitched barrage and Miller dismissed Watson and Reg Simpson in consecutive balls to be 5/171. England were 5/177 a stumps on day four, leading by 78. The pacemen were booed from the field. Miller reacted to one heckler by challenging him to a fight, which was declined. The next day, Miller dismissed Godfrey Evans early to leave England at 6/182, just 83 runs ahead with four wickets in hand, before Trevor Bailey began his resistance. Miller and Bailey were rivals; both were all rounders, but while Miller was attacking, Bailey was stubborn and defensive. Bailey attempted to save the match by time-wasting and causing stoppages by appealing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> holding discussions with his partner and withdrawing when the bowler was running in. At one point, Miller lost his cool and aimed a beamerin an illegal delivery straight at Bailey's head, further angering the crowd. Miller later took the wicket of Tony Lock to end with 4/63 from a long spell of 47overs and confronted another heckler {{on his way back}} to the dressing room, this time an elderly man. England held on for another draw after Bailey deliberately bowled wide down the leg side to prevent the Australian batsmen from reaching the target and used an uncharacteristically long run-up to slow down the proceedings. The teams would enter the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 00.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1930 season, Hobbs {{made himself}} {{available}} for the forthcoming Ashes series. He began in good form, scoring centuries in each innings of his first game, and maintained his run-scoring in {{the weeks leading up}} to the first Test. Before the series began, Hobbs and Rhodes were added to the selection panel again. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 in the first innings, one of the few English successes. After England established a lead on first innings, he scored a rapid 74; he top-scored in both innings and was praised by the press for his continued success. England won the match and Hobbs seemed to have established his ascendancy over the Australian bowling attack, which critics regarded as weak. He failed in the next Test and suggested to the selectors that he should be omitted from the team. But he played in the third Test and was controversially dismissed for 29; his sportsmanship was called into question when he refused to accept the word of the fielder who held the catch. He lingered on the pitch and only left once the umpire ruled him out; he made his displeasure clear and the crowd became unsettled. When England followed on, in reply to an Australian total of 566, Hobbs appealed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and was jeered by the crowd. He was later run out for 13. Feeling tired, possibly feeling under pressure by his role as a selector and concerned by his form, he once more offered to stand down but the other selectors retained him in the team. When he batted in the fourth Test, he scored slowly, determined not to be dismissed, and shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final match was to be played until there was a result, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last Test match. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record aggregate of runs in a first-class career.|$|E

500|$|Having {{overcome}} {{food poisoning}} {{leading up to}} the match, Barnes was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first, and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris {{at the top of the}} order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Bill Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and was reported to have casually muttered to umpire Frank Chester [...] "Eh, the light!", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946–47, Barnes continuously appealed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball attack of Edrich and Alec Bedser to reach stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. However, Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon.|$|E
