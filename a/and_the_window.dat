5|$|The hotel's {{exterior}} façade {{was inspired}} by the Louis XII wing of the Château de Blois. Since its construction, dormers have been added <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> design has changed.

5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} aisle. During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at the east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E

25|$|A further {{restoration}} {{was carried}} out between 1871 and 1873 {{on behalf of the}} Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Ewan Christian carried out the work on the chancel and John Douglas was responsible {{for the rest of the}} church. This included removal of the whitewash from the interior and adding vaulting under the tower. New oak screens were fitted between the chancel and the chapels, and the seating was replaced in the choir and the nave. Many memorials were removed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> tracery was renewed.|$|E

25|$|The {{church is}} a {{miniature}} building, which belongs {{to the type of}} the four-apse centric round monuments of the 10th to 13th centuries such as the church of St. Gregory in Sanahin. But as distinct from them the church of Astvatsatsin is round only in its lower part and octahedral in its upper part, with four triangular niches crowned with various conchs. The dome is proportionate to the lower round bulk. The decoration of the church is in stylistic harmony with that of the main temple and the narthex. The profiled girth skirting the building passes across the ends of the niches <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> openings. On the northern side there are eye-catching reliefs of a stork and a snake, and over the southern window a scene showing two beasts locked in a fight.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermal profile}} can be ranked {{on how it}} fits in a process window (the {{specification}} or tolerance limit). Raw temperature values are normalized {{in terms of a}} percentage relative to both the process mean <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> limits. The center of the process window is defined as zero, and the extreme edges of the process window are ±99%. A Process Window Index (PWI) {{greater than or equal to}} 100% indicates the profile is outside of the process limitations. A PWI of 99% indicates that the profile is within process limitations, but runs at the edge of the process window. For example, if the process mean is set at 200°C with the process window calibrated at 180°C and 220°C respectively, then a measured value of 188°C translates to a process window index of 60%.|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{father had}} an {{extremely}} low tolerance {{for any kind}} of noise, refusing to have a working television or radio in the house. Apart from one slightly open window Genie did not have any access to auditory stimuli outside the house, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> was set well away from the street and other houses, so what little she heard from outside almost exclusively consisted of environmental sounds. Her father never allowed other people in the house, forbade any interaction between Genie and her mother, and forced his son to assist with carrying out his abuse while otherwise preventing him from being in Genie's presence. He did not permit them to speak, and especially not to or around Genie, so any conversations they had were out of Genie's earshot, keeping her from hearing any meaningful amount of language.|$|E

25|$|Southover Grange is a grade II* listed Tudor {{manor house}} built in 1572 with Caen {{limestone}} {{taken from the}} ruins of Lewes Priory. The house and its gardens were bought by Lewes District Council and {{opened to the public}} in 1945. The house is now owned by East Sussex County Council, and it is currently being refurbished into a wedding venue, registry office and community facility. The east wing is leased to an art shop <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Window</b> café (open in spring and summer). The Grange gardens are divided by the Winterbourne stream and contain formal bedding displays, a wildflower area, a knot garden and some notable trees, including a large Magnolia grandiflora, a mulberry tree dating perhaps to the seventeenth century and a tulip tree planted by Queen Elizabeth II. The gardens {{are open to the public}} during daylight hours all year round.|$|E
25|$|During office hours, {{most of the}} {{exterior}} and the remaining grounds are accessible to the public. Spring Hall is a large, three-storey, cellared building which was originally set in its own grounds. It has pitched roofs, gables and tall, Elizabethan-style chimneys. There is a four-storey, octagonal, pinnacled tower and a ground-floor entrance-porch at the south-east corner (pictured below). The west side, which faces the drive and the Huddersfield Road, has two non-functioning gargoyles representing a dog and fox on the outer corners of the central bay of the first floor. Besides being evident from outside, these gargoyles can be seen through adjacent windows, from inside the building. The lintel above the ground floor window on the same bay is carved with a frieze of stylised flower motifs separated by a zigzag line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> below contains stone frames with double ogee curves along the top edges. Above the south-east entrance porch is the Holdsworth family crest carved in stone: a lion rampant, holding an opened scroll.|$|E
25|$|The {{church of}} Notre-Dame de Louviers {{underwent}} a dramatic expansion project during the Late Middle Ages. An entirely new aisle {{was added to}} the north between 1493 and 1496. According to historical documents, the architect was Jehan Gillot. Mr. Gillot worked in the Late Gothic period, and his design for the expansion project shows this. The prismatic bases of the piers {{in this part of the}} church are much higher, the linear vault moldings disappear into piers and walls, vault responds intersect one another, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> tracery is Flamboyant in nature—it resembles the flickering patterns of a flame. Documentary sources imply that Gillot continued work on the new south nave aisle between 1496-1506 but this has yet to be proven. However, many of the same architectural forms were employed on the south side with the notable omission of the intersecting vault responds. The expansion of the nave necessitated the reworking of the upper parts of the church, which received a glazed triforium (later filled with cement) and a modified system of flying buttresses. The amount of usable interior space increased dramatically as a result of these extensive expansion projects, which were funded in large part by Louviers’ cloth guilds and elite patrons, including Guillaume II le Roux, Duke of Bourgtheroulde.|$|E

25|$|The early 20th {{century was}} a period of {{prolific}} collecting for the museum, which acquired such works as a dragon tile relief from the Ishtar Gate of Babylon, an Egyptian relief of Mourning Women and a statuette of a Seated Scribe, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's The Wedding Dance, Saint Jerome in His Study by Jan van Eyck and Giovanni Bellini's Madonna and Child. Early purchases included French paintings by Claude Monet, Odilon Redon, Eugène Boudin, and Edgar Degas, as well as Old Masters including Gerard ter Borch, Peter Paul Rubens, Albrecht Dürer and Rembrandt van Rijn. The museum includes works by Vincent van Gogh including a self-portrait. The self-portrait of Vincent van Gogh <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Window</b> by Henri Matisse were purchased in 1922 and were the first paintings by these two artists to enter an American public collection. Later important acquisitions include Hans Holbein the Younger's Portrait of a Woman, James Abbott McNeill Whistler's , and works by Paul Cézanne, Eugène Delacroix, Auguste Rodin, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and François Rude. German Expressionism was embraced and collected early on by the DIA, with works by Heinrich Campendonk, Franz Marc, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Beckmann, Karl Hofer, Emil Nolde, Lovis Corinth, Ernst Barlach, Georg Kolbe, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Paula Modersohn-Becker, and Max Pechstein in the collection. Non-German artists in the Expressionist movement include Oskar Kokoschka, Wassily Kandinsky, Chaim Soutine and Edvard Munch. The Nut Gatherers by William-Adolphe Bouguereau is, by some accounts, the most popular painting in the collection.|$|E
