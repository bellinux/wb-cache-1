40|$|The lack {{of study}} on <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits</b> {{reliability}} is {{likely due to}} the migration of <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits</b> to their digital equivalents. There are a considerable numbers of important <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits</b> such as amplifiers and comparators used in sensors in portable devices, which may be investigated on its reliability. The small number of investigations on <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit's</b> reliability has initiated the interest in investigating the impact of single event transients or soft errors for <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits.</b> Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the sensitive parts of the circuit. The sensitivity analysis have indicated that single event transient has lead to erroneous behavior of comparators and eventually cause failure. The sensitive sub-circuits were later investigated on its dependence on variability of the design variables which covers both process and environment parameters. The variability analysis has proven that it does contribute towards increasing {{the sensitivity of the}} comparator to single event transients. Variability has also proven that it could increase the vulnerability of the least sensitive parts of the comparator...|$|R

50|$|Since the {{information}} is encoded differently in analogue and digital electronics, the way they process a signal is consequently different. All operations that can be performed on an analogue signal such as amplification, filtering, limiting, and others, can also be duplicated in the digital domain. Every digital circuit is also an <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit,</b> in that the behaviour of any digital circuit can be explained using the rules of analogue circuits.|$|E
50|$|Analogue {{circuits}} {{are typically}} harder to design, requiring more skill than comparable digital systems. This {{is one of}} the main reasons that digital systems have become more common than analogue devices. An <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> is usually designed by hand, and the process is much less automated than for digital systems. However, if a digital electronic device is to interact with the real world, it will always need an analogue interface. For example, every digital radio receiver has an analogue preamplifier as the first stage in the receive chain.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{extensions}} of our analogue fault simulator `aFSIM' to a multi-level hierarchical analogue fault simulation tool are described. Due to these extensions {{it is now}} possible to fault-simulate larger <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits.</b> In addition mixed-signal circuits including a not too large amount of digital circuitry can also be fault-simulated. The term `multi-level hierarchical analogue fault simulation' comprises the usage of behavioural models for components together with components described at the transistor-level, fault injection at different abstraction levels, and a hierarchical handling of both different descriptions of the circuit components and faults during the fault simulation process. Multi-level hierarchical analogue fault simulation is an important means to tackle the complexity of <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits</b> for providing test signals with a high fault and defect coverage...|$|R
40|$|Transient Response Testing {{has been}} shown to be a very {{powerful}} and economical functional test technique for linear analogue cells in mixed-signal systems. Recently this work has been extended to non-linear <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits</b> by treating Transient Response Testing as a structural test technique and employing optimised and reduced fault sets that are derived from Inductive Fault Analysis and circuit sensitivity analyses. These developments have been very successful and have also facilitated a novel BIST methodology for <b>analogue</b> <b>circuits.</b> The BIST scheme employs a generic on-chip stimulus for all analogue cells and features a specially designed test cell that coordinates a short test sequence that involves sampling the transient response at key instants in the test cycle and comparing to a known reference...|$|R

Analogue Circuit: Live At The Roundhouse features {{the first ever}} live John Foxx DVD, plus a double audio album of the show, filmed during the performance at the Short Circuit event at the London venue on June 5, 2010. The discs feature tracks from John Foxx's years with Ultravox, his solo career and a preview of then still unreleased new tracks by John Foxx and the Maths. Personnel include former Ultravox guitarist Robin Simon, Benge, Jean-Gabriel Becker, Jori Hulkkonen, Serafina Steer, Steve D'Agostino and Liam Hutton.

5000|$|His first cybernetic {{work that}} moved {{directly}} and recognisably {{in response to}} what was going on around it was the Sound Activated Mobile (SAM). It had four microphones mounted in front of fiberglass parabolic reflectors (reminiscent of a flower) on top of a spine-like column of aluminium castings. Hydraulic pistons in the vertebra-like units allowed the neck to twist from side-to-side and bend forwards and backwards. An <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> was used to control the hydraulics to move the robot to face the direction of the predominant sound. It was exhibited at the Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition [...] which was held initially at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1968 and later toured Canada and the US ending at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. SAM's behaviour, that of turning to face people as they talked and tracking their movement if they continued to make a sound, together with its sensitivity to quiet but sustained noise, rather than loud shouts, encouraged many people to spend time in front if it, trying to attract its attention.|$|E

In this paper, a new analytical mismatch model is developed for both triode and saturation regimes and verified using 35 nm gate-length BSIM 4 model cards. Short-channel effects, such as velocity saturation and mobility degradation, are taken into consideration. The results achieved excellent agreement with Monte Carlo HSPICE simulations.

40|$|Scaling of {{complementary}} metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) {{technology has}} benefited {{the semiconductor industry}} for almost half a century. For CMOS devices with a physical gate-length in the sub- 100 nm range, extreme device variability is introduced {{and has become a}} major stumbling block for next generation <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> design. Both opportunities and challenges have therefore confronted <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> designers. Small geometry device can enable high-speed <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> designs, such as data conversion interfaces that can work in the radio frequency range. These designs can be co-integrated with digital systems to achieve low cost, high-performance, single-chip solutions that could only be achieved using multi-chip solutions in the past. However, <b>analogue</b> <b>circuit</b> designs are extremely vulnerable to device mismatch, since a large number of symmetric transistor pairs and circuit cells are required. The increase in device variability from sub- 100 nm processes has therefore significantly reduced the production yield of the conventional designs. Mismatch models have been developed to analytically evaluate the magnitude of random variations. Based on measurements from custom designed test structures, the statistics of process variation can be estimated using design related parameters. However, existing models can no longer accurately estimate the magnitude of mismatch for sub- 100 nm “atomistic” devices, since short-channel effects have become important. In this thesis, a new mismatch model for small geometry devices will be proposed to address this problem. Based on knowledge of the matching performance obtained from the mismatch model, design solutions are desired at different design levels for a variety of circuit topologies. In this thesis, transistor level compensation solutions have been investigated and closed-loop compensation circuits have been proposed. At circuit level, a latch-based comparator has been used to develop a compensation solution because this type of comparator is extremely sensitive to the device mismatch. These comparators are also used as the fundamental building block for the analogue-to-digital converters (ADC). The proposed comparator compensation scheme is used to improve the performance of a high-speed flash ADC. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
