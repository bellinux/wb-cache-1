The first film from this contract was The Fog.

He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself.

A grass drive, {{as we should}} call it in England--a 'trace,' {{as it is called}} in the West Indies--some sixty feet in width, and generally carpeted with short turf, led up hill and down dale; for the land, though low, is much ridged and gullied, and there has been as yet no time to cut down the hills, or to metal the centre of the road. It led, as the land became richer, through a natural avenue even grander than those which I had already seen. [...] The light and air, entering the trace, had called into life the undergrowth and lower boughs, till from the very turf to a hundred and fifty feet in height rose one solid green wall, spangled here and there with flowers.

The crimson masses of Norantea on the highest tree-tops were here most gorgeous; but we had to beware of staring aloft too long, for fear of riding into mud-holes--for the wet season would not end as yet, though dry weather was due--or, even worse, into the great Parasol- ant warrens, which threatened, besides a heavy fall, stings innumerable. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> recollect, a gold-green Jacamar sat on a log and looked at me till I was within five yards of her.

40|$|Wittgenstein, 1968) {{endorsed}} {{one kind}} of inverted spectrum hypothesis and rejected another. This paper argues {{that the kind of}} inverted spectrum hypothesis that Wittgenstein endorsed (the “innocuous ” inverted spectrum hypothesis) is the thin end of the wedge that precludes a Wittgensteinian critique of the kind of inverted spectrum hypothesis he rejected (the “dangerous ” kind). The danger of the dangerous kind is that it provides an argument for qualia, where qualia are (for the purposes of this paper) contents of experiential states which cannot be fully captured in natural language. I will pinpoint the difference between the innocuous and dangerous scenarios that matters for the argument for qualia, give arguments in favor of the coherence and possibility of the dangerous scenario, and try to show that some standard arguments against inverted spectra are ineffective against the version of the dangerous scenario I will be advocating. The leading idea of the paper is that an argument for qualia based on spectrum inversion does not require that the inversion be behaviorally indistinguishable. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> crucial <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> will rely on a less controversial version of an argument I gave in Block (1999).
