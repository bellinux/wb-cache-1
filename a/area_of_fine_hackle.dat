50|$|In {{periglacial}} {{areas and}} areas affected by seasonal frost, repeated freezing and thawing of groundwater forces larger stones toward the surface, as smaller stones flow and settle underneath larger stones. At the surface, {{areas that are}} rich in larger stones contain much less water than highly porous <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>finer</b> grained sediments. These water-saturated <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>finer</b> sediments have a much greater ability to expand and contract as freezing and thawing occur, leading to lateral forces which ultimately pile larger stones into clusters and stripes. Through time, repeated freeze-thaw cycles smooth out irregularities and odd-shaped piles to form the common polygons, circles, and stripes of patterned ground.|$|R
