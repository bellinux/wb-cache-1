The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 required GAO to study children's access to care under Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP,</b> including information on physicians' willingness to serve children covered by Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP.</b> GAO assessed (1) the extent to which physicians are enrolled and serving children in Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP</b> <b>and</b> accepting these and other children as new patients, and (2) the extent to which physicians experience difficulty referring children in Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP</b> for specialty care, as compared to privately insured children. GAO conducted a national survey of nonfederal primary and specialty care physicians who serve children, and asked about their enrollment in state Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP</b> programs, whether they served and accepted Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP</b> <b>and</b> privately insured children, and the extent to which they experienced difficulty referring children in Medicaid <b>and</b> <b>CHIP</b> <b>and</b> privately insured children to specialty care.

5|$|The Fat Duck {{is located}} in a 16th-century cottage that was further {{modified}} in the 19th and 20th centuries. Prior to the restaurant opening in the location, it was a public house called The Ringers. The building was Grade II listed by English Heritage on 2 May 1989. When the restaurant opened in 1995, the kitchen was staffed by owner Heston Blumenthal and one other employee. At the time the restaurant was serving meals in the style of a French bistro, such as lemon tarts, and steak <b>and</b> <b>chips.</b> Blumenthal later said that science had already begun to influence the cooking at this early stage, as already on the menu were his Triple Cooked Chips, which were developed to stop the potato from going soft.|$|E

5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle <b>and</b> <b>Chips,</b> and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E

40|$|Proximodistal {{patterning}} in Drosophila requires {{division of}} the developing leg into increasingly smaller, discrete domains of gene function. The LIM-HOM transcription factors apterous (ap) and Lim 1 (also known as dlim 1), and the homeobox genes Bar and aristaless (al) {{are part of the}} gene battery required for the development of specific leg segments. Our genetic results show that there are posttranslational interactions between Ap, Bar and the LIM-domain binding protein Chip in tarsus four, and between Al, Lim 1 <b>and</b> <b>Chip</b> in the pretarsus, and that these interactions depend on the presence of balanced amounts of such proteins. We also observe in vitro protein binding between Bar <b>and</b> <b>Chip,</b> Bar <b>and</b> Ap, Lim 1 <b>and</b> <b>Chip,</b> <b>and</b> Al <b>and</b> <b>Chip.</b> Together with the previous evidence for interactions between Ap <b>and</b> <b>Chip,</b> these results suggest that these transcription factors form protein complexes during leg development. We propose that the different developmental outcomes of LIM-HOM function are due to the precise identity and dosage of the interacting partners present in a given cell...|$|R
