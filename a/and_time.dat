40|$|Abstract: Field {{experiments}} were conducted at Sivapuri, Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of vermicompost, in comparison to inorganic fertilizers–NPK, on the physio-chemical and biological characteristics of the soils – clay loam soil (CLS) and sandy loam soil (SLS) and on the growth, yield and nutrient content of beans – Phaseolus vulgaris. Results showed that the application of vermicompost @ 5 tonnes ha- 1 had enhanced significantly the pore space (1. 09 <b>and</b> 1. 02 <b>times),</b> water holding capacity (1. 1 <b>and</b> 1. 3 <b>times),</b> cation exchange capacity (1. 2 <b>and</b> 1. 2 <b>times).</b> It reduced particles (1. 2 <b>and</b> 1. 2 <b>times),</b> <b>and</b> bulk density (1. 2 <b>and</b> 1. 2 <b>times),</b> pH (1 <b>and</b> 1. 02 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> electrical conductivity (1. 4 <b>and</b> 1. 2 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> increased organic carbon (37 <b>and</b> 47 <b>times),</b> micro (Ca 3. 07 <b>and</b> 1. 9 <b>times,</b> Mg 1. 6 <b>and</b> 1. 6 <b>times,</b> Na 2. 4 <b>and</b> 3. 8 <b>times,</b> Fe 7 <b>and</b> 7. 6 <b>times,</b> Mn 8. 2 <b>and</b> 10. 6 <b>times,</b> Zn 50 <b>and</b> 52 <b>times</b> <b>and</b> Cu 14 <b>and</b> 22 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> macro (N 1. 6 <b>and</b> 1. 7 <b>times,</b> P 1. 5 <b>and</b> 1. 7 <b>times,</b> K 1. 5 <b>and</b> 1. 4 <b>times)</b> nutrients <b>and</b> microbial activity (1. 4 <b>and</b> 1. 5 <b>times)</b> in both soil types, particularly more in CLS. The growth, yield (1. 6 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> quality (protein (1. 05 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> sugar (1. 01 times) content in seed) of bean were enhanced in CLS than SLS. On the other hand, the application of inorganic fertilizers @ 20 : 80 : 40 kg ha- 1 has resulted in reduced porosity (1. 03 <b>and</b> 1. 01 <b>times),</b> organic carbon (1. 04 <b>and</b> 9. 5 <b>times)</b> <b>and</b> microbial activity (1. 02 <b>and</b> 1. 03 <b>times)</b> in both soil types...|$|R
