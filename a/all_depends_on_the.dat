However, Mike Brown claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E

He said that it could be set five years after ZNMD and that the original characters would have grown older, having a reason to go on another trip. It has also been agreed upon that a proper script is required, as it is {{not a part of the}} [...] "commercial field" [...] of cinema. However, no official confirmations have been made regarding the sequel, despite requests from many viewers. After the IIFA ceremony, Farhan Akhtar commented that there was [...] "no necessity" [...] for the sequel. Later in 2013, in an interview with Hindustan Times, Zoya Akhtar expressed interest in scripting for the sequel after completing the shooting of her next film Dil Dhadakne Do released in June 2015.|$|E

Shayne Lee, author of Erotic Revolutionaries: Black Women, Sexuality, and Popular Culture (2010), wrote that her music {{over the following}} decade [...] "brand her {{as one of the}} most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s." [...] In You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (1996), Lilly J. Goren observed [...] "Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] The Washington Post declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted [...] "from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds—figuratively and literally—of love and lust." [...] The song [...] "Free Xone" [...] from The Velvet Rope, which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as [...] "a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics." [...] During promotion for Janet, she stated [...] "I love feeling deeply sexual—and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process." [...] Upon the release of Damita Jo, Jackon stated [...] "Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring—and liberating—my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme," [...] adding [...] "As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music—as with anything, it <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> artist." ...|$|E

This results in control over material parameters known as [...] permittivity and magnetic permeability. These two parameters (or quantities) determine the propagation of electromagnetic waves in matter. Therefore, controlling the values of permittivity and permeability means that the refractive index can be negative or zero as well as conventionally positive. It <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intended application or desired result. So, optical properties can be expanded beyond the capabilities of lenses, mirrors, and other conventional materials. Additionally, one of the effects most studied is the negative index of refraction.|$|E

They won't be able to exist, and they will run away from here. But it <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war, and whether we will win the battles with them."

2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; it <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies. This [...] "indeterminacy" [...] criticism revolves around the idea that technological change could have many different and contradictory effects. It could reduce costs, or it could increase unemployment; it could be labor saving, {{or it could be}} capital saving. Therefore, so the argument goes, it is impossible to infer definitely a theoretical principle that a falling rate of profit must always and inevitably result from an increase in productivity. Perhaps the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall might be true in an abstract model, based on certain assumptions, but in reality no substantive empirical predictions can be made. In addition, profitability itself can be influenced by an enormous array of different factors, going far beyond those which Marx specified. So there are tendencies and counter-tendencies operating simultaneously, and no particular empirical result necessarily follows from them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{portion of}} the {{marginal}} cost curve above its intersection with the average variable cost curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market. (the {{portion of the}} MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve {{is not part of}} the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shut down point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly [...] "has" [...] an MC curve it does not have a supply curve. [...] In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price – for each price there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve.|$|E
2500|$|Giving {{it three}} out of five stars, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticized Damita Jo saying it {{featured}} [...] "a slew of the gooey, structureless sex ballads that have become Janet's staple." [...] Cinquemani also called the songs [...] "Like You Don't Love Me" [...] and [...] "Moist" [...] "two of the album's best." [...] Entertainment Weekly rated it a 'C+' saying [...] "The tracks, many produced by her longtime collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, have the sumptuous, homogenized creaminess we've come to expect from her." [...] Angus Batey of Yahoo! Music UK gave it four out of ten stars, saying [...] "Numerous explanatory spoken word asides seek to reassure us that Janet, as she approaches 40, is seeking love rather than reveling in lust." [...] However, she called [...] "R Junkie" [...] "a delicious throwback, like a glorious 'Rhythm Nation'", [...] "I Want You" [...] "a peculiar post-modern waltz with a '40s supper club vibe, being the ear-catcher", and [...] "All Nite (Don't Stop)" [...] "another precision-tooled winner, with Jackson using an almost ethereal higher-pitched vocal delivery." [...] Neil Strauss of Rolling Stone gave the album two out of five stars, saying Damita Jo [...] "smacks of trying too hard. [...] {{the truth is that}} Jackson is just trying to humanize herself, as she did so well on her breakthrough 1986 album, Control [...] Jackson has had eighteen years of monster hits, so it's hard to fault her instincts. [...] but there's too much of Jackson's moistness to wade through to get to Damita Jo's solid ground." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said [...] "while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music -- as with anything, it <b>all</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> artist. [...] Damita Jo proves that she was merely flirting with modesty, since it's as explicit as pop music gets." [...] Ian Wade of BBC Music had mixed feelings, saying that [...] "While there's nothing outwardly bad about Damita Jo, at 22 tracks over 65 minutes, your attention does start to wander and you almost forget it's playing. But after a third or fourth listen, the slick grooves of [...] "Spending Time With You" [...] and [...] "Island Life" [...] gain more identity. [...] Damita Jo heralds no real major leap forward, but it's no pig's ear either. A bit of editing and a couple of killer dance tracks would've made it even better." ...|$|E
