5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life. Chastity includes temperance, self-mastery, personal and cultural growth, and divine grace. It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity {{for those who are}} not married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> conjugal chastity.|$|E

Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) claims that she knows who was responsible and names the attacker as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei. When questioned, Arden admits that he made sexual overtures to her, but claims that it was harmless {{and that he is}} too elderly to have done anything.|$|E
5|$|Apollo and {{his mentor}} Kristoph Gavin, {{an old friend}} of Phoenix's, <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} him against charges of murdering one of his customers in a rigged game of poker. In the middle of his testimony, Phoenix inadvertently names Kristoph as a witness, {{and with the help of}} a falsified piece of evidence provided by Trucy, exposes him as the real murderer. Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E

5|$|In a dance club, a {{young man}} is taken by a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death {{was caused by a}} fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to the sex of the killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always be open to the possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Montana after a {{shooting}} on a farm near a Native American reservation.

5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop {{is actually the}} killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{investigate}} the {{shooting death of}} Charles Courtland Cox, a small-time drug peddler shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse. When Pembleton suspects a police shooting, Lt. Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) explains Officer Hellriegel (Jeffrey Mandon) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon. However, Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton. Gee is angry with Pembleton's inquiries into the police, and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) and Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) say they will make Hellriegel a scapegoat if the media start suggesting racism or police brutality. Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun, but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested. Gee refuses to approve the tests, but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E

5|$|She, Charlie (Kirk Acevedo), and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{the scene}} of an {{accident}} where a pedestrian has been run over by a bus, nearly duplicating events of a similar bus accident the day before, a statistical impossibility according to Astrid (Jasika Nicole). Olivia finds a ball-point pen at the scene, a rarity in the parallel universe because of the adoption of digital interfaces. Evidence suggests that the discovery of the pen by a bystander created a sequence of reactions that led to the victim's death. The next day, another pedestrian is wounded in a bus accident. As the Fringe team investigates the scene, finding another pen, a bystander is struck and killed by an ambulance. Olivia spots a suspicious man in the crowds, but he uses a seemingly random series of happenstance events to get away.|$|E
5|$|The third episode {{takes up}} events {{eighteen}} {{years prior to}} the present, where Gregory and Shigaraki <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> defend Issei Tenkai from the charge of murdering fellow chef Isaku Hyōdō. Because the body has disappeared, Gregory and prosecutor Manfred von Karma cannot make much progress, but von Karma coerces Tenkai into falsely confessing to being an accomplice. This leads to Gregory accusing von Karma of forging evidence which lead to the infamous DL-6 Incident. In the present, the chef Yutaka Kazami is almost killed in an art gallery run by Tenkai's assistant Tsukasa Oyashiki. Yumihiko is assigned to prosecute under Mikagami's direction, but Edgeworth still investigates. He concludes that Oyashiki killed Hyōdō and attempted to kill Kazami; Oyashiki admits to the latter crime, but accuses Kazami of being Hyōdō's murderer. Kazami admits to murdering Hyōdō, who he had conspired with to cheat in a cooking contest, but had then been betrayed by. Kazami and Oyashiki are jailed, and Tenkai is freed.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen they <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E

5|$|Walter (John Noble) {{struggles with}} {{writing a letter}} to Peter (Joshua Jackson) to explain the events from 1985 that led Walter to bring Peter to his {{universe}} from the parallel one. As he contemplates the final letter, he {{and the rest of}} the Fringe team <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car of a train. Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck (Peter Weller), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel. Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there, and activates a mechanism on his body, causing him to travel back in time.|$|E
5|$|When {{transferred}} to a secret underwater government base, Osborn takes steps to ensure his release from prison. He uses a group of followers known as the 'Green Goblin Cult' to break out {{with the aid of}} corrupt senators; he plans to turn himself in after killing his fellow escapees, setting him up as a 'champion' of the judicial system. After the breakout he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch, Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk, Superia for Ms. Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and an A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals he has the Super-Adaptoid's powers, declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn's leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded. After the Hobgoblin returns to New York, a nurse and doctor <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Norman's hospital room, only to find him gone.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Todd Fleming (Jeffrey Nordling) <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Lacey's (Mary Mouser) {{school when}} she is seen looking at photos of a young woman, Nikki Parkson (Mary Fegreus) who died, after battling a {{terminal}} illness. When Megan looks at a photo, she sees irregularities and without permission from Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), Megan and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) stop Nikki being buried, so they can look at her body, much to the horror of Nikki's mother Lillian (Jill Eikenberry). Although Nikki's family say that she committed suicide, Megan finds evidence to suggest otherwise; Nikki's neck has bruising on the bottom, showing that she was strangled. Nikki was being given pills to help her illness by Lillian, though these made her worse, but this kept Lillian in the social limelight, getting sympathy from friends; however Lillian did not kill her. Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn), Megan, Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) and Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) find out that Nikki's boyfriend Shane (Charlie Semine) was actually working together with Nikki's sister Sara (Jo Armeniox). It is revealed that Shane and Sara killed Nikki, as in Nikki's will she was giving all her money to a fake wildlife foundation which Sara had set up. However, Nikki wanted to switch charities, so Sara killed her to stop her from doing this, with Shane helping her to stage it as suicide, so they could both get the money.|$|E
