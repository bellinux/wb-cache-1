5|$|In 1932, Stalin {{closed down}} {{independent}} artists' unions; former avant-garde artists had to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new climate or risk being officially criticised or even blacklisted. Lissitzky retained {{his reputation as}} the master of exhibition art and management into the late 1930s. His tuberculosis gradually reduced his physical abilities, and he was {{becoming more and more}} dependent on his wife in actual completion of his work.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{developed}} by a small team at Ubisoft Reflections for internal release, the game became popular between co-workers and was eventually planned for official release, confirmed in a blog post by Ubisoft on January 22, 2015. It was created using the Unity game engine, and contains procedural animation and physics-based gameplay, which allow the player's movements to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game's environment.|$|E

5|$|Polyploidy {{appears to}} have {{enhanced}} the ability of flowering plants to survive the extinction, probably because the additional copies of the genome such plants possessed, allowed them to more readily <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rapidly changing environmental conditions that followed the impact.|$|E

5|$|Species {{that were}} unable to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{changing}} environment and competition from other life forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence {{of many of these}} older species.

5|$|The Paleo-Indians {{that survived}} are {{now known as}} the Archaic peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the {{extinction}} of most big game and were primarily hunter-gatherers who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. They were able to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shifting climate and the resulting change of animal and plant populations.|$|E

5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} the supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised. The BBC's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product in light of the supply changes. Modifications were made to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E

5|$|During his {{period in}} Berlin, {{he came in}} contact with and was greatly {{influenced}} by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the necessity for politicians to be acquainted with historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during KogÄƒlniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual spirit of nations.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{regional}} master franchise for Israel, Orgad Holdings, decided {{to close its}} operations in that country and merge all operations with its own local chain, Burgeranch. It was claimed by Ograd owners Eli and Yuval Orgad that Israelis preferred {{the taste of the}} local brand over the American chain. One blogger, a former manager of a Burger King in the United States, claimed that both chains were basically the same in product and preparations, it was Burger King's failure to fully <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local market tastes that doomed them in that country. By 6 September 2010 all 55 locations in the country were closed down and converted to Burgeranches.|$|E
5|$|In 1348 {{a plague}} {{known as the}} Black Death crossed from {{mainland}} Europe into England, rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population. After an initial period of economic shock, England began to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> changed economic situation. The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply. Labourers could charge more for their work and, in the consequent competition for labour, wages were driven sharply upwards. In turn, the profits of landowners were eroded. The trading, commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated.|$|E

BeyoncÃ©'s husband Jay-Z acquired {{the parent company of}} Tidal, Aspiro, {{in the first quarter of}} 2015. Including BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.|$|E
5|$|Leeds United manager George Graham signed Hasselbaink in {{the summer}} of 1997 for a fee of Â£2 million.

5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to <b>adapt</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable to be caught. Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E
