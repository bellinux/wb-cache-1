40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Educational Leadership, Sports Studies, and Educational/Counseling Psychology, Washington State UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this action {{research}} {{study was to identify}} and improve organizational strategies for data use at East Omak Elementary in the Omak School District in Washington State. The study was conducted using Stinger's (2007) action research process of "look, think, act" from fall of 2013 to spring of 2014. Throughout the cyclical process of action research, grade level teams developed data organizational <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> could be used for analyzing and interpreting data. During the "look" phase, grade level teams administered assessments and collected data. The study transitioned to the "think" phase in late fall 2013 by analyzing how data could be organized in a manner that provided teachers structure for interpreting and analyzing data, and into the "act" phase in the winter of 2014. The "act" phase consisted of developing four organizational <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> <b>grade</b> level teams used for interpreting and analyzing student data. The major outcome of the study was the development of data organizational <b>tools</b> <b>that</b> <b>grade</b> level teams were able to use to analyze and interpret student academic growth. Conclusions of this study include beginning with the "end in mind," that is first determining how data will be used, that teachers often lack the capacity to interpret data and need support in developing this capacity, and proactive leadership practices and the action research process itself are useful mechanisms for supporting teacher data use.

40|$|Assessment {{of program}} {{outcomes}} is an important, but time-consuming, {{part of the}} ABET accreditation process for faculty. Many faculty members argue, “I grade; therefore, I assess. ” The problem with using grades as assessment <b>tools</b> is <b>that</b> <b>grades</b> often cover material that represents more than one programmatic outcome. 1, 2 In addition, {{there may be a}} great deal of variability in assignment of grades, depending on which faculty member does the grading.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Last year, a revolutionary new idea was {{presented}} at the CAA conference introducing VorteX, a collaboration <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> allows fairer <b>grading</b> of group based assessments through its monitoring of group work, and the presentation of statistical information. Since that time, further research has been carried out at Aberystwyth to improve the effectiveness of group-based assessments, and to ultimately improve students results and learning. Although VorteX has helped students collaborate and work as a team, it has become apparent that there are still several issues when working in a group. As soon as students are monitored, it appears that many of the standard issues of team-working are overcome, in particular the problem of students not putting in their fair share of the effort. What is difficult to overcome is the clash of personalities and biased preconceptions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHistological {{grade is}} {{recognized}} as one of the strongest prognostic factors in operable breast cancer (BC). Although grade 1 and grade 3 tumours are biologically and clinically distinct, grade 2 tumours bear considerable difficulty in outcome prediction and planning therapies. Several attempts such as genomic grade index have been performed to subclassify grade 2 into two subgroups with clinical relevance. Here, we present evidence that the routinely evaluable immunohistochemical MIB 1 /Ki 67 labelling index (MIB-LI) can classify grade 2 tumours into two clinically distinct subgroups. In this study, growth fractions of 1, 550 primary operable invasive breast carcinomas were immunohistochemically assayed on full-face tissue sections using the MIB 1 clone of Ki- 67. Growth fractions were assessed as number of MIB 1 positive nuclei in 1, 000 tumour nuclei at high-power magnification and expressed as MIB 1 -LI. Using a 10 % cut-point of MIB 1 -LI, grade 2 BCs were classified into low (49. 8 %) and high (50. 2 %) proliferative subgroups. Univariate and multivariate survival analysis revealed statistically significant differences between these subgroups regarding patients' BC specific survival ( <  0. 001), and metastasis free survival ( <  0. 001) which was independent of the well-established prognostic factors (HR =  2. 944, 95 % CI =  1. 634 - 5. 303,  <  0. 001). In conclusion, our results further demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>grade</b> 2 BCs may represent at least two biological or behaviourally different entities. Assay of growth fraction in BC using MIB 1 /Ki 67 immunohistochemistry is a robust cost-effective diagnostic <b>tool</b> <b>that</b> subdivides <b>grade</b> 2 tumours into low and high risk populations providing additional prognostic information in planning therapies and outcome prediction...|$|R
