The {{objective}} of this workshop was to discuss current tools <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> for learning object-oriented concepts and to share ideas and experiences about the usage of computer support to teach the basic concepts of object technology. Workshop participants presented current and ongoing research. During the discussions the participants developed a general “package ” of requirements for such tools <b>and</b> <b>environments,</b> which underlying pedagogical approaches could be applied, and how such tools <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> should look like. ...|$|R

40|$|Women {{working in}} male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> face {{experiences}} that are unique to their counterparts in more gender-balanced and female-dominated professions. The nature of these experiences affects women’s integration and potential success in male- dominated professions. To enhance employment equity in historically male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments,</b> an understanding of women’s experiences in such environments is beneficial. The purpose {{of this research was}} to explore the challenges and coping strategies of women working within male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments.</b> This was an exploratory qualitative study conducted within the interpretive research paradigm. A purposive sample consisting of five women working in identified male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> was utilised. In-depth interviews were conducted and data was analysed using grounded theory. The main findings indicate that the central theme pertinent to women working in male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> pertains to the types of challenges inherent in their work settings. The main challenges found were as follows: discrimination and bias; physical and health-related difficulties experienced; negative emotions resulting from working in male-dominated environments; lack of real transformation; and work/life balance. This study provides current insight into the plight of women working in male-dominated professions <b>and</b> <b>environments</b> in South Africa. Industrial and Organisational PsychologyM. A.

5|$|Due to Nicole's {{atypical}} structure, {{the strongest}} thundershowers were well {{removed from the}} center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000residences. Extreme precipitation of up to 37.42inches (940mm) caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland <b>and</b> <b>environment,</b> which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $240million (2010USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteenfatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, Florida, and the Cayman Islands. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths.|$|E

The development team conducted extensive research, visiting historical American landmarks and analyzing classic Western films, to achieve realism while creating the game. The game's open world, set in New Austin, Nuevo Paraíso and West Elizabeth, represents iconic features of the American frontier, in which the game is set.|$|E
5|$|Several {{countries}} employ {{government agencies}} to provide forecasts and watches/warnings/advisories {{to the public}} in order to protect life and property and maintain commercial interests.

Traditionally, newspaper, television, and radio have been the primary outlets for presenting weather forecast information to the public. Increasingly, the internet is being used due to the vast amount of specific information that can be found. In all cases, these outlets update their forecasts on a regular basis.|$|E
