25|$|In 2009, The Stranger ran {{an article}} on Cantwell's {{opposition}} to {{the inclusion of a}} public option in the health-care reform plan. They reported that: “Seattle congressman Jim McDermott supports it. Washington senator Patty Murray wants it. So does President Barack Obama. So does the often conservative Seattle Times editorial page. So do 72 percent of Americans, according to <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>poll.</b> So what's going on with Washington's junior senator, Maria Cantwell? Why doesn't she want Congress to include a public option—a new government-run health-care plan that will be available to everyone and will compete with private insurance companies to bring down costs—in its health-care-reform package?” Cantwell cited her concerns with getting the bill through the United States Senate as the reason for her opposition.|$|E
25|$|Kurlantzick and Link {{noted that}} through {{cultivating}} {{economic growth and}} Chinese nationalism, the CCP has modernized authoritarianism to maintain their political control. They asserted that elite business leaders, who have benefited from China's economic growth, have accepted the CCP's authoritarian control as a result, largely preventing the new rich and emerging middle class from challenging their rule. Fenby argues that the latter, rather than accepting the system per se, have learnt {{to use it to}} their advantage. Kurlantzick and Link also noted that dissent still largely exists in the Chinese populace in regards to government policies on the economy, environment and society, particularly in rural areas, as they are becoming more aware of their constitutional rights. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>poll</b> in 2007 showed that 70% of Chinese consider the new rich to be corrupt and unworthy of respect.|$|E
25|$|This {{is often}} {{considered}} Buffalo's most famous rivalry. Though the Bills and Dolphins both {{originated in the}} American Football League, the Dolphins did not start playing until 1966 as an expansion team while the Bills {{were one of the}} original eight teams. The rivalry first gained prominence when the Dolphins won every match-up against the Bills in the 1970s for an NFL-record 20 straight wins against a single opponent. Fortunes changed in the following decades with the rise of Jim Kelly as Buffalo's franchise quarterback, and though Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino shared a competitive rivalry in the 1980s and 1990s, the Bills became dominant in the 1990s. Things have since cooled down after the retirements of Kelly and Marino {{and the rise of the}} Belichick/Brady-led Patriots, but Miami remains a fierce rival of the Bills, coming in second place in <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>poll</b> of Buffalo's primary rival. Miami leads the overall series 60-45-1, but Buffalo has the advantage in the playoffs at 3-1.|$|E
