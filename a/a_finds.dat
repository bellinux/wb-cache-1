5000|$|This theory {{states that}} Player A {{will be able}} to get payoff of higher than 40. Suppose Player <b>A</b> <b>finds</b> the {{induction}} argument convincing. He will decide how many periods at the end to play such a strategy, say 3. In periods 1-17, he will decide to always be aggressive against the choice of IN. If all of the potential competitors know this, it is unlikely potential competitors 1-17 will bother the chain store, thus risking the safe payout of 1 ("A" [...] will not retaliate if they choose [...] ""). If a few do test the chain store early in the game, and see that they are greeted with the aggressive strategy, the rest of the competitors are likely not to test any further. Assuming all 17 are deterred, Player A receives 91 (17×5 + 2×3). Even if as many as 10 competitors enter and test Player A's will, Player A will still receive a payoff of 41 (10×0+ 7×5 + 3×2), which is better than the induction (game theoretically correct) payoff.|$|E

However, Denzau and Kim (2006) argue that appropriate analysis of this issue requires focusing on trade sectors that are actually under the WTO’s purview. Denzau and Kim find that when the WTO-exempt oil sector is excluded, the WTO is found to significantly promote trade among its members. This paper extends the previous analysis by also excluding the agriculture and textile sectors; as a result, the WTO’s beneficial effect is even more pronounced, promoting trade by approximately 30 percent for its member countries...|$|E

In this event, the node which gets the LIVE message first checks its {{neighbour}} table.

30|$|Regarding {{empirical}} studies, Rodríguez (2010 <b>a)</b> <b>finds</b> {{evidence in}} favor of the presence of non-linearities in Peruvian GDP and of asymmetries in its cyclical component. In consequence, one could establish the existence of mixtures of normals in the trend level, in its growth rate, and in the cyclical component of output. One could even allow the presence of a mixture of normals in the measurement equation that would capture the effect of atypical output changes or outliers. For example, natural disasters that drastically affect the level of Peruvian output, and take place irregularly, would be mistakenly estimated within the cyclical component. However, according to Wada and Perron (2006), the inclusion of all disturbances as mixtures of normals implies an unstable estimation algorithm.|$|E
