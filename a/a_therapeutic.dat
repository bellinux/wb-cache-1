5|$|Adderall is {{available}} as immediate-release tablets or two different extended-release formulations. The extended-release capsules are generally {{used in the}} morning.

The longer extended-release formulation, approved for 16 hours, is available under the brand Mydayis. In the United States, the immediate and extended release (XR) formulations of Adderall are both available as generic drugs, while Mydayis is available only as a brand-name drug.|$|E

5|$|After an {{incident}} in 1951, where a US Army inductee attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide but recovered fully after presenting to a hospital and being treated with vitamin K (by then known as a specific antidote), studies began {{in the use of}} warfarin as <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic</b> anticoagulant. It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol, and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans. An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower, who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955.|$|E

He lived at the Parkway Garden Homes, located in the Washington Park neighborhood on the city's South Side. Keef is estranged from his biological father; {{when he was a}} minor, Keef's legal guardian was his grandmother, whom he lived with during his residence in Chicago. He began rapping at a very young age, regularly listed as 5, using his mother's karaoke machine and blank tapes to record his music. During his childhood, Keef attended Dulles Elementary School and the Banner School, <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic</b> day school. Keef dropped out of Dyett High School at age 15.|$|E

50|$|This {{effect of}} protein binding is most {{significant}} with {{drugs that are}} highly protein-bound (>95%) and have <b>a</b> low <b>therapeutic</b> index, such as warfarin. <b>A</b> low <b>therapeutic</b> index indicates {{that there is a}} high risk of toxicity when using the drug. Since warfarin is an anticoagulant with <b>a</b> low <b>therapeutic</b> index, warfarin may cause bleeding if the correct degree of pharmacologic effect is not maintained. If a patient on warfarin takes another drug that displaces warfarin from plasma protein, such as a sulfonamide antibiotic, it could result in an increased risk of bleeding.|$|R

5|$|Follow-ups of {{untreated}} {{people over}} thirty {{with a history}} of severe allergic reactions would greatly benefit from venom immunotherapy. Both rapid and slow doses can be done safely during immunotherapy. The efficacy (capacity to induce <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic</b> effect) of ant venom immunotherapy is effective in reducing systemic reactions in comparison to placebo and whole body extract immunotherapy, where patients were more likely to suffer from a systemic reaction. Ultrarush initiation of insect immunotherapy may be used, but results show higher risks of allergic reactions. Despite immunotherapy being successful, only ten percent of patients do not have any response to desensitisation.|$|E
5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic.</b>|$|E

5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic</b> Christmas meal together.|$|E
5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (higher proportion of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (higher proportion of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of <b>a</b> <b>therapeutic</b> INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
