5|$|Brown {{had also}} speculated that Persephone, {{the wife of}} the god Pluto, would be a good name for the object. The name had been used several times in science fiction, and was popular with the public, having handily won a poll {{conducted}} by New Scientist magazine ("Xena", despite only being a nickname, came fourth). This was not possible once the object was classified as a dwarf planet, because there is <b>already</b> <b>an</b> asteroid with that name, 399 Persephone.|$|E
5|$|Canavan captained Tyrone to two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championships {{titles in}} 1991 and 1992, having {{been on the}} team which lost the 1990 final, again to Kerry. In four years as an Under 21 player, Canavan scored 13–53 (13 goals and 53 points—each goal equals 3 points; 13×3 + 53 = 92 points, see GAA scoring rules) for Tyrone. By {{the time he was}} twenty, he was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> {{automatic}} choice in the senior panel.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{became the}} {{administrative}} centre for the earldom {{and was used}} by Robert's court. There was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> existing market held at nearby St Stephen's church by the local canons, but Robert appropriated it and moved the market to outside his new castle, intending {{to profit from the}} trade. A watermill was built to the south-west of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The {{portable}} electric {{fire engine}} would be efficient and practical only if {{a supply of}} electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against {{the high cost of}} such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{discrepancy}} {{regarding the}} number of children born to Richard and Hetty Hawes. Harrison claims that the couple had two children, while Neace and Harned mention four sons. The 1850 census showed six Hawes children living in the household: four sons and two daughters. This did not include James Morrison Hawes, who was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> instructor at the United States Military Academy by 1850.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Brock {{joined the}} 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot on 8 March 1785 with the rank of ensign, and was likely given {{responsibility}} for the regimental colours. His elder brother John was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> officer in the same regiment. As was usual at the time, Brock's commission was purchased. On 16 January 1790 he bought the rank of lieutenant and later that year he raised his own company of men. As a result, {{he was promoted to}} captain (of an independent company of foot) on 27 January 1791 and transferred to the 49th (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot on 15 June 1791.|$|E
5|$|Bosworth's {{first film}} role came after an open casting call in New York for the {{supporting}} part of Judith in the 1998 film, The Horse Whisperer. The film's producers needed {{someone who was}} <b>already</b> <b>an</b> experienced horse rider, leading to Bosworth's successful audition for the role. The film received positive reception from film critics. In 2000, she starred in the television series drama Young Americans, in which she played Bella Banks. The series, however, was canceled. That same year, she had a small part in the film Remember the Titans. In 2001, Bosworth moved to Los Angeles in hopes of obtaining easier access to auditions and better film parts.|$|E
5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{was built}} by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, in the manor of Acre during the 1070s. William was a Norman lord who had {{accompanied}} William the Conqueror in the conquest of England in 1066; he was rewarded with extensive estates across England. Acre was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon estate centre {{and at the time}} of the invasion was owned by a wealthy man called Toki, but he was quickly replaced by Frederick, a Flemish lord and William's brother-in-law. When Frederick died around 1070, William acquired control of the manor, which formed part of his massive land holdings across the region.|$|E

5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was {{considered}} a prodigy who rose to stardom despite not starting ballet {{until the age of}} 13. By age 15, her mother and ballet teachers, who were serving as her custodial guardians, fought a custody battle over her. Meanwhile, Copeland, who was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> award-winning dancer, was fielding professional offers. The 1998 legal issues involved filings for emancipation by Copeland and restraining orders by her mother. Both sides dropped legal proceedings, and Copeland moved home to begin studying under a new teacher who was a former ABT member.|$|E
5|$|Dev Gill was {{selected}} to portray the film's antagonist. Rajamouli was criticised for selecting him considering Gill's previous film, Krishnarjuna (2008), but remained adamant about casting him. He {{said that he had}} to cast a good looking man as the film's villain because the heroine needed to find him trustworthy. For this film, Gill had to practice horse riding in Ramoji Film City; Ram Charan was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> experienced equestrian. Srihari was cast in his role in the film in early April 2008. Kim Sharma {{was selected}} to perform one of the two item numbers in the film in early June 2008. Saloni Aswani made a cameo appearance in the film and shot for three days. She was subsequently signed for Rajamouli's next project, Maryada Ramanna (2010), before Magadheera was even released.|$|E

5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 {{inscription}} from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying {{that he was}} <b>already</b> <b>an</b> adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E
5|$|He knew {{he wanted}} to become a {{professional}} wrestler at the age of twelve and said he performed a wrestling routine in his high school's talent show, complete with fake blood. Hickenbottom was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> athlete; his career began at the age of six when he started playing football. He was a stand-out linebacker at Randolph High School on Randolph Air Force Base and eventually became captain of the football team. After graduating, Hickenbottom attended Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, but soon realized that college life was not for him. He then began pursuing a career in professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|John was {{eldest son}} of {{the founder of the}} Angelos line, Constantine Angelos from Philadelphia, by Theodora Komnene, the seventh child of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (ruled 1081–1118) and Empress Irene Doukaina. The couple, who married in 1110/15, had four sons and three daughters, of whom two, John and Andronikos (the father of the future {{emperors}} Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos), preferred to use their grandmother's far more prestigious surname of Doukas to their father's surname. The date of John's birth is unknown, and the only reference to his age is that in 1185 he was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> old man. The genealogist of the Komnenian family, Konstantinos Varzos, put his birth date approximately in 1125/27.|$|E

5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, {{then he would have}} been born circa 1346–1348, as he was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} a few years before Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. <b>Already</b> <b>an</b> artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, were already in Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique. She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October.|$|E
5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia (which was <b>already</b> <b>an</b> entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, wines and olives grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E
