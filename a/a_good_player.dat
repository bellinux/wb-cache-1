5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered a masculine instrument. To be considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player,</b> one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{is also a}} good dribbler. This is due to his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson said that he would only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the {{remainder}} of his career, Năstase steadily declined and only occasionally defeated <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player,</b> such as Johan Kriek in the third round of the 1982 US Open.

25|$|Ken Taylor (born Kenneth Taylor, 21 August 1935, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England) is an English former cricketer, {{who played}} in three Tests for England from 1959 to 1964. He also played {{first-class}} cricket for Yorkshire. He was renowned as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> of spin {{and was one of}} the best cover fielders of his generation, while his medium pace 'darts' broke many a stubborn partnership for his county captains, Vic Wilson and Brian Close.|$|E
25|$|Flower {{was born}} in Cape Town, South Africa, and {{starting}} from his high school days at Oriel Boys' High School and Vainona High School played {{most of his career}} alongside his younger brother Grant Flower. He is considered {{to be one of the}} best wicket-keeper batsmen, alongside players such as Australian Adam Gilchrist. Flower made his international debut in a One Day International against Sri Lanka at New Plymouth, New Zealand, in the 1992 Cricket World Cup. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> of spin, he made 550 runs in a Test series against India in 2000/01. This tally came in just four innings and he was only dismissed twice. He is one of the few players to score a century on ODI debut.|$|E

After good form against Zimbabwe and in domestic, he got an ODI cap and scored 43 not out; he also took 2–26 in 6 overs. Together he and Bilawal Bhatti defeated South Africa. He also made a fine 41 not out in an ODI against Sri Lanka and took a wicket in the match. Only in his first One Day International, Anwar Ali promised to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> as {{he was able to}} win the Man Of The Match award.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the great}} {{strengths}} of the team was its plentiful all-rounders, apart from Keith Miller, there was Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and the wicketkeeper Don Tallon. Lindwall took to fast bowling after seeing Harold Larwood as a boy, but was a strong striker of the ball and a menace to parked cars in grade cricket. In the Third Test he hit exactly 100 off 90 balls with 14 fours and a six and added 154 {{in an hour and}} a half with Tallon, whose 92 off 108 balls with 10 fours was the highest score by an Australian wicketkeeper until Rod Marsh made 132 against New Zealand in 1973–74. Like Tallon Ian Johnson never quite batted as well as expected, but topped the averages in the 1954-55 Ashes series by making 116 runs (58.00). McCool made 95 in the First Test and 104 not out in the Third, when he came in at 188/5 and dominated the strike. He was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> of spin with wristy cuts and vigorous hooks.|$|E
25|$|Having {{overcome}} initial {{reservations about}} leaving {{his wife and}} newly-born son, Hobbs accepted the invitation but throughout the voyage to Australia was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which was to afflict him throughout his life. To allow him to recover from his illness upon arrival in Australia, Hobbs missed {{the first two games}} of the tour, but once recovered, he played in only two of the remaining four fixtures before the Test series began. Hobbs later expressed the belief that the MCC captain, Arthur Jones was instrumental in his omission from the team as he did not rate Hobbs <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player.</b> He also believed that Jones did not {{give him a chance to}} prove himself. But Hobbs failed with the bat on his two appearances and was subsequently left out of the team for the first Test match. Even when Jones was taken ill before the game started, George Gunn, not a member of the touring team but present in Australia, was preferred to Hobbs and scored a century in the game. However, England lost the game and the performance of the amateur wicketkeeper and makeshift opening batsman Dick Young was singled out as detrimental to the team. Following effective batting performances by Hobbs in two matches after the Test, Frederick Fane, the stand-in England captain, chose Hobbs to open the batting in the second Test. He made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at Melbourne. He went in to bat on the second day after Australia had scored 266; in 182 minutes, he scored 83 runs in his first innings and although he batted more slowly than usual, critics praised his defence. Eventually, England needed 282 to win. Hobbs and Fane added 54 for the first wicket; before Hobbs fell for 28 but England went on to win the match by one wicket.|$|E

500|$|He {{prefers to}} receive {{the ball in the}} air, because he can always beat smaller players in the air but they can take {{advantage}} of better acceleration and quicker reactions on the ground. According to David Pleat, a major factor in Birmingham's 2011 League Cup win was [...] "telling him to do what he does best and flick the ball on with his head from direct diagonal balls played from both wings". Nevertheless, he is technically competent, scoring goals with his feet and providing assists for others. A 2009 feature in Mundo Deportivo assessed Žigić as one of those few tall players with a good touch on the ball, and in 2010, German international defender Per Mertesacker described him as [...] "technically <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> and very smart tactically".|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1890 season, Dunlap engaged in {{protracted}} salary negotiations with President Nimick of the Alleghenies. In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play with us this season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ...

Broderick was initially asked by Mustaine's management company at the end of 2007 if he would be interested in auditioning for Megadeth. After an informal meeting at Mustaine's house, Broderick was introduced as the band's new guitarist. Mustaine complimented Broderick's playing skills and called him [...] "the best guitarist Megadeth has ever had". Broderick's former Nevermore bandmate, Van Williams, congratulated Megadeth on [...] "getting one hell of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player,</b> more importantly they're getting a great guy to hang out with and a true friend".|$|E

500|$|Having {{just been}} {{released}} from Burnley, Pugh signed for League Two club Bury on a short-term contract on 23 March 2006, following a three-week trial. Bury were entangled in a relegation battle, and Pugh made his debut two days later after coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Lewis Gobern in a 2–1 home win over Rochdale. He marked his first start for Bury with a goal from 10yards in a 1–1 away draw with Lincoln City on 15 April 2006, after which manager Chris Casper commented [...] "Mark's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> and he's got a bright future if he keeps {{his feet on the}} ground". He finished the 2005–06 season by playing six matches and scoring one goal for the club. As a result of his good performances, and helped by the fact that Bury had survived relegation in 19th place, Bury manager Chris Casper offered him a new one-year contract at Gigg Lane; his first professional contract.|$|E
500|$|On 13 January 2012 Walker joined Scunthorpe United on a one-month {{emergency}} loan deal. Walker's move to Scunthorpe United permanently {{was changed}} to Loan because Fifa's rules which mean players can only play for two clubs in a season apply for standard but not emergency loans. Walker scored on his debut for Scunthorpe United in a 1–1 draw against Colchester United. His debut impressed manager Alan Knill and he told the club official website: [...] "Josh is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> and fits in well in there. We lost [...] Oliver Norwood, but we have Josh, who {{is a bit more}} streetwise and very good on the ball." [...] On 18 February, Walker scored his second goal and set up a goal for Jon Parkin in a 3–1 win over Leyton Orient. On 20 February, Walker extended his loan spell at Scunthorpe for another month after making five appearances and scoring twice. On 6 March, Walker provided a double assist in the late second half for David Mirfin and Garry Thompson respectively in a 2–1 win over Oldham Athletic. On 31 March, Walker scored his third goal and set up a goal for Jordan Robertson in a 4–1 win over Chesterfield.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, after {{returning}} to Leeds, new Leeds owner Massimo Cellino revealed that Morison would be fully in Dave Hockaday's plans for the following season, describing that [...] "he needs to show if he's still <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>player</b> because he used to be." [...] On 1 August, Morison was assigned the Leeds number 19 shirt for the 2014–15 season, with Morison's previous shirt number going to teammate Matt Smith. Morison missed the opening {{games of the season}} through injury, making his first league appearance for Leeds in over a year as a substitute against Huddersfield Town on 20 September. On 25 October 2014, Morison was named in Leeds' starting 11 {{for the first time in}} 18 months for the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, replacing the suspended Souleymane Doukara. The match proved to be Darko Milanic's last match as head coach. On 19 April 2015, Morison scored his first goal for Leeds since March 2013, when he scored a volley in a 2–1 loss against Charlton Athletic. After scoring against Charlton, Morison followed this up by scoring in the consecutive game on 25 April in a 2–1 win against Yorkshire rivals Sheffield Wednesday. It would have been three goals in three games if his goal against Rotherham hadn't been wrongly called offside. He started off the 2015/16 pre season in good form, scoring against Harrogate Town on 10 July 2015, and then scoring against Eintracht Frankfurt in a 2–1 defeat on 21 July 2015. On 31 July 2015, Morison was given the number 20 shirt for the upcoming 2015/16 season.|$|E

Hyphen wrote that Whitlock [...] "reinforced the insipid and insidious 'small Asian penis' stereotype". The Asian American Journalists Association demanded an apology. [...] "I debased a feel-good sports moment. For that, I'm truly sorry," [...] apologized Whitlock.

[...] NBCNewYork.com in response to Mayweather noted that [...] "no one of any skin color in the history of basketball has done in their first four starts what Lin pulled off for the Knicks last week." [...] On February 15, the MSG Network during game coverage showed a fan's sign of Lin's face above a fortune cookie with the words [...] "The Knicks Good Fortune", which some viewed as an ethnic stereotype. Sporting News wrote that the sign was [...] "questionable", while CBS News called it [...] "distasteful". Some Knicks teammates were criticized for bowing to Lin during games. On February 17, ESPN used a racial slur on its mobile website in the headline [...] "Chink in the Armor" [...] after Lin had nine turnovers in New York's loss to the Hornets. It was removed 35minutes later, and ESPN apologized. The network fired the employee who posted the headline, and suspended ESPNews anchor Max Bretos for using the same reference earlier in the week. Bretos also apologized. Knicks radio announcer Spero Dedes also used the phrase on 1050 ESPN New York, but he was an employee of Madison Square Garden (MSG) and not ESPN.
