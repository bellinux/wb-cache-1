500|$|With {{respect to}} the <b>arbitration</b> <b>decision</b> itself, Mamatey writes that [...] "On 25 March, to {{expedite}} {{the work of the}} peace conference, the Council of Ten was divided into the Council of Four (The [...] "Big Four") and the Council of Five (the foreign ministers). Early in April the two councils considered and approved the recommendations of the Czechoslovak commission without a change– with the exception of Teschen, which they referred to Poland and Czechoslovakia to settle in bilateral negotiations." [...] When the Polish-Czechoslovak negotiations failed, the Allied powers proposed plebiscites in the Cieszyn Silesia and also in the border districts of Orava and Spiš (now in Slovakia) to which the Poles had raised claims. In the end, however, no plebiscites were held due to the rising mutual hostilities of Czechs and Poles in Cieszyn Silesia. Instead, on 28 July 1920 the Spa Conference (also known as the Conference of Ambassadors) divided each of the three disputed areas between Poland and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to adhere to Wikipedia policy, Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee decided on May 28, 2009, to {{restrict}} editing from Scientology organization IP addresses {{in order to prevent}} self-serving edits by editors within Church of Scientology-administered networks. The decision accorded Scientology-controlled IP addresses the same blockable status as open proxies on the site. Ten members of the Arbitration Committee voted in favor of the ruling, thus preventing such users from editing existing articles or creating new articles on the site. Wikipedia previously frequently had banned individual users from the site, but not entire organizations. The <b>Arbitration</b> <b>decision</b> came as the culmination of a [...] "longstanding struggle" [...] involving promoters of the organization and critics of its practices. ABC News noted the conflict was [...] "one of the longest-running disputes in Wikipedia's history". The conflict involved over 400 articles within the topic of Scientology. It was the fourth such Arbitration Case before Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee on the topic of Scientology in the prior four years. The case was drawn out for six months, prior to the decision of the Arbitration Committee.|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the analysis of}} 935 unfair dismissal <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from 2000 to 2005. It explores whether gender effects {{were present in the}} <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions,</b> and whether dismissed employees received different <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> according to firmographic factors of industry sector, size of firm, occupational skill and HR expertise. The study shows major findings supporting the role of HR expertise in lowering the favourability towards grievants. In terms of gender effects a logistic regression analysis suggests two interesting effects, aligned with bivariate analysis, which suggested male arbitrators were associated with favourable decisions toward female workers and female arbitrators were associated with favourable decisions toward low skilled grievants. Such findings support our typology which positions male arbitrators as paternalistic and chivalrous, and female arbitrators as path breaking. These findings have implications for HR/IR professionals, unions, industry bodies and government policy and legislation in terms of how we manage sections of our workforce and protect vulnerable workers...|$|R

40|$|One {{may wonder}} what <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> are being reached by our Federal {{industrial}} arbitrators, given the constant debate among social commentators {{that a number}} of tribunal appointments to the AIRC and now FWA are a reflection of the appointing government’s ideological bias. This debate is underpinned by a general perception that arbitrators with union backgrounds will tend to favour the interests of workers and vice versa for appointees with an employer background. This chapter addresses the potential for bias to occur in the arbitration setting and identifies existing safeguards that aim to limit bias occurring in Australia’s Federal tribunal. The nature of the ‘stacking’ debate is described before examining unfair dismissal <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> of the AIRC to consider if this ongoing debate has any foundation. The results reveal a mildly significant association between the work background of the members and their substantive <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> – however, this result is to be interpreted with caution as decisions are influenced by a range of explanatory factors. The most recent appointment to FWA was secured via a job application process, which is to be applauded but further steps could be taken to improve the public perception. ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with ABC News, sociologist of the University of Alberta, Stephen A. Kent commented, [...] "Historically, Scientology has tried to control what critics say about it.

Scientology can't roll over and give up on this issue. It will continue to attempt to have its representation." [...] Evgeny Morozov of Foreign Policy wrote a blog post critical of the <b>Arbitration</b> <b>decision,</b> and stated, [...] "I am no fan of Scientology, but I think that banning them from Wikipedia is going to be counterproductive. Unfortunately, it presents the Wikipedia admins/editors as a non-neutral group that opposes a particular set of ideas." [...] In an August 2010 article in The Guardian, journalists Rachel Shabi and Jemima Kiss observed, [...] "Editors can remain anonymous when changing content, but conflicts are passed to Wikipedia's arbitration committee. Scientology was a regular source of conflict until the committee blocked editing by the movement." ...|$|E

[...] She characterized the Arbitration Committee decision as [...] "a routine internal action by Wikipedia to clean up its editing process". Pouw emphasized, [...] "More importantly is the fact that Wikipedia finally banned those who were engaged in unobjective and biased editing for the purposes of antagonism as opposed to providing accurate information." [...] Pouw commented to ABC News, [...] "People have conflicts on Wikipedia all the time, and it's obvious why [...] anybody can post." [...] Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Pouw's statements, [...] " [...] says her organization regularly monitors the Internet for wrong information about its belief system and members. After this ruling, Pouw says there remain 'gross inaccuracies' on the Scientology article on Wikipedia that she hopes will eventually be corrected. But for the time being, her group's ability to do that have been weakened." [...] In a statement to CNN, Pouw asserted [...] "she is unaware of any coordinated effort to alter Wikipedia".|$|E
500|$|Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the decision, and commented to The New York Times that due to the controversial nature of the case, the decision was crafted so as not to focus directly upon any particular individual. Wikipedia media contact Dan Rosenthal emphasized in a statement to ABC News that it was generally accepted procedure on the site to ban users that had violated policy intended to prevent them from promoting propaganda. Wikimedia Foundation spokesman and head of communications Jay Walsh said to Bloomberg BusinessWeek the <b>Arbitration</b> <b>decision</b> was intended to help restore Scientology-related articles to an acceptable state on the site. Wikimedia Germany spokesperson Catrin Schoneville stated to Computerwoche that the decision impacted the English Wikipedia, and noted it was unclear whether a similar ruling might be applied to the German Wikipedia. Statements from Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw labelled the Arbitration ruling as a routine matter, and maintained there were still [...] "gross inaccuracies" [...] on the Scientology article. In a statement to CNN, Pouw denied the presence of an organized campaign by the Church of Scientology to manipulate Wikipedia. Scientology representative Tommy Davis emphasized to the St. Petersburg Times that users critical of the organization were also banned, and similarly denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia.|$|E

500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to send the message that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the <b>Arbitration</b> <b>decision</b> included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This study {{identifies}} {{statistically significant}} associations between unfair dismissal <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> and inherent characteristics {{pertaining to the}} unfair dismissal claims.

This research contributes {{to the body of}} knowledge on grievance activity within the workplace. It focuses specifically on arbitrated grievances and as such, AIRC unfair dismissal decisions are investigated as an exemplar of arbitrated grievance activity. This study is within an Australian context which may limit its world-wide generalisability but its strength is that it addresses across industry and across occupational data.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{a new set}} of data on {{the decisions}} of conventional arbitrators. The main goal is to draw inferences {{about the extent to which}} conventional <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions</b> are fashioned as mechanical compromises of the parties' final offers, without reference to the exogenous facts involved in different disputes. The results of the analysis are remarkably clear: conventional arbitrators tend to split-the-difference between the parties' final offers with virtually no evidence of additional systematic reference to the facts of the cases. However, since there is a substantial amount of unexplained variance in the <b>arbitration</b> <b>decisions,</b> this evidence of mechanical compromise behavior should be viewed as characterizing the overall operation of conventional arbitration mechanisms and not the behavior of individual arbitrators in any particular case. Indeed, the results are consistent with the view that individual arbitrators pay close attention to the facts of the cases, but that there is considerable variation in the structure of different arbitrators' preference functions. ...|$|R
