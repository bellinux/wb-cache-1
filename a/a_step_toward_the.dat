25|$|The {{period of}} the Helvetic Republic is still very {{controversial}} within Switzerland. It represents {{the first time that}} Switzerland as a unified country existed and <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> modern federal state. For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden {{it was a time of}} military defeat followed by occupation. In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, {{he finally}} {{achieved}} electoral success {{as one of}} only three Democrats elected to the Washington State Senate, which then had 42 members. Crossing the aisle, he became the leader of progressive Republicans, and successfully built support for the direct primary law of 1907. As a legislator, he also backed the Lake Washington Ship Canal and helped preserve shorelines for the University of Washington and for city parks. He backed local option as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> prohibition of alcohol and drafted an amendment to the state constitution that granted women the right to vote in 1910, a decade ahead of the country at large. He was also instrumental in passing the law that allowed formation of port districts. The workman's compensation law he helped to write became a national model.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "new" [...] {{perspective}} has, by and large, been {{an internal}} debate among Protestant scholars. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox writers have generally responded favorably to new-perspective ideas, seeing both a greater commonality {{with their own}} beliefs and strong similarities with the views {{of many of the}} early Church Fathers. From a Catholic point of view, the [...] "new" [...] perspective is seen as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> progressive reality of human salvation in Christ. Moreover, passages in the works of many early Church Fathers show that new-perspective-style interpretations were widely held among them.|$|E

2500|$|Brown {{argues that}} Luther's {{personality}} was based partly upon anal fantasies and that Luther achieved {{some of his}} spiritual breakthroughs while defecating. Brown suggests numerous similarities between Lutheran Protestantism and psychoanalysis. He also provides a study of Jonathan Swift, in which he denounces attempts to conceal Swift's interest in scatology and [...] "housebreak this tiger of English literature." [...] He is especially critical of Aldous Huxley and John Middleton Murry for their treatment of Swift. While giving Huxley and Murry credit for calling attention to Swift's [...] "hatred of the bowels", he deplores their reduction of the theme to Swift's personal psychopathology and failure to see that Swift was calling attention to something significant. In the last chapter, Brown advocates [...] "dialectical consciousness" [...] as <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> creation of a [...] "Dionysian ego".|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} marked <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> city's potential {{bid for the}} 2020 Summer Olympics. Detroit {{has made}} the Summer Olympic Games' final bidding election more often than any other ultimately unsuccessful bid city, participating in IOC elections for the 1944 (3rd place, behind bid winner London), 1952 (5th place), 1956 (4th place), 1960 (3rd place), 1964 (2nd place), 1968 (2nd place) and 1972 (4th place) Games. (Los Angeles has made more total bids with nine, but hosted twice) If accepted as the U.S. candidate by USOC, {{this would be the}} city's eighth bid. Lowered crime figures improve Detroit's prospects for the USOC competition. Soft-drink manufacturer Faygo has stepped up its efforts as major sponsor. [...] Successful events such as Super Bowl XL have showcased Detroit as a city accustomed to hosting supersized crowds.|$|E
2500|$|His {{foray into}} {{national}} politics {{appears to be}} a catalyst for this change; when he established the Moral Majority which joined [...] "Bible Christians" [...] (Independent and conservative Southern Baptists) in a political alliance with Charismatics, Roman Catholics, Jews, Mormons and others he rejected the level of separation preached by most movement Fundamentalists. Bob Jones University declared the Moral Majority organization [...] "Satanic", holding that it was <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> apostate one-world church and government body as it would cross the line from a political alliance to a religious one between true Christians and the non-born-again, as forbidden by their interpretation of the Bible. David Cloud's Way of Life Literature also criticizes Falwell for associations with Catholics, Pentecostals and liberal Christians, tracing his alleged [...] "apostasy" [...] back to his role in the political Religious Right.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese historians {{write of}} Tibetans heroically {{opposing}} the British out of loyalty not to Tibet, but to China. [...] They {{assert that the}} British troops looted and burned, and that the British interest in trade relations was a pretext for annexing Tibet, <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> ultimate goal of annexing all of China. They assert also that the Tibetans destroyed the British forces, and that Younghusband escaped only with a small retinue. The Chinese government has turned Gyantze Dzong into a [...] "Resistance Against the British Museum", promoting these views, {{as well as other}} themes such as the brutal life endured by Tibetan serfs who fiercely loved their motherland. China also treats the invasion as part of its [...] "century of humiliation" [...] at the hands of Western and Japanese powers and the defence as a Chinese resistance, while many Tibetans look back to it as an exercise of Tibetan self-defence and an act of independence from the Qing dynasty as the dynasty was falling apart.|$|E
