5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the <b>acron,</b> which carries the eyes, with {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired appendages, while segment one is lost during the embryo's development. Segment two has a pair of chelicerae, small appendages that often form pincers, segment three has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four cephalothorax segments have pairs of legs. In primitive forms the <b>acron</b> has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, even {{allowing}} for this possibility, {{the complexity of}} the anterior part of the brain, which even if the <b>acron</b> concept is incorrect may still have been inherited from very basal animals; untangling the new characters evolved by the earliest arthropods from those inherited from their ancestors therefore still stands centrally in the arthropod head problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} the {{arthropod}} head must contain an acronal remnant has been shaken by the relatively recent revision of protostome phylogeny, which has dismantled the Articulata and placed the arthropods together {{with a group of}} unsegmented worms {{often referred to as the}} Cycloneuralia in the so-called Ecdysozoa. All members of the Ecdysozoa are direct developers without a trochophore, and the cycloneuralians have terminal mouths. As a result, the idea of the arthropods having inherited a preoral <b>acron</b> from their ancestors seems less likely.|$|E
25|$|The {{arthropod}} head {{problem has}} until recently been {{predicated on the}} Articulata theory, i.e. that the arthropods and annelids are close relatives. Although arthropods are essentially direct developers that do not possess a trochophore-like larva, the annelids do. During annelid metamorphosis, segments are added close to the posterior of the body, behind the mouth; whereas the brain {{is derived from the}} episphere or region in front of the mouth. Recognition of this led to the concept of a primary, non-segmental component of the body in annelids known as the <b>acron</b> being developed, from which the brain is ultimately derived. Because the arthropod and annelid heads, {{in the light of the}} Articulata theory, were assumed to be structurally homologous in some way, the arthropod head was also often considered to incorporate a non-segmental acronal component. Taking the homology between annelid and arthropod heads at face value, Swedish workers such as Hanström and Holmgren assumed that a large part of the arthropod head must correspond to the <b>acron,</b> a view followed later by several prominent American insect workers such as Butt and Snodgrass. They proposed that all pre-oral structures in insects were non-segmental, although such a view is at odds with the preoral position of apparently bona fide appendages such as the antennae. A less extreme set of theories propose that only the protocerebrum and associated structures should be considered to be acronal.|$|E
2500|$|Fuxianhuia {{was first}} {{described}} from incomplete material, and its true nature {{did not become}} apparent until the head and limbs were discovered. [...] Its articulated head region, lack of tergite-segment correspondence and undifferentiated limbs have all been taken to indicate a very basal position in the arthropods, even though an early cladistic analysis suggested, rather, {{that it was a}} stem-group chelicerate. [...] The presence of a distinct anterior sclerite bearing the eyes has been taken to suggest that a distinct <b>acron</b> once existed in front of the euarthropod head.|$|E
2500|$|Jupiter Feretrius, {{who carries}} away {{the spoils of}} war". Feretrius was called upon to witness solemn oaths. The epithet or [...] "numen" [...] is {{probably}} connected with the verb ferire, [...] "to strike," [...] referring to a ritual striking of ritual as illustrated in foedus ferire, of which the silex, a quartz rock, is evidence in his temple on the Capitoline hill, which {{is said to have}} been the first temple in Rome, erected and dedicated by Romulus to commemorate his winning of the spolia opima from <b>Acron,</b> king of the Caeninenses, and to serve as a repository for them. Iuppiter Feretrius was therefore equivalent to Iuppiter Lapis, the latter used for a specially solemn oath. According to Livy I 10, 5 and Plutarch Marcellus 8 though, the meaning of this epithet is related to the peculiar frame used to carry the spolia opima to the god, the feretrum, itself from verb fero, ...|$|E
2500|$|The site of Caenina has not {{yet been}} {{identified}} with certainty. It may have been located near present-day [...] "La Rustica" [...] close to the Anio river, on a trade route connecting Latium with Etruria and Campania. Festus states it was close to the old Roman settlement. It was originally a settlement of the Sicels, as was Antemnae, who were later expelled by the Aborigenes. [...] Dionysius records a tradition according to which Romulus was at Caenina for a sacrifice during the festival of the Lupercalia, which was the occasion of the abduction of Remus by Numitor's shepherds. The town underwent synoecism and some of its cults and [...] priests (sacerdotes) were transferred to Rome by Romulus, who celebrated his first triumph after conquering the Caeninenses and killing their king, <b>Acron.</b> However, according to Dionysius, Romulus allowed the Caeninenses to continue to live in their hometown, although they had to accept a colony of three hundred Romans and the allotment to them of one third of their land. The town is still mentioned {{at the beginning of the}} Republic: the Vindicius who revealed the plot of the Aquilii to Publius Valerius Publicola [...] was a slave from Caenina captured in war.|$|E
2500|$|After he {{left the}} Academy, a [...] few {{important}} commissions came to him. The French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, asked him to decorate rooms of the Monte Cavallo Palace, a former papal residence, for an expected visit of Napoleon. Ingres painted a large-scale Romulus' Victory Over <b>Acron</b> (1811) for the salon of the Empress and The Dream of Ossian (1813), based on a book of poems that Napoleon admired, for {{the ceiling of the}} Emperor's bedroom. General Miollis also commissioned Ingres to paint Virgil reading the Aeneid (1812) for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini. The painting showed the moment when Virgil predicted the death of Marcellus, the son of Livia, causing Livia to faint. The interior was precisely depicted, following the archeological finds at Pompeii. As he often did, Ingres made several versions of the same scene: a three-figure fragment cut from an abandoned version is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in 1832 he made a drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving by Pradier. The version General Miollis owned was repurchased by Ingres in the 1830s, reworked by assistants under Ingres's direction, and never finished; The Dream of Ossian was likewise repurchased, modified, and left unfinished.|$|E
60|$|The {{interest}} {{which would}} be naturally felt by such an encounter, was increased very much by the strong contrast that was observed in {{the appearance of the}} warriors. Romulus was very young, and though tall and athletic in form, his countenance exhibited still the expression of softness and delicacy characteristic of youth. <b>Acron,</b> on the other hand, was a war-worn veteran, rugged, hardy, and stern; and the throngs of martial spectators that surrounded the field, when they saw the combatants as they came forward to engage, anticipated a very unequal contest. Romulus was nevertheless victorious. As he went into the battle, he made a vow to Jupiter, that if he conquered his foe, he would ascribe to the god all the glory of the victory, and he would set up the arms and spoils of <b>Acron</b> at Rome, as a trophy sacred to Jupiter, in honor of the divine aid through which the conquest should be achieved. It was in consequence of this vow, as the old historians say, that Romulus prevailed in the combat. At all events, he did prevail. <b>Acron</b> was slain, and while Romulus was stripping the fallen body of its armor on the field, his men were pursuing the army of <b>Acron,</b> for the soldiers fled in dismay toward their city, as soon as they saw that the single combat had gone against their king.|$|E
60|$|So he {{gathered}} together a rude and half-organized army, and advanced toward Rome. Romulus, {{who had been}} informed of his plans and preparations, went out to meet him. The two armies came in view of each other on an open plain, {{not far from the}} city. Romulus advanced at the head of his troops, while <b>Acron</b> appeared likewise in the fore-front of the invaders. After uttering in the hearing of each other, and of the assembled armies, various exclamations of challenge and defiance, it was at length agreed that the question at issue should be decided by single combat, the two commanders themselves to be the champions. Romulus and <b>Acron</b> accordingly advanced {{into the middle of the}} field, while their armies drew up around them, forming a sort of ring within which the combatants were to engage.|$|E
60|$|While the {{negotiations}} with the Sabines were still pending, Romulus became involved in another difficulty, which for a time assumed a very threatening aspect. This difficulty was a war which broke out, somewhat suddenly, in consequence of {{the invasion of the}} Roman territories by a neighboring chieftain named <b>Acron.</b> <b>Acron</b> was the sovereign of a small state, whose capital was a town called Cænina.[F] This Cænina is supposed to have been only four or five miles distant from Romulus's city,--a fact which shows very clearly on how small a scale the deeds and exploits connected with the first foundation of the great empire, which afterward became so extended and so renowned, were originally performed, and how intrinsically insignificant they were, in themselves, though momentous in the extreme in respect to the consequences that flowed from them.|$|E
60|$|This {{victory over}} <b>Acron,</b> and the {{annexation}} of his dominions to the Roman commonwealth, are considered of great historical importance, {{as the original}} type and exemplar of the whole subsequent foreign policy of the Roman state;--a policy marked by courage and energy in martial action on the field, and by generosity {{in dealing with the}} conquered; and which was so successful in its results, that it was the means of extending the Roman power from kingdom to kingdom, and from continent to continent, until the vast organization almost encircled the world.|$|E

60|$|<b>Acron</b> was a bold, energetic, and {{determined}} man, {{who had already}} acquired great fame by his warlike exploits, and who had long been watching {{the progress of the}} new colony with an evil eye. He thought that if it were allowed to take root, and to grow, it might, at some future day, become a formidable enemy, both to him, and also to the other states in that part of Italy. He had been very desirous, therefore, of finding some pretext for attacking the new city, and when he heard of the seizure of the Sabine women, he thought that the time had arrived. He, therefore, urged the Sabines to make war at once upon the Romans, and promised, if they would do so, to assist them with all the forces that he could command. The Sabines, however, were so unwilling to proceed to extremities, and spent so much time in negotiations and embassies, that Acron's patience was at length wholly exhausted by the delays, and he resolved to undertake the extermination of the new colony himself alone.|$|E
60|$|Romulus {{faithfully}} {{fulfilled the}} vow {{which he had}} made to Jupiter. On {{the return of the}} army to Rome, the soldiers, by his directions, cut down a small oak-tree, and trimming the branches at the top, and shortening them as much as was necessary for the purpose, they hung the weapons and armor of <b>Acron</b> upon it, and marched with it thus, in triumph into the city. Romulus walked {{in the midst of the}} procession, a crown of laurel upon his head, and his long hair hanging down upon his shoulders. Thus the victors entered the city, greeted all the way by the shouts and acclamations of the people, who had assembled,--men, women, and children,--at the gates and upon the tops of the houses. When the long procession had thus passed in, tables for the soldiers were spread in the streets and public squares, and the whole day was spent in festivity and rejoicing. This was the first Roman triumph,--the original model and example of those magnificent and imposing spectacles which in subsequent ages became the wonder of the world.|$|E
