Most patients [...] "get limb-sparing or limb-reconstructive surgery. Now the cure rate's almost up to 80 per cent in younger patients. In older patients it's more like 70 per cent.... So that's <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> turnaround {{in a couple}} of decades."

So I can't be that disappointed, yet, it is a letdown that it hasn't been as buoyant as it should be. ... But I don’t really feel that negative about it. As far as I'm concerned it's {{one of the better}} albums I've made. As I've said. Never Let Down has been <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> seller for me. So I'm quite happy."

500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, this is <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> hog {{we are trying to}} catch and to hold when we catch him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E

Alston was named NL Manager of the Year six times. He also managed NL All-Star squads a record nine times and won seven of those games. At a time when multi-year contracts were on the rise, Alston's managerial career consisted of 23 one-year contracts. He earned seven NL pennants in that span.|$|E
500|$|Kreisberg {{described}} the crossover between both shows as [...] "a superhero a-go-go!", saying: [...] "It’s insane {{to have them}} all together." [...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> jaw-dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E

The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, so we were really thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E

As Cure Echo, her brown hair becomes light blonde and her ponytails grow longer, and her theme color is white. She wears the Smile Pretty Cure insignia on her chest. Cure Echo also {{has the ability to}} control light, yet actually never fights in the movie, as she's used this form to reach out her feelings to Fuu-chan.

500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which is going to have <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
500|$|An attacking {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler, Loxton {{spent much}} of his cricket career in the shadow of Miller, who played the same type of role. Upon Miller's death in 2004, he said [...] "I was in Keith's shadow all my career ... and it was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> shadow." [...] First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 {{after the end of the}} war, but Loxton failed to gain state selection during the season. He played his final VFL season in 1946 and was chosen in 12 of St Kilda’s 19 games, kicking 40 goals. However, his team only won two of these 12 matches, and finished second last. Loxton had a strong start to his final season, kicking 34 goals in the first 8 rounds. This included a career best of eight goals in another away win over Geelong. He also added six goals apiece against Footscray and Collingwood, but it was not enough to prevent defeats. However, Loxton missed three matches after the eighth round and upon his return, struggled and managed only six goals in his last four matches for St Kilda.|$|E
500|$|The post-hardcore {{sound of}} Box Car Racer {{inspired}} {{the change in}} tone and experimental nature the band approached Blink-182 with. Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: [...] "Before, we got one guitar sound that we changed a little bit through the record. This time {{we want to try}} a whole different setup for each song." [...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as the}} first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with Box Car Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E

500|$|Valene's {{relationship}} with Gary {{is important to}} the understanding of her overall character. The Gary/Abby/Valene love triangle, which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters. Van Ark described the storyline:"There wasn’t really anything I could think of, but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. I can’t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple. Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby. It was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> deal to break up the couple that the show began with. So (the producers) were going toward this, then they pulled away but eventually returned to it. David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him. And it was the longest running story on the show. It took a long time for them to get back together. Eight years." ...|$|E

Cyrus returned {{to perform the}} song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people. Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. A critic from the Nashville Scene praised the performance, writing, [...] "Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly shouted in unison by the arena, some of the audience tearing up." [...] Blake Hannon praised Cyrus' vocal delivery, writing, [...] "The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball. It was {{the highlight of the}} night, and not because of anything visual. The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black, with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights.

500|$|In February 2006, {{four months}} before the release of Superman Returns, Warner Bros. {{announced}} a summer 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer returning as director. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were expected to reprise their roles, however, {{with the release of}} Superman Returns in July 2006, Warner Bros. was hesitant on moving forward with development. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film, but that it [...] "should have done $500million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd." [...] Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, [...] "That movie made $400million! I don't know what constitutes under-performing these days..." [...] Filming was supposed to start in March 2008; no screenplay was ever written, but Singer would have titled it Man of Steel, with an interest in Darkseid as the main villain. Singer stressed {{that it would have been}} more action-packed than Superman Returns. while writer Michael Dougherty was interested in using Brainiac. [...] "In my mind, if the Kryptonians really were a space-faring race... it would only make sense that there would've been colonies and off-planet missions... other Kryptonians making their way to Earth seemed like <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> one. It wouldn't necessarily be evil right off the bat. That's too easy and cliché... I think it'd be interesting to see how these other Kryptonians show up, land and have all these powers and [...] how to adapt to them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. So I think we have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>big</b> reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
