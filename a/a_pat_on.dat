For example, <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) {{in order to support}} their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{reported that}} [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter" [...] was a [...] "stellar episode that was hitting {{all the right}} beats", and commented that [...] "ven the tired, formulaic structure of Jack's two women scenario was given some great new lines" [...] from Fey and Cannon, who developed the script. He opined that if the episode centered only around Jack's two women dilemma it [...] "would have been just fine." [...] Canning appreciated Elizabeth Banks' and Julianne Moore's appearances, writing that the two [...] "exhibited the charms that have made them welcome additions to this season". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode a 9.2 out of 10 rating. Jane Boursaw of AOL's TV Squad said that the Toofer story was [...] "funny, without being (too) offensive." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin said that he enjoyed [...] "just about every minute" [...] of this episode, and praised Liz's speech citing it as the [...] "crowning moment" [...] from [...] "Lee Marvin vs. Derek Jeter". Rabin also liked the Toofer quitting storyline writing that it [...] "could easily have gone nowhere but the show made it both funny and surprisingly thoughtful by {{using it as a}} springboard to discuss Affirmative Action and our society's defiantly uneven playing field." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik noted that this episode was stronger than [...] "Khonani", which aired the same day of the week as this episode. Sean Gandert of Paste wrote that Toofer's plot was not [...] "given {{more than a few minutes}} of screen time [...] it also doesn't wear out its welcome... The show doesn't address race, gender, or affirmative action in a particularly enlightened manner, but who cares, it's funny." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that he found the most enjoyment in Liz's story, writing that he found it [...] "endearing". In regards to Jack's plot, Mersel said that Jack is able to play off Nancy and Avery so well that [...] "I am going back and forth on whether or not to scold the NBC boss or give him <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back. Avery and Nancy both have their shining moments, but I feel that he must choose quite soon, or he will be loosing [...] both." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately, Elderspeak {{is based}} on {{stereotypes}} and not actual behaviour of elders because it is used in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. Elderspeak is actually offensive but nursing home residents are no longer offended by these speech patterns because they have claimed it as a normal habit. [...] The use of elderspeak in more [...] “warmth” [...] and lower in a “superiority” dimension when the speaker was a family member and/or friend compared to an unfamiliar. Generally, young adults use an overstated version of elderspeak when addressing impaired older persons. When older adults converse with older people with cognitive impairments, they make speech accommodations {{to a lesser extent}} than young people. They speak more slowly and incorporate more pauses, however they do not use more repetition as young people do. It is possible that older speakers may not accommodate their speech as much in order to avoid seeming patronizing. Research shows that approximately 80% of communication is non verbal. Elderspeak involves communicating to the older adult in a coddling way, which includes non verbal cues and gestures. An example would be looming over a wheelchair or bed in dominancy, or <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the buttocks resembling parent-child touching.|$|E
2500|$|In December, {{the company}} went on to produce their best known {{theatrical}} performance Kamra No. 9 (Room No. 9) a radio play written by Saadat Hasan Manto and directed by Azeem Hamid. The performance was well received by critics and audiences, the Daily Times wrote [...] "Kamra #9 ... mystery musical {{is an example of}} Urdu theatre at its finest." [...] Shoaib Ahmed of Dawn Newspaper wrote [...] "The 60-minute three-act play had such a strong production value that it kept glued the audience to their seats till the end. The literary piece was deeply and meaningfully tailored for the play.", while during an interview to The Express Tribune, director Azeem Hamid said, [...] "Visualising and creating a 1930s Delhi feel for a radio play was an immense challenge; we walked around Jalander, India to get inspiration for Kamra #9’s set design." [...] The Mani-Nama blog reviewed the performance saying, [...] "The set was quite modest- a realistic one with an old radio, telephone and chairs. After sometime I witnessed some quality lighting which was done by Shakeel Siddique, who literally set the pace of play with classic lights." [...] and The News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Kamra #9 provided insight into human complexities." [...] Aleeza Rasool, writer and critic, of Youlin Magazine reported praising the performance as she wrote, [...] "Firstly, a radio play by Manto was a refreshing choice, for {{it is one of the}} lesser-known genres that Manto composed during his brief lifetime. Secondly, the play was very well-acted, and most importantly, the direction was even-tempered, making the play engaging., adding that, [...] "It is unusual to come across the genus of anticipation and suspense in Pakistani stage plays, which is why Azeem Hamid, actor and director of the play, deserves <b>a</b> <b>pat</b> <b>on</b> the back for putting up a wonderful performance on Manto’s radio play." ...|$|E
