However, despite the technical {{success of the}} program, investment has moved more toward autonomous intelligent vehicles rather than building specialized infrastructure. The AHS system places sensory technology in cars that can read passive road markings, and use radar and inter-car communications to make the cars organize themselves without the intervention of drivers. Such an autonomous cruise control system is being developed by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen and Toyota.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} its investigation into deployment sequences {{to better understand the}} paths that could be taken from today's driving environment to vehicle-highway automation. One of the most vexing problems has always been that of determining how to advance from the present-day manually-controlled vehicles to the future fully automated vehicles. Considerable research attention has been devoted to defining the architecture and operating protocols, as well as the technology, of <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems.</b> Rather less attention has been devoted to defining the steps by which we can get there. Initially, targets of opportunity were identified for accelerating progress toward highway automation, taking account of the operational constraints. Next, after reviewing existing literature on <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> deployment, a set of principles to govern the design of deployment strategies is suggested followed by proposed deployment sequences for <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems,</b> beginning with adaptive cruise control and then adding elements of vehicle-vehicle cooperation and lane protection to build toward <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> capabilities within constraints of technological, human factors and economic feasibility. A general deployment staging sequence is then presented along with example deployment "roadmaps" shown for transit buses, heavy trucks and light-duty passenger vehicles. Finally, we discuss the findings of our modeling and evaluation work for the beginning stages of a specific deployment sequence for light-duty passenger vehicles in the setting of a single highway lane. This sequence incorporates the use of cooperative adaptive cruise control along with conventional or autonomous adaptive cruise control and manual-driven vehicles. The evaluation assesses the impact of each of these three operational driving modes on traffic flow dynamics and highway capacity as well as of increasing proportions of both autonomous and cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles relative to manually driven vehicles. Such effects are difficult to estimate from field tests on highways because of their necessarily low market penetration of these vehicles. Our approach uses Monte Carlo simulations based on detailed modeling work to estimate the quantitative effects of varying proportions of vehicle control types on lane capacity and on queue lengths and wait times at on-ramps. progressive deployment sequences, <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems,</b> adaptive cruise, control, cooperative adaptive cruise control, highway capacity, traffic flow, modeling, evaluation...|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, the United States Congress {{passed the}} ISTEA Transportation Authorization bill, which {{instructed}} USDOT to [...] "demonstrate an automated vehicle and highway system by 1997." [...] The Federal Highway Administration took on this task, {{first with a}} series of Precursor Systems Analyses and then by establishing the National <b>Automated</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>System</b> Consortium (NAHSC). This cost-shared project was led by FHWA and General Motors, with Caltrans, Delco, Parsons Brinkerhoff, Bechtel, UC-Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon University, and Lockheed Martin as additional partners. Extensive systems engineering work and research culminated in Demo '97 on I-15 in San Diego, California, in which about 20 automated vehicles, including cars, buses, and trucks, were demonstrated to thousands of onlookers, attracting extensive media coverage. The demonstrations involved close-headway platooning intended to operate in segregated traffic, as well as [...] "free agent" [...] vehicles intended to operate in mixed traffic. Other carmakers were invited to demonstrate their systems, such that Toyota and Honda also participated. While the subsequent aim was to produce a system design to aid commercialization, the program was cancelled in the late 1990s due to tightening research budgets at USDOT. Overall funding for the program was in the range of $90 million.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to extend and {{integrate}} existing results on fault diagnostics and fault management for passenger vehicles used in <b>automated</b> <b>highway</b> <b>systems</b> (AHS). These re-sults have been combined to form a fault diagnostic and management system for the longitudinal control system of the automated vehicles which has a heirarchical framework that complements the established PATH control system. Furthermore, the fault diagnostic module effectively mon-itors all of the sensors and actuators required for longitudinal control, while the fault handling module corrects for any detected faults via controller reconfiguration and degraded modes of op-eration. Simulations using the SHIFT programming language are presented to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} fault diagnostic and management system for different fault scenarios.

40|$|Highway {{congestion}} has {{in recent}} years become a pervasive problem for urban and suburban areas alike. The concept of <b>Automated</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Systems</b> {{is based on the}} belief that integration of sensing, communication, and control technologies into vehicles and highways can lead to a large improvement in capacity and safety without requiring a significant amount of additional highway right-of-way. A fundamental determinant of <b>Automated</b> <b>Highway</b> <b>Systems</b> capacity is the vehicle-following rule, the rule that governs the behavior of vehicles traveling along a common lane (e. g., the spacing between any two longitudinally adjacent vehicles). Vehicle following affects the longitudinal capacity (achievable flow within a lane), the lateral capacity (achievable flow between lanes) and the conflicting relationship between the longitudinal flow and lateral capacity. The issues are investigated by developing probabilistic models for vehicle/platoon and gap distributions, for vehicles that travel in platoons, in slots, or as free-agents. Mathematical models are also developed to estimate the completion time of a lane change, which can be used as a surrogate for the lateral capacity. Numerical results for the three major vehicle-following rules and their comparison are also provided...|$|R
