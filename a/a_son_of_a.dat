5|$|Careful {{selection}} of a spouse was important to maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E
5|$|Narendra's father's {{sudden death}} in 1884 left the family bankrupt; {{creditors}} began demanding the repayment of loans, and relatives threatened to evict the family from their ancestral home. Narendra, once <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-to-do family, {{became one of}} the poorest students in his college. He unsuccessfully tried to find work and questioned God's existence, but found solace in Ramakrishna and his visits to Dakshineswar increased.|$|E

5|$|According {{to modern}} genealogies {{the father of}} Artavasdes I, Ariobarzanes I was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{previous}} ruling King Mithridates I of Media Atropatene and his wife, an unnamed Armenian Princess from the Artaxiad Dynasty who was a daughter of the Armenian King Tigranes the Great and his wife, Cleopatra of Pontus, which can explain the claims of Mithridates I’s descendants to the Armenian Kingship {{in opposition to the}} lasting ruling monarchs of the Artaxiad Dynasty. Another possibility in linking Artavasdes I to the marriage of Mithridates I and his wife is through his name. The name Artavasdes bears as a typical Armenian royal name and therefore, in all likelihood, Artavasdes I is a descendant of this marriage.|$|E

As an astronomer, he worked on his scientific theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.|$|E

Nathaniel Hughson, a property owner to the north, cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare {{a proposal for a}} courthouse and jail on Hamilton's property. Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site. Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town. As he had been instructed, Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly, which established a new Gore District, of which the Hamilton townsite was a member.|$|E
5|$|This {{branch of}} the family claims descent from Patrick, <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chief of Glenoe.

John Macintyre of Camus-na-h-erie, 10th of his line, fought on the Jacobite side in the 1745 and was wounded at the battle of Falkirk.

5|$|In 1032, Barbolano {{himself was}} deposed {{by those who}} wished to restore power to Otto Orseolo, but the former Doge lay dying in Constantinople {{and was unable to}} return from exile. Domenico Orseolo, a younger brother of Otto and a rather unpopular figure in Venice, {{attempted}} to seize the throne without waiting for the formality of an election, but as soon as he tried this, his many enemies, including those who pushed for the reinstatement of Otto, grew outraged that an Orseolo would assume the throne simply because {{he was the son of}} Pietro II. The power of the Doge was severely checked, and Domenico Flabanico, a successful merchant, was called by the people to the position of Doge. During his 11-year reign Flabanico enacted several key reforms that would restrict the power of future Doges, including a law forbidding the election of <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Doge.|$|E

5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was <b>a</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E
