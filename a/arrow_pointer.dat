The bombardier typically has a switch to move the pointer to the right or left, and a repeater dial so {{he can see the}} setting.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} here {{is simple}} to understand if we {{only look at}} the <b>arrow</b> <b>pointers.</b> When there is an access to a value say 'A' and the we cannot {{find it in the}} cache then load it from memory and place it at the block where the arrows are pointing go from top to bottom and when you place that block make the arrows point away from that block go from bottom to top. In the above example we see how 'A' was placed followed by 'B', 'C and 'D'. Then as the cache became full 'E' replaced 'A' as that was where the arrows were pointing at that time. On the next access block where 'C' is being held will be replaced.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the image}} to be {{superimposed}} (indexed color is assumed), a given palette entry {{plays the role of}} the transparent color. Usually the index number 0, but other may be chosen if the overlay is performed by software. At design time, the transparent color palette entry is assigned to an arbitrary (usually distinctive) color. In the example below, a typical <b>arrow</b> <b>pointer</b> for a pointing device is designed over an orange background, so here the orange areas denoted the transparent areas (left). At run time, the overlapped image is placed anywhere over the background image, and it is blended in such way that if the pixel color index is the transparent color, the background pixel is kept, otherwise it is replaced.|$|E

To fill out the form online in Adobe Acrobat Reader: • Select the hand tool • Position the pointer on a form line or inside a form box. The I-beam pointer allows you to type text. The <b>arrow</b> <b>pointer</b> allows you to select a button or check box. Use your mouse or press Tab to move between form items...|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year he wrote of another exhibition: [...] "Three large new canvases by Bacon prove him {{once more to}} be the most astonishingly sinister artist in England, {{and one of the most}} original". Head II is, for Bacon, very thickly painted, one of few instances when he had been able to 'rescue' a painting after it had become overworked and the weave of the canvas clogged (as happened with two abandoned works on canvas from the Head series, from 1949, also in the 1949 Hanover show). The <b>arrow,</b> or <b>pointer,</b> motif in Head II is taken from the book Positioning in Radiography by Kathleen Clara Clark, 1939.|$|R

Each box with an <b>arrow</b> represents a <b>pointer</b> and a row is a linked list giving a sparse subsequence; the numbered boxes (in yellow) at the bottom represent the ordered data sequence. Searching proceeds downwards from the sparsest subsequence at the top until consecutive elements bracketing the search element are found.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} on an {{experiment}} conducted to test the effects of different hand representations on near space pointing performance and user preference. Subjects were presented with varying levels of hand realism, including real hand video, a high and a low level 3 D hand model and an ordinary 3 D <b>pointer</b> <b>arrow.</b> Behavioural data revealed that an abstract hand substitute like a 3 D <b>pointer</b> <b>arrow</b> leads to significantly larger position estimation errors in terms of lateral target overshooting when touching virtual surfaces with only visual hand movement constraints. Further, questionnaire results show that a higher fidelity hand is preferred over lower fidelity representations for {{different aspects of the}} task. But we cannot conclude that realtime video feedback of the own hand is better rated than a high level static 3 D hand model. Overall, these results, which largely confirm previous research, suggest that, although a higher fidelity feedback of the hand is desirable from an user acceptance point of view, motor performance seems not to be affected by varying degrees of limb realism - as long as a hand-like shape is provided...|$|R
40|$|The Teaching Machine is a {{software}} system for animation of computer programs. It allows the instructor {{in the classroom}} or the student {{on their own to}} single step through computer programs written in C++ or Java while observing the effect of each step on the state of a virtual machine. The state of the machine is represented {{in a number of ways}} including a presentation of the current state of evaluation of an expression, the state of memory in terms of bits or symbolic values, a box and <b>arrow</b> view of <b>pointer</b> based data structures. We report on recent developments in the Teaching Machine and on experience in the classroom. Keywords: Program Animation, Teaching Machine, Computer Education...|$|R
