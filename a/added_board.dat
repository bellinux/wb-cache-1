40|$|Two {{types of}} oil palm trunk particleboards namely {{binderless}} and polylactic acid (PLA) <b>added</b> <b>board</b> were manufactured with a target density of 1. 0 g/cm 3. The mass attenuation coefficients of the binderless and PLA added particleboards {{were determined by}} using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) photons emanating from high purity metal plates.
