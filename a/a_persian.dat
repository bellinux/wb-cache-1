In 582, Maurice won a battle at Constantia over Adarmahan and Tamkhusro, who was killed, but the Roman general did not follow up his victory; he had to hurry to Constantinople to pursue his imperial ambitions. Another Roman victory at Solachon in 586 likewise failed to break the stalemate.|$|E

5|$|A {{preliminary}} expedition under Mardonius, in 492BC, {{to secure}} the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia, the latter which had been <b>a</b> <b>Persian</b> vassal {{as early as the}} late 6th century BC. An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and Artaphernes in 490BC, using Delos as an intermediate base at, successfully sacking Karystos and Eretria, before moving to attack Athens.

5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, <b>a</b> <b>Persian</b> Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and the fact that no Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel.|$|E

5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of <b>a</b> <b>Persian</b> ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-450s the Athenians {{launched}} an unsuccessful attempt to aid an Egyptian revolt against Persia, {{which led to}} a prolonged siege of <b>a</b> <b>Persian</b> fortress in the Nile Delta.

Cimon defeated the Persians in the Battle of Salamis-in-Cyprus, but died of disease in 449BC. Pericles is said to have initiated both expeditions in Egypt and Cyprus, although some researchers, such as Karl Julius Beloch, argue that the dispatch of such a great fleet conforms with the spirit of Cimon's policy.|$|E
