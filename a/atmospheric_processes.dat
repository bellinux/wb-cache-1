500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the relatively recent appearance of noctilucent clouds, and their gradual increase, {{may be linked to}} climate change. The author of the first cited study, atmospheric scientist Gary Thomas of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, has pointed out that the first sightings coincide with both Krakatoa and the nascent Industrial Revolution, and they have become more widespread and frequent throughout the twentieth century, including an uptick between 1964 and 1986. The connection of global warming to noctilucent clouds remains controversial, however. Gary Thomas may have penned his paper after Wilfried SchrÃ¶der, who might hold the distinction of being the first to explain noctilucent clouds as [...] "indicators" [...] for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>processes</b> (Gerlands BeitrÃ¤ge zur Geophysik, 1971, Meteorologische Rundschau 1968â€“1970). Most recently in 2012 Lonnie Cumberland's physics PhD work supported viewing noctilucent clouds as a possible Miner's Canary for climate change as her third conclusion as a sign of increasing the presence of water in the high atmosphere. NASA scientists speculate that methane may be driven higher into the mesophere where noctilucent clouds form by climate change and through reactions that end up producing water at such altitudes.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{numerical}} weather prediction began in the 1920s {{through the efforts of}} Lewis Fry Richardson, who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. [...] It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950, based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations. In 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast (i.e., a routine prediction for practical use). Operational {{numerical weather prediction}} in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Weather Bureau.
