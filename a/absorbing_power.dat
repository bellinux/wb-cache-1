It received radio exposure on both AM and FM stations with songs such as the title track and [...] "Holy Thursday", which became the album's best-known recording. The album was not a commercial success and only sold 75,000 copies by October 1969. In a contemporary review, Billboard magazine called it [...] "an aesthetic mix of music and philosophy... chock full of mysticism, creativity, and change", believing that Axelrod's idyllic music would be interesting enough to impact the record charts. Writing for Gramophone, Alasdair Clayre said Axelrod's impressions of Blake [...] "reveal a depth of imagination and skill warranting attention {{beyond the confines of}} pop music", proving he could compose innovatively for a large orchestra, which Clayre felt comprised the best of California's studio musicians on the album. He questioned whether the [...] "occasional guitar gobbling" [...] reflected Axelrod's genuine ideas or [...] "an obligatory concession to contemporary sound" [...] on an otherwise compelling record. The magazine's Nigel Hunter found the record's songs to be [...] "of <b>absorbing</b> <b>power</b> and depth", but complained of the electric guitar parts. Nat Freedland from Entertainment World was more critical, accusing Axelrod of [...] "indulging himself here to little avail". Stereo Review magazine's Paul Kresh panned Song of Innocence as a pretentious, inadequate album dependent on movie music tricks and outdated techniques such as forced climaxes and gaudy orchestration. He said it fell severely short of the concept Axelrod aspired to and that [...] "only the most uneducated will be taken in by the mountains of misterioso claptrap that surround these squeaking musical mice".|$|E

For some individual bus rides the correlations were poor, but when {{a sufficient number of}} rides was used to give reasonable sample base, an excellent correlation was obtained.

A six-degree-of-freedom method developed for aircraft data was completed. Preliminary {{correlation of}} <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> with ISO standards further enhances the bus ride and <b>absorbed</b> <b>power</b> correlation numbers since the AP's obtained are of the same order of magnitude for both correlations.

Although Superman is able to regain his powers by subjecting himself to a dangerous form of 'chemotherapy' where he deliberately exposes himself to kryptonite to burn away what radiation was preventing his cells from absorbing sunlight, analysis reveals that Superman is now <b>absorbing</b> <b>power</b> from kryptonite that will soon kill him.

Using his enhanced abilities, Savage attempts to win Superman's loyalty by revealing that the asteroid that empowered him could have hit Krypton before it was redirected to Earth, suggesting that a Kryptonian with his powers would have saved the planet, and then showing him a vision of a future where Savage rules the world with Superman as his general against enemy threats, but Superman rejects both of these visions as he genuinely doesn't believe that strength alone solves anything, working with Savage's son the Puzzler to push the asteroid back out of Earth orbit.|$|E
