5000|$|In April 1990 Joachim Alfred Wünning made {{experiments}} with industrial gasoline engines thereby observing that beyond {{a temperature of}} 850 °C the flames were blown away. The German word [...] "flammenlose Oxidation" [...] (flameless oxidation) is {{the origin of the}} name for the FLOX-Technology that was derived from the effect. Its specific advantages led to additional funding including a project [...] "FLoxCoal" [...] at the Stuttgart University to engineer a prototype of an <b>atomizing</b> <b>burner</b> for coal without flame reactions.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} water {{addition}} to fuel by emulsification on combustion and emission characteristics was investigated using air-assisted fuel <b>atomizing</b> <b>burner.</b> Water addition elongates the combustible range to higher fuel equivalence ratio side by reduction of PM emission. The water addition also reduces NOx emission drastically. Although the reduction of NOx {{is caused by the}} reduction of locally high temperature region, the reduction of global flame temperature is not significant, thus thermal penalty by adding water is negligible. Water addition is also effective to reduce PM emission especially in higher fuel equivalence ratio...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} technical advances made to {{the concept}} of a low pressure, air <b>atomized</b> oil <b>burner</b> for home heating applications. Currently all oil burners on the market are of the pressure atomized, retention head type. These burners have a lower firing rate limit of about 0. 5 gallons per hour of oil, due to reliability problems related to small flow passage sizes. High pressure air <b>atomized</b> <b>burners</b> {{have been shown to be}} one route to avoid this problem but air compressor cost and reliability have practically eliminated this approach. With the low pressure air <b>atomized</b> <b>burner</b> the air required for atomization can be provided by a fan at 5 - 8 inches of water pressure. A burner using this concept, termed the Fan-Atomized Burner or ''FAB'' has been developed and is currently being commercialized. In the head of the FAB, the combustion air is divided into three parts, much like a conventional retention head burner. This report describes development work on a new concept in which 100 % of the air from the fan goes through the atomizer. The primary advantage of this approach is a great simplification of the head design. A nozzle specifically sized for this concept was built and is described in the report. Basic flow pressure tests, cold air velocity profiles, and atomization performance have been measured. A burner head/flame tube has been developed which promotes a toroidal recirculation zone near the nozzle for flame stability. The burner head has been tested in several furnace and boiler applications over the firing rate range 0. 2 to 0. 28 gallons per hour. In all cases the burner can operate with very low excess air levels (under 10 %) without producing smoke. Flue gas NO{sub x} concentration varied from 42 to 62 ppm at 3 % O{sub 2 }. The concept is seen as having significant potential and planned development efforts are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This Conference {{is a key}} {{technology}} transfer activity supported by the ongoing Combustion Equipment Technology (Oil-Heat R and D) program at BNL, and is aimed at providing a forum for the exchange of information among international researchers, engineers, manufacturers, and marketers of oil-fired space-conditioning equipment. The objectives of the Conference were to: identify and evaluate the state-of-the-art and recommend new initiatives for higher efficiency, a cleaner environment, and to satisfy consumer needs cost-effectively, reliably, and safely; and foster cooperation among federal and industrial representatives with the common goal of sustained national economic growth and energy security via energy conservation. The 1996 Oil Technology Conference comprised: (a) fourteen technical papers, and (b) four workshops which focused on mainstream issues in oil-heating technology, namely: oilheat research agenda forum; fan <b>atomized</b> <b>burner</b> commercialization, applications, and product development; fuel quality, storage and maintenance [...] industry discussion; and application of oil heat venting tables, NFPA 31 standard.

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced oil burner concepts {{has long been}} a part of Brookhaven National Laboratory`s (BNL) oil heat research program. Generally, goals of this work include: increased system efficiency, reduced emissions of soot and NO{sub x}, and the practical extension of the firing rate range of current burners to lower input rates. The report describes the results of a project at BNL aimed at the {{development of}} air <b>atomized</b> <b>burners.</b> Two concepts are discussed. The first is an air atomizer which uses air supplied at pressures ranging from 10 to 20 psi and requiring the integration of an air compressor in the system. The second, more novel, approach involves the use of a low-pressure air atomizing nozzle which requires only 8 - 14 inches of water air pressure for fuel atomization. This second approach requires the use of a fan in the burner instead of a compressor although the fan pressure is higher than with conventional, pressure <b>atomized</b> retention head <b>burners.</b> In testing the first concept, high pressure air atomization, a conventional retention head burner was modified to accept the new nozzle. In addition, the burner head was modified to reduce the flow area to maintain roughly 1 inch of water pressure drop across the head at a firing rate of 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour. The burner ignited easily and could be operated at low excess air levels without smoke. The major disadvantage of this burner approach is the need for the air compressor as part of the system. In evaluating options, a vane-type compressor was selected although the use of a compressor of this type will lead to increased burner maintenance requirements...|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure <b>atomized</b> <b>burners</b> include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, airblast atomizer which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A burner head has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and combustion head the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a solenoid pump and flow metering orifice. At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and metering orifice to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{effort on}} {{the environmental impacts of}} fossil fuel based power generation has led to increased research with the aim of reducing emissions and improving combustion efficiency by turning to alternative fuel such as biodiesel. But the hazardous emission caused by biodiesel is still a problem that need to tackle. One of way to achieve this is by choosing the correct nozzle characteristic. In the current study, the effect of nozzle angle on mixture formation and combustion characteristic are investigate using air-assisted fuel <b>atomizing</b> biodiesel <b>burner.</b> The nozzle angle that was used are θ = 450 and 500. The results show with nozzle 450 produce lower spray penetration, but higher spray angle and spray area compare to nozzle 500. The result are similar on flame development. For the emission characteristic, theCarbon Monoxide (CO) and Hydro Carbon (HC) emission had a strong reduction by using nozzle with 450 angle compare to 500 angl...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} done in an oil-fi red 350 MW load-following unit with an opposed wall-fi red boiler, steam-assisted <b>atomized</b> {{conventional}} <b>burners</b> and fluegas recirculation for steam temperature control. Combustion optimization was performed to improve unit performance while maintaining environmental compliance. A comprehensive combustion optimization program was carried out using a systematic approach that included: installation of a new continuous emissions monitoring system with a laser-based particulate matter monitor, combustion tuning of the burners to improve baseline performance, parametric field testing to create a database, data modeling using artificial neural networks, determination of optimal settings using a mathematical optimization algorithm, and development of an on-line advisory software. The real-time advisory software provides expert-system advice to the operators on the optimal boiler control settings for operation under area grid control. Operation with the advisory software allows better compliance with the environmental restrictions while maintaining optimal thermal performance of the unit. It also allows the operator to explore the impact of changes in operating parameters such as excess air, fluegas recirculation rate, fuel viscosity, fuel temperature, atomization pressure, and burner nozzle fouling on emissions and performance parameters...|$|R

40|$|MicroCHP {{involves}} the coproduction of both heat and electric power in (typically) residential heating systems. A range of different energy conversion technologies are currently receiving attention for this application including Stirling engines, internal combustion engines, fuel cells, and Rankine cycles with steam or organic compounds as working fluids. In this work {{the use of}} ThermoPhotoVoltaic (TPV) and ThermoElectric (TE) conversion devices either alone or in combination for power production in an oil-fired heating system have been explored. The focus of this work to date has been on sufficient electric power output to achieve self-powering of the appliance with the consideration that reliability of the heating system during power outages may provide the greatest value to the consumer. Also explored {{is the potential for}} producing larger power output levels, to 1 kW. Low cost, currently available TE devices, based on bismuth telluride, have very low thermal to electric power conversion efficiencies. The use of these in self-powered heating appliances for other applications is established art. Further for simply self-powering, a low conversion efficiency is all that is required to produce the 100 watts needed to power the system. Advanced TE materials under development offer strong potential for increased efficiency in the future. TPV, while currently at an earlier state of development offers the potential for higher conversion efficiencies. This work will report the production of power with both TE and TPV integrated with a residential boiler. A hydronic system was selected relative to a forced air system because of the lower electric power requirements. Using a novel pressure <b>atomized</b> oil <b>burner</b> in combination with very low power circulating pumps, the total running power demand has been reduced to 72 watts. In consideration of cycling, it is estimated that a minimum steady state power output level of 120 watts is required. Experimental results on power production with both TE and TPV in this system are presented. The potential for integration of both TE and TPV devices in a hybrid system are discussed...|$|R
