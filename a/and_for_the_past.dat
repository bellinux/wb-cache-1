25|$|On 31 July Tartar sighted a {{schooner}}. Maxwell set off {{to prevent}} the schooner from entering the narrow and intricate channel between the island of Saona and San Domingo {{where it would be}} difficult for him to pursue. As Tartar got closer he saw that the schooner was using her sweeps to aid her. Her behaviour made Maxwell suspect that his quarry was a privateer so he pursued her until neither vessel could progress farther. At that point, Maxwell was unable to get Tartar into a position from which she could use her broadside. Instead, he sent in a cutting out party in three boats. As the boats set out, their quarry fired a gun, hoisted French colours, and then opened fire on the boats. The schooner was not able to deter the attack and the British captured her with no more casualties than two men wounded. The French lost nine killed and six wounded, as well as three missing, presumed drowned when they tried to swim to shore. Maxwell sent the wounded to San Domingo under flag of truce, but kept the other Frenchmen prisoners, there being no English prisoners available for exchange. The privateer was Hirondelle, under the command of Captain La Place. She was armed with ten 4-pounder guns and had been out of San Domingo for two days. She had been active during the French Revolutionary Wars <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two years also, having frequently escaped pursuit due to her speed.|$|E

500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, something happens and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E
