40|$|Background: Mosquito feeding {{behaviour}} determines {{the degree of}} vector–host contact and may have a serious impact on the risk of West Nile virus (WNV) epidemics. Feeding behaviour also interacts with other biotic and abiotic factors that affect virus <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission.</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified the origin of blood meals in five mosquito species from three different wetlands in SW Spain. All mosquito species analysed fed with different frequencies on birds, mammals and reptiles. Both ‘mosquito species ’ and ‘locality ’ explained a similar amount of variance in the occurrence of avian blood meals. However, ‘season of year ’ was the main factor explaining the presence of human blood meals. The differences in diet resulted in a marked spatial heterogeneity in the estimated WNV transmission risk. Culex perexiguus, Cx. modestus and Cx. pipiens were the main mosquito species involved in WNV enzootic circulation since they feed mainly on birds, were abundant {{in a number of}} localities and had high vector competence. Cx. perexiguus may also be important for WNV transmission to horses, as are Cx. pipiens and Cx. theileri in transmission to humans. Estimates of the WNV transmission risk based on mosquito diet, abundance and vector competence matched the results of previous WNV monitoring programs in the area. Our sensitivity analyses suggested that mosquito diet, followed by mosquito abundance and vector competence, are all relevant factors in understanding virus <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission</b> risk in the studied wild ecosystems.

40|$|The {{ability of}} bats and toothed whales to echolocate is a {{remarkable}} case of convergent evolution. Previous genetic studies have documented parallel evolution of nucleotide sequences in Prestin and KCNQ 4, {{both of which are}} associated with voltage motility during the cochlear amplification of signals. Echolocation involves complex mechanisms. The most important factors include cochlear <b>amplification,</b> nerve <b>transmission,</b> <b>and</b> signal re-coding. Herein, we screen three genes that play different roles in this auditory system. Cadherin 23 (Cdh 23) and its ligand, protocadherin 15 (Pcdh 15), are essential for bundling motility in the sensory hair. Otoferlin (Otof) responds to nerve signal transmission in the auditory inner hair cell. Signals of parallel evolution occur in all three genes in the three groups of echolocators [...] two groups of bats (Yangochiroptera and Rhinolophoidea) plus the dolphin. Significant signals of positive selection also occur in Cdh 23 in the Rhinolophoidea and dolphin, and Pcdh 15 in Yangochiroptera. In addition, adult echolocating bats have higher levels of Otof expression in the auditory cortex than do their embryos and non-echolocation bats. Cdh 23 and Pcdh 15 encode the upper and lower parts of tip-links, and both genes show signals of convergent evolution and positive selection in echolocators, implying that they may co-evolve to optimize cochlear <b>amplification.</b> Convergent evolution <b>and</b> expression patterns of Otof suggest the potential role of nerve and brain in echolocation. Our synthesis of gene sequence and gene expression analyses reveals that positive selection, parallel evolution, and perhaps co-evolution and gene expression affect multiple hearing genes that play different roles in audition, including voltage and bundle motility in cochlear <b>amplification,</b> nerve <b>transmission,</b> <b>and</b> brain function...|$|R

We sampled open-cup and cavity-nesting passerines in Chicago, Illinois, an area of intense WNV transmission, to determine infection rates in nestlings and mosquitoes, and to test whether mosquitoes are attracted to nesting birds. Analysis of Culex pipiens mosquito populations demonstrated WNV amplification to high mosquito infection rates during both years of the study near the locations where nestlings were sampled. Nevertheless, of 194 nestlings representing 12 species, only one 8 -day-old house wren was positive for WNV RNA, and only one 10 -day-old mourning dove was seropositive for antibodies to WNV, but at a low titer (1 : 20). The number of mosquitoes captured in nest box traps and control traps was not significantly different.

Pollination signals initiate a cascade of development events in multiple floral organs, including the induction of ethylene biosynthesis, which coordinates several postpollination developmental responses. The initiation and propagation of ethylene biosynthesis is regulated by the coordinated expression of three distinct ACC synthase genes in orchid flowers. One ACC synthase gene (Phal-ACS 1) is regulated by ethylene <b>and</b> participates in <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> interorgan <b>transmission</b> of the pollination signal, as we have previously described in a related orchid genus. Two additional ACC synthase genes (Phal-ACS 2 and Phal-ACS 3) are expressed primarily in the stigma and ovary of pollinated orchid flowers. Phal-ACS 2 mRNA accumulated in the stigma within 1 h after pollination, whereas Phal-ACS 1 mRNA was not detected until 6 h after pollination. Similar to the expression of Phal-ACS 2, the Phal-ACS 3 gene was expressed within 2 h after pollination in the ovary. Exogenous application of auxin, but not ACC, mimicked pollination by stimulating a rapid increase in ACC synthase activity in the stigma and ovary and inducing Phal-ACS 2 and Phal-ACS 3 mRNA accumulation in the stigma and ovary, respectively.

In children, amplitude of the pressure wave increased progressively along the aorta, and a prominent diastolic wave appeared in the distal aorta and iliac artery. These changes in contour were associated with fluctuations in modulus and phase of the pressure wave harmonics. Alterations in the pressure wave during transmission became progressively less with increasing age, and the wave was transmitted virtually unchanged in the older patients with arterial degener-ative disease.

40|$|A {{cellular}} repeater is {{a system}} of duplex reception, <b>amplification,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission</b> used to enhance uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) signals in areas of low radio coverage. This enhancement expands the coverage of cellular network base transceiver stations (BTS) at low cost. The signals at the input and output ports of the two transceivers (TRX), each dedicated for the UL or DL direction of signal reception, amplification, and re-transmission, are multiplexed at a directional donor and local area antennas by means of diplexers in FDD systems such as GSM and WCDMA FDD. For the DL path, assuming a fixed link with the BTS, a signal of relatively slow-varying power is amplified to a fixed level suitable for adequate radio coverage and QoS in the target local area. For the UL path, a signal of varying power due to slow-fading from user equipment within the local target area is received and amplified at a fixed power level before re-transmission to the BTS. Signal integrity on both the DL and UL paths should be maintained over the widest possible range of input levels in terms of modulation accuracy (EVM) and spectral content. In addition, the levels of in-repeater-band wideband noise and spurious emissions at the repeater output should comply with 3 GPP requirements [1, 2]...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous EGF and TGF-alpha {{accelerate}} wound healing, but treatment {{effects are}} often modest. Using short-term human skin organ culture, {{we found that}} autocrine EGF receptor activation could account for this observation. Amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) transcripts were rapidly and markedly induced, whereas EGF and TGF-alpha mRNAs were undetectable or only slightly increased. Vascular permeability factor and keratin 6 transcripts were also strongly induced, albeit with a >/= 3 h delay relative to HB-EGF and amphiregulin. All four transcripts were upregulated in actual healing skin wounds, HB-EGF and keratin 6 being the most prominent. The highly EGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD 153035 strongly inhibited induction of all four transcripts in organ culture, as well as release of immunoreactive HB-EGF into the medium. These effects were confirmed using the anti-EGF receptor mAb 225 IgG. Neither PD 153035 nor 225 IgG was toxic to keratinocytes, as judged by calcein-AM uptake. PD 153035 completely abrogated the proliferative phase of keratinocyte outgrowth in skin explant cultures, whereas it {{had no effect on}} the antecedent migratory phase. Based on these results, we conclude that EGF receptor activation by highly inducible, keratinocyte-derived heparin-binding ligands is an important mechanism for <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission</b> of the cutaneous wound healing signal...|$|E

The model distinguishes between susceptible, infested and symptomatic fields. It is motivated by rhizomania disease on sugar beet in the UK as an exemplar of a spatially structured and partially asymptomatic epidemic. Our results show the importance of matching the scales of local control strategies to prevent intensification and regional spread of disease with the inherent temporal and spatial scales of an epidemic. A simple field-scale containment strategy, whereby the susceptible crop is no longer grown on fields showing symptoms, fails for this system with cryptic infection because the locally applied control lags behind the epidemic. A farm-scale strategy, whereby growers respond to the disease status of neighbouring farms by transferring their quota for sugar beet to farmers in regions of reduced risk, succeeds. We conclude that a soil-borne pathogen such as rhizomania could be managed by movement of susceptible crops in the landscape using a strategy that matches the temporal and spatial scales of the epidemic and which take account of risk aversion among growers.

40|$|The Japanese {{encephalitis}} virus (JEV), an arthropod-born Flavivirus, is {{the major}} cause of viral encephalitis, responsible for 10, 000 - 15, 000 deaths each year, yet is a neglected tropical disease. Since the JEV distribution area has been large and continuously extending toward new Asian and Australasian regions, it is considered an emerging and reemerging pathogen. Despite large effective immunization campaigns, Japanese encephalitis remains a disease of global health concern. JEV zoonotic transmission cycles may be either wild or domestic: the first involves wading birds as wild amplifying hosts; the second involves pigs as the main domestic amplifying hosts. Culex mosquito species, especially Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the main competent vectors. Although five JEV genotypes circulate, neither clear-cut genotype-phenotype relationship nor clear variations in genotype fitness to hosts or vectors have been identified. Instead, the molecular epidemiology appears highly dependent on vectors, hosts' biology, and {{on a set of}} environmental factors. At global scale, climate, land cover, and land use, otherwise strongly dependent on human activities, affect the abundance of JEV vectors, and of wild and domestic hosts. Chiefly, the increase of rice-cultivated surface, intensively used by wading birds, and of pig production in Asia has provided a high availability of resources to mosquito vectors, enhancing the JEV maintenance, <b>amplification,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission.</b> At fine scale, the characteristics (density, size, spatial arrangement) of three landscape elements (paddy fields, pig farms, human habitations) facilitate or impede movement of vectors, then determine how the JEV interacts with hosts and vectors and ultimately the infection risk to humans. If the JEV is introduced in a favorable landscape, either by live infected animals or by vectors, then the virus can emerge and become a major threat for human health. Multidisciplinary research is essential to shed light on the biological mechanisms involved in the emergence, spread, reemergence, and genotypic changes of JEV. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

A total of 600 fresh caecal faecal samples were obtained from under cages of laying hens in three sheds each containing flocks of ∼ 5400 hens. Samples were cultured for intestinal spirochaetes, and growth on the primary isolation plate was observed under a phase contrast microscope and subjected to PCRs specific for the intestinal spirochaetes Brachyspira intermedia and Brachyspira pilosicoli. Spirochaete isolates obtained in pure culture were assessed for their ability to cause haemolysis on blood agar and to produce indole, and were typed using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A 1250 base pair portion of the 16 S rRNA gene of three B. intermedia and five unidentified isolates was sequenced, and the sequences compared with those of other Brachyspira species. Overall, 121 (20. 2 %) of the faecal samples contained spirochaetes as determined by growth on the plate and microscopy. Using PCR on the primary growth from these positive samples, 43 (7. 2 % overall) were shown to contain B. intermedia, 8 (1. 3 %) to contain B. pilosicoli, and 70 (11. 7 %) were PCR negative. Only 24 isolates of B. intermedia and five isolates of unknown species were obtained in pure culture. Comparative analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene sequence identified the non-B. intermedia isolates as belonging to the proposed species "Brachyspira pulli". PFGE analysis of the B. intermedia strains identified them as having four major banding patterns. Individual patterns were found in hens from different flocks, suggesting cross-transmission of strains between flocks. No environmental sources of infection were identified. The youngest flock had a significantly lower level of colonisation with B. intermedia than the flock of intermediate age (P = 0. 004), suggesting that following initial infection of individual young hens on this farm there was <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission</b> of infection amongst members of the flock...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, a growing amount of {{evidence}} has {{showed that the}} adult brain is capable of undergoing dramatic reorganisation: learning new skills or acquiring novel experiences determine brain responses in order to reflect the changing circumstances. Changes in behaviour and brain function are probably accompanied by structural alterations in neuronal cells: while extensive descriptions of local rearrangements driven by experience during postnatal development have been provided, the adult brain was classically described to be resistant to such structural modifications. Nevertheless, recent studies convincingly showed that the adult brain is able not only to adapt synaptic transmission, but also to undergo remodelling of pre- and postsynaptic compartments in response to experience. Plasticity phenomena have been generally described for either pre- or postsynaptic compartments within small cortical fields, thus not fully clarifying the influence of structural remodelling on the synaptic transmission, on the neuronal behaviour (e. g. global versus local behaviour of a given axonal projection) and, lastly, on the circuit connectivity. In addition, considerable effort is currently made {{in order to establish}} a causal relationship between synaptic, structural and representational or topographic map plasticity. In order to address, at least in part, these questions, we exploited the simple and well-characterized cerebellar circuitry: this system has long been known as a centre for fine motor control and sensorymotor integration; moreover, in the past decade, new results have suggested an involvement of the cerebellum in cognitive and emotional functions. In addition, the cerebellum is a brain region endowed {{with a high degree of}} structural plasticity during development, as well as in the adulthood, not only following damage, but also in order to maintain its normal architecture under the influence of activity. The cerebellar anatomy is characterized by a simple and stereotyped connectivity between readily identifiable neurons, and therefore allows the investigation of synaptic rearrangements on a comprehensive scale. We focused our attention on the input stage of the vermal lobule V, namely at the synapse between mossy fiber (MF) terminals and granule cell (GC) dendrites. MF axons convey multimodal sensory information from distinct sources, such as spinal cord, vestibular system and cerebral cortex. The physiological properties and the anatomical arrangement at this stage, make the MF-GC synapse an advantageous system to investigate pre- and postsynaptic structural plasticity induced by experience. Here, we used two distinct behavioural paradigms: in one case, mice were housed in an enriched environment (EE), in order to provide social interactions and extensive sensorymotor stimulation. In a second set of experiments, mice were trained to associate a neutral stimulus with an aversive one, exploiting a pavlovian learning paradigm that relies on fear emotion (fear conditioning, FC). We combined these tasks with large-scale confocal imaging in transgenic mouse lines that express membrane-targeted GFP in few neuronal cells, thus revealing their morphology in crisp details. This approach allowed us to solve and analyze entire MF projections, and related presynaptic terminals, as well as GC dendritic compartments. In general, we found that distinct experiences elicit substantially different remodelling events, in terms of structural outcome and time course. Upon EE, the MF-GC connectivity is profoundly altered in the properties of the afferent projections and in the putative <b>amplification</b> <b>and</b> <b>transmission</b> of the sensory information. The refinement of the connectivity (i. e. the number of presynaptic inputs per cell) is particularly altered in animals that were reared since birth in the enriched context; but a similar robust remodelling of single synaptic units (i. e. the dendritic endings) also occured in animals that experienced EE only in the adulthood. We further found that FC triggers a stepwise remodelling of the local connectivity at the MF-GC synapse, which proceeds for several days after the training and affects the whole population; the extent and quality of remodelling is lobule-specific and can be further modulated according to subsequent experience. The structural rearrangements we observed upon distinct experiences show that the adult cerebellar system is able to undergo extensive reshaping of its connectivity and synaptic organization. Complementary evidence about synaptic transmission at the MF-GC synapse upon EE and FC would help to assess a correlation between anatomical and functional properties. ...|$|E
