25|$|On {{all their}} {{projects}} since 1972 they worked exclusively with photographer Wolfgang Volz. At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of the prejudices against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E

500|$|Apogee's {{branding}} {{was largely}} Jackson's doing. Bennett said in 2005 that the company's decision to sell purple-coloured products {{was one of}} Jackson's ideas: [...] "He has a good eye for design, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> distinguish ourselves from the all-black rack gear that everybody had at that point." [...] Jackson encouraged a lighting designer from Clair Brothers to sketch a company logo on a cocktail napkin over dinner one evening, and that was immediately made the Apogee logo.|$|E

[...] Moore stated that OSI would remain a studio-only project [...] "until further notice".|$|E

500|$|The Wisteria Lane set, {{which is}} located on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios, {{underwent}} changes for the time jump. Production designer P. Erik Carlson explained, [...] " [...] had already created a fairly Utopian world, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> exaggerate and enhance it a little bit more, mostly through the use of color. We didn’t want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast." [...] Bree's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character's catering business. Additionally, all houses were repainted with bolder colors, with the exception of Gabrielle's home, in order to reflect the Solis' financial situation.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic concept}} behind [...] "Rush" [...] {{had been coming}} {{together}} since the sixth season. According to series creator Chris Carter, {{the way in which}} to portray the teenagers on screen was [...] "tricky". He noted, [...] "it {{had been a long time}} since we had dealt with teenage angst. [...] it was being done everywhere else <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take a run at it." [...] David Amman, who wrote the episode, later explained that the original idea for the episode was simply [...] " [...] effect having the power of super speed would have on troubled teens." [...] However, the story quickly developed [...] "deeper" [...] meanings: drug abuse, boredom, and the teenage experience.|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} DecembeRadio all began playing music in their teens. [...] Josh Reedy and Brian Bunn {{attended}} the same schools, and the former's rendition of [...] "Johnny B. Goode" [...] on guitar at {{a middle school}} talent show convinced Bunn to take up guitar, as well. [...] "Our first year of high school, we started a Top 40 band. We played Hootie & the Blowfish covers {{and that sort of}} thing. Then shortly thereafter, we realized that God had given us these gifts, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> utilize them for him," [...] recalled Bunn. [...] The pair decided to pursue music full-time upon graduation from Auburn High School in Riner, Virginia.|$|E

500|$|The title track, Loughnan's [...] "Big Red Rock", is an eight-and-a-half minute {{instrumental}} {{described by}} Juke Magazine as [...] "expertly capturing the stark loneliness and cosmic tranquility one gets standing before their namesake rock". According to Loughnan, the atmosphere {{they wanted to}} create was [...] "that spacey sort of feeling—like desert <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get {{the sound of the}} didgeridoo—which we did electronically". Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah-wah pedal. Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised [...] "Big Red Rock", saying that it [...] "suggests the huge expanse of the outback, then takes you to the Aboriginal secrets [...] the power surrounding the area [...] in a burst of truly inspired musicianship".|$|E
500|$|Maisie Williams {{also spoke}} with Entertainment Weekly and {{described}} the process behind Arya's scenes, saying [...] "We wanted people to think {{this could be the}} end, or the start of the end. Like maybe her wound is going to fester – like The Hound. We did so many different takes of emerging out of the water the first time she's stabbed and sliced. I had been to a music festival so I hadn't slept the whole weekend. Then I was jumping in the Irish sea. It was a totally manic day. We did a million different takes. We wanted it to be real frantic and panicked. Arya hasn't been emotional in a long time <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> bring that emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's {{nothing we can do}} about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|Black Sabbath {{began work}} on their sixth album in February 1975, again in England at Morgan Studios in Willesden, {{this time with a}} decisive vision to differ the sound from Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. [...] "We could've {{continued}} and gone on and on, getting more technical, using orchestras and everything else which we didn't particularly want to. We took a look at ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do a rock album – Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath wasn't a rock album, really." [...] Produced by Black Sabbath and Mike Butcher, Sabotage was released in July 1975. As with its precursor, the album initially saw favourable reviews, with Rolling Stone stating [...] "Sabotage is not only Black Sabbath's best record since Paranoid, it might be their best ever", although later reviewers such as AllMusic noted that [...] "the magical chemistry that made such albums as Paranoid and Volume 4 so special was beginning to disintegrate".|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007). Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, {{we need to do}} it for a new set of reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing what I was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] exclaimed Bridge, [...] "and now for upstairs. They'll be howling {{around here}} {{in about five}} minutes, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give them a {{reception}} they won't forget." ...|$|R

500|$|In July 2013, Dennings {{told reporters}} that the film was about to head into reshoots. In August, Taylor said he shot extra scenes with Hiddleston {{and was about to}} shoot more with Hopkins. Taylor {{explained}} that it was all a part of the [...] "Marvel process" [...] saying, [...] "We're doing full scenes, scenes that were not in the movie before. We're adding scenes, creating scenes, writing scenes for the first time. The one [...] was a fun connective scene... We realised how well Loki was working in the movie, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do more with him. So {{it was that kind of}} thing, it was like, 'Oh, we could do this, we could jam this in here' because he's such a wonderful guy to watch do his stuff." [...] Also in August, IMAX Corporation and Marvel Entertainment announced that the film would be digitally re-mastered into the IMAX 3D format and released into IMAX 3D theatres internationally beginning October 30, 2013.|$|E
500|$|On 24 September 2014, the band's website was updated {{to include}} a {{countdown}} timer accompanied by text reading [...] "News...". The timer ended on 13 October with the announcement of a ten-year anniversary show at the Forum in London. A statement from the band followed: [...] "It has been 10 years {{since the inception of}} this band <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> celebrate it with a bang. We want to thank you all for your love and support {{over the past ten years}} and we can't wait to commemorate this milestone with you guys." [...] The concert sold out in minutes; due to demand a second concert was scheduled at O2 Academy Brixton for December, which was later postponed until February 2015. With news of the postponement came an announcement of additional dates in Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester. On 25 February, it was confirmed that the band would be third-stage headliners at the 2015 Download Festival.|$|E
500|$|... "Breaking Point" [...] premiered on August 18, 2010, on {{the urban}} radio station V-103 in Atlanta. It was {{selected}} as the album's lead single to showcase Hilson sans featured acts. In an interview, Hilson elaborated on the decision: [...] "Timbaland and Polow [...] knew that even though I've been known for club records, guest features and collaborations, I am a true R lover ... for many reasons ... We knew it wouldn't grow as fast or even be as big a record as some of my past ... We wanted to showcase me by myself, feature-less, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> reveal that I can sing, and really connect with my music and my message. We felt that was the best introduction to No Boys Allowed." [...] Mosley Music Group and Interscope Records released the single via digital distribution in the United States on September 7, 2010. It was later sent to urban adult contemporary radio on October 25, 2010, while the album's second single, [...] "Pretty Girl Rock", was classified for contemporary hit radio the same week.|$|E
