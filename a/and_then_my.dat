25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
25|$|Around 1954, {{parties were}} held at Florance's house, {{referred}} to as 'The Hovel'. According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked out that we had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis {{and all that kind}} of stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E

500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they would call {{me as soon as}} the draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Terry Gilliam {{has called}} Méliès [...] "the first great film magician," [...] adding: [...] "His joyous sense {{of fun and}} ability to astound were a big {{influence}} on both my early animations <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> live-action films… Of course, Méliès still has a tight creative grip on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E

2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
60|$|It was by {{an effort}} that I refrained from {{striking}} him. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mother spoke again.|$|E
60|$|But, to deprecate her anger, I {{kept her}} hand an instant, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> bent <b>my</b> venerable head and kissed it. I think I appeased her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you mean," [...] asked Midwinter, more seriously, but {{not less}} gently than before, [...] "that you must first justify yourself, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> answer <b>my</b> question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are safe," [...] she began, glancing {{first at}} the palm ropes that lay upon the rock <b>and</b> <b>then</b> at <b>my</b> wrists, {{one of which was}} cut.|$|R
60|$|I drew back, still wrought upon by my surprise; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mother's {{voice came}} cold and acid.|$|E

6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> ('twas <b>my</b> duty {{to spare}} her [...] The shame of recalling me) I [...] Just sought her again to prepare her [...] For an {{everlasting}} good-bye.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Not for my sake,’ says {{my sister}} obstinately, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mother comes ben {{to me to}} say delightedly, ‘She winna listen to reason!’ ...|$|E
