In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.|$|E

From poets to scholar, sculptors to painters, the community of Iraqi artists, local and international, experimented with avant-garde and cutting-edge art, and found an insatiable audience that was often blind to gender, socio-economic status, or identity. However, during the past 40 years, the art of Iraq <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> of the artists has certainly paralleled the tumultuous political and social history of the country, creating an inextricable union that has been displayed in all forms of art.|$|E

On the flight home he is told by [...] "Angel" [...] that the whole episode was a scientific experiment that got out of hand; if Pinfold will keep silent about his experiences, he is told, he will never be bothered by the voices again. Pinfold refuses, declaring Angel to be a menace that must be exposed.

Pinfold hears Margaret faintly say,"I don't exist, but I do love you", before the voices disappear forever. Pinfold's doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral. Pinfold views his courage in the battle against the voices as a significant victory in the battle with his personal demons, and he begins to write an account of his experiences: [...] "The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold".|$|E
