It is published in Canada by Madrigal Press. An updated version of the biography was released in 2003 in the United States with a different cover, several corrections, and additional information about Disc One: All Their Greatest Hits <b>and</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>to</b> Everyone, which were released after the initial printing.|$|E
25|$|Not {{a single}} Latin colony {{defected}} to Hannibal, despite the latter's policy of treating the Latin colonists {{in the same}} way as other socii: i.e. releasing captured Latin soldiers without ransom and sparing the colonies' territory from devastation. The closest any Latin colonies came to mutiny was in 209 BC (after eight years of war), when 12 colonies sent a delegation to Rome to inform the Senate that they had run out of men and money and could supply no more troops. But even this was not a defection to the enemy, but an attempt to pressure the Senate into making peace. The inhabitants of the colonies were descendants of Romans and original Latins and were bound to Rome by ethnic solidarity (although they had nominally lost their citizenship, they could automatically regain it by moving to Roman territory). In addition, the colonists occupied land seized from the neighbouring Italic tribes, which the latter were keen to regain. They therefore had little to gain <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> lose by joining Hannibal's Italic coalition. (None even joined the Italian coalition in the Social War over a century later, when there was no external threat).|$|E
500|$|Shama Joseph, professionally {{known as}} Sham, {{was hired as}} one of the {{producers}} to work on crafting songs at the camp. Sham's manager had arranged his attendance at the camp through an acquaintance who was an employee of the record label. Sham explained that he found a flight to Los Angeles and began working on music as soon as he arrived, stating that he had [...] "nothing to lose <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> gain". He was inspired by a vision of Rihanna performing songs at a concert that were Caribbean themed. Sham felt that Rihanna had not explored Caribbean-themed music since her debut album, Music of the Sun (2005).|$|E

500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E
500|$|Mackenzie King died in 1950, {{by which}} time Canada was again going to war, this time in Korea; on the train {{returning}} from the former prime minister's funeral, St. Laurent and his External Relations minister, Lester Pearson, began planning troop movements. [...] Howe saw it as the wrong war in the wrong place, and thought that Canadian troops should not be sent. Nevertheless, he spent the summer of 1950 at his desk, making plans to implement government controls on the booming economy. In September 1950, Howe tabled a bill allowing him to reallocate scarce materials such as steel from the civilian sector to military use. The bill passed, but not before the Opposition had charged that Howe had [...] "an enormous appetite for power". [...] Late in the year, the Government decided on a massive rearmament program. As the Canadian Commercial Corporation, the Crown Corporation which handled government purchases, was felt to be inadequate for the task, the Cabinet decided on a new department to handle procurement. [...] St. Laurent introduced a bill in February 1951 creating a Department of Defence Production, and announced that on passage, Howe would add that responsibility to his portfolio. The opposition parties objected to the Defence Production Act, stating {{that there was no}} emergency justifying the powers Howe wanted. According to Roberts, Howe sought to implement rearmament by getting [...] "full power for himself and running rights over everyone <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> get an urgent job done". [...] Backed by the overwhelming Liberal majority, the bill passed and the Department was established on 1 April 1951.|$|E

2500|$|The Portuguese [...] "discovery" [...] of Brazil was {{preceded by}} a series of {{treaties}} between the kings of Portugal and Castile, following Portuguese sailings down the coast of Africa to India and the voyages to the Caribbean of Genoese mariner sailing for Castile, Christopher Columbus. The most decisive of these treaties was the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, that created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between those two kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian was to be the property of Portugal, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> the west of it went to Spain.|$|E

2500|$|Appearances of Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (1928–1967) {{in popular}} culture are common {{throughout}} the world. Although during his lifetime he was a highly politicized and controversial figure, in death his stylized image {{has been transformed into}} a worldwide emblem for an array of causes, representing a complex mesh of sometimes conflicting narratives. Che Guevara's image is viewed as everything from an inspirational icon of revolution, to a retro and vintage logo. Most commonly he is represented by a facial caricature originally by Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick and based on Alberto Korda's famous 1960 photograph titled Guerrillero Heroico. The evocative simulacra abbreviation of the photographic portrait allowed for easy reproduction and instant recognizability across various uses. For many around the world, Che has become a generic symbol of the underdog, the idealist, the iconoclast, or the martyr. He has become, as author Michael Casey notes in Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image, [...] "the quintessential postmodern icon signifying anything to anyone <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> everyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carson {{opposed the}} Vietnam War, and capital punishment, favored racial equality, and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography. He avoided {{explicitly}} mentioning {{his views on}} The Tonight Show, saying he [...] "hates to be pinned down", as that would [...] "hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am." [...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, {{and there are times}} when I would like to express a view on the air. I would love to have taken on Billy Graham. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> lose." [...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was generally laudatory, if more enthusiastic in the US {{than in the}} UK. Rolling Stone remarked on [...] "Bowie's provocative melodies, audacious lyrics, masterful arrangements (with Mick Ronson) and production (with Ken Scott)", while Billboard called it a combination of [...] "raw energy with explosive rock". In the British music press, however, letters columns accused Bowie of 'selling out' and Let it Rock magazine found the album to be more style than substance, considering that he had [...] "nothing to say <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> say it with". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote {{a few years later}} that his favorite Bowie album had been Aladdin Sane, [...] "the fragmented, rather second-hand collection of elegant hard rock songs (plus one Jacques Brel-style clinker) that fell between the Ziggy Stardust and Diamond Dogs concepts. That Bowie improved his music by imitating the Rolling Stones rather than by expressing himself is obviously a tribute to the Stones, but it also underlines how expedient Bowie's relationship to rock and roll has always been." ...|$|E

David Edelstein of Slate called the film [...] "profoundly stupid and inept" [...] and added, [...] "it's an endless source of giggles once you realise that its historical revisionism {{has nothing to}} do with archeological discoveries <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times further remarked that the film was [...] "a blunt, glowering B picture, shot in murky fog and battlefield smoke, full of silly-sounding pomposity and swollen music (courtesy of the prolifically bombastic Hans Zimmer). The combat scenes, though boisterous and brutal, are no more coherent than the story, which requires almost as much exposition as [...] Luckily there is an element of broad, brawny camp that prevents King Arthur from being a complete drag." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{everything}} about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found {{by many to be}} laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal Pandore wrote about [...] "that English candour which allows everything to be expressed <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama". Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him [...] "what I was searching for, what I lacked, what I had to find [...] actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Adams {{had an affair}} with novelist Sally Emerson, who was {{separated}} from her husband at that time. Adams later dedicated his book Life, the Universe <b>and</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>to</b> Emerson. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, Peter Stothard, a contemporary of Adams's at Brentwood School, and later editor of The Times. Adams was soon introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the [...] "lady barrister" [...] mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [...] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of Hitchhiker's. When the deal fell through, they moved back to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom") and a broken engagement, they married on 25 November 1991. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on 22 June 1994, shortly after Adams turned 42. In 1999 the family moved from London to Santa Barbara, California, where they lived until his death. Following the funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London. Jane died on 7 September 2011 of cancer, aged 59.|$|E
