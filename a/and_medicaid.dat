GAO conducted a national survey of nonfederal primary and specialty care physicians who serve children, and asked about their enrollment in state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> CHIP programs, whether they served <b>and</b> accepted <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> CHIP and privately insured children, and the extent to which they experienced difficulty referring children in <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> CHIP and privately insured children to specialty care.

The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%.

5|$|As of December 2016 {{there were}} 32 states (including Washington DC) that had adopted the Medicaid extension, while 19 states had not. Those states that {{expanded}} Medicaid had a 7.3% uninsured rate on {{average in the}} first quarter of 2016, while those that did not expand Medicaid had a 14.1% uninsured rate, among adults aged 18 to 64. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2012, which held that states would not lose Medicaid funding if they didn't expand Medicaid under the ACA, several states rejected expanded Medicaid coverage. Over half of the national uninsured population lived in those states. In a report to Congress, the Centers for Medicare <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> Services (CMS) estimated that the cost of expansion was $6,366 per person for 2015, about 49 percent above previous estimates. An estimated 9 million to 10 million people had gained Medicaid coverage, mostly low-income adults. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated in October 2015 that 3.1 million additional people were not covered because of states that rejected the Medicaid expansion.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid</b> in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most of the coverage gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} a 2008 survey of physicians, this study {{estimates}} {{the relationship between the}} generosity of fees paid to primary care providers under the <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> Medicare pro-grams and a physician’s willingness to accept new patients covered by Medicaid, Medicare, or both.

Using the estimated model, this study simulates the likely effects of three distinct provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which alter the fees paid to primary care physicians under <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> Medicare. Our findings suggest that, when considered together, the three payment reforms are likely to dramatically improve physician willingness to accept new Medicaid patients while only slightly reducing their willingness to accept new Medicare patients.

5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare <b>and</b> <b>Medicaid).</b> See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E

50|$|A {{report by}} the Kaiser Family Foundation in April 2008 found that US {{economic}} downturns place a significant strain on state <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> SCHIP programs. The authors estimated that a 1% increase in the unemployment rate increase <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> SCHIP enrollment by 1 million, and increase the number uninsured by 1.1 million. State spending on <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> SCHIP would increase by $1.4 billion (total spending on these programs would increase by $3.4 billion). This increased spending would occur while state government revenues were declining. During the last downturn, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) included federal assistance to states, which helped states avoid tightening their <b>Medicaid</b> <b>and</b> SCHIP eligibility rules. The authors conclude that Congress should consider similar relief for the current economic downturn.|$|R
