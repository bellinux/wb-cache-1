50|$|In an <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> the p arm {{contains}} {{genetic material}} including repeated sequences such as nucleolar organizing regions, {{and can be}} translocated without significant harm, as in a balanced Robertsonian translocation. The domestic horse genome includes one metacentric chromosome that is homologous to two acrocentric chromosomes in the conspecific but undomesticated Przewalski's horse. This may reflect either fixation of a balanced Robertsonian translocation in domestic horses or, conversely, fixation of the fission of one metacentric chromosome into two acrocentric chromosomes in Przewalski's horses. A similar situation exists between the human and great ape genomes; in this case, because more species are extant, {{it is apparent that}} the evolutionary sequence is a reduction of two acrocentric chromosomes in the great apes to one metacentric chromosome in humans (see Karyotype#Aneuploidy).|$|E
40|$|A new CMS system {{designated}} as ‘msH 1 ’ {{has been reported}} in bread wheat using the cytoplasm of H. chilense. While testing this system in different wheat backgrounds, a highly fertile line with chromosome number 42 plus an extra <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> was obtained. The extra chromosome did not pair with any wheat chromosome at meiosis, and progeny from this line which lack the <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> showed pollen abortion and male sterility. In order to establish the origin of this chromosome, FISH using H. chilense genomic DNA as probe was used and showed that it had originated from H. chilense chromosome(s). The novel chromosome did not possess sequences similar to wheat rDNA; however, the probe pSc 119. 2 from S. cereale containing the 120 bp family was found to occur {{at the end of its}} long arm. Data obtained from FISH and EST molecular markers confirm that the long arm of the <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> is indeed, the short arm of chromosome 1 Hch from H. chilense. We suggest that the novel chromosome originated from a deletion of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 1 Hch. Neither the 1 HchS short arm, nor the whole chromosome 1 Hch restores pollen fertility of the alloplasmic wheat. Therefore, the restorer gene on the <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> must be located on the retained segment from the hypothetical 1 HchL, while some pollen fertility inhibitor could be present on the deleted 1 HchL distal segment.

After the common ancestor of salmonids underwent a whole genome duplication,its karyotype would have 100 chromosome arms, and this is reflected in the modal range of 96 – 104 seenin extant salmonids (e. g., rainbow trout).

40|$|Human ribosomal gene repeats are {{distributed}} among five nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) on the p arms of <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> On exit from mitosis, nucleoli form around individual active NORs.

Human ribosomal genes are transcriptionally silent in this context. Combined immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization (immuno-FISH) on three-dimensional preserved nuclei showed that human <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosomes</b> associate with hybrid cell nucleoli. Analysis of purified nucleoli demonstrated that human and mouse NORs are equally likely to be within a hybrid cell nucleolus.

These monomers are organised into a 1. 37 -kilobase higher-order structure that is itself tandemly reiterated. Using a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing specific human chromosomes, this higher-order structure is demonstrated on chromosomes 14 and 22, {{but not on the}} remaining <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> In situ hybridisation studies have localised the sequence to the proximal p-arm region of these chromosomes.

The observed diploid number was 2 n = 34 chromosomes for both sexes and three distinct katyotypic formulae were found, namely cytotype A (20 m, 8 sm, 6 st, Fundamental Number/FN = 68; 6 males and 11 females), cytotype B (19 m, 8 sm, 6 st, 1 a, FN = 67; 8 males and 4 females) and cytotype C (18 m, 8 sm, 6 st, 2 a, FN = 66; a single male). NORs's analyses showed that these regions were located in distinct sites on the NOR-bearing chromosome pair, according to cytotypes. Thus, in cytotype A, NORs were located in the terminal region of the short arm of the second metacentric chromosome pair; in cytotype B, they were detected in the short arm of the metacentric chromosome and interstitially on the <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> and, in cytotype C, NORs were observed in the interstitial region of the <b>acrocentric</b> <b>chromosome</b> pair. C-positive heterochromatic bands were adjacent to the rDNA sites in the corresponding chromosomes. Thus, the chromosomal polymorphism of A. cuiabae was probably originated through a pericentric inversion in chromosome pair nº 2 involving the NOR sites, which represents a novelty in the Ancistrini tribe.
