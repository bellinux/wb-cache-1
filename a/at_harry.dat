The flowers appear steadily between April and December, and are most frequent between August and October. [...] They are red or orange, and emerge from the leaf axils. They are usually solitary, but occasionally an axil will carry two flowers. As with other Proteaceae species, each flower consists of a perianth of four united tepals, and a single style. In A.obovatus, the perianth is around [...] long, and the style around [...] Although the flowering period is lengthy (six months), there are generally only a few flowers at any one time, and a seven-year study <b>at</b> <b>Harry</b> Waring Marsupial Reserve south of Perth revealed fairly constant flowering from year to year, even when shrubs were cut back to ground level to simulate a bushfire.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Bob Marley {{signed with}} CBS Records in London and {{embarked}} on a UK tour with American soul singer Johnny Nash. While in London the Wailers asked their road manager Brent Clarke to introduce them to Chris Blackwell, who had licensed some of their Coxsone releases for his Island Records. The Wailers intended to discuss the royalties associated with these releases; instead the meeting resulted in the offer of an advance of £4,000 to record an album. Since Jimmy Cliff, Island's top reggae star, had recently left the label, Blackwell was primed for a replacement. In Marley, Blackwell recognised the elements needed to snare the rock audience: [...] "I was dealing with rock music, which was really rebel music. I felt that would really {{be the way to}} break Jamaican music. But you needed someone who could be that image. When Bob walked in he really was that image." [...] The Wailers returned to Jamaica to record <b>at</b> <b>Harry</b> J's in Kingston, which resulted in the album Catch a Fire.|$|E
500|$|In February 1900, Lloyd was {{the subject}} of another benefit {{performance}} at the Crown Theatre in Peckham. Kate Carney, Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the main piece, Cinderella, which starred Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie. The same year, although her divorce was not yet finalised, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in Southampton Row, London. Hurley, an established singer of coster songs, regularly appeared on the same bill as Lloyd; his calm nature was a contrast to the abusive personality of Courtenay. Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a tour of Australia in 1901, opening <b>at</b> <b>Harry</b> Rickards Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May with their own version of [...] "The Lambeth Walk". [...] After the successful two-month tour, Lloyd and Hurley returned to London where she appeared in the only revue of her career. Entitled The Revue, it was written by Charles Raymond and Phillip Yorke with lyrics by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi. [...] It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Lloyd and Courtenay's divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906. Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife's popularity. MacQueen-Pope suggested that [...] " [...] was a star who had married a planet. [...] Already the seeds of disaster were being sown." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the book's climax, Voldemort's second Killing Curse hurled <b>at</b> <b>Harry</b> also fails and rebounds upon Voldemort, finally killing him. The spell fails because Harry, not Voldemort, {{had become}} the Elder Wand's true master and the wand could not harm its own master. Harry has each of the Hallows (the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand) {{at some point in}} the story but never unites them. However, J. K. Rowling said the {{difference}} between Harry and Voldemort is that Harry willingly accepts mortality, making him stronger than his nemesis. [...] "The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living." [...] At the very end, Harry decides to leave the Elder Wand in Dumbledore's tomb and the Resurrection Stone hidden in the forest, but he keeps the Invisibility Cloak because it had belonged to his father.|$|E
