25|$|The disunion of 1929-30 and {{the effects}} of Un Cadavre had very little {{negative}} impact upon Surrealism as Breton saw it, since core figures such as Aragon, Crevel, Dalí and Buñuel remained true the idea of group action, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being. The success (or the controversy) of Dalí and Buñuel's film L'Age d'Or in December 1930 had a regenerative effect, drawing a number of new recruits, and encouraging countless new artistic works the following year and throughout the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Although {{prepared}} to grant formal independence to Southern Rhodesia (now Rhodesia), the British government had adopted {{a policy of}} no independence before majority rule, dictating that colonies with a substantial population of European settlers would not receive independence except under conditions of majority rule. Rhodesian colonials initially balked at the suggestion; some felt they {{had a right to}} absolute political control, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being, despite their relatively small numbers. The authorities were also disturbed by the post-independence chaos which was plaguing other African nations at the time. However, once Rhodesia had been introduced as a topic for discussion in international bodies, extension of the status quo became a matter of concern to the world community and a serious embarrassment to the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine–Fatimid treaty {{weakened}} Nasr's {{strategic position}} and {{forced him to}} improve relations with the Fatimids. As early as 1030, Nasr sought Fatimid approval of his rule and dispatched an envoy carrying {{a large amount of}} war booty from Azaz to Caliph az-Zahir. In turn, the caliph accepted Nasr's authority in Aleppo, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being. However, {{there is no indication that}} Nasr paid the Fatimids tribute. Nasr's envoy remained in Cairo for several years and likely did not return to Aleppo until after the accession of Caliph al-Mustansir. Zakkar speculates this indicated discord between Aleppo and Cairo due to Nasr's continued tribute to Byzantium instead of to the Fatimids or Fatimid reservations at Nasr's request for the governorship of Hims.|$|E
25|$|Since shared {{libraries}} on most {{systems do}} not change often, systems can compute a likely load address for each shared library on the system before it is needed, and store that information in the libraries and executables. If every shared library that is loaded has undergone this process, then each will load at its predetermined address, which speeds up the process of dynamic linking. This optimization is known as prebinding in macOS and prelinking in Linux. Disadvantages of this technique include {{the time required to}} precompute these addresses every time the shared libraries change, the inability to use address space layout randomization, and the requirement of sufficient virtual address space for use (a problem that will be alleviated by the adoption of 64-bit architectures, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being).|$|E

The Nawab due to his connections with the British administrators and also due to his friendship with Sikander was not in favour of severing links with the Unionist party. Moreover, it seems that Jinnah would have made his own calculations that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being playing for time was the best policy in dealing with Sir Sikandar Hayat's policies based on maintaining the status quo model in Punjab politics.

25|$|According to President Chen Shui-bian who was President of the Republic of China between 2000 and 2008, China {{accelerated}} {{the deployment of}} missiles against Taiwan up to 120 a year (May 2007), bringing the total arsenal to 706 ballistic missiles capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads that are aimed at Taiwan. Some believe that their deployment is a political tool {{on the part of}} the PRC to increase political pressure on Taiwan to abandon unilateral moves toward formal independence, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being, although the PRC government never declares such deployment publicly.. Legislative elections were held in Taiwan on January 12, 2008. The results gave the Kuomintang and the Pan-Blue Coalition a supermajority (86 of the 113 seats) in the legislature, handing a heavy defeat to President Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party, which won the remaining 27 seats only. The junior partner in the Pan-Green Coalition, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, won no seats. The election for the 12th-term President and Vice-President of the Republic of China was held in the Republic of China (Taiwan) on Saturday, March 22, 2008. Kuomintang nominee Ma Ying-jeou won, with 58% of the vote, ending eight years of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential power. Along with the 2008 legislative election, Ma's landslide victory brought the Kuomintang back to power in Taiwan.|$|E

[...] The review described the latter portion of the book as [...] "a more intense personal chronicle of Godwin's deep involvement {{in what he calls}} the 'cyberporn panic' – the push to control Internet content." [...] Columbia Journalism Review concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Godwin shows, this strong response laid the groundwork for lawsuits that enabled the Supreme Court to declare the 'decency' amendment unconstitutional. He was in the thick of things throughout this effort, and his journal lets the reader relive the tension and uncertainty of trying to halt a media stampede before it crushed everything in its path." ...|$|E
500|$|Larkin {{began at}} Oxford University in October 1940, {{a year after}} the {{outbreak}} of Second World War. The old upper class traditions of university life had, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being, faded, and most of the male students were studying for highly truncated degrees. Due to his poor eyesight, Larkin failed his military medical examination and was able to study for the usual three years. Through his tutorial partner, Norman Iles, he met Kingsley Amis, who encouraged his taste for ridicule and irreverence and who remained a close friend throughout Larkin's life. Amis, Larkin and other university friends formed a group they dubbed [...] "The Seven", meeting to discuss each other's poetry, listen to jazz, and drink enthusiastically. During this time he had his first real social interaction with the opposite sex, but made no romantic headway. In 1943 he sat his finals, and, having dedicated much of his time to his own writing, was greatly surprised at being awarded a first-class honours degree.|$|E

[...] He noted the {{experimental}} style of the tracks, which he credited to the experimental style of the game itself {{as well as the}} relative newness of the genre of video game music at the time. Reviewer Patrick Gann of RPGFan received the album well, saying that he enjoyed the variety of genres presented in it, though he noted that the lyrics were [...] "trite and cheesy", though still [...] "catchy". He also applauded the production value, calling it [...] "incredible, especially for 1989". Square Enix Music Online, in their review of the album, called it [...] "a happy little gem with quirks and surprises". Though unlike RPGFan they felt that the sound production quality was not as good as it could be, they still felt that the pieces had [...] "stood the test of time in terms of good music".|$|E

500|$|Goldstone was {{hindered}} by the inflexible bureaucracy of the UN, finding {{the newly established}} ICTY in a shambles {{when he joined the}} tribunal. The tribunal lacked political legitimacy, financial support and prosecutorial direction; its failure to even bring any prosecutions had led to it being criticised by the media as [...] "a fig leaf for inaction", and Goldstone was asked by the former British prime minister Edward Heath: [...] "Why did you accept such a ridiculous job?" [...] He had to make repeated appeals to the UN's hierarchy and to donor nations for the equipment and funding that the tribunal needed to operate. He quickly found that the key to the job was to take [...] " [...] big-picture diplomatic role and [...] that the hands-on prosecution work could be pushed down to experienced prosecutors and investigators like [...] Blewitt – <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being." [...] He undertook a flurry of media appearances and financial negotiations that led to the tribunal being properly staffed for the first time, with many staff being recruited through his own personal networks; a budget of eight million dollars from thirteen countries, supplemented by a $300,000 donation from George Soros; and the first indictment, of Bosnian Serb prison camp guard Duško Tadić.|$|E
500|$|By April 1853 the {{situation}} had become very acrimonuous. [...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a conductive path through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte). [...] This resulted in the Journal removing the Pulvermacher advertisements from its pages. [...] The Association Medical Journal was quickly followed by the Medical Times and with growing pressure on The Lancet to do the same this pretty much ended professional medical support for the device, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, Boganda was {{urged by}} the Bishop of Bangui, Mgr Grandin, to {{complement}} his humanitarian and social works through political action. Boganda {{decided to run}} for election to the National Assembly of France. On 10 November 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the assembly after winning almost half of the total votes cast and defeating three other candidates, including the outgoing incumbent, François Joseph Reste, who had formerly served as the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa. Boganda arrived in Paris attired in his clerical garb and introduced himself to his fellow legislators as the son of a polygamous cannibal. From 1947 on, Boganda conducted a lively campaign against racism and the colonial regime. Soon realizing the limits of his influence in France (he served in parliament until 1958 but gradually detached himself from its activities), he returned to Oubangui-Chari to organise a grassroots movement of teachers, truck drivers and small producers to oppose French colonialism, although his previous attempt to set up a marketing cooperative among African planters of his own ethnicity had failed. On 28 September 1949, at Bangui, he founded the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), a quasi-religious political movement and party that sought to affirm black humanity and quickly came to dominate local politics. His political creed was summed up in the Sango phrase [...] "zo kwe zo", which translated to [...] "every human being is a person". Effectively, he was looking for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks within the French Union rather than independence, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> being. He demarginalised large masses of people—women, youth, workers, poor cultivators—with the intent of unleashing the creativity of the Oubanguian people by placing them centre stage in the making of their country's history.|$|E
