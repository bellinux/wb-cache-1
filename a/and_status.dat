40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{patterning}} of health by family <b>status</b> <b>and</b> employment <b>status</b> among women in Finland and Sweden and to explore whether the patterning of health by family status is influenced by employment <b>status</b> <b>and</b> income. An additional aim was to identify which combinations of family <b>status</b> <b>and</b> employment <b>status</b> are especially disadvantageous for women's health. The data derived from comparable interview surveys carried out in 1994 / 1995. The analyses were restricted to ages 25 - 49; 2282 women in Finland and 2685 in Sweden. Firstly, age-adjusted prevalence percentages were presented by family <b>status</b> <b>and</b> employment <b>status.</b> Secondly, the patterning of health by family <b>status</b> <b>and</b> employment <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> the influence of adjusting for income, were studied by logistic regression analysis. The main results showed that women living in couples with children had the best health in both countries. Additional analyses showed that in Finland particularly poor health can be found among women who are simultaneously non-partnered and non-employed, whereas in Sweden poor health can be found among all non-employed groups of women. Income did not explain the poor health among the non-partnered and non-employed. This study confirmed that health is patterned by family <b>status</b> <b>and</b> employment <b>status</b> both among Finnish and Swedish women. It was found that non-employed women without a partner are likely to have poor health. In order to reduce inequalities in health among women, more efforts should be put on promoting health among these groups. Women Family Health Employment Finland Sweden...|$|R

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth <b>and</b> <b>status.</b> One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
5|$|Decades {{of civil}} war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly {{to the demise of}} the old {{aristocracy}} of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during {{the early part of the}} 1st century.

The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of the Han throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design in this scene further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class <b>and</b> <b>status</b> differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E
5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units, themselves replaced by {{the men of the}} 827th. This was contentious, however; the number <b>and</b> <b>status</b> of segregated combat units was a matter of intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E

5|$|In October 1995, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center {{relocated}} {{its operations}} to Norman, Oklahoma, and was rechristened the Storm Prediction Center.

In 1998, the Center began issuing the National Fire Weather Outlook to provide forecasts for areas potentially susceptible to the development and spread of wildfires based on certain meteorological factors. The Day 3 Convective Outlook (which is similar in format to the Day 2 forecast) was first issued on an experimental basis in 2000, and was made an official product in 2001.|$|E

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore which demographic <b>and</b> health <b>status</b> variables moderated the relationship between psychological distress and three nutrition indicators: the consumption of fruits, vegetables and takeaway. - Method We analysed data from the 2009 Self-Reported Health Status Survey Report collected in the state of Queensland, Australia. Adults (N = 6881) reported several demographic <b>and</b> health <b>status</b> variables. Moderated logistic regression models were estimated separately for the three nutrition indicators, testing as moderators demographic (age, gender, educational attainment, household income, remoteness, <b>and</b> area-level socioeconomic <b>status)</b> <b>and</b> health <b>status</b> indicators (body mass index, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, <b>and</b> diabetes <b>status).</b> - Results Several significant interactions emerged between psychological distress, demographic (age, area-level socioeconomic <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> income level), <b>and</b> health <b>status</b> variables (body mass index, diabetes status) in predicting the nutrition indicators. Relationships between distress and the nutrition indicators were not significantly different by gender, remoteness, educational attainment, high cholesterol <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> high blood pressure status. - Conclusions The associations between psychological distress and several nutrition indicators differ amongst population subgroups. These findings suggest that in distressed adults, age, area-level socio-economic status, income level, body mass index, <b>and</b> diabetes <b>status</b> may serve as protective or risk factors through increasing or decreasing the likelihood of meeting nutritional guidelines. Public health interventions for improving dietary behaviours and nutrition may be more effective if they take into account the moderators identified in this study rather than using global interventions...|$|R
