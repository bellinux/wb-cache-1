Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe <b>and</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.|$|E

5|$|When Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, the Belzer Rebbe, {{was hiding}} from the Nazis in the Kraków Ghetto in 1942, he {{accepted}} a kvitel {{from one of}} the men who was assigned to protect him.
