50|$|These {{centralized}} systems {{consisted of}} an <b>air</b> <b>exhauster,</b> a dust filter (with detachable dust container), and wrought iron pipes {{run through the}} building, to which flexible hoses could be fitted for use in individual rooms.|$|E
40|$|Some {{preventive}} measures to counter vibration disease in an iron foundry were investigated. The servo-arm with a servo-mechanism for the portable vibrating tool {{was developed and}} introduced. Vibration acceleration level, noise level and dust exposure level of servo-arm equipped chipping-hammer were reduced by 25 to 30 dB, about 10 dB and three fourth respectively, compared with the chipping-hammer operated directly. This servo-arm reduced also the temporary shifts of vibratory sensation threshold and pinching power during the operation time. The polishing room with a local <b>air</b> <b>exhauster</b> 150 m^ 3 /min) and two infrared lamps (3 kw× 2) were {{set up in the}} foundry...|$|E
50|$|While {{making an}} {{important}} statement for CNG technology, the Charger R/T was equally {{appealing to the}} design community. It had functional side scoops, as does the Dodge Viper, and the chrome plated, central mounted exhaust was somewhat reminiscent of the Viper. It even has functional <b>air</b> <b>exhausters</b> sculpted into its rear fascia.|$|R
5000|$|A {{machinery}} compartment {{behind each}} cab housed auxiliary gear such as two motor generator sets, one of [...] {{and the other}} of , each coupled to a blower fan on its shaft for ventilating the main motors. In addition it contained a motor-driven rotary vacuum <b>exhauster,</b> <b>air</b> compressor, air reservoirs for the brakes, low-tension control contactors and resistances for the auxiliaries and battery, together with contactor gear for controlling the field of the larger motor generator.|$|R
40|$|AbstractExpressor is {{a device}} used in railway locomotives, {{consisting}} of two individual units called the compressor and exhauster. Compressor is used to compress the <b>air</b> and the <b>exhauster</b> is used to create vacuum. The function of the intercooler in expressor is to cool the air, which {{comes out of the}} low-pressure compressor, and send it to the highpressure compressor. The main objective of this work is {{to increase the amount of}} heat transfer from the hot air when it is passed through the Intercooler. This is accomplished by making modifications in the existing fin of the tubes in intercooler. The best designs for maximum heat transfer is chosen by varying three parameters namely fin material, shape of the fin and thickness of the pipe using Taguchi's Design of Experiments (DoE). Using ANSYS, analysis software, the analysis is carried out and the output response parameters are analyzed using Signal-to-Noise ratio. An validation analysis is performed with the optimum control parameters and the output responses are analyzed, which shows an improved heat transfer...|$|R
5000|$|A third example, NIR 106/CIÉ 227 was {{preserved}} privately {{and displayed}} at Cahirciveen, County Kerry http://users.chariot.net.au/~nldoncas/nicspages/images/train%206.JPG http://users.chariot.net.au/~nldoncas/nicspages/the_irish_crossleys.htm and carries the number C202, which was supposedly {{the number of}} the locomotive hauling the last train from Cahirciveen in 1960 but it was in fact both 227 and 201 which worked the last up and down trains. Irish Rail recovered the engine for reuse in its 141/181 class locomotives. This locomotive and its three remaining siblings were stored in a unprotected site on NIR. Metal theft at this stage rendered it and its sisters a write off as far as ever running again was concerned. Whilst scrapping of its sisters was taking place this locomotive was further stripped of almost all internal equipment (compressor, <b>exhauster,</b> <b>air</b> tanks, cooler fan, etc) before being moved to Cahirsiveen in 1997. The locomotive was cosmetically restored and repainted in silver and renumbered C202. The almost empty engine room was floored with plywood. While in Cahirsiveen the body suffered extensive corrosion from 7 years of open air display near the sea and its windows were smashed again.http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:Q7YRTZ1pgDkJ:www.unison.ie/irish_independent/stories.php3%3Fca%3D9%26si%3D1443335%26issue_id%3D12810+c202+acard&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=5 An arson attack on the locomotive as well as its [...] "eye sore" [...] appearance on the landscape meant that scrapping was becoming very likely. In around 2004, the locomotive was saved from scrapping {{by a member of the}} now defunct [...] "A15r sic Group and moved from Caherciveen to a site used by a heritage railway, the Waterford and Suir Valley Railway, at Bilberry, Waterford with the intention of being restored as part of a scheme to reopen the New Ross railway. However, during her time in Bilberry the locomotive was further vandalised. The plywood floor was ripped up and any remaining traction motor cable was cut out by metal thieves. The locomotive also suffered further deterioration due to being stored in the open with rainwater entering through broken windows and rotten roof panels. In 2010, the locomotive was relocated to a more secure site near Kilmacow village, and traveled the 10 km journey to this premises in Kilmacow by road on a low loader. It is believed that the wish of the current owners is still that 227 will be restored at least cosmetically, but this seems unlikey. As of July 2016, the locomotive remained in its derelict state at the Kilmacow site along with several other Bord na Mona locomotives and a Wickham inspection car.|$|R
