6000|$|As to Friedrich Wilhelm, {{his plan}} in 1717, as all along, in this bewitched state of matters, was: To fortify his Frontier Towns; Memel, Wesel, {{to the right}} and left, {{especially}} to fortify Stettin, his new acquisition;--and to put his Army, and his Treasury (or Army-CHEST), more and more in order. In that way we shall better meet whatever goblins there may be, thinks Friedrich Wilhelm. Count Lottum, hero of the Prussians at Malplaquet, is doing his scientific uttermost in Stettin and those Frontier Towns. For the rest, his Majesty, invited by the Czar and France, has been found willing to make paction with them, as he is with all pacific neighbors. In fact, the Czar and he had their private Conference, at Havelberg, last year,--Havelberg, some sixty miles from Berlin, on the road towards Denmark, as Peter was passing that way;--ample Conference of five days; [23d-28th November, 1716: Fassmann, p. 172.]--privately agreeing there, about many points conducive to tranquillity. And it was on that same errand, though ostensibly to look after Art and the higher forms of Civilization so called, that Peter had been to France on this celebrated occasion of 1717. We know he saw much Art withal; saw Marly, Trianon and the grandeurs and politenesses;--saw, among other things, [...] "a Medal of himself fall accidentally at his feet;" [...] polite Medal [...] "just getting struck in the Mint, with a rising sun on it; and the motto, VIRES ACQUIRIT EUNDO." [...] [Voltaire, OEuvres Completes (Histoire du Czar Pierre), xxxi. 336.--Kohler in Munzbelustigungen, xvii. 386-392 (this very MEDAL the subject), gives authentic <b>account,</b> <b>day</b> by day, of the Czar's visit there.] Ostensibly it was to see CETTE BELLE FRANCE; but privately withal the Czar wished to make his bargain, with the Regent d'Orleans, as to these goblins walking in the Northern and Southern parts, and what was to be done with them. And the result has been, the Czar, Friedrich Wilhelm and the said Regent have just concluded an Agreement; [4th August, 1717; Buchholz, i. 43.] undertaking in general, that the goblins shall be well watched; that they Three will stand by one another in watching them. And now the Czar will visit Berlin in passing homewards again. That is the position of affairs, when he pays this visit. Peter had been in Berlin more than once before; but almost always in a succinct rapid condition; never with his [...] "Court" [...] about him till now. This is his last, and by far his greatest, appearance in Berlin.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} {{portfolio}} allocation based on time asymmetry of stock characteristics. In particular, we analyzed the empirical data {{of changes in}} financial stock prices during the day period and during the night period and have found that characteristics such as mean and variance are different for changes {{during the day and}} changes during the night. Also, the portfolio characteristics, such as covariance between stocks, differ on whether we take into <b>account</b> <b>day</b> changes or night changes in prices. That greatly affects the allocation of fund to the portfolio for an investor who trades frequently. The portfolio should be re-balanced every day in order to achieve optimality and much higher return. At the same level of risk the returns on this new portfolio may by several times larger than the returns on a portfolio without everyday re-balancing. We computed numerically the allocation of funds for the stocks from the finance industry and showed that the increase in returns is substantial...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the influence of working capital management {{on the performance of}} SMEs in Ghana. Both descriptive and correlational research design was adopted for the study. The annual financial statements from 2011 to 2015 of SMEs in the Greater Accra, Ashanti and Brong Ahafo Regions of Ghana were examined. The study adopted availability/convenience sampling technique to select four hundred (400) SMEs. The impact of working capital management on the performance of SMEs in Ghana was established through the use of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression technique. Average Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) was proxied as the measure of performance whilst average cash conversion period, average <b>account</b> receivable <b>days,</b> average inventory turnover <b>days</b> and average <b>account</b> payable <b>days</b> were used as proxies for working capital management. The study found that cash conversion period, <b>account</b> receivable <b>days</b> and inventory turnover days were significantly and negatively related to performance. On the other hand, <b>account</b> payable <b>days</b> was ascertained to have a positive relation with performance. It is thus concluded that effective working capital management impacts on the performance of SMEs. The implication of these results is that by decreasing the cash conversion period, <b>account</b> receivable <b>days</b> and inventory turnover days, the SMEs can increase their profitability. The study recommends that the SMEs should consider a reduction in the cash conversion period, average <b>account</b> receivable <b>days</b> and average inventory turnover days. The SMEs must also consider negotiating for favourable terms of payments with their suppliers...|$|R

40|$|Objective - This study {{aimed to}} compare dietary intake {{of older people}} with {{dementia}} receiving day care at regular day care facilities (RDCFs) or at so-called green care farms (GCFs). Design and settings - A comparative cross-sectional study was performed at 10 GCFs and 10 RDCFs in the Netherlands. Participants - 30 subjects from GCFs and 23 subjects from RDCFs, aged 65 years or over, {{were included in the}} study. Subjects from GCFs were mostly married males who were aged younger than the subjects from RDCFs who were mostly widowed females. Measurements - Dietary intake of the subjects was observed and/or recorded both at home and during their time at the day care facility. Results - In the GCF group, average total energy intake was significantly higher than in the RDCF group (8. 8 MJ/d vs. 7. 2 MJ/d). Also total carbohydrates and protein intakes were higher in the GCF group than in the RDCF group (with 257 g/d vs. 204 g/d, and 76 g/d vs. 65 g/d respectively). In addition, average total fluid intake was significantly higher in the GCF group than in the RDCF group (2577 g/d vs. 1973 g/d). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that after taking possible confounders into <b>account,</b> <b>day</b> care type was still significantly related to the intake of energy, carbohydrates and fluids. Conclusion - This study suggests beneficial effects of this new type of day care on dietary intake by community-dwelling older people with dementia...|$|E

40|$|The cash {{conversion}} cycle (CCC) is {{the difference}} in time between the expenditures for purchases of medical inventory and services provided to patients, and the collection of revenues from those services. Data from hospitals for the State of Washington from 2002 - 2011 were used to study {{the relationship between the}} CCC and hospital profitability. A fixed effects analysis revealed that a 10 day lower than average CCC was associated with an operating margin 0. 13 points higher than average. The overall CCC relationship to operating margin is largely attributable to management of inventory. The associations between <b>days</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable and <b>days</b> <b>accounts</b> payable and operating margins were insignificantly different from zero. <b>Days</b> <b>accounts</b> payable was positively related to total profit margin.
