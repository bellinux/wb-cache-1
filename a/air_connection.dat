25|$|Following {{the signing}} of the Communications Agreement, on 3 July 1971 the Argentine Air Force broke the islands' airways {{isolation}} by opening an air route with an amphibious flight from Comodoro Rivadavia with Grumman HU-16B Albatross aircraft operated by LADE, Argentina's military airline. In 1972, after an Argentine request, the United Kingdom agreed to allow Argentina to construct a temporary air strip near Stanley. On 15 November 1972 a temporary runway was inaugurated with the first arrival of a Fokker F-27; subsequent flights arrived twice weekly. Flights were improved in 1978 with Fokker F-28 jets, after the completion of a permanent runway funded by the British Government. This service, the only <b>air</b> <b>connection</b> to the islands, was maintained until the 1982 war.|$|E
2500|$|Malaysia Airlines, Malaysia's flag carrier, traces {{its origins}} back to 1947, when Malayan Airways was jointly formed by Singapore's Straits Steamship Company and the Ocean Steamship Company of Liverpool.

2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the long range of the aircraft, the RAAF used the Catalina as a passenger and mail carrier during the war. The Fall of Singapore to the Japanese Army in 1942 cut Australia's <b>air</b> <b>connection</b> to Britain. To reestablish communications, an extreme range flight route was planned. Former Qantas Airlines pilots were employed to fly a [...] nonstop route from Perth to Ceylon in modified Catalinas, a route which {{was at that time}} the longest flight path in history without refueling. The modified Catalinas had their crews reduced to 3 and were loaded with extra fuel and [...] of diplomatic and armed forces mail. Dubbed The Double Sunrise, these top secret flights remain the longest nonstop commercial flights in terms of airtime at 32 hours 9 minutes.|$|E
