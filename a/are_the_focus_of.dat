5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the playable races, {{there are two other}} non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. These ancient races were thought extinct, and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game's storylines. The game features several typical Final Fantasy fiends, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting self-awareness, emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{acts as a}} {{link between}} the other main {{characters}} of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the scene. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but was not sure whether {{it would be in the}} manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They {{are not limited to}} following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E
5|$|In StarCraft, the Zerg are {{obsessed with}} the pursuit of genetic purity, and <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the game's second episode. With the Xel'Nagaempowered Protoss {{targeted}} as the ultimate lifeform, the Zerg invade the Terran colonies in the Koprulu Sector to assimilate the Terrans' psionic potential and give the Zerg an edge over the Protoss. Through {{the actions of the}} Sons of Korhal, the Zerg are lured to the Confederate capital Tarsonis, where they capture the psionic ghost agent Sarah Kerrigan and infest her. Returning to the Zerg base of operations on Char, the Zerg are attacked by the dark templar Zeratul, who accidentally gives the location of the Protoss homeworld Aiur to the Zerg Overmind. With victory in sight, the Overmind launches an invasion of Aiur and manifests itself on the planet. However, {{at the end of the}} game, the Protoss high templar Tassadar sacrifices himself to destroy the Overmind, leaving the Zerg to run rampant and leaderless across the planet.|$|E

5|$|People who stutter include British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, orator Demosthenes, King George VI, actor James Earl Jones, {{and country}} singer Mel Tillis. Churchill, whose stutter was {{particularly}} apparent to 1920s writers, {{was one of}} the 30% of stutterers who have an associated speech disorder—a lisp in his case—yet led his nation through World War II. Demosthenes stammered and was inarticulate as a youth, yet, through dedicated practice, using methods such as placing pebbles in his mouth, became a great orator of Ancient Greece. King George VI hired speech therapist Lionel Logue to enable him to speak to his Empire, and Logue effectively helped him accomplish this goal. This training and its results <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> the 2010 film The King's Speech. James Earl Jones has stated he was mute for many years of his youth yet he became an actor noted for the power of his voice. Mel Tillis stutters when talking but not when singing. Many people had their speech impediment only as a child and have overcome their condition.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, mould fungi have been {{exploited}} to create {{a wide range of}} industrial products, including enzymes and drugs. Medicines based on fungi include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, statins and many anti-cancer drugs. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important model organism in cell biology. The fruiting bodies of some larger fungi are collected as edible mushrooms, including delicacies like the chanterelle, cep, and truffle, while a few species are cultivated. Mould fungi provide the meaty (umami) flavour of fermented soybean products such as tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and contribute flavour and colour to blue cheeses including Roquefort and Stilton. Moulds also yield vegetarian meat substitutes like Quorn. Some fungi, especially the fly agaric and psilocybin mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain; these in particular <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> academic study in the field of ethnomycology.|$|E
