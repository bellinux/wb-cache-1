40|$|Characteristics of <b>autoclaved,</b> and <b>autoclaved</b> then acetylated, ae, wx {{and normal}} maize {{starches}} were studied. Prior <b>autoclaving</b> decreased {{the degree of}} acetylation of all the starches. After <b>autoclaving</b> the gelatinization peak temperature (Tp) increased and peak viscosity (PV) generally decreased. The Tp of <b>autoclaved</b> then acetylated starches increased and PV decreased compared with acetylated native starches except for waxy starch which showed a higher PV. <b>Autoclaving</b> increased hardness and adhesiveness of waxy and normal starches, but decreased that of ae starches. Acetylation decreased hardness of all the native and <b>autoclaved</b> starches. <b>Autoclaving</b> decreased swelling power and solubility of all the starches except waxy. Acetylation increased swelling power and solubility of all the native and <b>autoclaved</b> starches. <b>Autoclaving</b> decreased clarity and digestibility of all the starches. <b>Autoclaved</b> starches increased less in clarity and more in digestibility than native starches after acetylation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antimicrobial effect of different copaiba oil concentrations against the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, and analyze differences in inhibition of microorganisms with <b>autoclaved</b> and non <b>autoclaved</b> oil. This study provided an agar diffusion test with six isolates of bacteria and six different concentrations of <b>autoclaved</b> or non <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil and a negative control. The results showed sensitivity of five L. monocytogenes isolates related to the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil. Four strains also showed sensitivity to the 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution and one to 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution. The 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> oil solution showed growth inhibition only for two strains. These results had pointed the 10 % <b>autoclaved</b> solution of copaiba oil with higher inhibition as all other solutions and concentrations tested (P< 0. 05). For the other concentrations of both solutions, the 5 and 2. 5 % <b>autoclaved</b> and 10 % non <b>autoclaved</b> solutions had presented statistically equal. All other concentrations of both copaiba solutions and the negative control did not presented any bacteria inhibition. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the <b>autoclaved</b> copaiba oil may be a potential new agent source for infection control or for food preservation, inhibiting the growth of food-borne bacteria such as L. monocytogenes...|$|R
5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from the surroundings. As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an <b>autoclave</b> is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam <b>autoclave</b> {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Commercial, dehulled, solvent-extracted {{soybean meal}} (DSBM) was overprocessed by <b>autoclaving</b> at 121 C and 105 kPa for 0, 20, 40, or 60 min. Analyzed {{concentrations}} (acid hydrolysis followed by ion-exchange chroma-tography) of lysine and cystine, {{and to a}} lesser extent arginine, in DSBM were reduced by increased <b>autoclaving</b> time. <b>Autoclaving</b> time had little or no effect on levels of other amino acids. Performance of chicks fed 40 -min <b>autoclaved</b> DSBM as the sole source of dietary protein was inferior to that of chicks fed unautoclaved DSBM. True digestibilities of several amino acids in DSBM decreased (P<. 05) as <b>autoclaving</b> time increased, with the largest decreases being observed for lysine, cystine, histidine, and aspartic acid. The effect of <b>autoclaving</b> on lysine was due both to reduced concentration of analyzed lysine and reduced digestibility of the lysine remaining after <b>autoclaving.</b> True digestibilities of most amino acids determined in conventional cockerels were higher (P<. 05) than those determined in cecectomized cockerels.

Some common features of <b>autoclaves</b> that differentiate them from competing technologies are as follows. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the moist-heat method to sterilize and deactivate refuse in a large pressure vessel where saturated steam is injected. The end product is completely sanitized and even previously bio-hazardous waste can be discarded in a normal municipal landfill. <b>Autoclaves</b> employ the same method of sterilization as converters, but do so using larger and more complex equipment that also has higher safety and energy consumption requirements. In a majority of cases, <b>autoclaves</b> are hub-and-spoke operations requiring regional treatment centers and a supply chain.|$|R

To evaluate the performance, rats born from females receiving or not <b>autoclaving</b> diets during the gestation were distributed in a randomized experimental design, with two treatments and a one-animal experimental unit. The diet used for female rats in gestation did not influence the weight of the rats either at birth or during the weaning period. As for digestibility and performance assays, rats from both kinds of females (with and without <b>autoclaving</b> diets during gestation) were distributed in a 2 x 2 factorial outline (normal or <b>autoclaving</b> diets until weaning versus normal or <b>autoclaving</b> diets after weaning). There was a reduction in the digestive use of the <b>autoclaving</b> diet gross energy after weaning and a worsening in the alimentary conversion in the period up to 42 days.
