5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol <b>abuse.</b> Increasing the age at which licit drugs of <b>abuse</b> such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and <b>abuse.</b> Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol <b>abuse</b> have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol <b>abuse</b> amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.|$|E

40|$|Behaviors of {{influence}} and response during a conflict negotiation task {{were examined in}} eight physically child <b>abusing,</b> substance <b>abusing</b> families in which the father was the primary abuser and eight demographically matched nonabusing families. <b>Abusing</b> fathers displayed more coercive patterns of influencing behavior and more negative patterns of response to other family members, including both mothers and children. Fewer differences were observed between mothers in the <b>abusing</b> and nonabusing families or in the children's behavior; however, mothers in the <b>abusing</b> families criticized their husbands more and <b>abused</b> children exhibited less agreement and more criticism toward their fathers. In support of Patterson's theory, <b>abusing</b> families exhibited relatively more reciprocated sequences of criticism and relatively fewer reciprocated sequences of agreement as compared to nonabusing families.

40|$|Risk {{behaviors}} were compared between sexually <b>abused</b> and nonabused youth living with HIV (YLH). <b>Abused</b> YLH {{were significantly more}} likely to have attempted sui-cide, to have been admitted into an alcohol and/or drug treatment program, and to have engaged in crack cocaine use than were nonabused YLH and had a greater num-ber of sexual partners. A significantly higher proportion of <b>abused</b> YLH had been incarcerated in contrast to nonabused youth. There were also significantly greater conduct problems among <b>abused</b> YLH. Finally, <b>abused</b> YLH had significantly higher scores on positive action and social-support coping styles than nonabused youth. Consistent with previous research, <b>abused</b> youth are at higher risk for a variety of negative outcomes and are also similar in many respects to sexually <b>abused</b> youth who are not HIV-positive.

5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of <b>abuse</b> and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its <b>abuse</b> was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol <b>abuse</b> and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and <b>abuse</b> was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

However, there are <b>abuses</b> of feasibility study occurred in construction industry in which this issue is seldom being given attention by the developers.

The research data are collected by using postal questionnaires to 109 developers in Johor, Malaysia. Statistical analysis is used for data analysis in this research.
