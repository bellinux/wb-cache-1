5|$|Near the Potawatomi Zoo are the Potawatomi Greenhouses and the Ella Morris and Muessel-Ellison Botanical Conservatories.

5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> her own garden. In {{a letter to a}} friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{revenue was}} 816,444 francs, {{and the company}} paid a {{dividend}} of 555,500 francs. The company was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> its rates without reducing traffic. In 1822, the canal earned almost a million francs from carrying 243,200 tons of coal and 96,000 tons of other merchandise. The concession holders had repaid most of the debts they had incurred to build the canal, including many improvements since it was opened, {{and were able to}} pay healthy dividends. By 1824, the canal was giving annual revenues of 850,000 francs. An 1824 account described a superb water station at Givors on the right bank of the Rhone, an excellent basin at Rive-de-Gier for loading, fine buildings for administration of the canal and spacious shops and warehouses.|$|E
5|$|In the Republican gubernatorial primary, the Williams-Farmer ticket {{defeated}} businessman Phil Moffett {{and former}} Jefferson County Judge/Executive Bobbie Holsclaw.

Holsclaw won the voting in her home county of Jefferson, which contains the city of Louisville and is the state's most populous. Moffett, a Tea Party favorite, carried the second most populous county, Fayette (which contains Lexington), as well as heavily-populated Daviess, McCracken, and Warren counties, and several counties in Northern and Central Kentucky.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} nine {{reference}} strains of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (serovars A-I) <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> detectable, hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies in immunized specific-pathogen-free chickens was investigated. Six {{of the nine}} O. rhinotracheale serovar (A-H) reference strains raised detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies 14 and 21 days after vaccination. Detectable serum hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers ranged from 512 - 16348. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopic examination of a hemagglutinating reference strain (B 3263 / 91, serovar A) demonstrated a close interaction between the bacterial and chicken erythrocyte surfaces. The results indicate {{that most of the}} hemagglutinating O. rhinotracheale reference strains included in this study are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raised</b> detectable hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies in immunized specific-pathogen-free chickens. The findings have the potential to become an alternative laboratory approach for detecting serum antibodies from chickens immunized with O. rhinotracheale...|$|R
5|$|Wayne {{originally}} intended to use Kentucky militiamen in preemptive strikes against the Indians and to conduct the main invasion using only federal troops, {{but by the time}} he moved to Fort Washington in mid-1793, he had assembled fewer than 3,000 of the 5,000 troops he had anticipated. He now requested that Scott's and Logan's men join his main force. Logan flatly refused to cooperate with a federal officer, but Scott eventually agreed, and Wayne commissioned him an officer in the federal army on July 1, 1793. He and Governor Isaac Shelby instituted a draft to raise the 1,500 troops he was to command in Wayne's operation. When he joined Wayne at Fort Jefferson on October 21, 1793, he had only been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> 1,000 men.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. entered World War II {{at the end}} of 1941, Lombard {{traveled}} to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother, Bess Peters, and Clark Gable's press agent, Otto Winkler.

Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was anxious to reach home more quickly and wanted to fly by a scheduled airline.

Their powers and responsibilities are regulated through the Local Government Act of British Columbia, the Community Charter, and, in the case of Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter. They have the power of a natural person, the power to expropriate, and the power to establish and enforce bylaws.

5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still had to raise the capital for the construction works. The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> its funds without difficulty.

5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health.

Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

On arrival he had taken the name Thomas Castro from an acquaintance from Melipilla and had wandered for some years before settling in Wagga Wagga. He had married a pregnant housemaid, Mary Ann Bryant, and taken her child, a daughter, as his own; a further daughter had been born in March 1866.|$|E
5|$|Most {{commonly}} {{employed as}} a right-handed opening batsman, Sainsbury was one of Somerset's most talented batsman during their formative years. His slow underarm bowling was effective in second-class cricket, but {{in an era when}} overarm bowling was becoming the standard, he was used sparingly in the first-class game. During his time at Somerset, the county gained first-class status. After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury's Lansdown team-mate Stephen Newton, Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season. A combination of poor results and not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a full eleven during that season led to the county's removal from the first-class game, although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888. By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first-class cricket in 1891, Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire, where he saw out his county cricket career.|$|E
5|$|The English {{attacked}} the Temple Gate {{on the first}} day but were beaten off. Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously, without success. Before {{the end of the first}} week of the siege, reinforcements arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil. On the eighth day (15 June) Despenser {{attacked the}} defences with artillery, firing on the Messines Gate and damaging it, but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached. Over the following days of the siege, sustained artillery attacks had little overall effect and the assaults of Despenser's troops were all beaten off. An attempt to drain the ditches seriously threatened the Yprois, but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the Duke of Burgundy through Louis le Mâle, who was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a large French army to come to the aid of the city. On 8 August, after eight weeks of effort, Despenser abruptly decided to abandon the siege, leaving his allies to continue on their own.|$|E
