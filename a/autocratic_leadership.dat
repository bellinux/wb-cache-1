He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. With the fear of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E

Interviews with all participants and a questionnaire addressing a sample of 154 teachers were used to collect data.

40|$|International audienceThe {{debate is}} still raging among {{leadership}} and organizational behaviour researchers: which leadership style leads to better {{job satisfaction and}} work performance among team members? From autocratic to participative management, various models coexist in organizations and have evolved over time to reflect societal changes and expectations. Similarly governance issues in business-format franchising should also be scrutinized. Traditionally, business-format franchising {{has been based on}} a directive leadership model where franchisors develop the rules while franchisees execute the strategy. Deviating from the traditional model of concept uniformity, certain franchisors have implemented new forms of leadership throughout their franchise network and have fostered innovation, creative and entrepreneurial spirit in their franchisees. These new models take different forms and shapes and are called ‘freedom franchise’, ‘quasi-franchise’ or ‘entrepreneurial franchise’. The purpose of the chapter is to investigate the various forms of autonomy in business-format franchising and to research the viability and the justification of autonomy in business-format franchising. A parallel could be made with the research in the field of <b>leadership.</b> <b>Autocratic</b> versus democratic <b>leadership</b> styles lead to different results in terms of productivity, and employee satisfaction in particular. And, more recently, transformational leadership has been linked to innovativeness and creativity in corporations. This chapter is a conceptual chapter that lays the foundations for future research opportunities based on existing leadership models that may predict future directions in governance models for business-format franchising...|$|R

Hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that [...] "Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all." [...] One of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common. Groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task. Groups prefer leaders who are elected, democratic, and prototypical of the group, and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation. A general aversion to <b>autocratic</b> <b>leadership</b> exists, although it may be an effective solution, possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption.|$|E

Back in Moscow, he spent much of his time feuding with other Hungarian Communist émigrés, several of whom he denounced to the Soviet secret police, the OGPU, which arrested and imprisoned them in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During the Comintern's [...] "Third Period" [...] from 1928 to 1935, Kun was a prominent supporter of the Social Fascism line that equated the moderate left as [...] "social fascism" [...] , an animosity in large part owing to Kun's strained relations with the Hungarian Social Democrats. In 1934, Kun was charged with preparing the agenda for the 7th Congress of the Comintern, in which the Social Fascism line was to be abandoned and the Popular Front was to be the new line for Communists all over the world, a policy change that Kun was opposed to. Instead of submitting to party discipline, Kun did his best to sabotage the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which led to him being formally sanctioned for insubordination. In 1935-36, the leadership of the émigré Hungarian Communist Party was thrown into crisis as Kun sought to prevent the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which occasioned a vigorous round of party in-fighting. Beyond policy, there was also a clash of personalities as Kun's abrasive and <b>autocratic</b> <b>leadership</b> style had left him with many enemies, who saw the dispute over whether the Hungarian Communist Party was to adopt the Popular Front strategy as a chance to bring down Kun, who many Hungarian émigrés deeply hated. Reflecting his embattled position led Kun to denounce one of his leading enemies in the Comintern, Dmitry Manuilsky who was sympathetic to the anti-Kun faction to the NKVD as a Trotskyite, who in his turn had also denounced Kun to the NKVD as a Trotskyite.|$|E

Deriving hypotheses from recent theoretical work, Bueno de Mesquita et al (2003) and McGillivray and Smith (2000), we examine how leader change affects trading relations between nations using dyadic trade data. Consistent with hypotheses, we find that large winning coalition systems, such as democracies, are relatively immune from the vagaries of leadership change. In such systems, trade remains relatively constant whether leader change occurs or not. In contrast, when winning coalition size is small, as in <b>autocratic</b> states, <b>leadership</b> change profoundly alters relations, causing a decline in trade. Finally we examine instances of poor relations, measured by a significant decline in trade compared to historical levels. As predicted, instances of poor relations are less common between pairs of democracies than other dyadic pairing. Further, <b>leadership</b> turnover in <b>autocratic</b> systems restores trading relations between states. Again the effect of leadership change in democracies is much less pronounced.

Yet some terms of English managerial vocabulary, which are perfectly translatable in other languages, remain untranslated.

Semantic resonances focused {{on the issue of}} which meanings can or cannot be expressed by a single word in different cultures. In this paper, based on an organisational ethnography of Latin American expatriates working for an Italo-Latin-American multinational corporation (Tubworld), we analyse the resonances of the word leader/lı´der and director, direttore, capo, guida, coordinador, caudillo among a group of expatriates; all Italian, Spanish or multilingual speakers who use English as a second language in their everyday interactions. The paper explains how the different uses contribute to create a meaning of what a leader should and should not be; someone who leads without leading, sometimes a manager. The authors, an Italian native speaker who learnt Spanish during childhood and use English as his everyday language and a Spanish native speaker, argue that Italian or Spanish speakers not only avoid the words duce and caudillo (the vernacular vocabulary for leader, not in use due to the political and cultural meaning) but also the word leader/lı´der itself, as it resonate to the other two (violent, authoritarian, <b>autocratic,</b> antidemocratic <b>leadership)</b> but furthermore because the word, a lexical loan from English, failed to encapsulate the complexity of leading multilingual organisations like Tubworl...|$|R
