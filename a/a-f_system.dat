30|$|G-protein-coupled {{receptor}}s (GPCRs) {{form the}} largest receptor superfamily of eukaryotic cells (Flock et al. 2017). A typical GPCR protein contains seven transmembrane helices (TMs 1 – 7) (Palczewski et al. 2000). Upon activation, the GPCR opens a cavity on its cytoplasmic side, between TMs 5 – 6 {{and the remaining}} of the receptor, to interact with downstream effectors such as G-proteins and arrestins (Kang et al. 2015; Rasmussen et al. 2011). Based on phylogenetic analysis, GPCRs have been further categorized into several families. Among them, the rhodopsin-like class-A—referred to as such in the <b>A–F</b> classification <b>system</b> (Attwood and Findlay 1994; Kolakowski 1994)—is the largest family, including over 700 members from human genome alone. Class-A GPCRs (hereafter referred simply as “GPCRs”) possess a number of highly conserved fingerprint motifs (Nygaard et al. 2009) which presumably play important functional roles in common signaling mechanisms shared by all members of their family.|$|R

40|$|The {{implementation}} of a plus/minus system of grading to replace the traditional A through F grading system for graduate students was studied at a midsize Midwestern university. Decimal equivalents were established to enable the computation of grade point averages (GPAs) that reflected the dispersion of grades through the plus/minus system. A survey was administered to graduate faculty to assess {{their perceptions of the}} effect of the plus/minus system on graduate grades, and the analysis was based on 250 responses.,Then an analysis of the graduate GPA in the first three graduate courses for 4, 944 master's level students who were enrolled under the <b>A-F</b> <b>system</b> was compared to that for 3, 144 students enrolled after the {{implementation of}} the plus/minus system.

40|$|Introduction: Evidence-based Medicine (EbM) was {{originally}} {{developed as a}} teaching tool for young doctors, but in Germany the last surveys among residents in 2009 and 2011 demonstrated that, across all topics, the largest deficits were seen {{in the field of}} EbM. One reason may be a deficit in customised offers for continuing medical education in EbM. In a randomised controlled trial with a wait-control design we investigated a possible gain in knowledge and the acceptance of an online course in EbM for first-year residents. Methods: All first-year residents at the Hospital of the Goethe University in Frankfurt received the offer to voluntarily take part in an online EbM course. The tutored course consisted of five modules according to the five steps of EbM, each module being complemented by practical tasks. The participants were randomised via telephone to the course right away or after a three-month waiting period. The primary endpoint (i. e., knowledge) was tested via two sets of 13 multiple choice questions before and after the course and after 6 and 12 months. The participants were asked to subjectively evaluate the course by using an <b>A-F</b> grading <b>system</b> and to semiquantitatively assess its level of difficulty; they were also asked to evaluate the usefulness of its content in their clinical setting.

40|$|Calculator is “an electronic/mechanical {{device for}} the {{performance}} of mathematical computations and implemented with physical hardware devices”, while a software calculator is a calculator that has been implemented as a software program. Similarly a number system is a set of rules & symbols used to represent a number. So, number system calculator is a software calculator used to perform mathematical computations on number systems. Today everyone is familiar with decimal number system (using 0 - 9). However digital devices almost use binary number system (using 0 & 1). Binary and other famous number systems e. g. octal (using 0 - 7) and hexadecimal (using 0 - 9 & <b>A-F)</b> number <b>systems</b> are based on the same fundamental concept of decimal number system. The knowledge of number systems, their representation, limits, arithmetic, compliments and inter-conversion of numbers between prescribed number systems is essential for understanding of computers and successful programming for digital devices. Understanding all these number systems and related terms/concepts requires allot of time and a large number of techniques to expertise. To overcome this problem, we propose calculating software which will cover and perform all the prescribed calculations within a fraction of second. It will perform various operations like number validity, arithmetic’s, conversion from one to another system and the compliments of number in any required system. Four most common number systems taken under the consideration are binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. Index term...|$|R

The State of New Mexico {{is in the process}} of developing a 2015 Water Plan. Water resource planners, managers, and other stakeholders are looking to the internet for pertinent information to aid in the planning process. However, a multitude of stakeholders historically lack a voice to participate in the wide array of water-sharing agreements. Through internet communication, government agencies and non-governmental organizations can utilize their websites to communicate, negotiate, and collaborate with stakeholders. This study applies Senecah's Trinity of Voice Theory (2004) as the basis to evaluate access to information on websites through website performance usability and design to promote information transparency; standing through online educational components to promote stakeholder participation; and influence through community outreach call to action to promote stakeholder collaboration. A practical tool, in the form of a website score card, was designed for evaluating water resource websites. Thirty-one of New Mexico’s leading water resource websites were analyzed, evaluated, and ultimately scored using the <b>A-F</b> grading <b>system.</b> The websites were assessed based on the provision of information and the quality of education and community outreach offered to New Mexico stakeholders affected by complex water issues. The results of this study can be used for the analysis and improvement of the websites assessed; the scoring tool itself can be used for future evaluation and improvement of web-based communications within the water resource community...|$|R

Advisor: Joe Magner. 1 computer file (PDF); v, 52 pages, appendices <b>A-F.</b> Lake <b>systems</b> present {{a challenge in}} determining how water associated solutes cycle with time. Lake hydraulic residence time is an important lake management variable dependent on several factors including: volume, watershed size, location within a watershed and climatic variability. The stable isotopes of hydrogen (Deuterium expressed as δD) and oxygen (δ 18 O) can provide some hydrologic insight to lake water quality management. Analyzing the stable isotopic composition of lake water δD and δ 18 O over time can aid in identifying source water input mixing and evaporative processes. Lake water δD and δ 18 O were compared to the isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapor which has a known isotopic concentration at specific latitudes and air temperatures (Burns and McDonnell, 1998; Dansgaard, 1964). Study lakes were sampled spring, summer, and fall over a three year period. Deviations in the amplitudes of fractionated lake water compared to water vapor was modeled to predict hydraulic residence time for twenty-four lakes throughout Minnesota. Results suggest hydraulic residence time was dynamic; variations occurred with annual source water contributions, watershed size and connectivity. Ranges of annual hydraulic residence time among individual lakes were as great as 18. 8 years and as small as 0. 4 years. δD and δ 18 O values were plotted {{in relation to the}} Meteoric Water Line (MWL) for all study lakes. A gradient of δD and δ 18 O values were found in relation to latitude. Lighter values ofδD and δ 18 O were found in northern Minnesota compared to southern Minnesota. Variations in seasonal δD and δ 18 O created annual amplitudes that provide insight into lake water budgets and residence times. The use of δD and δ 18 O offer water quality managers a tool to better understand, protect, and remediate lakes and their watersheds...|$|R

Fry. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 261 pages, appendices <b>A-F.</b> The <b>system</b> of education developed by Maria Montessori, noted Italian feminist, anthropologist and physician, {{is the single}} largest pedagogy {{in the world with}} over 22, 000 public, private, parochial, and charter schools on six continents, enduring even as other teaching methods have waxed and waned. Despite its international diffusion and longevity, research into the pedagogy is glaringly absent from mainstream educational literature. The purpose of this study is, first, to explore Dr. Montessori's involvement in international conferences and examine how the exchange of ideas by participants may have influenced her pedagogy. Second, this study investigates the implementation of Montessori pedagogy in two countries, the United Republic of Tanzania and the Russian Federation, focusing on the interplay of teacher training, classroom practice, and culture. This comparative multiple case study was designed to differentiate what is universal in the Montessori pedagogy and what is country specific or culture bound. Observations in classrooms guided by a checklist of ten essential elements, interviews with teachers, trainers and leaders of Montessori associations, and historical and contemporary documents are the primary sources of data. The results of the data indicate that limited economic resources, the quality of training, government regulations and availability of Montessori books translated into the Kiswahili and Russian languages influence the implementation of Montessori pedagogy in the United Republic of Tanzania and the Russian Federation {{to a greater extent than}} culture. Montessori pedagogy as implemented in Tanzania is thriving and is providing much needed quality education for young children. Several factors influence its implementation, but poverty permeates through all the classrooms and is the most significant. Montessori pedagogy as implemented in Russia also is thriving, in spite of the challenge of consistent training. Impressive efforts such as the work of the Belgorod Montessori Study Center to develop the theoretical understanding and practical applications of cosmic education and Michailova Montessori School's experiment in integrating into a self-managed government school may determine whether Montessori remains on the periphery of pedagogy or moves to the center, influencing future policy...|$|R
