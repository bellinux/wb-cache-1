TAC includes not just the costs of materials and labour, but also of all manufacturing overheads (whether ‘fixed’ or ‘variable’).The cost of each cost center can be direct or indirect cost.

50|$|Variable costing is a {{managerial}} <b>accounting</b> <b>cost</b> concept. Under this method, manufacturing overhead is incurred in {{the period}} that a product is produced. This addresses the issue of absorption costing that allows income to rise as production rises. Under an absorption cost method, management can push forward costs to the next period when products are sold. This artificially inflates profits {{in the period}} of production by incurring less cost than would be incurred under a variable costing system. Variable costing is generally not used for external reporting purposes. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, income statements must use absorption costing to comply with GAAP.|$|E
