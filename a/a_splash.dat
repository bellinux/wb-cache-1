5|$|In {{the first}} match {{of the actual}} event Carlito faced Chris Masters. In the beginning, Carlito had the {{advantage}} over Masters, as he performed <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> and Springboard Back elbow on Masters. Masters, however, gained the advantage and executed a Powerbomb. Carlito performed a Back Cracker. Carlito then pinned Masters while using the ropes for leverage to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Robinson made <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> in {{his first}} season of play at Michigan. He led the Big Ten Conference in three point {{shooting}} percentage from the beginning of conference play in December until early February. In both of Michigan's wins in the 2016 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, Robinson made three point shots to tie the score with less than a minute remaining.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between Santino Marella and Umaga for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. The match began with Umaga in control, {{squashing}} Marella. Two {{minutes into the}} match, Umaga was punching Marella uncontrollably. The referee disqualified Umaga when he refused to stop after giving a five count, and Marella retained the title. Umaga, following the disqualification, delivered <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> and a Samoan Spike to Santino.|$|E
5|$|The thirty-minute pre-show aired {{before the}} event began with a match between Phi Delta Slam (Bruno Sassi and Big Tilly) and the team of Lex Lovett and Buck Quatermain. Phi Delta Slam won the match by pinfall, after Big Tilly {{performed}} <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> from the top rope onto Lovett. The second saw real-life brothers Ron and Don Harris defeat the team of Mikey Batts and Jerelle Clark.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt made a brief cameo in the 2011 one-off comic Unit:E, {{produced}} by Hasbro {{as a potential}} concept for crossing over many of the franchises they owned; he is seen in <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> page amongst many other Hasbro-owned characters (including characters from G.I.

5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's experiments on soap films. He illustrates the way <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> breaks into droplets and compares {{this to the}} shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Virgil faced Yokozuna, who was billed at 505 pounds. Virgil {{was unable to}} knock Yokozuna down with several dropkicks. Yokozuna {{performed}} a savate kick on Virgil before throwing him to the ring floor twice. He executed a legdrop on Virgil, but Virgil regained the advantage when Yokozuna accidentally ran into the ring pole while trying to attack Virgil. Yokozuna won the match after <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> {{in the corner and}} a Banzai Drop.|$|E
5|$|The show {{opened with}} a Six Sides of Steel Tag Team Cage match that pitted the team of Apolo and Sonny Siaki against Chris Candido and Lance Hoyt, which lasted 6 minutes and 58 seconds. This was {{originally}} promoted as a bout between Hoyt and Apolo but was changed at the event. During the opening minutes, Candido suffered a bad fall and was helped to the backstage area. Siaki and Apolo won the contest after Siaki performed <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle on Hoyt.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric Flair faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} Flair on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put Flair through the table with <b>a</b> <b>Splash.</b> Near {{the end of the}} match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on Flair, allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed Flair on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by Flair.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} a triple threat {{match for the}} WWE Women's Championship, in which Mickie James defended the title against Beth Phoenix and Melina. The match began with James {{attempting}} a roll-up on Melina for a near-fall, but Phoenix performed a clothesline on James. Mid-way in the match, James performed <b>a</b> <b>splash,</b> from the top rope, on Phoenix for a near-fall. A spot in the match saw Phoenix lift both Melina and James {{at the same time}} and try to perform a double backbreaker but Phoenix did not execute the move successfully. The match concluded when James performed the Mickieâ€“DT on Melina, thus winning the match and retaining her title.|$|E
5|$|The tag team {{championship}} match came next, {{which saw}} the Beverly Brothers (Beau and Blake) attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell. The Disasters used {{their size and}} strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents {{but was unable to}} tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.|$|E

5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the tournament}} commenced, TNA held three preview matches {{involving}} World X Cup participants. The first two were {{featured on the}} June12 episode of Impact!. In the first preview match, Team TNA's The Motor City Machine Guns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) were pitted against Team Japan's Speed Muscle (Masato Yoshino and Naruki Doi) in a tag team match lasting 6 minutes. The Motor City Machine Guns won when Sabin pinned Doi, after Shelley and Sabin performed a double kick to the face. The second was between Team International's Alex Koslov and Team TNA's Curry Man, which lasted 4 minutes. Koslov won the match by pinfall after <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> from the top rope. TNA held another preview match on the June19 episode of Impact!. In this match, Kaz of Team TNA defeated Koslov after smashing Koslov face-first into the mat with his signature Wave of the Future maneuver.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners {{to wait for the}} shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E

60|$|I turned, and Miss Ingram darted {{forwards}} {{from her}} sofa: the others, too, {{looked up from}} their several occupations; for {{at the same time}} a crunching of wheels and <b>a</b> <b>splashing</b> tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.|$|R
60|$|Jim stepped {{the short}} mast with its well-worn leg-of-mutton sail, {{got one of}} the oars aft as a rudder, and the full-bowed clipper began to move through the water slowly, but with <b>a</b> <b>splashing</b> and <b>a</b> wake {{sufficient}} for a craft ten times her size.|$|R
5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other {{squirrels}} and the bear do not. There is no apparent reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the squirrels should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the squirrels gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E
5|$|Next was the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament finals for {{the vacant}} TNA World Tag Team Championship between LAX, {{accompanied}} by Guerrero and Salinas, and Team 3D. The duration was eleven minutes and thirty seconds. Devine tried {{to interfere in}} the contest by setting up a table for Team 3D, but Guerrero stopped him {{and set up the}} table for himself outside the ring, placing Devine on top. Guerrero then climbed a padded turnbuckle and jumped onto Devine with a diving foot stomp, forcing him through the table. In the ring, Team 3D performed one of their signature tag team maneuvers, the 3D II, forcing Homicide into the mat and following with a cover, but the referee refused to count because Homicide was not the legal man in the contest. Hernandez then performed his signature Border Toss maneuver on Devon, slamming him into the mat from the top of a turnbuckle. Homicide followed with <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> from the top of a padded turnbuckle on Devon for the pinfall victory, winning the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament and the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed <b>a</b> <b>splash</b> attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw {{him out of the}} cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> Bigger <b>Splash</b> is <b>a</b> large pop art {{painting}} by British artist David Hockney. Measuring 242.5 cm by 243.9 cm, it depicts {{a swimming pool}} beside a modern house, disturbed by <b>a</b> large <b>splash</b> of water created by an unseen figure who has apparently just jumped in from a diving board. It was painted in California between April and June 1967, when Hockney was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. Jack Hazan's fictionalised 1974 biopic, <b>A</b> Bigger <b>Splash,</b> concentrating on the breakup of Hockney's relationship with Peter Schlesinger, was named after the painting.|$|R
60|$|Then, a real {{shock to}} her, there came <b>a</b> loud <b>splashing</b> {{of water from}} out of the dark, tree-filled hollow beyond the road, <b>a</b> <b>splashing</b> that deepened rapidly to a harsh roar, and then became a heavy, booming noise of a great body of water falling solidly all the time. It {{occupied}} the whole of the night, this great steady booming of water, everything was drowned within it, drowned and lost. Ursula seemed to have to struggle for her life. She put her hands over her ears, and looked at the high bland moon.|$|R
