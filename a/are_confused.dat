5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana <b>are</b> <b>confused</b> with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae <b>are</b> <b>confused.</b> Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|After their capture, Khurshid's sons, {{the crown}} prince Dadmihr, Hormozd and Vandad-Hormozd, {{received}} Arabic names, but otherwise their fate is unknown. According to Chinese sources, on the other hand, {{one of them was}} on embassy in the Tang court at the time Tabaristan was conquered. Khurshid's daughters were distributed as concubines to members of the Abbasid dynasty. The names and genealogy of these princesses <b>are</b> <b>confused,</b> but one was taken by al-Mansur himself and another by his brother, Abbas ibn Muhammad. Al-Bakhtariyya, a daughter of Farrukhan-i Kuchak, became the concubine of al-Mahdi, and it is reported that another of al-Mahdi's concubines, Shakla, was a daughter of Khurshid. In 817, during the Fourth Islamic Civil War, the populace of Baghdad turned to their sons to make them caliphs in opposition to al-Ma'mun (r. 813–833). Al-Bakhtariyya's son al-Mansur ibn al-Mahdi refused, but his half-brother Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi accepted and ruled as anti-caliph until 819.|$|E

Rachel learns she is also a former witch who was resurrected by Lilith, but her memories <b>are</b> <b>confused</b> with the real Rachel Beck. Jet was brought back to life by the spirit of James, Rachel's boyfriend from her past life. Rachel, Jet, and Zoe kill the two resurrected witches and stop Lilith's plan to destroy Manson. James' spirit moves on to the afterlife, leaving Jet herself again. Rachel heals Jet and Aunt Johnny's wounds using her knowledge of witchcraft, and they resume the search for Rachel's killer.|$|E
5|$|Often the Matrikas <b>are</b> <b>confused</b> {{with the}} Yoginis, {{a group of}} sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses. In Sanskrit {{literature}} the Yoginis have been represented as the attendants or various manifestations of goddess Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal Yoginis are identified with the Matrikas. Other Yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of sixty-four Yoginis from eight Matrikas became a common tradition, by mid- 11th century. The Mandala (circle) and chakra of Yoginis were used alternatively. The eighty-one Yoginis evolve {{from a group of}} nine Matrikas, instead of seven or eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda) joined by Chandika and Mahalakshmi form the nine Matrika cluster. Each Matrika {{is considered to be a}} Yogini and is associated with eight other Yoginis resulting in the troupe of eighty-one (nine times nine). Thus, Yoginis are considered as manifestations or daughters of the Matrikas.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, <b>are</b> <b>confused</b> and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

Faith is a matter of reflection in the sense that one cannot have the virtue unless one has the concept of virtue – or at any rate the concepts that govern faith's understanding of self, world, and God.|$|E

25|$|Huntsman spiders, {{members of}} the family Sparassidae (formerly Heteropodidae), are known by this name because of their speed and mode of hunting. They also are called giant crab spiders because of their size and appearance. Larger species {{sometimes}} are referred to as wood spiders, because of their preference for woody places (forests, mine shafts, woodpiles, wooden shacks). In southern Africa the genus Palystes are known as rain spiders or lizard-eating spiders.

25|$|The states secrets {{privilege}} is {{a common}} law privilege originating with the judiciary which enunciated its necessity and laid down some directions for its scope in cases {{going back to the}} 19th century but more recently highlighted in United States v.

The time is now ripe for such legislation in the civil arena; litigants and their counsel <b>are</b> <b>confused</b> and unsure as to how to proceed in cases where the government raises the privilege; the courts themselves are confronted with precedent going in many different directions as to the scope of their authority and the requirements exercising it.|$|E
