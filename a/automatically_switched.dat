25|$|With {{the opening}} of its newest store located in Colonie Plaza in Colonie, New York on June 2, 2009, Price Chopper has made {{investments}} to incorporate various green and energy-saving initiatives throughout the store. Green features include a 400kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides {{a significant amount of}} power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an addressable lighting control system from Encelium Technologies both allow the store to dim its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors covering nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms, and loading docks ensure the lights are <b>automatically</b> <b>switched</b> off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.|$|E

As originally introduced in these exchanges, subscribers telephones had no dials and customers continued to make calls by asking an operator to ring their called party, {{at which point the}} operator keyed {{the telephone}} number into the panel equipment, instead of making cord connections manually.|$|E

2500|$|The {{railroad}} {{was originally}} constructed {{as a single}} track from Carbondale to Honesdale. [...] It contained 5 planes ascending [...] from Carbondale to the summit at Rix's Gap in the Moosic Mountains, and three planes on the [...] descent to Honesdale where the railroad terminated at the D Canal. [...] Each ascending plane was powered by a stationary steam engine which lifted the loaded cars to a [...] "level" [...] which was graded slightly to allow the loaded cars to roll by gravity {{to the foot of}} the next plane. [...] In the opposite direction, the empty cars were towed by horses. [...] Each plane contained a single track, with an <b>automatically</b> <b>switched</b> siding in the center where the loaded and empty cars could pass.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electromagnetic}} (telecoil) mode {{is usually}} {{more effective than}} the acoustic method. This is mainly because the microphone is often <b>automatically</b> <b>switched</b> off when the hearing aid is operating in telecoil mode, so background noise is not amplified. Since there is an electronic connection to the phone, the sound is clearer and distortion is less likely. But in order for this to work, the phone has to be hearing-aid compatible. More technically, the phone's speaker has to have a voice coil that generates a relatively strong electromagnetic field. Speakers with strong voice coils are more expensive and require more energy than the tiny ones used in many modern telephones; phones with the small low-power speakers cannot couple electromagnetically with the telecoil in the hearing aid, so the hearing aid must then switch to acoustic mode. [...] Also, many mobile phones emit high levels of electromagnetic noise that creates audible static in the hearing aid when the telecoil is used. [...] A workaround that resolves this issue on many mobile phones is to plug a wired (not Bluetooth) headset into the mobile phone; with the headset placed near the hearing aid the phone can be held far enough away to attenuate the static. [...] Another method is to use a [...] "neckloop" [...] (which is like a portable, around-the-neck induction loop), and plug the neckloop directly into the standard audio jack (headphones jack) of a smartphone (or laptop, or stereo, etc.). Then, with the hearing aids' telecoil turned on (usually a button to press), the sound will travel directly from the phone, through the neckloop and into the hearing aids' telecoils.|$|E
