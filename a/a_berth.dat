50|$|Designing a fender system {{basically}} is determining what the <b>berthing</b> energy of <b>a</b> vessel or range of vessels will be, then determine what capacity the fender {{needs to have}} to absorb that kinetic energy and finally {{how to find a}} way to avoid the reaction force creating too much hull pressure. In principle, <b>a</b> <b>berthing</b> energy calculation is a simple kinetic energy calculation, adjusted for specific behaviour of <b>a</b> <b>berthing</b> vessel or the specific characteristics of the berthing location or structure.|$|R

5|$|The 1981 Major League Baseball strike {{caused the}} season to be split into two halves.

The Milwaukee Brewers finished the second half in first place to earn the division's other playoff berth.|$|E
5|$|ACC teams viewed <b>a</b> <b>berth</b> in the Humanitarian Bowl as {{undesirable}} {{due to its}} location. Aside {{from being}} one of the lower priority tie-ins, the destination is far outside the conference's geographic footprint. Travel costs from the East Coast are prohibitively expensive and historically caused low turnout among ACC fans. In addition, the game is hosted at a cold-weather venue, which is a disadvantage in comparison with ACC bowl games in places such as Florida, California, and Georgia.|$|E

5|$|That season, an {{economic}} recession factored into the selections.

Maryland, however, stated {{that they would not}} accept <b>a</b> <b>berth</b> to face in-state rival Navy in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school's final exams. The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland's participation in it the year prior.|$|E

The UEFA Cup had replaced the Fairs Cup in 1971, when control of the competition transferred to UEFA. City's debut in the competition was a short one.

Because their second-place finish only granted <b>a</b> <b>berth</b> in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Lazio for {{a spot in the}} group stage.
