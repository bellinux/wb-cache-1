50|$|An iron {{is a type}} of club used in {{the sport}} of golf to propel the ball towards the hole. Irons {{typically}} have shorter shafts and smaller clubheads than woods, the head is made of solid iron or steel, and the head's primary feature is a large, flat, <b>angled</b> <b>face,</b> usually scored with grooves. Irons are used {{in a wide variety of}} situations, typically from the teeing ground on shorter holes, from the fairway or rough as the player approaches the green, and to extract the ball from hazards, such as bunkers or even shallow water hazards.|$|E
5000|$|Central Park Plaza is a 15 story, {{commercial}} {{office complex}} in Downtown Omaha, Nebraska. The complex consists 419679 sq ft of office space, in two red brick towers {{with a lower}} level center connector on {{the first and second}} floors. The building features a central courtyard and a six story parking garage that is located directly north of the building and is connected by a skywalk. In 2007 a [...] "sunrise" [...] lighting feature was added to the <b>angled</b> <b>face</b> of the towers. The towers, built in a [...] "V" [...] formation, have been central to Omaha's skyline since they were built in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Christopher (Sebastian) Morgenstern is Clary's brother. Like her, he is a Shadowhunter but he {{was born}} with demon blood in his veins. It was {{administered}} to him by his father, Valentine, while his mother, Jocelyn, was pregnant. Jonathan is described as having pitch black eyes with no whites (as a baby, but when he is older, they are simply black on the inside), a sharply <b>angled</b> <b>face,</b> and blonde, almost-white hair. At the end of City Of Heavenly Fire the evil is burnt out of him, and his face becomes rounder and his eyes turn green. He dies soon after admitting and apologizing for his wrongdoings to Clary and their mother.|$|E

50|$|The nut is stepped and {{the larger}} {{diameter}} end is chamfered around 270 degrees of its diameter. The <b>angled</b> <b>face</b> created is meant to interface with the chamfer on the backside of the KeyMod slot. The full diameter is left intact to create two flats on the nut which align the nut to the slot, {{and allow it to}} be indexed to the accessory {{as well as to the}} KeyMod slot. This eliminates the need to align the nuts to the holes prior to accessory installation as well as the need for tools to tighten the screw/nut. In most accessories, the screw is swaged after assembly to ensure that it cannot be backed out of the nut. This prevents loss of small parts (screws, nuts or other small parts used in the assembly of the accessory). The spacing of the holes is critical and is based on MIL-STD-1913 spacing to allow the greatest modularity with existing accessories.|$|E
50|$|Irons are clubs with a solid, {{all-metal}} head {{featuring a}} flat <b>angled</b> <b>face,</b> and a shorter shaft and more upright lie angle than a wood, {{for ease of}} access. Irons are designed {{for a variety of}} shots from all over the course, from the tee box on short or dog-legged holes, to the fairway or rough on approach to the green, to tricky situations like punching through or lobbing over trees, getting out of hazards, or hitting from tight lies requiring a compact swing. Most of the irons have a number from 1 to 9 (the numbers in most common use are from 3 to 9), corresponding to their relative loft angle within a matched set. Irons are typically grouped according to their intended distance (which also roughly corresponds to their shaft length and thus their difficulty to hit the ball); in the numbered irons, there are long irons (2-4), medium irons (5-7), and short irons (8-9), with progressively higher loft angles, shorter shafts, and heavier club heads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{class of}} wedges {{grew out of}} the need for a better club for playing soft lies and short shots. Prior to the 1930s, the best club for short [...] "approach" [...] shots was the [...] "niblick", roughly {{equivalent}} to today's 9-iron or pitching wedge in loft; however the design of this club, with a flat, <b>angled</b> <b>face</b> and virtually no [...] "sole", made it difficult to use in sand and other soft lies as it was prone to dig into soft turf. The club most often used for bunker shots was called the [...] "jigger"; it was used similarly to today's pitching wedge, and had a similar short shaft, but its loft was closer to the [...] "mashie" [...] of the day (equivalent to today's 4-iron). The lower loft prevented the club [...] "digging in" [...] to soft lies, but the low launch angle and relatively high resistance to the club moving through the sand to [...] "dig out" [...] a buried ball made recovery from a bunker with this club very difficult. The club was also not ideal for approach shots from a bunker near the green, as a chip shot made with this club tended to roll for most of its distance.|$|E

50|$|The pyramids of Ancient Egypt are tombs {{constructed}} with deliberately chosen proportions, but which these were has been debated.

5000|$|A precise {{profile of}} the tooth (including gullet area, hook angle and top {{clearance}} angle) must be maintained for proper saw operation and wood chip removal.

A saw filer will maintain the gullet shape by manually shaping the grinding wheel with a dressing stone, and the set up of his grinding machine. Variations include <b>face</b> <b>angle,</b> <b>face</b> length, back <b>angle,</b> gullet width and depth, and a frost notch (if necessary). Typical bandsaw tooth dimensions are 1-3/4" [...] tooth space x 3/4" [...] gullet depth x 3/4" [...] gullet width (grinding wheel width) x 30deg <b>face</b> <b>angle</b> x 16deg back angle.|$|R
30|$|The {{effects of}} grain <b>angle</b> of <b>face</b> veneer on surface wave {{velocity}} and dynamic shear modulus of {{three types of}} wood-based composites were examined using a surface wave propagation method. It was found that grain-angle dependence of surface wave velocity and dynamic shear modulus indeed exists for wood-based composites. Grain <b>angles</b> of <b>face</b> veneer {{were found to have}} substantial effects on the surface wave velocities and dynamic shear moduli of wood–plastic composite (WP), wood–fiberboard composite (WF), and wood–metal composite (WM). The orthotropic properties of the three composites were defined as the ratio of surface wave velocities at 0 ° and 90 ° grain angles (V 0 /V 90), which were 3.7, 2.2, and 2.0 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively. For WP, WF, and WM, the dynamic shear moduli in the 90 ° grain <b>angle</b> of <b>face</b> veneer were approximately 7 %, 19 %, and 25 % of that in the 0 ° grain angle, respectively. The relationships between grain <b>angles</b> of <b>face</b> veneer and the shear moduli of the three types of wood-based composites could be represented by Hankinson’s equation, and their optimal n values were 2.1, 1.2, and 1.3 for WP, WF, and WM, respectively.|$|R

30|$|This {{study used}} a {{vibration}} test method {{to show that}} grain <b>angles</b> of <b>face</b> veneer have substantial effects on sound velocities and dynamic Young’s moduli of three types of wood-based composites. The sound velocity at 0 ° grain <b>angle</b> of <b>face</b> veneer was the highest, and it decreased with increasing grain angle {{in the range of}} 0 ° to 90 °. This tendency was similar to that for dynamic Young’s modulus. The relationship between the grain <b>angle</b> of <b>face</b> veneer and the sound velocity of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed in the form of Hankinson’s equation or a second-order parabolic equation. This study also showed that the application of orthotropic elasticity theory was valid for the three types of wood-based composites. The relationship between the grain <b>angle</b> of the <b>face</b> veneer and the Young’s modulus of three types of wood-based composites can be expressed {{in the form of the}} Jenkin equation, Hankinson’s equation, or a second-order parabolic equation. Rule of mixture can also be used to predict the Young’s modulus of wood-based composite from the Young’s moduli of the two elements.|$|R
