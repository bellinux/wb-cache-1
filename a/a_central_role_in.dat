5|$|According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, {{the lack}} of {{explicit}} violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> imagining.

Based on an interdisciplinary approach, combining linguistic approaches and educational theories, the chapter describes how vocational learning processes may be related to participation in situated verbal and non-verbal interactions. Data collected in the context of apprenticeship programs as they are implemented in Switzerland illustrate how learning opportunities may vary depending on the conditions in which interactions are conducted between apprentices and workplace supervisors.
