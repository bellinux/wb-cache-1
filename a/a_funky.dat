25|$|There {{are a few}} early {{recordings}} which survive {{from before}} the famous sextetos were formed. Some of the theatre music was interesting, for example, the Teatro Alhambra had a group of which Adolfo Colombo was the leading personality. He was a singer and regular recording artist, though few of these recordings have survived. One that has been reissued by Harlequin reveals <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> number which is hard to categorize. Listed as a rumba, it is perhaps best described as a guaracha-son. The artists singing are Colombo and Claudio García, the guitar probably Alberto Villalón, plus an unknown tres player. All three named players were white, yet the number is creole, almost Afro-Cuban, in style.|$|E
500|$|... "Play" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Jennifer Lopez for her second studio album, J.Lo (2001). It was released on March 27, 2001, as the album's second single. The song was written by Cory Rooney, Christina Milian, Arnthor Birgisson and Anders Bagge, with production done by the latter two under their production name, Bag & Arnthor. A dance-pop track, it was noted for its funky vibe, compared to the works of Madonna by critics. Over an electric guitar and <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> beat, Lopez sings about pleading a DJ to play her favorite song.|$|E
5000|$|The two mixes were {{provided}} by British house music producer (Dancing) Danny D (a.k.a. D Mob) who gave <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> interpretation with additional backing vocals on the chorus whereas the similar-sounding [...] "Strip to the Bone" [...] mix (also by Danny D) gave the song <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> version with <b>an</b> additional rap ad-lib of [...] "the drum, the bass" [...] to bridge the verse and chorus.|$|R

500|$|The rhythm {{section is}} more {{pronounced}} in the mix on Achtung Baby, and hip hop-inspired electronic dance beats are featured {{on many of the}} album's tracks, most prominently [...] "The Fly". [...] Elysa Gardner of Rolling Stone compared the layering of dance beats into guitar-heavy mixes to songs by British bands Happy Mondays and Jesus Jones. [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] combines <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> guitar riff with a danceable, conga-laden beat, for what Bono called [...] "U2 at our funkiest... Sly and The Family Stone meets Madchester baggy." [...] Amidst layers of distorted guitars, [...] "The Fly" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station" [...] feature industrial-influenced percussion—the timbre of Mullen's drums exhibits a [...] "cold, processed sound, something like beating on a tin can", according to author Albin Zak.|$|E
500|$|Lynn Saxberg {{from the}} Ottawa Citizen gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} concert at Bronson Centre in Ottawa and said, [...] "Accompanied by a DJ who also played <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> electric guitar, the curvy dynamo (Gaga and Space Cowboy) fronted one of wildest spectacles ever mounted at Bronson Centre, an action-packed circus of sound, lights, video images, fog and choreography. Though heavy on theatrics, there was no skimping on the music." [...] She also commented on Gaga's fashion sense and style in her costumes by saying, [...] "In an hour, Gaga proved her star power by packing in all her hits, displaying influences that ranged from Motown to 80s pop, and exhibiting a fearless fashion sense in several costume changes, none of which covered her bum." ...|$|E
500|$|Essentially a ballad, [...] "Respect" [...] is an uptempo and {{energetic}} song, which took [...] "a day to write, 20 minutes to arrange, and one take to record", according to Redding. Aretha Franklin covered this song in 1967 {{and with it}} topped the Billboard R and Pop charts. Redding shouted to a woman for more respect, while Franklin ironically countered the song and transformed it into a [...] "feminist hymn". The next song is an energetic version of Sam Cooke's ballad, [...] "Change Gonna Come"; a protest against racial segregation and disrespect for black people. [...] "Down in the Valley" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> cover of Solomon Burke's original, with whom Redding toured before the recording. Nate Patrin of Pitchfork felt that the song [...] "ratchets up both the gospel beatitude and the secular lust".|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> {{instrumental}} {{version of}} the song [...] "Pheromone" [...] {{was used as the}} theme music for the BET music video program, Video LP.|$|R

25|$|The early 1960s {{also saw}} {{performers}} like bassist Joseph Makwela and guitarist Marks Mankwane add electric instruments and marabi and kwela influences to the mbaqanga style, leading to <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> and more African sound.|$|R
500|$|... "The She", {{named after}} a nightclub that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been {{described}} as having <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> feel, with a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums. Bryant found the track's keyboard part reminiscent of Stereolab's music, while AllMusic's Heather Phares likened the entire song to Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit". Cibula mentioned that the [...] "creepy/cool ... sound [...] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over the night we met.'" [...] Kim Deal plays every instrument on [...] "Too Alive" [...] and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar. To Phares, the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were there watching the performance in person.|$|E
500|$|According to McAdams, Tony! Toni! Toné!'s songwriting on The Revival eschewed [...] "social {{commentary}} {{or political}} posturing" [...] {{in favor of}} [...] "the preservation of R's signature, the perpetuation of the soul tradition, and—on the lighter side—the glorification of barbeque, the boogaloo and the [...] on a Saturday night." [...] Described by the group as [...] "Baptist shout music that makes you wanna dance", [...] "Feels Good" [...] incorporates a popular sample from James Brown's 1970 song [...] "Funky Drummer" [...] and gospel musical themes. [...] "Don't Talk About Me" [...] is a warning to a mouthy woman, while [...] "The Blues" [...] features the narrator's spiteful complaints about an ungrateful girlfriend. The latter song features aggressive bass, <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> break, doo-wop verses, a blues riff that the group's guitarist D'wayne Wiggins learned from his father, and ideas from pianist Vince Guaraldi's music for Peanuts television specials.|$|E
500|$|Title TK {{begins with}} [...] "Little Fury", {{named after a}} kind of pocketknife sold at truck stops with the word [...] "fury" [...] written {{along the side of}} the blade. On the call and {{response}} track, the Deal sisters sing over a heavy bassline, <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> drumbeat, and guitar sounds influenced by surf music and grunge. J.R. Moores wrote for Drowned in Sound that [...] "Somebody considers unleashing a guitar solo, yet its notes are few and the vocals kick back in before it has the chance to go anywhere. Is it a solo or a riff? Whatever it is, it flicks its middle finger at other solos and riffs, exposing them as absurd, flamboyant, shallow fripperies. I'm not part of that club, it says." [...] For PopMatterss Matt Cibula, the repeated line [...] "Hold what you've got" [...] is the Deals' reminder to themselves to keep the Breeders intact henceforth.|$|E
5000|$|The song's {{production}} {{also was}} a far departure from the group's earliest sounds as they embraced <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> production style. The single was released off of the group's 1974 album {{of the same name}} and reached the Billboard Pop Top 20, selling over one million copies.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{the song}} was re-recorded by Michael in <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> style. It appeared, {{credited}} to Michael solo, as a B-side on the [...] "Fastlove" [...] CD single (also being interpolated into an extended mix of [...] "Fastlove") and, credited to Wham!, on The Best of Wham!: If You Were There....|$|R
5000|$|The song {{showed a}} change of style for ELO, with <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> backbeat beneath the band's {{trademark}} sweeping strings, and {{the inclusion of a}} clavinet. The record was a favourite of John Lennon at the time, who dubbed the band [...] "Son of Beatles" [...] in a US radio interview.|$|R
500|$|In [...] "Give It 2 Me", the album's second single, Madonna merged bounce-beats and <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> bassline. [...] "If it's {{against the}} law, arrest me", she sings [...] "If {{you can handle}} it, undress me." [...] The song has a short {{interlude}} where Madonna continuously repeates the words [...] "Get stupid", as Williams chants, [...] "To the left, to the right". [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] was written by Madonna as an anthemic, self-manifesto song which, although {{it appears to be}} about dance and sex, is a reference to Madonna's career spanning three decades in the music industry. Musically it is an upbeat dance song, featuring instrumentation from West African percussion and cowbells. Backing vocals are provided by Williams. The fourth track [...] "Heartbeat" [...] has Madonna singing breathlessly and also features an interlude where the music changes from its normal rhythm, just the sound of drums.|$|E
500|$|The album's thirteenth track, [...] "I Love U, but I Don't Trust U Anymore", {{features}} vocals from folk rock singer Ani DiFranco, {{who plays}} an acoustic guitar. [...] "Silly Game" [...] uses a string orchestra {{performed by the}} NPG Orchestra. [...] "Strange but True" [...] uses a [...] "spoken-word soliloquy with <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> foundation", similar to Prince's previous song, [...] "Irresistible Bitch". The album's final mentioned track is [...] "Wherever U Go, Whatever U Do", is another [...] "subtle" [...] ballad, similar to [...] "So Far, So Pleased" [...] and [...] "The Sun, the Moon and Stars". The standard edition of the album contains two hidden tracks, [...] "Segue III" [...] (also appears as [...] "1-800-Newfunk Ad" [...] in select releases), which is like the other two similarly titled tracks, and [...] "Prettyman", which is a jazz song, including a special appearance from saxophonist Maceo Parker.|$|E
500|$|... "Misery" [...] is an electropop {{song that}} lasts three minutes and twenty-six seconds. The upbeat {{composition}} {{is accompanied by}} a samba and heavy percussion, which was compared to the material on No Doubt's 2012 studio album, Push and Shove, by Sarah Grant from Rolling Stone. As described by Dee Lockett of Vulture, [...] "Misery" [...] contains: [...] "some synths, <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> bassline, and well-placed hand claps to disguise the pain." [...] Leoni Cooper of NME stated that [...] "Misery" [...] has [...] "future-disco beats", and [...] "captures the highs and lows of being [...] " [...] in love," [...] using the metaphor that [...] "a love is as irresistible as drugs." [...] Nicki Gostin, writing for the New York Daily News, questioned the song's subject matter, stating [...] "it's not clear who she's crooning about — ex Gavin Rossdale or new love Blake Shelton." [...] Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "give an inside look to a painful past relationship." ...|$|E
50|$|They {{were led}} by Ian Carr, {{who had been in}} the Rendell-Carr Quintet during the mid and late 1960s, and was a {{respected}} figure in British jazz for more than forty years. Their jazz-based music evolved from an early sound incorporating elements of progressive and psychedelic rock toward combination with <b>a</b> <b>funkier</b> sound in the mid and late 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|Now! is {{the third}} album by singer, France Joli, {{released}} in 1982.

500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an eye on her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> track. Who's that for?' And we said, 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'. I think she was very pleased when she heard the track".|$|E
500|$|Website AllMusic graded {{the album}} with three-and-a-half stars out of five. A writer further praised the CD of the album, writing that [...] "a fun, late-1970s/early-'80s vibe pervades the record". The writer {{added that the}} album [...] "opens with a sexy cover of... 'Wishing on a Star'... 'What's It Gonna Be' drips honeyed harmonies over <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> beat, while 'My First Time' falls somewhere between Rufus and Shalamar, with its dreamy '80s-funk-fueled R" [...] He further praised the soulful slow-tempo remix version of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] and the high-powered techno {{reworking}} of [...] "Baby Boy". The DVD was also included in Vibe magazine's list of [...] "Get in Tune With New Music" [...] in June 2004. In an interview with The New York Times in 2007, American singer Miranda Lambert stated that she admired Beyoncé's performance in Live at Wembley, saying [...] "The charisma and the confidence — she's the ultimate diva." [...] She further revealed that the album inspired her to [...] "take little bits from that [...] for her live shows." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an {{instrumental}} track, [...] "The Urban Theme", which {{begins with the}} sound of a stylus dropping on a vinyl record. The track's prominent funk sound is reminiscent of the music of the Brand New Heavies. [...] "Welcome" [...] features the album's prominent sexual vibe, and contains a quiet storm sound and saxophone. The two opening tracks both contain prominent funk influence. Roni Sarig wrote that their [...] "early '80s full-band R and jazz pop grooves are reminiscent of Maze's brightest days and Steely Dan's coolest nights." [...] The funk-influenced [...] "Sumthin' Sumthin'", which was co-written by Leon Ware, contains a strong, rhythmically tight groove created by the implementation of the [...] "pocket" [...] bass technique. Co-written by songwriter Itaal Shur, [...] "Ascension (Don't Ever Wonder)" [...] opens with <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> groove and bass line, and features a forceful rhythm and rough funk sound. The song contains strong gospel overtones with references to God in the lyrics. The song has been covered by gospel artists such as Londa Larmond and LaShun Pace.|$|E

500|$|... "Left & Right" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> party jam {{featuring}} rappers Method Man and Redman, who exchange verses as D'Angelo {{sings the}} song's verses and chorus. Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna {{put my finger on}} the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to wonder why the fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive, and Housewives {{was considered}} the breakout hit of the season. Robert Bianco of USA Today gave the pilot a score of four stars out of four, calling it [...] "efreshingly original, bracingly adult and thoroughly delightful", and going {{on to say that}} [...] " [...] Housewives is a brightly colored, darkly comic take on suburban life, sort of Knots Landing meets The Golden Girls by way of Twin Peaks." [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle thought that Desperate Housewives was [...] "a brilliantly conceived and relentlessly entertaining new drama". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe commented that the series had [...] "marvelous tonal elasticity". Peter Schorn of IGN felt that season one was [...] "blessed with an attractive cast (sing the praises of older women!), sharp writing and <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> vibe of its own" [...] and that [...] "Desperate Housewives was able {{to take some of the}} oldest formulas in the book and infuse them with their own subversive twists to whip up a frothy confection of sly wit and dark motives." [...] Schorn gave the season a score of 9 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{live for}} the first time the 2011 Glastonbury Festival on June 26, 2011. During the performance she danced with her male backup dancers and the official video of the song was played on a screen behind them. Later, in May 2012, Beyoncé performed <b>a</b> <b>funky</b> version of the song as a part of her revue show [...] in Atlantic City, New Jersey at Revel. While reviewing the show, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Then she makes some of the most thorough and gold-plated declarations of self-worth ever rendered in pop. 'There’s nothing not to love about me,' she sang... without needing to make a joke out of it." [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice was also positive about the performance of the song, saying, [...] "Live, she threw herself into the track, from tsk-tsk-tsk opening to impassioned ending; after that, the song's frenetic beat got transformed into an extended outro that showcased her band's prowess in such a convincing way, she took off her shoes to dance along with it." [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] was included in the set list of Beyoncé's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013-2014).|$|E
