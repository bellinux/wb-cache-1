The house is {{outfitted}} with video cameras mounted on walls to capture more intimate moments, and numerous camera crews consisting {{of three to}} six people follow the cast {{around the house and}} out in public. In total, approximately 30 cameras are used during production. Each member of the cast is instructed to ignore the cameras and the crew, but are required to wear <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> and microphone in order to record their dialogue, though some castmembers have been known to turn off or hide them at times. The only area of the house in which camera access is restricted are the bathrooms.|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the Borg {{prosthetics}} as used in [...] "I, Borg" [...] was an evolution from those previously seen in the series. Michael Westmore's make-up team developed a removable eye-piece for Hugh, using magnets to allow the actor to remove it {{as required by the}} script. The team wanted the eye-piece to be dramatic, but decided against using a laser as this had been previously used for Locutus of Borg. They instead opted for a hologram and a series of LEDs that were powered by <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> built into the costume and mounted on the actor's back. The arm piece was also redeveloped; rather than a single [...] "club" [...] piece as previously used for the Borg, it was built from a foam-rubber glove with attachments.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "11001001" [...] is {{a binary}} number, a {{contraction}} {{of the names}} of the Bynars (One One, Zero Zero, One Zero, and Zero One). The episode at one point was called [...] "10101001". It was originally intended that this episode would take place prior to [...] "The Big Goodbye", with the Bynars' modifications causing the problems with the holodeck seen in that episode. Instead it was changed to the Bynars aiming to fix the holodeck to prevent those problems re-occurring. The Bynars themselves were played by young women. Children were considered for the parts, but the production team thought that it would be too problematic because of the limited time they could work each day and the need to hire teachers. Each actress was required to wear extensive make-up, which was created by make-up supervisor Michael Westmore. A large single-piece bald cap was made from the same mold for each actress, which required some customised trimming to get it to fit properly. To cover up problems with the seams of the cap, some fake hair was added on the Bynars' necks. Each actress also controlled the flashing light inside the apparatus {{on the side of the}} headpiece through <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> attached to the waistband of their costumes. To disguise their voices, the pitch was lowered in post production. It was originally planned to add subtitles over the Bynars' conversations between themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Expert Builder" [...] series matured in 1982, {{becoming}} the [...] "Technic" [...] series. 13 August {{of that year}} marked the Lego Group's 50th anniversary; the book 50 Years of Play was published to commemorate the occasion. In the following year, the Duplo system was expanded to include sets for even younger audiences, particularly infants; new sets included baby rattles and figures with adjustable limbs. The year after, Lego minifigure citizens gained a realm of knights and horses, with a redesign of the Castle theme. Light & Sound sets made their appearance in 1985; these sets included <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack</b> with electrical lights, buzzers, and other accessories to add another dimension of realism to Lego creations. Also that year, the Lego Group's educational division produced the Technic Computer Control, which was an educational system whereby Technic robots, trucks, and other motorized models could be controlled with a computer. Manaus, Brazil gained a Lego factory in this year, as well.|$|E

2500|$|Due {{to the end}} of {{deliveries}} of Chevrolet {{vehicles to}} Europe by the end of 2015 to focus on its core European brands, Opel and Vauxhall, the American-made Chevrolet Volt will not be available in Europe beginning in 2016. In July 2014, Opel announced that due to the slowdown in sales, the Ampera will be discontinued after the launch of next generation Volt, and between 2014 and 2018, Opel plans to introduce in Europe a successor product in the electric vehicle segment. Deliveries to retail customers of the second generation Chevrolet Volt began in the U.S. and Canada in October 2015 as a 2016 model year. Availability in the American market is limited to California and the other 10 states that follow Californiaâ€™s zero emission vehicle rules. It is scheduled to go on sale as a 2017 model year in the 39 remaining states by the second quarter of 2016.

2500|$|In 1900, while {{employed}} at Lohner Coach Factory, Ferdinand Porsche developed the Mixte, a 4WD series-hybrid version of [...] "System Lohner-Porsche" [...] electric carriage that previously appeared in 1900 Paris World Fair. George Fischer sold hybrid buses to England in 1901; Knight Neftal produced a racing hybrid in 1902. In 1905, Henri Pieper of Germany/Belgium introduced a hybrid vehicle {{with an electric}} motor/generator, batteries, and a small gasoline engine. [...] It used the electric motor to charge its batteries at cruise speed and used both motors to accelerate or climb a hill. The Pieper factory {{was taken over by}} Imperia, after Pieper died. The 1915 Dual Power, made by the Woods Motor Vehicle electric car maker, had a four-cylinder ICE and an electric motor. Below [...] the electric motor alone drove the vehicle, drawing power from <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> <b>pack,</b> and above this speed the [...] "main" [...] engine cut in to take the car up to its [...] top speed. About 600 were made up to 1918. The Woods hybrid was a commercial failure, proving to be too slow for its price, and too difficult to service. In England, the prototype Lanchester petrol-electric car was made in 1927. It was not a success, but the vehicle is on display in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. The United States Army's 1928 Experimental Motorized Force tested a gasoline-electric bus in a truck convoy.|$|E
