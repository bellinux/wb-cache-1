40|$|The basic {{features}} of the wave climate in the South-Eastern Baltic Sea are studied based on available long-term measurements and simulations. The analysis of average, typical and extreme wave conditions, frequency of occurrence of different wave parameters, variations in <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> from weekly to decadal scales, etc., is performed based on waverider measurements at the Darss Sill since 1991. The measured climatology is compared against numerical simulations with the WAM wave model driven by downscaled reanalysis of wind fields for 1958 – 2002 and by adjusted geostrophic winds for 1970 – 2007. The wave climate in this region is typical for semi-enclosed basins of the Baltic Sea. The maximum <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> are {{about half of those}} in the Baltic Proper.

All the further calculations of the wave fields in IO were made for these model settings. At the first stage, the analysis of the simulation results involves a) mapping the fields of the significant <b>wave</b> <b>height</b> and the <b>wave</b> energy, calculated with different scales of averaging in time T and space R; b) estimating the fields of seasonal, annual and long-term variability; and c) determining the 12 -year trend of the annually averaged fields.

Further analysis includes a) creation of time series for the averaged (over zones and across the ocean) <b>wave</b> <b>height,,</b> and <b>wave</b> energy,; b) construction of the frequency spectra of these series; c) finding the extrema of wave field; d) making histograms of <b>wave</b> <b>heights</b> (in the zones and the whole ocean); and e) calculating the first four statistical moments for the waveheight field (in the zones and whole IO).

40|$|Dense {{bathymetry}} surveys {{obtained by}} LIDAR at 13 small to medium coastal inlets {{of the continental}} United States were analyzed to quantify limiting (maximum) bottom slopes of ebb shoals and entrance channels. The LIDAR data were supplemented with conventional bathymetry measurements from five large inlets to obtain predictive relationships for the limiting (minimum) depth over crest of the ebb shoal. The sites, all located on sandy coasts, were chosen to cover a range in tidal amplitude, tidal prism, and <b>average</b> annual <b>wave</b> <b>height.</b> Wave-dominated inlets exhibited steeper slopes on their seaward margins than tide-dominated inlets. Slopes on ebb shoals typically do not exceed 4 – 6 j, with seaward slopes being 1 – 2 j steeper than landward slopes. Dredged entrance channels have steeper slopes than natural channels, with maximum slopes immediately after dredging reaching 6 – 8 j. At one inlet having a series of LIDAR surveys, entrance channel maintenance dredging created 3 – 5 j side slopes that decreased 0. 5 – 1 j/year for the next 2 years to achieve a typical slope of 3 j along much of the channel. Greatest bottom slopes are found in scour holes near jetties (10 – 12 j) and at the entrance bars (8 – 10 j) of (tideless) Great Lakes harbors. Limiting depth over crest of the ebb shoals is predicted well by the parameter (HSP) 1 / 4, whereHS is the <b>average</b> annual significant <b>wave</b> <b>height,</b> and P is the spring tidal prism. High correlation was also found between limiting depth and prism, and with limiting depth and <b>wave</b> <b>height...</b>|$|R
