5|$|Singapore's {{political}} {{model has}} been described as a representative democracy, and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. The constitutional rights to free speech <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non-citizens enjoy only common law free speech. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>assembly.</b> The grounds for restrictions are, for freedom of speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, public order, public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence; and for freedom of assembly, public order only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering.|$|E

5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation <b>and</b> <b>assembly.</b> The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power.

5|$|Cities are self-governing units {{administered}} {{independently of}} the larger jurisdictions within which they are located. In order to attain city status, a jurisdiction must have at least 500,000 inhabitants, 60 percent of whom are engaged in urban occupations. There are self-governing towns outside the cities as well as precincts of urban wards. Like the cities, {{each has its own}} elected mayor <b>and</b> <b>assembly.</b> Villages are the smallest self-governing entities in rural areas. They often consist of a number of rural hamlets containing several thousand people connected to one another through the formally imposed framework of village administration.
