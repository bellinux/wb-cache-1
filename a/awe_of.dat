5|$|In 1953 Gielgud {{made his}} first Hollywood film, the sole {{classical}} actor in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar, playing Cassius. Marlon Brando (Mark Antony) was in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> him, and James Mason (Brutus) was disheartened at Gielgud's seemingly effortless skill. Gielgud, for his part, felt he learned much about film technique from Mason. Gielgud enjoyed his four-month stay in California, not least, as Morley comments, for the relaxed attitude there to homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Salih quickly {{gained the}} {{allegiance}} {{of the entire}} body of Kilab, who were in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmān staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmān, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighborhoods, including many Christians and Jews. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.|$|E
5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is of this world rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E

40|$|The {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> {{is typically}} elicited {{in response to}} perceptually vast stimuli and is often characterized by feeling small and insignificant. In the present series of studies we aimed (1) {{to determine the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> on body perception and (2) to elucidate the role of the personality trait of ‘absorption’ (i. e. the tendency to get fully immersed in one’s experiences) in relation to the feeling <b>of</b> <b>awe.</b> Across 4 different studies, involving both lab-based and field experiments, we found that feelings <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> are associated with smaller body size estimates. We also found that absorption is a strong predictor of feelings of awe: people scoring high on absorption tended to report overall stronger feelings <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> – irrespective <b>of</b> the experimental manipulation. In addition, experimentally manipulating absorption, by instructing participants to get fully absorbed in an external stimulus resulted in stronger feelings <b>of</b> <b>awe.</b> Thereby these findings illustrate that two key features underlying the experience <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> are changes in the perception of one’s body and a tendency to get absorbed in internal or external stimuli...|$|R

25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{his role as}} founder of the Levites, Levi {{is referred to as}} being particularly pious. The Blessing of Moses, which some textual scholars attribute to a period just before the deuteronomist, speaks about Levi via an allegorical comparison to Moses himself, which hagaddah take to support the characterisation of Levi (and his progeny) as being by far the greatest of his brothers in respect to piety. The apocryphal Prayer of Asenath, which textual scholars believe dates from some time after the first century AD (scholarship in regards to the dating is currently quite contentious, with dates ranging from near the first century, to the fourth or fifth centuries), describes Levi as a prophet and saint, able to forecast the future, understand heavenly writings (astrology? weather trends?), and someone who admonishes the people to be forgiving, as well as in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> God. The Book of Malachi argues that the Levites were chosen by Yahweh to be the priests, because Levi as minister of God, was specified only the true religious regulations, was reverent, revered Yahweh, was in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the God's name, upheld peace, was a model of good morality, and turned many people from sin.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the society}} functioned a secret chamber, called Camara Reina, which was {{presided over by}} Bonifacio, Jacinto, and Pío Valenzuela.

25|$|The New York Times {{music critic}} Anthony Tommasini, who ranked Schubert as the fourth {{greatest}} composer, wrote of him:You {{have to love}} the guy, who died at 31, ill, impoverished and neglected except by a circle of friends who were in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> his genius. For his hundreds of songs alone – including the haunting cycle Winterreise, which will never release its tenacious hold on singers and audiences – Schubert is central to our concert life.... Schubert's first few symphonies may be works in progress. But the Unfinished and especially the Great C major Symphony are astonishing. The latter one paves the way for Bruckner and prefigures Mahler.|$|E
25|$|Arriving at Cajamarca, Pizarro sent an embassy, led by Hernando de Soto, with 15 {{horsemen}} and an interpreter; {{shortly thereafter}} he sent 20 more horsemen led {{by his brother}} Hernando Pizarro as reinforcements {{in case of an}} Inca attack. Atahualpa was in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> these men dressed in full clothing, with long beards and riding horses (an animal he had never seen). In town Pizzaro set a trap for the Inca and the Battle of Cajamarca began. The Inca forces greatly out numbered the Spanish; however, the Spanish superiority of weapons and tactics {{and the fact that the}} most trusted Inca generals were in Cusco led to an easy defeat and the capture of the Incan Emperor.|$|E
25|$|As Joan {{was growing}} up with her grandmother, her father was back in England, already {{arranging}} marriages for his daughter. He hoped to gain both political power and more wealth with his daughter's marriage, so he conducted the arrangement in a very “business like style”. He finally found a man suitable to marry Joan (aged 5 at the time), Hartman, son of King Rudolph I of Germany. Edward then brought her home from France {{for the first time}} to meet him. As she had spent her entire life away from Edward and Eleanor, when she returned she “stood in no <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> her parents” and had a fairly distanced relationship with them.|$|E
40|$|Awe, {{a complex}} emotion {{composed}} by the appraisal components of vastness {{and need for}} accommodation, is a profound and often meaningful experience. Despite its importance, psychologists have only recently begun empirical study <b>of</b> <b>awe.</b> At the experimental level, a main issue concerns how to elicit high intensity awe experiences in the lab. To address this issue, Virtual Reality (VR) has been proposed as a potential solution. Here, we considered the highest realistic form of VR: immersive videos. 42 participants watched at immersive and normal 2 D videos displaying an awe or a neutral content. After the experience, they rated their level <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> and sense <b>of</b> presence. Participants' psychophysiological responses (BVP, SC, sEMG) were recorded during the whole video exposure. We hypothesized that the immersive video condition would increase the intensity <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> experienced compared to 2 D screen videos. Results indicated that immersive videos significantly enhanced the self-reported intensity <b>of</b> <b>awe</b> {{as well as the}} sense of presence. Immersive videos displaying an awe content also led to higher parasympathetic activation. These findings indicate the advantages of using VR in the experimental study <b>of</b> <b>awe,</b> with methodological implications for the study of other emotions...|$|R

25|$|The {{composition}} of the opposing armies explains {{a lot about the}} outcome of the ensuing conflict. The Tibetan soldiers were almost all rapidly impressed peasants, who lacked organisation, discipline, training and motivation. Only a handful of their most devoted units, comprising monks armed usually with swords and jingals, proved to be effective, but they were in such small numbers as to be unable to reverse the tide of battle. This problem was exacerbated by their generals, who seemed in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the British and refused to make any aggressive moves against the small and often dispersed column. They also failed conspicuously to properly defend their natural barriers, frequently offering battle in relatively open ground, where Maxim guns and rifle volleys caused great numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the poor}} reviews given by European {{observers}} to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by westerners) {{and led by}} Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> the appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damanged the superior Russian force.|$|E

Clare's years as managing editor of Vanity Fair left her with an avid interest in journalism (she suggested the idea of Life magazine to her husband before it was developed internally).

25|$|A banquet {{was soon}} held in Han's honor for this success. During this banquet, Han met his future wife, Liang Hongyu. Liang Hongyu was a {{military}} courtesan and was serving the officers in the banquet. It is said that Liang {{caught the eye of}} Han who was sighing instead of celebrating like the others. Liang approached Han and asked him why he wasn't showing any signs of joy in the banquet which was thrown in his honor. Han replied that this was a small victory and that he was worried about the Jurchens who showed signs of hostility to the Song regime. He stated that it hurt him to imagine the damage that war may bring upon the peasants. Liang was in <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> Han, and the two quickly become very close to each another. Liang decided to follow Han and the two soon were married.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Italian {{newspaper}} Corriere della sera asked Foucault {{to write}} a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to Tehran in Iran, days after the Black Friday massacre. Documenting the developing Iranian Revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered the popular support for Islamism. Returning to France, {{he was one of}} the journalists who visited the Ayatollah Khomeini, before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed <b>awe</b> <b>of</b> Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility. In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied Zen Buddhism under Omori Sogen at the Seionji temple in Uenohara.|$|E

However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E
