5|$|Born to a Pentecostal-minister father, D'Angelo {{was brought}} up to an early {{appreciation}} of gospel music, while his mother, a jazz enthusiast, {{introduced him to the}} musical complexities of trumpeter Miles Davis and the funk <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> music of the 1970s. In addition to old gospel records, these factors inspired him during the making of Brown Sugar, as D'Angelo drew upon his roots of traditional gospel <b>and</b> <b>soul,</b> and infused the sound of contemporary R and hip hop music to create a stylistically unique and soulful sound for the album. The album has been noted by critics for its classic soul elements and influences, as well as the sound of live instruments and organic grooves, which are reminiscent of the work of Stevie Wonder and Sly & the Family Stone. Its production contrasts the producer-driven and digital approach of contemporary R {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and the celebrities of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk <b>and</b> <b>soul.</b> New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch {{holds an}} annual music festival {{on the first}} weekend in July.

Rock bands <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> groups have been included alongside the more traditional types of music. The festival's format changes annually but usually takes place on and around the town quay where a large marquee contains the main stage. Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self <b>and</b> <b>Soul.</b>|$|E

Recording sessions for the album {{took place during}} 1992 to 1993 at Firehouse Studio in New York City, and it was mastered at The Hit Factory. The album's title originates from the martial arts film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978). The group's de facto leader RZA produced the album entirely, utilizing gritty, eerie beats and a sound largely based on martial-arts movie clips <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> music samples.|$|E

50|$|Madhva states {{there are}} five {{permutations}} of differences between Jiva (individual <b>souls)</b> <b>and</b> Ishvara (God): between God <b>and</b> <b>souls,</b> between God <b>and</b> matter, between <b>souls</b> <b>and</b> matter, between one <b>soul</b> <b>and</b> another <b>soul,</b> <b>and</b> between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative. Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with Everyone and fusion with Universal Absolute, {{to the state of}} moksha in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one's soul is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual souls, but the individual <b>soul</b> never was <b>and</b> never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-2000s Miller joined bassist Dave Holland's band, {{changing}} {{it from a}} quintet to a sextet, and adding gospel <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> elements to the group's sound. Around this time, Miller had two regular bands of his own: a piano trio, and a quintet featuring saxophone and vibraphone. He also became heavily involved in music education: Miller was the Director of Jazz Studies at William Paterson University from 2005, and was the Artist in Residence at Lafayette College in 2008, which was two years after it had awarded him an honorary doctorate in Performing Arts.|$|E
5|$|Many late 20th-century musicians such as Fela Kuti have famously fused {{cultural}} {{elements of}} various indigenous music with American jazz <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> to form Afrobeat which has in turn influenced hip hop music. JuJu music, which is percussion music fused with traditional {{music from the}} Yoruba nation and made famous by King Sunny Adé, is also from Nigeria. There is also Fuji music, a Yoruba percussion style, created and popularised by Mr. Fuji, Alhaji Sikiru Ayinde Barrister.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Steinitz stands {{high as a}} {{theoretician}} and as a writer; he has {{a powerful}} pen, and when he chooses can use expressive English. He evidently strives {{to be fair to}} friends and foes alike, but appears sometimes to fail to see that after all he is much like many others in this respect. Possessed of a fine intellect, and extremely fond of the game, he is apt to lose sight of all other considerations, people and business alike. Chess is his very life <b>and</b> <b>soul,</b> the one thing for which he lives.|$|E
