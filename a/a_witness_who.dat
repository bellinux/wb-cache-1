5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, but she refused. After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. <b>A</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E

50|$|To {{rehabilitate}} <b>a</b> <b>witness,</b> the proponent {{is confined}} to using the same techniques used by the opponent to impeach the witness. That is, if the opponent impeached via bias, rehabilitation is limited to negating the claim of bias. If the opponent brought in <b>a</b> rebuttal <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> testified {{to the character of}} principal witness as that of a liar, rehabilitation is limited to <b>a</b> character <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> testifies principal <b>witness</b> is <b>a</b> truthful person. That is a different consideration from the ever-present right to cross-examine any witness, including character witnesses.|$|R

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> {{has refused}} to obey a lawful order to produce books, {{documents}} and papers may be properly incarcerated for contempt of court. A writ of habeas corpus will not apply, unless it can be shown the witness could not have legally had possession of such documents. In such a situation the writ of habeas corpus will properly apply, and is the remedy for such improper action.|$|E
25|$|US District Court Judge in Washington DC Emmet G. Sullivan, on October 2, 2008, {{denied the}} mistrial {{petition}} of Stevens's chief counsel, Brendan Sullivan, due to allegations of withholding evidence by prosecutors. Thus, {{the latter were}} admonished, and would submit themselves for internal probe by the United States Department of Justice. Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutors to give a defendant any material exculpatory evidence. Judge Sullivan had earlier admonished the prosecution for sending home to Alaska <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> might have helped the defense.|$|E

25|$|Marvin Charles Gabrion (born October 18, 1953) is an American man {{convicted of}} the 1997 {{kidnapping}} and murder of 19-year-old Rachel Timmerman, of Cedar Springs, Michigan. Timmerman and her 11-month-old daughter, Shannon, disappeared two days before Gabrion was set to stand trial on rape charges filed by Rachel the previous summer. Rachel's {{body was found in}} Oxford Lake, weighted down by cinder blocks. Shannon remains missing, but is presumed deceased. Gabrion is also a suspect in the disappearances of several other people, including <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> was set to testify against him in the trial for rape.|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{testified that}} Bembenek had spoken often of killing Christine Schultz. The {{prosecution}} produced <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> said Bembenek {{offered to pay}} him {{to carry out the}} murder. According to witnesses for the prosecution, Bembenek owned a green jogging suit similar to the one described by Schultz's son. It was pointed out that Bembenek owned a clothes line and a blue bandanna similar to what was used to bind and gag the victim. A wig found in the plumbing system of Bembenek's apartment matched fibers found at the murder scene. A boutique employee testified that Bembenek purchased such a wig shortly before the murder.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} this rule has been {{considered}} in cases when much of the prosecution case involves evidence by <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> is absent from court. In Luca v Italy (2003), in the European Court of Human Rights, it was held that a conviction solely or decisively based upon evidence of witnesses which the accused has had no opportunity to examine breached Article 6 of the Convention (right to a fair trial). However in R v Arnold (2004), in the Court of Appeal, it was said this rule would permit of some exceptions, otherwise it would provide a licence to intimidate witnesses - though neither should it {{be treated as a}} licence for prosecutors to prevent testing of their case. Each application had to be weighed carefully.|$|E

25|$|A person {{accused of}} a crime could deny the charge by denying it on oath and finding {{a certain number of}} persons {{prepared}} to go on oath that they believed his or her own oath, a system known as compurgation. The number of persons required to swear depended on the gravity of the alleged crime; for example denying a homicide could require 300 compurgators, while if a woman accused a man of rape, the man would have to find 50 men prepared to swear to his innocence. For lesser crimes a smaller number would be sufficient. Witnesses could also be called, including eyewitnesses of the crime (gwybyddiaid). <b>A</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> has once been proved to have given false testimony on oath was barred from ever appearing as a witness again.|$|E
25|$|Overland {{argued that}} the truth-in-evidence {{provisions}} of the California Constitution required that the long delay in bringing charges which adversely affected {{the quality of the}} evidence which might otherwise have allowed him to make a better case that there were other suspects, or that the evidence against Lazarus was not as solid as the prosecution claimed, be considered sufficiently negligent enough on the state's part to justify dismissing the case. For example, <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> could have corroborated the prosecution's account of the confrontation between Rasmussen and Lazarus at the hospital had died in 2000. Prosecutors argued in response that Perry was required to apply federal standards, under which such a delay could only be considered prejudicial if it was shown to have been intentional. Perry agreed, and let the case proceed.|$|E
500|$|The ACLU's {{support of}} {{defendants}} with unpopular, sometimes extreme, viewpoints have produced many landmark court cases and established new civil liberties. One such defendant was the Jehovah's Witnesses, {{who were involved}} in a large number of Supreme Court cases. Cases that the ACLU supported included Lovell v. City of Griffin (which struck down a city ordinance that required a permit before a person could distribute [...] "literature of any kind"); Martin v. Struthers (which struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door canvassing); and Cantwell v. Connecticut (which reversed the conviction of <b>a</b> <b>Witness</b> <b>who</b> was reciting offensive speech on a street corner).|$|E

50|$|The verdict {{has been}} {{challenged}} in Patna High Court; some of the points noted are that the conviction relied on <b>a</b> lone <b>witness,</b> <b>who</b> identified Shahabuddin in court, after a gap of seven years, {{without the benefit of}} a prior identification parade.|$|R
500|$|The defence {{produced}} <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> {{claimed to}} have seen McKay fall and strike his head on some stones several hours before the fight, and the Glasgow Free Press began a rumour that McKay had been drugged by [...] "a sleeping draught" [...] introduced into his water bottle. That the fight was illegal, as was the public assembly of spectators {{does not seem to}} have been considered in court. This benign neglect is surprising because as recently as 1825, in the case of Rex v. Billingham, Savage and Skinner, it had been deemed that anyone even attending a fight was guilty of an offence.|$|E
500|$|In Crawford v. Washington (2004), the Supreme Court {{held that}} the Confrontation Clause bars the [...] "admission of {{testimonial}} statements of <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who</b> did not appear at trial" [...] unless pursuant {{to one of the}} [...] "exceptions established {{at the time of the}} founding." [...] "hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements [...] [...] [...] so long as the declarant is present at trial to defend or explain it." [...] In Davis v. Washington (2006), the Court {{held that the}} Clause places no restrictions on nontestimonial statements.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1912, Commissioner Lane {{returned}} to New York {{to preside over}} hearings (begun on the Commission's own initiative) into oil pipelines. [...] While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company, he grew frustrated with the testimony of <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>who,</b> though secretary of several pipeline companies, could not say who authorized the sales. [...] "I don't {{want to deal with}} a clerk or one of your $5,000 a year men. I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority."
