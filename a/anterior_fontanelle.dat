25|$|The facial {{features}} of 1p36 deletion syndrome {{have been considered}} to be characteristic, although few patients have been diagnosed {{solely on the basis}} of facial appearance. These features may include microcephaly, small, possibly slanted, deep-set eyes, a flat nose and nasal bridge, anomalous, low-set and small ears, a small mouth with down-turned corners and a pointed chin. Distinguishing features in another study were a large or late-closing <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> (up to 85% of patients) and facial asymmetry.|$|E
50|$|The <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> {{is useful}} clinically. Examination {{of an infant}} {{includes}} palpating the <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelle.</b> A sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration, whereas a very tense or bulging <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> indicates raised intracranial pressure.

40|$|The {{clinical}} features of 107 cases {{of children with}} hydrocephalus and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively. Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having hydrocephalus, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid.

The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, tense <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles,</b> splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and {{a quarter of the}} cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs.

40|$|The {{development}} of the mammalian skull is a complex process that requires multiple tissue interactions and a balance of growth and differentiation. Disrupting this balance can lead {{to changes in the}} shape and size of skull bones, which can have serious clinical implications. For example, insufficient ossification of the bony elements leads to enlarged <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles</b> and reduced mechanical protection of the brain. In this report, we find that loss of Gsk 3 β leads to a fully penetrant reduction of frontal bone size and subsequent enlarged frontal fontanelle. In the absence of Gsk 3 β the frontal bone primordium undergoes increased cell death and reduced proliferation with a concomitant increase in Fgfr 2 -IIIc and Twist 1 expression. This leads to a smaller condensation and premature differentiation. This phenotype appears to be Wnt-independent and is not rescued by decreasing the genetic dose of β-catenin/Ctnnb 1. Taken together, our work defines a novel role for Gsk 3 β in skull development...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) receptor type 1 A (BMPR 1 A) mutations {{are associated}} with facial dysmorphism, {{which is one of}} the main clinical signs in both juvenile polyposis and chromosome 10 q 23 deletion syndromes. Craniofacial development requires reciprocal epithelial/neural crest (NC) -derived mesenchymal interactions mediated by signaling factors, such as BMP, in both cell populations. To address the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in craniofacial development, we generated a conditional knockdown mouse by expressing the dominant-negative Bmpr 1 a in NC-derived cells expressing the myelin protein zero(Mpz) -Cre transgene. At birth, 100 % of the conditional mutant mice had wide-open <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles,</b> and 80 % of them died because of cleft face and cleft palate soon after birth. The other 20 % survived and developed short faces, hypertelorism and calvarial foramina. Analysis of the NC-derived craniofacial mesenchyme of mutant embryos revealed an activation of the P 53 apoptosis pathway, downregulation of both c-Myc and Bcl-XL, a normal growth rate but an incomplete expansion of mesenchymal cells. These findings provide genetic evidence indicating that optimal Bmpr 1 a-mediated signaling is essential for NC-derived mesenchymal cell survival in both normal nasal and frontal bone development and suggest that our model is useful for studying some aspects of the molecular etiology of human craniofacial dysmorphism...|$|R
50|$|In newborns and {{toddlers}} with hydrocephalus, the head circumference is enlarged rapidly and soon surpasses the 97th percentile.

40|$|Background This study {{explored}} {{the outcome of}} children with patent <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles</b> who were treated with trans-fontanelle ultrasound scan (TFUSS), which is more affordable and available than CT scan and MRI in the diagnosis of childhood intracranial pathologies and treatment of subdural empyema, in developing countries. Patients and Methods: Seventeen infants with post-meningitic subdural empyema, diagnosed using trans-fontanelle ultrasound alone and treated with subdural tapping over a 31 -months period, were studied. Results: Eleven patients presented with grades II and III Bannister and William grading for level of consciousness in intracranial subdural empyema. Aspirate from 7 (41. 2 %) patients were sterile. The most common organisms isolated were Streptococcus faecalis 3 (17. 6 %), Haemophilus Influenza 2 (11. 8) and Staphylococcus aureus 2 (11. 8), multiple organisms were isolated {{in three of the}} patients. Ninety-four percent (94 %) of the patients had good outcome. Five subjects developed hydrocephalus, one patient had a recurrence of subdural empyema, four patients had residual hemiparesis, two of the four patients had speech difficulties, while one patient (~ 6 %) died. Conclusion: While CT and MRI remain the gold standard for investigating intracranial lesions, transfontanelle ultrasonography is adequate for diagnosis of infantile subdural empyema in resource-challenged areas. Percutaneous subdural tap is an affordable and effective therapy in such patients with financial challenges...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{delineate}} a new syndrome {{of brain}} dysgenesis and cutis laxa {{based on the}} description of 11 patients belonging to nine unrelated families recruited through an international collaboration effort. Methods: Careful clinical assessment of patients from birth {{to the age of}} 23 years with follow-up studies ranging from 3 to 20 years. Biochemical studies of serum proteins glycosylation by isoelectric focusing and capillary zone electrophoresis were performed in 10 patients. Brain MRI studies using conventional methods were analyzed in eight patients. Results: An expanded clinical spectrum of a syndrome comprising facial dysmorphia (enlarged <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles,</b> downward slant of palpebral fissures, prominent root of the nose), a connective tissue disorder (inguinal hernia, hip dislocation, high myopia), and neurologic impairment was defined. Early developmental delay was followed by onset of generalized seizures {{by the end of the}} first decade and a subsequent neurodegenerative course. A defect of N- or N- plus O-glycosylation of serum transferrins and ApoCIII was observed in 10 patients. An unusual cobblestone-like cortical malformation over the frontal and parietal regions was seen in eight patients and cerebellar abnormalities, including two patients with Dandy-Walker malformation, were observed in three patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that autosomal recessive cutis laxa, Debré type, initially considered a dermatologic syndrome, is a multisystemic disorder with cobblestone-like brain dysgenesis manifesting as developmental delay and an epileptic neurodegenerative syndrome. It might represent a metabolic cause of Dandy-Walker malformation. It is associated with a deficient N- and-O glycosylation of proteins and shares many similarities with muscle-eye-brain syndromes. © 2008 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{clinical}} features of 107 cases {{of children with}} hydrocephalus and measured raised intraventricular pressure were analysed retrospectively. Fifty one children had recently been diagnosed as having hydrocephalus, and the remainder had had shunts injected to direct the cerebrospinal fluid. The most common symptoms in the group were vomiting, behavioural changes, drowsiness, and headaches. The most common clinical signs were inappropriately increasing occipitofrontal head circumferences, tense <b>anterior</b> <b>fontanelles,</b> splayed sutures, and distension of the scalp veins. Half the infantile cases of hydrocephalus were without symptoms, and {{a quarter of the}} cases with cerebrospinal fluid shunts and measured raised intraventricular pressure were without signs. There were no fewer than 33 different clinical signs including several unusual ones, such as macular rash and sweating. We believe that the presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intraventricular pressure is sufficiently variable, unusual, or even absent to justify the direct measurement of intracranial pressure. The classical adult presentation of raised intracra-nial pressure (headache, vomiting, and papil-loedemal) is rare in children with progressive hydrocephalus. There are few studies of the clinical presentation of hydrocephalus with raised intracra-nial pressure either before or after an operation to divert the cerebrospinal fluid. There are certainly no studies in which raised intracranial pressure has been confirmed by direct measurement, and such reports that do exist in children frequently include those with causes of raised intracranial pressure other than hydrocepha-lus alone. The aim of this study therefore was to document the symptoms and signs of 107 cases of progressive hydrocephalus (that is, hydrocephalus with raised intracranial pressure) in which the {{clinical features}} were documented and raised ven-tricular pressure had been confirmed on direct measurement.

40|$|Based on {{additional}} specimens {{the fossil}} pimelodid catfish {{from the upper}} Miocene Urumaco Formation, Falcón State, Venezuela originally assigned to the extant species Phractocephalus hemioliopterus {{is described as a}} new, extinct species. †Phractocephalus nassi n. sp. is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: 1) posterior half of frontals and anterior half of supraoccipital with elongate, coarse ridges and sulci in addition to reticulating ridges and subcircular pits; 2) very broad and ornamented mesethmoid bone; 3) lateral ethmoid margin convex and eliminating orbital notch but not projecting far anteriorly over palatine condyle; 4) <b>anterior</b> cranial <b>fontanelle</b> closed or represented by a small pit; 5) supraoccipital process rounded laterally and posterolaterally, concave posteriorly and completely concealing Weberian complex in dorsal view; 6) opercle covered with reticulating ridges and pits; 7) cleithrum coarsely ornamented along ventral edge and bulging outward lateral to spine articulation; 8) pectoral spine mostly ornamented with coarse ridges and sulci. †Phractocephalus nassi is compared to modern P. hemioliopterus and an undescribed extinct species from the upper Miocene Solimões Formation, Acre, Brazil. New diagnostic characters of Phractocephalus are presented that apply to the modern and fossil species, including: 1) ornamentation of skull, pectoral girdle and fin spines comprising a coarse meshwork of reticulating ridges surrounding rounded pits plus some elongate ridges and sulci; 2) supraoccipital posterior process greatly expanded laterally and posteriorly behind occipital wall; 3) lateral ethmoid and sphenotic broadly sutured behind eye; 4) <b>anterior</b> cranial <b>fontanelle</b> reduced or completely closed and posterior cranial fontanelle closed; 5) vomerine tooth plate large, roughly pentagonal to triangular in form, and with fine teeth. Today Phractocephalus ranges widely throughout the lowland Orinoco, Amazon and Essequibo basins. However, the genus does not occur west or north of the Andes or Venezuelan coastal ranges.
