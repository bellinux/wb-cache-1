40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a cost-aware con-trol scheme to realize {{efficient}} authentication in wireless networks {{based on the}} user density, mobility, and traffic patterns of roaming users. First, a mechanism to estab-lish and break a direct security association (SA) between two networks is introduced. Then, an authentication cost function is developed to measure the cost for the proposed scheme. We further investigate an optimal condition to minimize the authentication cost, which decides the op-timal number of inter-domain <b>authentication</b> <b>requests</b> to establish direct SAS between networks. Finally, we ana-lyze the optimal condition based on user density, mobil-ity, and traffic patterns. Compared to the authentication without control scheme, the proposed scheme reduces the authentication cost greatly with {{the increasing number of}} hops, residence time of mobile users, and the arrival rate of inter-domain <b>authentication</b> <b>requests.</b> I...|$|R
5000|$|The user {{authentication}} layer (RFC 4252). This layer handles client authentication {{and provides a}} number of authentication methods. Authentication is client-driven: when one is prompted for a password, {{it may be the}} SSH client prompting, not the server.

50|$|The RADIUS server {{keeps track}} of all PEs that <b>requested</b> <b>authentication</b> for a {{particular}} VPN and returns a list {{of them to the}} PE <b>requesting</b> <b>authentication.</b> The PE then establishes LDP sessions to every PE in the list.|$|R

50|$|Instead {{of asking}} the service {{provider}} {{to trust the}} BSF and relying on it for every <b>authentication</b> <b>request,</b> the BSF establishes a shared secret between the simcard card and the service provider. This shared secret is limited in time and for a specific domain.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a client}} showing proper {{identification}} credentials {{to a bank}} teller is asking to be authenticated that he really is the one whose identification he is showing.

5000|$|A supplicant, in some contexts, {{refers to}} a user or to a client in a network {{environment}} seeking to access network resources secured by the IEEE 802.1X authentication mechanism. But saying [...] "user" [...] or [...] "client" [...] over-generalizes; in reality, the interaction takes place through a personal computer, an Internet protocol (IP) phone, or similar network device. Each of these must run supplicant software that initiates or reacts to IEEE 802.1X <b>authentication</b> <b>requests</b> for association.|$|R
5000|$|Non-traceable chip characteristics. In 2008 a Radboud/Lausitz University team {{demonstrated}} that it's {{possible to determine}} which country a passport chip is from without knowing the key required for reading it. The team fingerprinted error messages of passport chips from different countries. The resulting lookup table allows an attacker to determine from where a chip originated. In 2010 Tom Chothia and Vitaliy Smirnov documented an attack that allows an individual passport to be traced, by sending specific BAC <b>authentication</b> <b>requests.</b>|$|R
50|$|SecurID {{authentication}} server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both <b>authentication</b> <b>requests,</b> if two valid credentials are presented {{within a given}} time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard. If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume {{that it is the}} user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL.|$|R
50|$|<b>Authentication</b> <b>request</b> {{frames are}} sent by clients {{when they want}} to connect to a network. Authentication precedes {{association}} in infrastructure networks. Either open authentication or shared key authentication is possible. After serious flaws were found in shared key authentication, most networks switched to open authentication, combined with a stronger authentication method applied after the association phase.|$|E
50|$|The primary SAML {{use case}} is called Web Browser Single Sign-On (SSO). A user {{wielding}} a user agent (usually a web browser) requests a web resource {{protected by a}} SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know {{the identity of the}} requesting user, issues an <b>authentication</b> <b>request</b> to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The resulting protocol flow is depicted in the following diagram.|$|E
50|$|When {{the client}} {{initially}} establishes {{a connection with}} the server, the server can reply by either accepting the connection, refusing it, or requesting authentication. An <b>authentication</b> <b>request</b> contains {{the name of the}} authentication method to use. The core protocol does not specify the authentication process, which depends on the kind of authentication used, other than it ends with the server either sending an acceptance or a refusal packet.|$|E

Using this protocol, the authentication server efficiently able to verify <b>authentication</b> <b>requests</b> sent from multiple mobile users at a time.

5000|$|RePOP is a load-balancing {{proxy server}} {{specific}} to the POP3 protocol. It operates by answering the initial POP3 handshake and <b>authentication</b> <b>request</b> from a POP3 client. RePOP obtains the username from the USER request from the POP3 client, and then looks for {{the location of the}} user's home POP3 server in a database. RePOP then initiates a connection to the requested user's home POP3 and reissues the USER request to the POP3 server. A standard proxy connection is connected through the RePOP server directly from the POP3 client to the user's home POP3 server {{for the remainder of the}} POP3 session.|$|E
50|$|Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based {{solution}} for exchanging user security information between an enterprise and a service provider. It supports W3C XML encryption and service provider initiated web browser single sign-on exchanges. A user wielding a user agent (usually a web browser) {{is called the}} subject in the SAML-based single sign-on. The user requests a web resource protected by a SAML service provider. The service provider, wishing to know {{the identity of the}} requesting user, issues an <b>authentication</b> <b>request</b> to a SAML identity provider through the user agent. The identity provider is the one that provides the user credentials. The service provider trusts the user information from the identity provider to provide access to its services or resources.|$|E
5000|$|Authentication frame: 802.11 {{authentication}} {{begins with}} the Wireless network interface card (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial <b>authentication</b> <b>request</b> it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel control scheme to locally authorize inter-domain roaming users for {{efficient}} authen-tication in wireless networks, {{which is based}} on authentication, authorization, accounting (AAA) architecture. We develop a de-tailed procedure to establish local security associations (SAs) for authentication and determine a threshold to trigger the proposed scheme. By considering the traffic and mobility patterns of a mobile user (MU), as well as the number of hops between the MU and its home AAA server, we demonstrate that the performance of the proposed scheme outperforms DIAMETER protocol with respect to authentication latency and cost for macro-mobility users with a high volume of <b>authentication</b> <b>requests.</b> I...|$|R
