5|$|Although {{described}} as a non-lethal weapon for crowd control, studies have raised doubts about this classification. CS can cause severe pulmonary damage <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> significantly damage the heart and liver.|$|E
5|$|Although mainly terrestrial, these snakes {{are good}} {{swimmers}} <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> climb with ease; {{often they are}} found basking in low bushes. One specimen was found 4.6 m above {{the ground in a}} densely branched tree.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{production}} difficulty and high price, lutetium has very few commercial uses, especially {{since it is}} rarer {{than most of the}} other lanthanides but is chemically not very different. However, stable lutetium can be used as catalysts in petroleum cracking in refineries <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be used in alkylation, hydrogenation, and polymerization applications.|$|E

5|$|In addition, larger organs may use unison off couplers, {{which prevent}} the stops pulled in a {{particular}} division from sounding at their normal pitch. These {{can be used in}} combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be used to rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.|$|E

5|$|Letting bean dip {{sit for a}} {{while before}} serving can {{increase}} the intermingling of flavors in the dish. Bean dip can be served cold, at room temperature, or as a hot dish. Hot bean dip can be prepared ahead of time, refrigerated and then cooked at a later time, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be prepared using a slow cooker and served in the appliance. Bean dip can be prepared as a vegan and gluten-free dish. The dish is typically served with tortilla chips, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be served with crackers, crudit√©s, breadsticks, pita bread and toasted bread such as baguette.|$|E
5|$|Mood is {{described}} using the patient's own words, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> {{be described in}} summary terms such as neutral, euthymic, dysphoric, euphoric, angry, anxious or apathetic. Alexithymic individuals {{may be unable to}} describe their subjective mood state. An individual who is unable to experience any pleasure may be suffering from anhedonia.|$|E
50|$|Many outdoor {{activities}} such as hiking, skiing, canoeing <b>and</b> canyoneering <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be ways to discover the department <b>and</b> its landscapes.Tourists <b>can</b> <b>also</b> go swimming, fishing or sailing in the various lakes, either in the natural parks or in the rivers.|$|R

Additional garnishes can include dill, carrot leaves, grated, minced or diced carrot, chives, other fresh, chopped herbs, croutons, and toast squares, among others. Carrot soup can be prepared as a vegan food, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be prepared as a bisque.|$|E
5|$|TuneUp Utilities 2014: The 2014 {{version of}} TuneUp Utilities {{has added a}} set of new {{features}} that were not available in its predecessor. With the new version, users now {{have access to the}} Duplicate Finder, Windows 8.1 App Cleaner <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> use the software in Flight Mode.

5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{economic}} foundation of most countries, and {{for developing countries}} a likely source of economic growth. Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so. Profits from crops can increase from higher value crops, better marketing, value-adding activities such as processing, or expanded access {{for the public to}} markets.Profits can also decrease through reduced demand or increased production. Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> offer higher returns.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves when the water rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|As {{the players}} empire expands, agents and {{supervisors}} will make themselves available for employment. Agents {{are used for}} gathering intelligence on alien asteroids <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>also</b> be deployed on the players own asteroids for counter-intelligence. Other uses for agents include deploying APV's and destroying various buildings such as defense installations, life support, production, and other various installations. The chances of an agent successfully completing their mission and escaping detection are increased {{if there is a}} spy satellite orbiting the asteroid they are assigned to. Colony Supervisors are able to be employed to help manage the building and maintenance of asteroid colonies. There is no research in the game, as this popular mechanic is replaced with the Sci-Tek blueprint system which allows players to buy new technologies as needed. Multiplayer is available over an IPX network with TetraCorp being the only playable race.|$|E
