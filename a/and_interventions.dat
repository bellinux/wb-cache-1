5|$|Al-Jamri {{has written}} two books in Arabic, Memories of Childhood (2007) <b>and</b> <b>Interventions</b> on Thought and Politics (2008). The former is a {{narrative}} of al-Jamri's childhood in Iraq, the experiences he had and the events he witnessed. He was motivated to write it by people's reactions {{following the death of}} his father and dedicated the book to his memory. The latter deals with political and ideological concepts in Europe and the Muslim world, and how Muslim countries can benefit from them in order to consolidate the political pluralism within the Islamic theme. Al-Jamri also writes a daily column in Al-Wasat and regular articles on politics and human rights for other publications such as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.|$|E

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, <b>and</b> <b>interventions</b> by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, {{commonly}} called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

40|$|Study Design. To {{examine and}} compare the costs and {{consequences}} in a partial economic evaluation of two competing interventions in patients exposed to whiplash trauma in automobile crashes. The interventions were an active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> using early mobilization <b>and</b> a standard <b>intervention</b> of rest, recommended short-term immobilization in a cervical collar and a cautious, gradual self-exercise program according to a leaflet. The study was randomized and controlled. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the costs of an active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> versus a standard <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> to relate them to the clinical benefits in patients exposed to whiplash trauma in automobile crashes to facilitate decision-making regarding <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> resource allocation. Summary of Background Data. There is very little known about the health economic aspects of various interventions in the target treatment group of patients. Methods. Based on a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, data on clinical effectiveness and resources used for the active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> standard <b>intervention</b> were collected for a comparative analysis of the costs related to physical therapy treatment and sick leave. A cost-consequence analysis consisting of a modified cost-effectiveness analysis was used. Results. The costs were significantly lower after 6 and 36 months with an active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> as compared with the standard intervention. The active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> were significantly superior in reducing experienced pain and reducing sick leave. Conclusions. For patients exposed to whiplash trauma in a motor vehicle collision, an active involvement <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> were both less costly and more effective than a standard intervention...|$|R

Additionally, the 5-year plan for implementation of the national HIV/AIDS program aims to stem the rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by expanding prevention, treatment, and care activities.

40|$|Abstract Background Though {{screening}} <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> {{for alcohol}} <b>and</b> tobacco misuse are effective, primary care screening <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> rates remain low. Previous studies have increased intervention rates using vital signs screening for tobacco misuse and clinician prompts for screen-positive patients for both {{alcohol and tobacco}} misuse. This pilot study's aims were: (1) To determine the feasibility of combined vital signs screening for tobacco and alcohol misuse, (2) To {{assess the impact of}} vital signs screening on alcohol and tobacco screening <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> rates, <b>and</b> (3) To assess the additional impact of tobacco assessment prompts on intervention rates. Methods In five outpatient practices, nurses measuring vital signs were trained to routinely ask a single tobacco question, a prescreening question that identified current drinkers, and the single alcohol screening question for current drinkers. After 4 - 8 weeks, clinicians were trained in tobacco <b>intervention</b> <b>and</b> nurses were trained to give tobacco abusers a tobacco questionnaire which also served as a clinician <b>intervention</b> prompt. Screening <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> rates were measured using patient exit interviews (n = 622) at baseline, during the "screening only" period, and during the tobacco prompting phase. Changes in screening <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> rates were compared using chi square analyses and test of linear trends. Clinic staff were interviewed regarding patient and staff acceptability. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of nurse screening on clinician intervention, the impact of alcohol intervention on concurrent tobacco <b>intervention,</b> <b>and</b> the impact of tobacco intervention on concurrent alcohol <b>intervention.</b> Results Alcohol <b>and</b> tobacco screening rates <b>and</b> alcohol <b>intervention</b> rates increased after implementing vital signs screening (p Conclusions Vital signs screening can be incorporated in primary care and increases alcohol screening <b>and</b> <b>intervention</b> rates. Tobacco assessment prompts increase both alcohol <b>and</b> tobacco <b>interventions.</b> These simple interventions show promise for dissemination in primary care settings. </p...|$|R
