5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will <b>Abend</b> werden for Easter Monday as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E
500|$|A Free Ride was a {{well-known}} stag {{film of the}} 1910s and, according to Williams, {{is regarded as a}} classic pornographic film. It is one of the three earliest pornographic films, along with El Satario and Am <b>Abend,</b> {{in the collection of the}} Kinsey Institute. The 1970 documentary film A History of the Blue Movie includes scenes from this film. The Museum of Sex in New York City showed A Free Ride at its 2002 inaugural exhibition. Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based film director, [...] remade the film in 2004 using no actors; instead the events of the film were represented by [...] "the landscape and trees".|$|E
500|$|According to Williams, A Free Ride is a typological {{representative}} of a genre of early pornographic movies that included voyeurism. The film also shows sexual intercourse, fellatio, troilism, and urolagnia. Like the Argentinian film El Satario (c. 1907–15) and the German film Am <b>Abend</b> (c. 1910), A Free Ride begins with simple narrative frames, then shows signs of more conventional cinema for a short period, and finally shows hardcore scenes in a fragmented manner. Author Laurence O'Toole has described early stag films such as A Free Ride as [...] "a muddle of jerky camerawork and slipshod editing". However, like other stag films from the 1910s, this film is of superior quality to the non-commercial pornography which preceded it.|$|E

The {{knocking}} on the door is expressed by [...] chords in the strings. Dürr notes: [...] "The most expressive text-engendered declamation is here ingeniously melted down into a structure only ten bars long but of compelling musical logic." [...] John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares it to an Emmaus scene in Bach's later cantata Bleib bei uns, denn es will <b>Abend</b> werden, BWV 6, the [...] "post-Resurrection appearance to the disciples" [...] in Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ, BWV 67, even to [...] "the entry of the Commendatore in Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni. Bach would later frequently use the bass as the voice of Christ, in his St Matthew Passion even with a similar string accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} [...] "" [...] (Abide with us; {{for it is}} toward evening), a {{large-scale}} tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as [...] "of speech-like gestures". It is {{picked up by the}} voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on [...] "" [...] (for evening is nigh) [...] "as if the gloom of night were weighing upon them". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: [...] "denn es will <b>Abend</b> werden" [...] (for it is toward evening) and [...] "und der Tag hat sich geneiget" [...] (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the [...] "abiding" [...] or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's [...] "tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the SDA {{was being}} organized, {{there was some}} {{factional}} trouble within the older Socialist Labor Party. Some elements within the SLPs Jewish membership, concentrated in Manhattans Lower East Side, had objected to the party's dual unionism policy. As a consequence the Party's Yiddish language papers, the Dos <b>Abend</b> Blatt and Arbeter-Zeitung were put under direct party control. When the dissidents responded by launching The Jewish Daily Forward and forming [...] "Press Clubs" [...] to influence party activity among Jewish members, the Party leadership expelled the fourth, fifth and twelfth assembly district branches on July 4. The expelled branches held a convention July 31 to August 2, at which they decided to affiliate with the Social Democracy of America. Among the prominent members of this faction were Abraham Cahan, Meyer London, Isaac Hourwich, Morris Winchevsky, Michael Zametkin, Max Pine and Louis F. Miller.|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, the East Berlin-based Berliner Zeitung am <b>Abend</b> {{located the}} child upon whose story the novel was based: Stefan Jerzy Zweig, who survived Buchenwald {{at the age}} of four with his father Zacharias, with the help of two {{prisoner}} functionaries: Robert Siewert and Willi Bleicher. [...] Bleicher, {{a former member of the}} Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) and the kapo of the storage building, was the one who convinced the SS to turn a blind eye to the child. When Zweig was to be sent to Auschwitz, prisoners who were tasked with compiling the deportees' list erased his name and replaced him with Willy Blum, a sixteen-year-old Sinto boy. Zweig moved to Israel after liberation, and later studied in France. After he was discovered to be the 'Buchenwald child', he settled in East Germany, where he remained until 1972. Zweig received much media and the public attention in the country. Blum's fate was only disclosed after the German reunification.|$|E

2500|$|The two collaborated for {{the second}} of four times on the 1954 hit Rear Window, widely {{considered}} one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Stewart portrays photographer L.B. [...] "Jeff" [...] Jeffries, loosely based on Life photographer Robert Capa, who projects his fantasies and fears onto the people he observes out his apartment window while on hiatus due to a broken leg. Jeffries gets into more than he can handle, however, when he believes he has witnessed a salesman (Raymond Burr) hiding evidence of a murder, and when his glamorous girlfriend (Grace Kelly), at first disdainful of his voyeurism and skeptical about any crime, eventually is drawn in and tries to help solve the mystery. Limited by his wheelchair, Stewart is led by Hitchcock to react to what his character sees with mostly facial responses. It was a landmark year for Stewart, becoming the highest grossing actor of 1954 and the most popular Hollywood star in the world, displacing John Wayne. Hitchcock and Stewart formed a corporation, Patron Inc., to produce the film, which later {{became the subject of}} a Supreme Court case Stewart v. <b>Abend</b> (1990).|$|E
2500|$|Because Pirou {{is nearly}} unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films {{for being the}} first. In Black and White and Blue (2008), {{one of the most}} {{scholarly}} attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's Film Facts, [...] "the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge" [...] made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a [...] with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian El Satario might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that [...] "the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's Kinsey Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film Am <b>Abend</b> (1910) is [...] "a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and anal penetration." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1694, a half-timbered {{church was}} erected {{at the same}} location, above the arches of the {{previous}} building's crypt. Johann Andres Moritz, Pastor of Fahrland from 1774 to 1794, in his diary gave {{a detailed description of}} life in the village and of the changing owners of the manor house built in 1774. The writer Theodor Fontane integrated parts of these records into his travelogue Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg (Hikes through the Mark Brandenburg). As quoted by Fontane, Father Moritz in 1790 expressed his aversion to caring for the remote parish: [...] "Meine Pfarre ist eine beschwerliche Pfarre. Sakrow (nur Filial) liegt eine Meile ab...es ist in allem betrachtet ein verdrießlich Filial, und doch muß ich es alle 14 Tage bereisen. Gott! Du weißt es, wie ich dann...bis <b>Abend</b> fahren und reden muß, wie sauer es mir jetzt wird...." [...] ("My parish is an exhausting parish. [...] Sakrow (only a subsidiary) lies a league away... over all, it has to be regarded an irksome subsidiary, and nevertheless I must travel there every fortnight. [...] God! You know it, how I then...must travel until evening and speak, how disgusted it makes me now ....") After Father Moritz had died, in 1794 Sacrow was transferred to the parish of St. Nicholas' Church, Potsdam. After 1808 it was returned to Fahrland.|$|E
