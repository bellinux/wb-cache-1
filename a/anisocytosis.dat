50|$|Anisopoikilocytosis is {{a medical}} {{condition}} illustrated by a variance in size (<b>anisocytosis)</b> and shape (poikilocytosis) of a red blood cell. The underlying cause {{can be attributed to}} various anemias, most often; beta thalassemia major, a form of microcytic anemia. In β thalassemia major the beta hemoglobin chain is completely absent, rendering an increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF).|$|E
5000|$|There {{are five}} main causes of microcytic anemia forming the acronym TAILS. Thalassemia, Anemia of chronic disease, Iron deficiency, Lead {{poisoning}} and Congenital sideroblastic anemia. Only {{the first three}} are common {{in most parts of}} the world. In theory, these three can be differentiated by their red blood cell (RBC) morphologies. Anemia of chronic disease shows unremarkable RBCs, iron deficiency shows <b>anisocytosis,</b> anisochromia and elliptocytosis, and thalessemias demonstrate target cells and coarse basophilic stippling. In practice though elliptocytes and <b>anisocytosis</b> are often seen in thalessemia and target cells occasionally in iron deficiency. All three may show unremarkable RBC morphology. Coarse basophlic stippling is one reliable morphologic finding of thalessemia which does not appear in iron deficiency or anemia of chronic disease. The patient should be in an ethnically at risk group and the diagnosis is not confirmed without a confirmatory method such as hemoglobin HPLC, H body staining, molecular testing or another reliable method. Course basophlic stippling occurs in other cases as seen in Table 1 ...|$|E
50|$|Deficiencies of Vitamin B12 or folate {{produce a}} macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) {{in which the}} RDW is {{elevated}} in roughly two-thirds of all cases. However, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of both iron and B12 deficiencies, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as <b>anisocytosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{blood smear}} {{of a person}} with iron {{deficiency}} shows many hypochromic (pale and relatively colorless) and rather small RBCs, and may also show poikilocytosis (variation in shape) and <b>anisocytosis</b> (variation in size). With more severe iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear may show hypochromic pencil-shaped cells, and occasionally small numbers of nucleated red blood cells. Very commonly, the platelet count is slightly above the high limit of normal in iron deficiency anemia (this is mild thrombocytosis). This effect was classically postulated {{to be due to}} high erythropoietin levels in the body as a result of anemia, cross-reacting to activate thrombopoietin receptors in the precursor cells that make platelets; however, this process has not been corroborated. Such slightly increased platelet counts present no danger, but remain valuable as an indicator even if their origin is not yet known.|$|E
40|$|Red cell <b>anisocytosis</b> as {{assessed}} using the Coulter Channelyzer C- 1000 showed an increase with progressive anaemia in 25 patients with macrocytosis due to B 12 and/or folate deficiency.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} red cell distribution width reported statistically as coefficient of variation (RDW-CV), standard deviation (RDW-SD), and mathematical deduction of 1 standard deviation (SD) around mean corpuscular volume (MATH- 1 SD) in identifying <b>anisocytosis</b> in automated blood counts {{when compared with the}} manual quantification of erythrocyte <b>anisocytosis</b> in peripheral blood smears. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 806 routine samples obtained from the hematology laboratory of Hospital de Clínicas da Universidade Federal do Paraná (HC-UFPR) were analyzed. Performance evaluations were carried out by dividing samples into microcytic, normocytic and macrocytic mean corpuscular volume (MCV). For each MCV range, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and efficiency were calculated. In addition, the Youden index (Y) was obtained and a comparative analysis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was done to {{evaluate the}} performance of RDW-SD, RDW-CV, and MATH- 1 SD on different MCV ranges. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: RDW-CV had the best sensitivity (86. 8 %) and efficiency (86. 8 %) in detecting <b>anisocytosis</b> in microcytic MCV ranges. RDW-SD and MATH- 1 SD were more sensitive and efficient in normocytic (82. 9 % and 83. 3 %; 92. 1 % and 92. 3 %, respectively) and macrocytic (90. 2 % and 90. 2 %; 95. 1 % and 95. 1 %, respectively) MCV ranges. A ROC curve analysis indicated that RDW-CV was more efficient in detecting <b>anisocytosis</b> in microcytic MCV ranges (p < 0. 05 vs. RDW-SD and MATH- 1 SD). In normocytic and macrocytic MCV ranges, RDW-SD and MATH- 1 SD showed similar efficiency in detecting <b>anisocytosis</b> (p < 0. 05 vs. RDW-CV). CONCLUSION: RDW-SD, RDW-CV, and MATH- 1 SD deliver different performances in detecting blood smear <b>anisocytosis</b> according to MCV values. They are parameters that complement each other and should be used together to identify erythrocyte size heterogeneity...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Red cell {{distribution}} width (RDW) {{provides a}} quantitative measure of <b>anisocytosis</b> {{and it is}} associated with the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation and a poor outcome in a variety of diseases when elevated. <b>Anisocytosis</b> is a feature of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) but it’s prognostic role in PMF has not yet been evaluated. [...] - Patients and methods: 33 newly-diagnosed patients with PMF were analyzed. Baseline RDW values were obtained in addition to CRP, LDH, complete blood count, iron metabolism parameters and JAK 2 V 617 F mutational status. Patients were staged according to IPSS prognostic scoring system, liver and spleen size were assessed by palpation. [...] - Results: Median RDW was 19. 0 % (15. 2 %- 22. 5 %). RDW correlated significantly with hemoglobin level (p= 0. 005), CRP (p= 0. 031), spleen size (p= 0. 036) and IPSS score (p= 0. 003). Patients with more pronounced <b>anisocytosis</b> had an inferior overall survival (OS) – very-high RDW (≥ 19. 0 %) vs. high RDW (15. 1 %- 18. 9 %) subgroup, HR 5. 37, p= 0. 002. RDW remained significantly associated with OS (p= 0. 002) in a multivariate model including IPSS score, hemoglobin level and CRP. [...] - Conclusion: A higher degree of <b>anisocytosis</b> is associated with more advanced disease features and a decreased overall survival. RDW encompasses standard prognostic score and may help in the rapid detection of patients with an unfavorable prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a chronic}} disease of multifactorial origin. Major cause for obesity is {{imbalance}} between energy intake and energy expenditure. One among the important {{public health problem}} in developing countries is increase in the prevalence of obesity. Obesity can be general obesity and central obesity. The central obesity is more dangerous than general obesity, since the central obesity reflects abdominal visceral fat, which acts as an endocrine organ and release several pro inflammatory cytokines, which leads to oxidative stress which in turn causes <b>anisocytosis</b> (variation {{in the size of}} the RBCs). Waist circumference indirectly measures this abdominal obesity. This study is aimed at finding the impact of Waist circumference on RBC size in obese adults. Methods: This study was done in 100 subjects in the age group 25 to 50 years (50 control with normal waist circumference and 50 obese subjects with increased waist circumference) of Annapoorana Medical college hospitals. Patients with anaemia, malnutrition, and other chronic diseases who are RBCs may show <b>anisocytosis</b> were excluded. Waist circumference was measured. Peripheral smear was prepared and stained with leishman's stain. Smear was focused under oil immersion objective, and the image was captured using a digital camera. Image was transferred to the computer system and RBC diameter was measured using UTHSCA image tool software. Variation in size of the RBCs between control and subjects was compared using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient and Paired sample t test. Results: The variation in the size of RBCs (<b>anisocytosis)</b> was more in subjects with increased waist circumference when compared with subjects of normal waist circumference. By using Pearsons product moment correlation coefficient, significant r value of 0. 5 and 0. 7 were got in male subjects and female subjects respectively. Comparing waist circumference and <b>anisocytosis</b> using Paired sample t test, significant p value of and # 706; 0. 05 was got in male and female obese subjects. Conclusions: The oxidative stress caused by the cytokines released by the adipocytes causes decreased deformability of RBCs and cause <b>anisocytosis,</b> which further causes complications.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the effect of <b>anisocytosis</b> on the association of MCV values with HbA 1 c and reticulocyte counts as markers of red cell age. Normo-, micro- and macrocytic samples, fractionated by counterflow centrifugal elutriation were studied. The previously described correlation between MCV and HbA 1 c was only observed in normal samples and in the middle fractions of samples with <b>anisocytosis.</b> At both extremes of the elutriation profile, curves for HbA 1 c content and reticulocyte count levelled out. Furthermore, in fractions containing the largest red cells of the microcytic series and the smallest red cells of normo- and macrocytic samples, reticulocyte count decreased while HbA 1 c content increased with increasing MCV.

40|$|Objectives: The {{practice}} of fresh capillary blood analysis using darkfield microscopy (FCB-DM), commonly termed ‘live blood analysis’, is currently {{used as a}} point of care screening tool for several health aberrations, including nutritional deficiencies. There is currently a paucity of scientific research into the use of this technique and there is no research to date investigating the use of FCB-DM as a screening tool for nutritional deficiencies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to begin the process of validating this technique in screening for nutritional deficiencies of iron and cobalamin. Methods: FCB-DM screenings were performed on 29 consenting participants who were likely to be deficient in iron or cobalamin. The FCB-DM screenings were photographed to permit a quantitative analysis of cell size and morphology. Each participant provided a sample of venous blood soon after the FCB-DM screening for diagnostic pathology testing. The researcher was blinded to the pathology results until all FCB-DM data analysis was complete. Data from the FCB-DM screenings were correlated with the results of pathology blood tests used for the diagnosis of iron and cobalamin deficiencies. The sensitivity and specificity of FCB-DM parameters for detecting low iron or cobalamin levels were calculated. Results: Significant correlations were found between serum ferritin and the FCB-DM parameters of annulocytosis, elliptocytosis and microcytosis. Elliptocytosis showed the best performance for test sensitivity and specificity for low iron levels. The FCB-DM parameters of macrocytosis and <b>anisocytosis</b> showed significant correlations with pathology methylmalonic acid, homocysteine and holotranscobalamin II. <b>Anisocytosis</b> was found to have good test sensitivity and specificity for low cobalamin levels. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the FCB-DM parameter elliptocytosis is a valid marker of low iron levels and that <b>anisocytosis</b> is a valid marker of low cobalamin levels. However further research into all FCB-DM parameters is required to validate their use...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to analyze the {{hematological}} parameters, the prevalence of anemia and the association between anemia and socioeconomic conditions in an elderly community-based population. METHODS: A population-based study was performed as part of the Multidimensional Study of the Elderly in Porto Alegre, Brazil (EMIPOA). An initial total of 1058 community residents aged 60 years and older were interviewed. Of these, 392 agreed to have a physical evaluation and a blood sample was taken from each. The hematological parameters analyzed in the blood samples included the hemoglobin concentration, mean cell volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RDW). The association between the variables and the diagnosis of anemia was assessed using the chi-squared test and a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of anemia was 12. 8 %. Anemia was present in 13. 7 % of women and in 10. 4 % of men. Normocytic normochromic anemia without <b>anisocytosis</b> was {{the most common type of}} anemia (46 %). The assessment of erythrocyte morphology showed significant differences between anemic and non-anemic individuals (microcytosis = 12 % vs. 1. 5 %, hypochromia = 40 % vs. 8. 8 %, and <b>anisocytosis</b> = 26 % vs. 7 %). In the analysis of socioeconomic conditions, significant differences were found in respect to age and race. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anemia increases with age and is associated with race, microcytosis, hypochromia and <b>anisocytosis.</b> Anemia is not a condition that should be associated only with the aging process, as it may be due to pathological conditions that occur most frequently in this age group. As a result, a diagnosis of anemia warrants adequate clinical attention...|$|E

Two consecutive retrospective investigations were arranged including about 7, 000 CBCs and clinical records and laboratory data from dogs showing qRBCs. Few samples with qRBCs {{were prepared for}} Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). qRBCs were found in 6. 89 % (139 of 2016) and 8. 47 % (133 of 1569) of dogs and in 3. 89 % (154 of 3, 958) and 4. 47 % (138 of 3, 081) of CBCs (some dogs were tested more than once). Statistical analysis was significant for age groups (Chi squared, P < 0. 0001), decreased total leukocyte and neutrophil counts (ANOVA, P < 0. 0001), RBCs <b>anisocytosis,</b> polychromasia, and Howell-Jolly bodies (ANOVA, P < 0. 018, < 0. 005, and < 0. 003, respectively). qRBCs were distributed {{in the area of}} feathered edge and at the smear side of body-feathered edge area in blood films.

40|$|Cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{and cancer}} {{are the leading}} causes of death worldwide. A damaged {{endothelium}} {{is one of the}} factors contributing towards these diseases. This thesis focused on understanding the implications of alterations to the physiological endothelium resulting in pathologies related to vascular disease and cancer metastasis. Functional healing response occurs in the diseased vessel wall aimed at restoring the vessel after an injury. Existing studies state that vascular progenitor cells contribute to the injured vasculature and aid in the repair process. Yet the mechanisms underlying the amalgamation of the cells to the endothelium, their origin and functions have not been clear. Through Study 1 using animal models of arterial injury, we examined the role of bone marrow derived cells in arterial repair and the mechanisms behind it. We observed that bone marrow-derived cells, helped in the initial stages of arterial injury and were subsequently eliminated from the artery wall. They localized in the arterial intima and most them were of endothelial phenotype. Additionally, bone marrow-derived cells did not fuse with the intima but could differentiate into vascular cells. This helped them adjust in the vessel wall and meet the needs of their new microenvironment. Fascinatingly, local delivery of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells to the sites of arterial injury caused a 1. 4 -fold decrease of the intimal lesion area. These results define the role of BM derived endothelial cells in the development of intimal lesions post vascular injury and this information contributes to the existing understanding of the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia. Hemodynamic forces are a cause of a dysfunctional endothelium. A turbulent blood flow could result in vascular disease. Studies have shown that red blood cell distribution (RDW) width as a risk factor for death in cancer and CVD. RDW is one of the haematological parameters commonly reported as part of a complete blood count An RDW higher than normal is termed as <b>anisocytosis.</b> <b>Anisocytosis</b> has been traditionally used, in combination with the red blood cell corpuscular volume, to diagnose chronic inflammatory status in the body. It has been never studied before if <b>anisocytosis</b> is just factor that reflects chronic inflammation in the body, or is factor that directly affects it. Hence in Study 2, we hypothesized that <b>anisocytosis</b> leads to changes in blood flow affecting interaction between blood and vascular endothelium at the bifurcation of arteries. We found that a high RDW is a predictive factor for the interaction between cellular components of blood and vascular wall. These interactions can lead to increased inflammation in the vessels and initiation of thrombosis. Put together, we suggest that <b>anisocytosis</b> measured by RDW is a predictive factor of vascular diseases. Cancer metastasis {{is one of the major}} causes of mortality and arises also due to a damaged endothelium. In Study 3 we investigated the role of murine cytomegalovirus(MCMV) in colon cancer progression using MCMV infected and non-infected animal models. Our results indicate that MCMV did not affect tumor growth but increases the incidence of metastasis to the lungs. Additionally, using microarray analysis we found cytokeratins 1, 2 and 14 to be upregulated 100 times in the infected models compared to the non-infected. We speculate that in our case metastasis is mediated possibly through a cytokeratin mediated pathway. The mechanism for dissemination is under investigation. In Study 4, we investigated the effect of C/EBPβ on metastasis and the relationship between C/EBPβ expression and overall survival of breast cancer patients. We found that decrease in C/EBPβ expression was related to shorter overall survival of breast cancer patients. Loss of C/EBPβ also, affected tumor growth, morphology and lung metastasis in murine 4 T 1 breast cancer model. Furthermore, inhibition of C/EBPβ resulted in an augmented expression of MHCII and CD 45 +, CD 3 + and CD 4 + lymphocytes accumulation in the tumors. Additional experiments established the role of inflammation in C/EBPβ-mediated metastasis formation...|$|E
