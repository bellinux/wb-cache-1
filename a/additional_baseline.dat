40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that polarimetric interferometry {{can be used}} to extract precise spatial information about compact polarized flares of Sgr A*. We show that, for a faint dynamical component, a single interferometric baseline suffices to determine both its polarization and projected displacement from the quiescent intensity centroid. A second baseline enables two-dimensional reconstruction of the displacement, and <b>additional</b> <b>baselines</b> can self-calibrate using the flare, enhancing synthesis imaging of the quiescent emission. We apply this technique to simulated 1. 3 -mm wavelength observations of a "hot spot" embedded in a radiatively inefficient accretion disk around Sgr A*.

40|$|Radio {{interferometric}} {{techniques for}} measuring spacecraft angular position {{play a role}} of increasing importance in today's missions of interplanetary exploration. Several national and international space agencies have or are developing operational systems to support spacecraft navigation using interferometric measurements. NASA's Deep Space Network has provided Delta Differential One-way Range ((Delta) DOR) for this purpose since 1980. Steady improvements in system performance and operability have taken place with accuracy today approaching the 1 -nrad level. In this paper the current performance of NASA's (Delta) DOR system is presented. Recent data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter cruise from Earth to Mars are used to illustrate system performance at 8. 4 and 32 GHz. Technical feasibility and requirements for combining tracking stations from different agencies to support (Delta) DOR observations are discussed.

40|$|The {{benefits}} for the e-MERLIN and EVN arrays of using antennae at the satellite communication station at Goonhilly in Cornwall are discussed.

These <b>additional</b> <b>baselines</b> will improve the sensitivity {{on a set of}} critical spatial scales and will increase the angular resolution of e-MERLIN by a factor of two. e-MERLIN observations, including many allocated under the e-MERLIN Legacy programme, will benefit from the enhanced angular resolution and imaging capability especially for sources close to or below the celestial equator (where ESO facilities such as ALMA will operate) of including the Goonhilly telescopes. Furthermore, the baselines formed between Goonhilly and the existing stations will close the gap between the baselines of e-MERLIN and those of the European VLBI Network (EVN) and therefore enhance the legacy value of e-MERLIN datasets.

40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that limitations in the sky model used to calibrate an interferometric radio telescope, where the model contains extended radio sources, will generate bias in the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum. The information contained in a calibration model about the spatial and spectral structure of an extended source is incomplete because a radio telescope cannot sample all Fourier components. Application of an incomplete sky model to calibration of EoR data will imprint residual error in the data, which propagates forward to the EoR power spectrum. This limited information is studied {{in the context of}} current and future planned instruments and surveys at EoR frequencies, such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA 1 -Low). For the MWA EoR experiment, we find that both the <b>additional</b> short <b>baseline</b> $uv$-coverage of the compact EoR array, and the <b>additional</b> long <b>baselines</b> provided by TGSS and planned MWA expansions, are required to obtain sufficient information on all relevant scales.

This war contagion effect was mediated by heightened perceived threat from, and negative images of, a fictitious country unrelated to the past war, indicating a generalized effect of past interstate war on perceived threat/images from any foreign country. The war contagion effect was further moderated by national glorification (Study 2).

40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} have been debating whether infants' selective imitative learning is primarily based on sensorimotor processes (e. g., motor resonance through action perception) or whether inferential processes such as teleological reasoning (i. e., reasoning about the efficiency of others' actions) predominantly explain selective imitation in infancy. The current study directly investigated two different theoretical notions employing the seminal and widely used head touch paradigm. In two conditions, we manipulated whether the action appeared to be efficient while motor resonance was optimized to enhance imitation performance in general. The results showed that infants imitated the target action {{to the same extent}} in both conditions irrespective of the action's efficiency. In addition, in both conditions, more infants imitated the head action than in an <b>additional</b> <b>baseline</b> condition or in a condition where the target action was performed by another effector.

The method builds evolutionary trees in a Bayesian online filtering framework. The tree construction is formulated as an online posterior estimation problem, which well balances both the fitness {{of the current}} tree and the smoothness between trees. The state-of-the-art multi-branch clustering method, Bayesian rose trees, is employed to generate a topic tree with a high fitness value. A constraint model is also introduced to preserve the smoothness between trees. A set of comprehensive experiments on real world news data demonstrates that the proposed method better incorporates historical tree information and is more efficient and effective than the traditional evolutionary hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Estimating this association is complicated by having only intermittent measurements on aspirin-taking. Naive, commonly-used, methods can lead to substantial bias.

Comparative analysis of texts, particularly with respect to the hermeneutics involved within each textâs passages, is an inherently qualitative effort and demands a high level of human resourcesâtime and cognitive processing necessary to read and deliberate productively.

Additionally, with respect to the mandatory qualitative approach, there can be no definitively correct assessment scores on which to answer our research question. We have done our best to create the comparative data and interpret its meaning towards a wider field, but inevitably differences of opinion will arise within the community (as they already have within out small research team).

Measurements of salinity at a resolution compatible with these coastal regions {{on a regular basis}} would provide a rich source of information {{that could be used for}} a number of applications that have a fundamental bearing on the worldâs lifestyle. Doppler radiometry offers an approach to capture such measurements, as it reduces the number of required antennas needed to form an image, compared with an Interferometer type instrument. In this work, a Doppler Radiometer type instrument on free-flying satellites is introduced. This approach removes the need for a physical connection between all the antennas, affords the system a degree of reconfigurability, yet is still able to provide data of sufficient resolution. A Y-shaped central hub (similar to the SMOS configuration) is employed with additional antennas mounted on free flying platforms surrounding the central hub. The <b>additional</b> <b>baselines</b> formed between the antennas of the free flying satellites and central hub as well as between the free flying satellites extend the u-v coverage beyond that of just the central hub. The spatial resolution of a Doppler Radiometer system with a Y-shaped hub with a SMOS configuration of antennas, with each arm extended by five 6 m spaced free flying antennas would be of the order of 5 km, when imaging from 800 km. This paper will present some initial results from a study into an instrument concept that could provide coastal salinity measurements at microwave wavelengths. The study focuses on quantifying the improvement in spatial resolution available by using this method, and includes an investigation into the effects of the relative motion between the hub and the free flying satellites on the imaging.

In the largest multicenter trial on psychotherapy of social anxiety (SA) to date comparing cognitive therapy, PDT and wait list condition N = 230 patients were assigned to receive PDT, of which N = 166 completed treatment. Treatment outcome was assessed based on diverse parameters such as endstate functioning, remission, response, and drop-out.

In this study, the model including APACHE II score only (Model 1) had surprisingly low discriminative ability (TablesÂ  3, 5), which has been documented previously [21]. The model that combined <b>additional</b> <b>baseline</b> characteristics and early ICU interventions may better assess patientsâ illness severity and thus improve the estimated risk of mortality, compared with the APACHE II score alone. Nevertheless, though the prediction model had a significantly higher C index than APACHE II score in predicting risk of hospital mortality, adding more information such as BMI, medical admission and early pharmacologic interventions increased the discriminative accuracy to only a small extent (TableÂ  3). The simplicity of the APACHE II score is a major reason why it remains the most commonly used severity scoring system globally in clinical practice as well as health research [4]. Compared with the APACHE II score alone, the utilization of a new model which increases data collection, is more complex but does not substantially improve discriminative ability. Therefore, the use of the new model would be limited to situations where a clinician or health services investigator was sufficiently dissatisfied with the APACHE II and was requiring an even minimally better model to predict risk of death in critically ill patients.|$|E

The other rover will compete for the US$5 million worth prize by completing <b>additional</b> tasks beyond <b>baseline</b> requirements to win grand or the second place prize, such as survival and range. However the plans were later modified.|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} {{accommodate}} the removal of long-length contaminated equipment (LLCE) from Hanford underground radioactive waste storage tanks was designed, procured, and demonstrated, via a project activity during the 1990 s. The system is the Long Length Contaminated Equipment Removal System (LLCERS). LLCERS will be maintained and operated by Tank Farms Engineering and Operations organizations and other varied projects having a need for the system. The responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the LLCERS Receiver Trailer (RT) and Transport Trailer (TT) resides with the RPP Characterization Project Operations organization. The purpose of this document is to provide vendor supplied operating and maintenance (O & M) information for the RT and TT in a readily retrievable form. This information is provided this way instead of in a vendor information (VI) file to maintain configuration control of the operations baseline as described in RPP- 6085, ''Configuration Management Plan for Long Length Contaminated Equipment Receiver and Transport Trailers''. <b>Additional</b> Operations <b>Baseline</b> documents are identified in RPP- 6085...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} of single epoch ambiguity resolution success rate under {{varying levels of}} pseudorange accuracy is conducted with a hypothetical, 12 satellite in view, GNSS configuration. Scenarios were run with no atmospheric error (short baseline), with ionosphere error, and with ionosphere and troposphere error contributions (long <b>baseline).</b> <b>Additional</b> calibrations and supporting model data were simulated by adding appropriate weights. The long baseline scenarios were extremely sensitive to the inclusion of ionosphere model data, and were also aided by the inclusion of troposphere data. When aided by such data, single epoch ambiguity resolution success rates of 95 to 97 % were obtained with a 10 to 20 cm pseudorange RMS...|$|R
