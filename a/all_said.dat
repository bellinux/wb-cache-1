The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.|$|E

25|$|Opponents in Richmond {{countered that}} the plan would help only a small {{subsection}} of mortgage-holders, while two banks, Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank, immediately filed lawsuits against the city.

Other cities, including Newark, North Las Vegas, and Seattle were <b>all</b> <b>said</b> to be considering mortgage seizure, although only Richmond publicly pursued the plan.

25|$|Some of the {{officials}} who fell victim to Lü Yi's abuses of power were the general Zhu Ju, the Imperial Chancellor Gu Yong, and the commandery administrators Diao Jia (刁嘉) and Zheng Zhou (鄭胄). In Zhu Ju's case, which happened sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi falsely accused him of embezzling military funds when some funds designated for Zhu Ju's army went missing. Zhu Ju, unable to explain himself, suffered in silence. The finance officer in his army also died under torture during interrogation. Later, another inspector discovered the real culprit and cleared Zhu Ju's name. As for Gu Yong, Lü Yi initially prepared {{to make a case}} against him for incompetence and ask Sun Quan to remove him from office. However, after an official Xie Gong (謝厷) pointed out that Pan Jun, the Minister of Ceremonies, would most likely become the next Imperial Chancellor if Gu Yong were to be removed from office, Lü Yi immediately dropped the case against Gu Yong because he knew that Pan Jun resented him and would take action against him if he became Imperial Chancellor. In Diao Jia's case, Lü Yi falsely accused him of defaming the imperial court, resulting in an angry Sun Quan ordering Diao Jia's arrest. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they <b>all</b> <b>said</b> they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Only Shi Yi said he did not, and he eventually managed to convince Sun Quan that Diao Jia was innocent. In Zheng Zhou's case, earlier on he had arrested and executed Lü Yi's retainer(s) for breaking the law, so Lü Yi bore a grudge against him and spoke ill of him in front of Sun Quan. Sun Quan, believing what Lü Yi said, turned furious and summoned Zheng Zhou to meet him. Pan Jun and Chen Biao spoke up for Zheng Zhou and succeeded in convincing Sun Quan to spare him.|$|E
