2500|$|The lizards of New Guinea are {{represented}} by approximately 200 described species. Of these, a majority are skinks with {{a smaller number of}} geckos and <b>agamids.</b> The largest lizard is the crocodile monitor. The snakes, approximately 100 described species, show a much lower rate of endemism than most of New Guinea's fauna.|$|E
2500|$|Bipedalism {{is unknown}} among the amphibians. Among the non-archosaur {{reptiles}} bipedalism is rare, {{but it is}} found in the 'reared-up' running of lizards such as <b>agamids</b> and monitor lizards. Many reptile species will also temporarily adopt bipedalism while fighting. [...] One genus of basilisk lizard can run bipedally across the surface of water for some distance. Among arthropods, cockroaches are known to move bipedally at high speeds. [...] Bipedalism is rarely found outside terrestrial animals, though at least two types of octopus walk bipedally on the sea floor using two of their arms, allowing the remaining arms to be used to camouflage the octopus as a mat of algae or a floating coconut.|$|E

50|$|The {{chameleons}} {{are probably}} far older than that, perhaps sharing a common ancestor with iguanids and <b>agamids</b> more than 100 mya (<b>agamids</b> being more closely related).

50|$|The <b>agamids</b> show {{a curious}} distribution. They are found {{over much of}} the Old World, {{including}} continental Africa, Australia, southern Asia, and sparsely in warmer regions of Europe. They are, however, absent from Madagascar and the New World. The distribution is the opposite of that of the iguanids, which are found in just these areas but absent in areas where <b>agamids</b> are found. A similar faunal divide is found in between the boas and pythons.|$|E
50|$|This species feeds {{mainly on}} lizards such as skinks, geckos, <b>agamids,</b> other snakes, toads and {{occasionally}} mice and birds. It will also readily eat carrion.|$|E
50|$|Phylogenetically, {{they may}} be sister to the Iguanidae, and have a similar appearance. <b>Agamids</b> usually have well-developed, strong legs. Their tails cannot be shed and {{regenerated}} like those of geckos, though {{a certain amount of}} regeneration is observed in some. Many agamid species are capable of limited change of their colours to regulate their body temperature. In some species, males are more brightly coloured than females, and colours play a part in signaling and reproductive behaviours. Although <b>agamids</b> generally inhabit warm environments, ranging from hot deserts to tropical rainforests, at least one species, the mountain dragon, is found in cooler regions.|$|E

50|$|All recent {{molecular}} {{studies suggest}} that several groups form a venom clade, which encompasses a majority (nearly 60%) of squamate species. Named Toxicofera, it combines the groups Serpentes (snakes), Iguania (<b>agamids,</b> chameleons, iguanids, etc.), and Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, Gila monster, glass lizards, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Like many <b>agamids,</b> stellions {{can change}} color {{to express their}} moods. They bask on stone walls, rocks, and trees. They are usually found in rocky habitats, and are quite shy, being very ready to dive into cracks to hide from {{potential}} predators.|$|E
50|$|Like most <b>agamids,</b> painted dragons are swift-moving reptiles, {{capable of}} {{impressive}} sprints over short distances. This diurnal (day-active) lizard, like the majority reptiles, is an ectotherm {{meaning that it}} has to rely on its environment to regulate body temperature and as a result will spend considerable time basking to absorb heat. Known to be especially fond of low vegetation and ground debris such as fallen logs and branches, it occupies short burrows often concealed at the base of shrubs such as saltbush. Unlike the majority of other <b>agamids</b> which like to perch in elevated places, this species prefers to rest on low branches, from which it will forage over the surrounding open areas and ground litter. When disturbed or alarmed it will quickly retreat to the safety of the nearby burrow.|$|E

50|$|Indiagama is an extinct genus of agamid lizard {{known from}} the type species Indiagama gujarata from the early Eocene of India.

50|$|The dentitions of lizards {{reflect their}} {{wide range of}} diets, {{including}} carnivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, herbivorous, nectivorous, and molluscivorous. Species typically have uniform teeth suited to their diet, but several species have variable teeth, such as cutting teeth {{in the front of}} the jaws and crushing teeth in the rear. Most species are pleurodont, though <b>agamids</b> and chameleons are acrodont.|$|E

50|$|The family Gekkonidae {{to which}} G. variegata belongs to are of Gondwanan origin. When the land mass of Australia split from Gondwana, it {{contained}} early <b>agamids</b> and diplodactlyds, the latter encompassing geckoes.

The Scleroglossan group includes the clade Gekkota consisting of three families, including Gekkonidae.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{subclass}} Lepidosauria {{there are}} herbivores, omnivores, insectivores, and carnivores. The herbivores consist of iguanines, some <b>agamids,</b> and some skinks. Most lizard species and some snake species are insectivores. The remaining snake species, tuataras, and amphisbaenians, are carnivores. While some snake species are generalist, others eat {{a narrow range}} of prey - for example, Salvadora only eat lizards. The remaining lizards are omnivores and can consume plants or insects.|$|E
