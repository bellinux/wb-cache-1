5|$|A {{number of}} Armenians have entered into politics. The first Armenian {{to hold a}} high {{position}} office was Republican Steven Derounian, a Bulgarian-born Armenian, represented New York from 1953 to 1965 in the House of Representatives. George Deukmejian became the Republican governor of California in 1983 and left the office in 1991. Previously he had served as State Assemblyman (1963–1967), State Senator (1967–1979) and California Attorney General (1979–1983). A number of Armenian <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elected to state legislatures, especially in California. In Massachusetts, George Keverian served as a representative in the State House, eventually becoming its speaker from 1985 to 1991.|$|E
5|$|Statistics on lynchings {{began to}} be {{collected}} in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed by extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, whites publicly prohibited interracial relationships {{as a means to}} maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow mores was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.|$|E
5|$|The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} Scouting {{organizations}} in the United States of America and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with more than 2.4 million youth participants and nearly one million adult volunteers.

25|$|Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{characterized}} as a panethnicity of various groups or individuals. These generalizations are mostly based on outward appearance.

25|$|In 1964, Barry Goldwater's {{platform}} galvanized South Carolina's conservative Democrats and led {{to major}} defections of whites into the Republican Party, led by Senator Strom Thurmond. With the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, the national government under the Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson worked to enforce rights for South Carolina and other blacks to participate in public life and regain the power of suffrage. Since then African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> regularly elected to national, state and local offices in the state.|$|E
25|$|When Asian Americans {{were largely}} {{excluded}} from labor {{markets in the}} 19th century, they started their own businesses. They have started convenience and grocery stores, professional offices such as medical and law practices, laundries, restaurants, beauty-related ventures, hi-tech companies, and many other kinds of enterprises, becoming very successful and influential in American society. They have dramatically expanded their involvement across the American economy. Asian <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> disproportionately successful in the hi-tech sectors of California's Silicon Valley, {{as evidenced by the}} Goldsea 100 Compilation of America's Most Successful Asian Entrepreneurs.|$|E

The neighborhoods of South LA with highest concentration of African Americans include Crenshaw, Baldwin Hills, Leimert Park, Hyde Park, Gramercy Park, Manchester Square and Watts. Apart from South Los Angeles, neighborhoods in the Central region of Los Angeles, as Mid-City and Mid-Wilshire have a moderate concentration of African Americans as well. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported the city's population as 17.9% black, 61.1% non-Hispanic white and 17.1% Hispanic.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Jencks {{concludes that}} as a group African <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> harmed by the {{introduction}} of standardized entrance exams such as the SAT. This, according to him, is not because the tests themselves are flawed, but because of labeling bias and selection bias; the tests measure the skills that African Americans are less likely to develop in their socialization, rather than the skills {{they are more likely to}} develop. Furthermore, standardized entrance exams are often labeled as tests of general ability, rather than of certain aspects of ability. Thus, a situation is produced in which African American ability is consistently underestimated within the education and workplace environments, contributing in turn to selection bias against them which exacerbates underachievement.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the {{population}} grew to 31,408, {{and continued to}} grow to 67,134 in 1960, and nearly doubling in 1970 to 135,248; by 1990, {{the population}} of Filipinos in California grew to almost {{three quarters of a}} million people (733,941). Since at least 1990, Filipino <b>Americans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the largest group of Asian Pacific Americans in the state. In 1990, more than half (52 percent) of all Filipino Americans lived in California. In 2000, almost half of all Filipino Americans in the United States lived in California (49.4 percent), with the Los Angeles County and San Diego County having the highest concentration of that population; additionally in 2000, California was home to nearly half (49 percent) of Filipino immigrants. In 2008, {{one out of every four}} Filipino Americans live in Southern California, numbering over 1 million.|$|E
