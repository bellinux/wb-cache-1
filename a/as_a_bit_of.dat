25|$|This {{time the}} Greys {{were able to}} use a final {{appearance}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a stepping stone. In 2000-01 they earned a first-place finish {{for the first time since}} 1987 and blew past the Guelph Dominators in the quarter-finals, earning a rematch with Cambridge. The Winterhawks had finished four places and 17 points behind the Greys. That didn't stop them from dumping Owen Sound 4-2, a bitter disappointment for the favoured Greys.|$|E
25|$|The second Torneo Cibernetico match {{took place}} {{a week later}} and saw Pierrothito as {{the winner of the}} match when he outlasted Aéreo, Pequeño Halcón, Universito 2000, Astral, Último Dragóncito, Pequeño Black Warrior and Bam Bam. Pierrothito's victory was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a surprise, first and {{foremost}} because he was a Rudo just like Demus 3:16, but also because Demus and Bam Bam, the last man eliminated by Pierrothito, was a longtime rival and had frequently talked about wanting to move up a division in various interviews.|$|E
25|$|Hussain was {{subsequently}} not picked {{for the next}} three years. Hussain was also regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a hot-head, and his fiery temper briefly jeopardised his prospects of an international career. At Essex Hussain continued to score runs and impress his county colleague and England captain Graham Gooch enough to have a Test reprieve. So at the 3rd Ashes Test of 1993, Hussain joined an England team. Hussain scored 71 and 47 not out, which was enough to see him selected {{for the rest of the}} series. It was however not enough to secure his place for the subsequent winter tour, nor for that matter the next three years of Test matches.|$|E

25|$|In 1892, McCall {{was elected}} to the United States House of Representatives, a seat he would occupy for twenty years, {{generally}} winning reelection by large margins. As he had in the state legislature, he introduced a corrupt practices act into Congress. In foreign policy, he was anti-imperialist, arguing for the independence of The Philippines after the Spanish–American War, and opposed the Dingley Tariff, arguing its rates were too high. He {{was one of the few}} representatives opposed to the Hepburn Act, which enabled the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates. He had a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a maverick, because he often strayed from the Republican party line, but he maintained a generally conservative voting record, and introduced little new legislation.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{targeted}} at a specialist audience, {{was not intended}} as a textbook but {{as a means to}} show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, the only one he found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion Creangă foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax; this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar works. Here, he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the increasing output of Moldavian writers meant that, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.|$|E

In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So I bought a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'...

500|$|The San Diego Padres drafted Hamilton eighth {{overall in}} the 1991 Major League Baseball draft, making him the highest drafted Atlantic Sun Conference {{baseball}} player in the league's history. He eventually {{signed a contract with}} the Padres worth $415,000 after a short period in which Hamilton refused to sign a contract. He was surprised upon hearing of his selection, saying [...] "It came <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a shock because I really hadn't heard much from the Padres." [...] According to Hamilton's mother, Hamilton only signed the deal because his father Jack was dying of cancer, and it had been his father's dream to watch his son pitch in the major leagues. Following the draft, Hamilton joined Team USA in Canada in preparation for the Olympics.|$|E

[...] Powers also wrote, [...] "Playing on memory and melancholia, Janet's 'Rock With U' is nowhere {{as great as}} the original, but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> {{intimate}} meta-pop it's utterly poignant. Jackson has long been the bearer of her brother's secrets, and on this song she shows that she can still crave something other than sexual fulfillment. Something like innocence." [...] Michael Arceneaux of PopMatters praised the track, calling it [...] "a sensual gem" [...] and [...] "almost euphoric", effectively complimenting Jackson's [...] "whispery delivery." [...] Arceneaux added, [...] "It’s a digitized form of pop music Janet should look into for future recordings." [...] Tom Young from BBC was negative in his review, saying that its lyrics would not seduce anybody.|$|E
500|$|Although largely well-liked, Mulan's {{characterization}} {{has drawn}} some mild criticism and speculation, inspiring {{a series of}} generally mixed to positive reviews from some film critics. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "Far more than Beauty and the Beast or the stolidly virtuous Pocahontas, Mulan showcases a girl who gets to use her wits ...a testament {{to the power of}} mind over brawn." [...] However, Gleiberman continued, [...] "Mulan finally falls a notch short of Disney's best... because the heroine's empowerment remains... an emotionally isolated quest." [...] Similarly, Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times hailed Mulan as [...] "a strong, engaging character who, unlike many of her Disney counterparts, needs no one to rescue her from danger," [...] while questioning her personality, asking, [...] "was it really necessary to bestow Mulan with self-esteem problems? Because she seems so confident and intelligent, her sad statement that she wants to 'see something worthwhile' in the mirror comes <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a shock." ...|$|E
500|$|Neeson auditioned as Schindler early on, and {{was cast}} in December 1992, after Spielberg saw him perform in Anna Christie on Broadway. Warren Beatty participated in a script reading, but Spielberg was {{concerned}} {{that he could not}} disguise his accent and that he would bring [...] "movie star baggage". Kevin Costner and Mel Gibson expressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson, so the actor's star quality would not overpower the character. Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a buffoon. [...] "They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect." [...] To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips of Time Warner CEO Steve Ross, who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's. He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.|$|E

500|$|Livingstone's {{administration}} advocated {{measures to}} improve the lives of minorities within London, who together made up a sizeable percentage of the city's population; what Reg Race called [...] "the Rainbow Coalition". The GLC allocated a small percentage of its expenditure on funding minority community groups, including the London Gay Teenage Group, English Collective of Prostitutes, Women Against Rape, Lesbian Line, A Woman's Place, and Rights of Women. Believing these groups could initiate social change, the GLC increased its annual funding of voluntary organisations from £6 million in 1980 to £50 million in 1984. They provided loans to such groups, coming under a barrage of press criticism for awarding a loan to the Sheba Feminist Publishers, whose works were widely labelled pornographic. In July 1981, Livingstone founded the Ethnic Minorities Committee, the Police Committee, and the Gay and Lesbian Working Party, and in June 1982, a Women's Committee was also established. Believing the Metropolitan Police to be a racist organisation, he appointed Paul Boateng to head the Police Committee and monitor the force's activities. Considering the police a highly political organisation, he publicly remarked that [...] "When you canvas police flats at election time, you find that they are either Conservatives who think of Thatcher <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a pinko or they are National Front." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite contending {{late into}} the season, the 1948 Yankees {{finished}} in third place. Harris was released and the Yankees brought in Casey Stengel to manage. At the time, Stengel had [...] "a reputation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a clown", according to Appel, and had been unsuccessful in two previous MLB managing stints. As the Yankees' manager, he optimized matchups by using a platoon system, playing more left-handed batters against right-handed pitchers. Numerous injuries affected the team during the 1949 season but it battled with the Red Sox for the AL pennant; before a season-ending two-game series at Yankee Stadium, New York trailed Boston by one game and needed a pair of wins. By scores of 5–4 and 5–3, the Yankees won the two games and the league championship. New York won a World Series rematch with the Dodgers in five games. Stengel was named AL Manager of the Year in his first season. The Yankees faced another competitive pennant race in 1950, as the Tigers joined New York and Boston {{at the top of}} the AL. Late in the season, the Yankees broke a tie with the Tigers for first place and went on to win the pennant. In the 1950 World Series, the Yankees swept the Phillies; the second game was decided by a DiMaggio home run in the tenth inning. Following the season, Yankee Phil Rizzuto was named AL MVP after recording 200 base hits during the regular season.|$|E
500|$|In mid-October 1965, the Beatles {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio; {{for the first}} time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, [...] "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> art on their own." [...] Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to [...] "the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as [...] "the pot album", and Starr said: [...] "Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently." [...] After Help!s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning.

She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury is still out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E
