Through {{establishing}} solidification-heat transfer {{mathematical model}} of the super heavy <b>steel</b> <b>ingot,</b> the temperature distribution at different moments in the solidification process of <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> has been simulated.

40|$|Melt {{convection}} and macrosegregation in casting {{of a large}} <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> are numerically simulated. The simulation {{is based}} on a previously developed model for multicomponent steel solidification with melt convection and involves the solution of fully coupled conservation equations for the transport phenomena in the liquid, mush, and solid. Heat transfer in the mold and insulation materials, as well as the formation of a shrinkage cavity at the top, is taken into account. The numerical results show the evolution of the temperature, melt velocity, and species concentration fields during solidification. The predicted variation of the macrosegregation of carbon and sulfur along the vertical centerline is compared with measurements from an industrial <b>steel</b> <b>ingot</b> that was sectioned and analyzed. Although generally good agreement is obtained, the neglect of sedimentation of free equiaxed grains prevents the prediction of the zone of negative macrosegregation observed in {{the lower part of the}} ingot. It is also shown that the inclusion of the shrinkage cavity at the top and the variation of the final solidification temperature due to macrosegregation is important in obtaining good agreement between the predictions and measurements.
