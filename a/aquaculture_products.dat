40|$|The green seaweed Ulva {{is a major}} fouling {{organism}} but also an edible <b>aquaculture</b> <b>product</b> in Asia. This study quantified {{for the first time}} the effect of key factors on the reproduction of a tropical species of filamentous Ulva (Ulva sp. 3). The controlled timing of release of swarmers (motile reproductive bodies) was achieved when experiments were initiated in the early afternoon by exposing the thalli to a temperature shock (4 °C) for 10 min and subsequently placing them into autoclaved filtered seawater under a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod at 25 °C. The release of swarmers then peaked two days after initiation. In contrast, segmentation, dehydration, salinity or time of initiation of experiments had no effect of any magnitude on reproduction. The released swarmers were predominantly biflagellate (95 %), negatively phototactic and germinated without complementary gametes.

40|$|Markers of {{oxidative}} stress {{in response to}} hypoxia and reoxygenation were assessed in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Adult shrimp were either exposed to hypoxia (1 mg O 2 /L) for 6, 12, or 24 h followed by 1 -h reoxygenation, or exposed to hypoxia for 24 h followed by 1 - to 6 -h reoxygenation. In all cases, shrimp maintained at constant normoxia were used as controls. Spectrophotometric techniques were applied to analyze lactate concentration, superoxide radical (O 2 [dot above]-) production, lipid peroxidation (TBARS), and antioxidant capacity status in muscle, hepatopancreas, and gill samples. Results indicate differences among tissues, even under control conditions. O 2 [dot above]- production and TBARS levels were higher in hepatopancreas than in gill or muscle. No effect of exposure to hypoxia was found. However, reoxygenation following exposure to hypoxia was found to affect the oxidative metabolism of muscle and hepatopancreas from cultured shrimp.

40|$|Historically, {{milkfish}} (Chanos chanos Forsskal) {{has been}} the premier <b>aquaculture</b> <b>product</b> in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. However, there are {{significant differences in the}} industry's performance among and within these places, especially in terms of yield. These differences can be explained by different factor (land, labor, capital) endowments and by the fact that producers have generally been responsive to these conditions. In Taiwan and the Philippines, milkfish production is becoming less profitable over time. In both places, brackishwater pond producers of milkfish are caught in a cost-price squeeze as input costs have increased more rapidly than market prices. Indonesian producers also face market constraints because high regional transport costs often isolate them from major market centers. In response to declining profitability of milkfish, producers have been changing their production techniques and shifting to the culture of other species such as tilapia that currently have greater domestic or export market potential. Although total milkfish production continues to increase, in the Philippines and Indonesia at least, milkfish's traditional share of total aquaculture production in all these places has declined quite dramatically over the last 10 years, and this trend is likely to continue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — It is an {{established}} fact {{that climate change}} caused by human-induced concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially CO 2 emissions, are increasing in the earth’s atmosphere {{and is one of}} the greatest challenges the world is currently facing. Algae play significant roles in normal functioning of the atmospheric environment and are important candidates for climate change mitigation. Macroalgae (over 20 commercial seaweed species) are the second most cultured species of aquatic organisms after finfish. More than 92 % of the world’s macroalgae production comes from mariculture. Macroalgae have a higher photosynthetic efficacy (6 – 8 %) than that of terrestrial plants (1. 8 – 2. 2 %). An investigation into seaweed as a food source for the South African abalone (Haliotis midae L.) has led to an increased knowledge of its fisheries and aquaculture conditions. Ulva spp are grown on a large scale in paddle wheel ponds and is currently South Africa’s largest <b>aquaculture</b> <b>product.</b> Its growth rate, ease of harvesting, resistance to contamination by other algal species and minimal production loss make it preferable to microalgae and to other macroalgae for large scale renewable energy production and CO 2 capturing systems. Of all macroalgae, Ulva spp are exciting prospects in terms of energy efficiency. Findings have further revealed that biotransformation of Ulva to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is viable.

Vertebrate-type steroids and their receptors were identified in crustaceans and implicated in reproduction. In this study, we presented the sex steroids estradiol and progesterone by LC-MS/MS in female M. rosenbergii, and reveal steroidogenic-related genes by in silico analysis of de novo assembled transcriptomes. Comparative analysis with other species was performed to confirm their putative role, as well as tissue-specific and quantitative gene expression. We reveal 29 transcripts that encode for steroidogenic-related proteins, including steroidogenic enzymes, a nuclear steroid hormone receptor, and a steroidogenic factor. Moreover, we identified for the first time the presence of steroidogenic factor 1, StAR-related lipid transfer protein, estradiol receptor- and progesterone-like protein in M. rosenbergii. Those targeted for gene expression analysis (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, estrogen sulfotransferase and progesterone receptor-like) showed widespread expression within many tissues, and at relatively high levels in the central nervous system during ovarian maturation. In summary, we provide further evidence for the existence of steroidogenic pathways in crustaceans, which may be useful for advancing prawn aquaculture...|$|R
40|$|In aquaculture, {{nutrient}} loading {{is defined}} as the difference between nutrients supplied with fertilizers and feed and nutrients harvested in the form of finfish, crustaceans, molluscs and seaweeds. On average, the production of finfish and crustaceans results in a net nutrient loading, while for the production of molluscs and seaweeds the nutrient loading is negative. In marine and brackish water aquaculture, on a global scale, more nutrients are extracted than added to the environment. However, in freshwater, more nutrients are loaded than extracted. In 2008, the global aquaculture production of finfish and crustaceans resulted in an environmental loading of 1. 7 million metric tonnes of nitrogen (N) and 0. 46 million metric tonnes of phosphorus (P). This nitrogen loading represents 0. 9 % of the human input to the N-cycle and 0. 4 % of the global N-cycle. For phosphorus, the loading from finfish and crustacean aquaculture represents 2. 3 % of the global annual fertilizer supply. With cage aquaculture, nutrients are directly discharged to the environment. Mitigation measures should be shared equally between all polluters involved. For land-based aquaculture, the development of water re-use systems is still in its infancy. Although still a minor contributor to global aquaculture production, recirculation technology shows that control and mitigation of pollution from aquaculture is possible. A 15 – 20 year goal should be to have all inland aquaculture operations applying water re-use and purification technology and generating useful (waste) outputs in addition to standard <b>aquaculture</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R
