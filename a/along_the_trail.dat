5|$|Black bear {{activity}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in New Jersey increased rapidly {{starting in}} 2001. Hence, metal bear-proof trash boxes {{are in place}} at all New Jersey shelters.|$|E
5|$|Famous {{landmarks}} {{along the}} southern route included Ayres Natural Bridge and Register Cliff, {{one of a number}} of locations <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in Wyoming where settlers carved their names.|$|E
5|$|For most hikers, {{the most}} {{persistent}} pests <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> are ticks, mosquitos, and black flies {{along with the}} mice that inhabit shelters.|$|E
50|$|Rattlesnakes (specifically, the {{northern}} Pacific rattlesnake: Crotalus oreganus) {{are known to}} be active during the summer months. They can occasionally be seen shading themselves in <b>the</b> foliage <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> Another snake that is native to the park is the California kingsnake, they are nonvenomous and can also be found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Locations <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> {{are listed}} in North to South order.|$|R
50|$|Bird and {{wildlife}} watching {{is the main}} activity. There are multiple observation towers and stations <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b>|$|R
5|$|Other hazards include venomous snakes, {{including}} the Eastern timber rattlesnake and copperhead, which are common <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Both snakes are generally found in drier, rockier {{sections of the}} trail; the copperhead's range extends north to around the New Jersey–New York state line, while rattlesnakes are commonly found <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in Connecticut and have been reported, although rarely, {{as far north as}} New Hampshire. Other large mammals commonly sighted include deer; elk, reintroduced in the Smoky Mountains; and moose, which may be found in the vicinity of Massachusetts and northward.|$|E
5|$|The Appalachian Trail is {{relatively}} safe. Most injuries or incidents {{are consistent with}} comparable outdoor activities. Most hazards are related to weather conditions, human error, plants, animals, diseases, and hostile humans encountered <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Pony Express route {{has been}} {{designated}} the Pony Express National Historic Trail. Approximately 120 historic sites <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> may eventually {{be open to the}} public, including 50 stations or station ruins.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Donkey Trail": Visitors ride on donkeys to {{the nearby}} woods or <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> of <b>the</b> village.|$|R
50|$|<b>Along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> are rest areas, lean-to, campsites, log {{cabins and}} other shelters.There are several springs to refill with {{drinking}} water.|$|R
50|$|Slats are one {{of several}} {{high-lift}} devices used on airliners, such as flap systems running <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of <b>the</b> wing.|$|R
5|$|The {{following}} are major points <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{at which the}} early Mormon pioneers stopped, established temporary camps, or used as landmarks and meeting places. The sites are categorized by their location in respect to modern-day US states.|$|E
5|$|Several shale {{outcrops}} {{are visible}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> {{with views of}} the Shawangunk Ridge to the west; the skytop tower of the Mohonk Mountain House is visible {{on one of the}} cliffs. Parking for the trail is provided at a municipal lot on Farmers Turnpike in Gardiner. In New Paltz, there are parking lots at the Sojourner Truth park, off Springtown Road, at the Huguenot Historical Society, and at a Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) conference center. The trail runs parallel to state routes 208 and 32; there are two park and rides on Route 32, a 63-spot lot in New Paltz, and a 58-spot lot in Rosendale. There are two bicycle shops <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> in both Gardiner and New Paltz.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush era, when dog trains would resupply at points <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
50|$|The park is {{open from}} dawn until dusk. Because of the cliffs and hazards <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> night hiking is not {{recommended}} due to the decreased visibility.|$|R
50|$|Hunting {{is allowed}} in KI Jo-Mary, but not <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails</b> in Gulf Hagas. Fishing is allowed per Maine State law. ATVs are not {{permitted}} in KI Jo-Mary.|$|R
50|$|Increased {{traffic of}} emigrants <b>along</b> <b>the</b> related Oregon, Mormon and California <b>trails,</b> {{beginning}} in <b>the</b> early 1840s, heightened competition with Native Americans for scarce resources {{of water and}} game in arid areas. With resource depletion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails,</b> <b>the</b> Cheyenne became increasingly divided into the Northern Cheyenne and Southern Cheyenne, where they could have adequate territory for sustenance.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> The pavilion includes a donated antique caboose. While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E
5|$|The trail serves hikers, joggers, bikers, horseback riders, and {{cross-country}} skiers. It {{passes through}} several historic districts, such as Huguenot Street in New Paltz, and the Binnewater Historic District and Snyder Estate in Rosendale. The trail also traverses U.S. Route 44 (concurrent with State Route 55), and state routes 299 and 213. Several natural features are visible from clearing <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> {{such as the}} Shawangunk Ridge to the west, and the Plattekill Creek between New Paltz and Gardiner. The trail passes through dense vegetation, and is frequented by many types of animals and overwintering birds.|$|E
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> Critically wounded men often died before reaching the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die before reaching adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
50|$|The larvae {{have been}} {{recorded}} feeding on Fagonia glutinosa and Fagonia sinaica. They spin loose webs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> stems and upon the ground beneath or the rocks behind them.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 8 mm. Adults have a fringe <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trailing</b> edge of each wing. The forewings have {{light and dark}} chevron markings, while the hindwings are golden brown.|$|R
50|$|Wilderness Park {{features}} a {{vast network of}} walking trails, single-track biking trails, and horse trails. Each trail type is denoted by signs <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b> <b>The</b> hiking <b>trail</b> was designated part of <b>the</b> National Recreation <b>Trails</b> Program in 1977.|$|R
5|$|Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker {{received}} a three-month-old letter from their father, stating {{that he and}} other family members wanted to emigrate, and would do so if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the Naches Pass into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first Fort Walla Walla (near Richland, Washington), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail.</b> He guided the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the trail}} is close to public roads or state forest roads. There are no camping {{facilities}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and camping is generally prohibited in the areas <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976 {{the state}} {{purchased}} some more land <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and built another lean-to at , <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> below the summit. The {{next year the}} tower's two support structures, the observer's cabin and a storage shed, were removed. These were the last significant changes to facilities on Tremper for two decades.|$|E
50|$|Warrior <b>Trail</b> reaches from <b>the</b> Monongahela River at Greensboro to the Ohio River {{south of}} Moundsville, West Virginia. The total {{distance}} is 67 mi, with 45 mi in Pennsylvania. Marked with yellow blazes and red mileposts, <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> mostly follows an east-west course 5 to 6 {{miles north of}} the Pennsylvania-West Virginia border, <b>along</b> <b>the</b> ridges that form a divide between watersheds. There are no streams to ford <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail's</b> entire length. Three Adirondack-type shelters are spaced relatively evenly <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail's</b> distance in Pennsylvania. Warrior Trail is entirely on private property, and volunteers have worked very hard to maintain the cooperation of landowners. Please allow this advantageous situation to continue by respecting private property.|$|R
50|$|Equestrian activities: Perry State Park and {{the public}} use Corps of Engineers land has over 25 miles of horse trails for exploration. Primitive camping is allowed at select {{locations}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trails.</b>|$|R
50|$|This section has a well packed gravel surface. Heading out of Cowarr <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{continues}} past <b>the</b> scenic Rainbow Creek {{crossing and}} through the rich river flats. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> passes through Dawson Flora Reserve, housing many significant flora species {{and can be found}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail's</b> shoulder.|$|R
