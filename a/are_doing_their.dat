25|$|Since 2004, several {{researchers}} at Oregon State University's (OSU) College of Forestry have researched {{various aspects of}} Christmas tree cultivation. In the Department of Forest Resources, Rick Fletcher is researching Christmas tree genetics, fertilization and disease management, while Chad Landgren is concentrating his emphasis on Christmas tree genetics and disease management. Both men <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> research in the Silviculture and Ecology Section of the department. In OSU's Department of Forest Science, Mike Bondi is conducting ongoing research into Christmas tree fertilization, productivity and genetics, as well as natural and artificial regeneration systems. During the mid-1990s, the trio's research was primarily focused on creating better Christmas tree seed stock, resulting in {{a higher percentage of}} quality mature trees, through genetic improvements. Similar research has been conducted by the Agricultural Experiment Station at New Mexico State University.|$|E
25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system worked like an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

Dolenz and Jones are initially indifferent because to them, coming from the acting world, it was just a soundtrack to the TV show and they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> job by singing what they were asked to sing.

During {{the early stages}} of production for The Definition Of..., Fantasia posted several videos on her social media accounts of her recording sessions with Kelly. In promotional interviews, Fantasia said that the album was initially produced by another artist who she “really, really, really loved", but she switched to a different team for the final product. She explained: [...] "Sometimes, when you work with producers who are artists, it’s very hard, They <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> thing … and things got a little chaotic.” Derrick G. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times speculated that Kelly was the producer mentioned by Fantasia.|$|E
500|$|Patrick J. Ford of The American Conservative said WALL-Es {{conservative}} critics missed {{lessons in}} the film that he felt appealed to traditional conservatism. He argued that the mass consumerism in the film was not {{shown to be a}} product of big business, but of too close a tie between big business and big government: [...] "The government unilaterally provided its citizens with everything they needed, and this lack of variety led to Earth's downfall." [...] Responding to Coffin's claim that the film points out the evils of mankind, Ford argued the only evils depicted were those that resulted from losing touch with our own humanity and that fundamental conservative representations such as the farm, the family unit, and wholesome entertainment were in the end held aloft by the human characters. He concluded, [...] "By steering conservative families away from WALL-E, these commentators <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> readers a great disservice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whistle-blowers {{are often}} high-performing {{employees}} {{who believe they}} <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> job (Martin, 2005). They just want to bring people's attention to a problem that is potentially harmful or unethical. [...] Despite this, whistle-blowers are perceived negatively and suffer grave consequences. They are often ostracized, harassed, and attacked by their superiors and coworkers. They face termination, financial losses, stress, relationship breakdown, and health problems. Even worse, few whistle-blowers seem to bring about any change. The organization seems to put all their efforts into destroying the whistle-blower while ignoring the original problem. The organization will take great measures to cover-up the problem, devalue the target, reinterpret the events, and intimidate and/or bribe the whistle-blowers (Martin, 2005).|$|E

2500|$|Mormons see the {{tendency}} to dismiss the possibility that God could call modern prophets as similar to the attitude {{of those in the}} Bible who rejected the prophets and/or apostles of their day. As demonstrated by the Jews in the time of Jesus, it is often much less challenging to accept prophets of prior ages, rather than a contemporary prophet. Granted, the work of a prophet has always been to dispel false beliefs and warn against behaviors that are contrary to God's will, which inevitably creates friction when viewed as a threat to firmly entrenched traditions and mindsets. The sense of change in the message of Christ and the apostles led many to regard them as false prophets. Christ himself warned against false prophets, teaching that the way to distinguish between a true and a false prophet was [...] "by their fruits" [...] (Matt 7:15-20); however, the perceived threat to tradition was often a strong enough deterrent to cause the witnesses of good fruits (such as powerful sermons or miraculous healings) to dismiss them as the work of the devil (Matt 12:24). After Christ ordained his apostles, he warned them of the extreme opposition they would encounter for these reasons, telling them, [...] "ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake" [...] (Matt 10:16-23). Christ also said, “Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! For so did their fathers to the false prophets," [...] thus illustrating that opposition will naturally accompany a true prophet if they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> job correctly (Luke 6:22-26).|$|E
2500|$|Gibson's {{script was}} mockingly {{summed up by}} him as [...] "Space commies hijack alien eggs – big problem in Mallworld". The story picked up after Aliens, with the Sulaco {{drifting}} into an area of space claimed by the [...] "Union of Progressive Peoples". The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The Sulaco then arrives at a space station-shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint. With Ripley put in a coma, Hicks explores the station and discovers Weyland-Yutani are developing an Alien army. In the meantime, the U.P.P. <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>their</b> own research, which led them to repair Bishop. Eventually Anchorpoint and the U.P.P stations are overrun with the Aliens, and Hicks must team up with the survivors to destroy the parasites. The film ends with a teaser for a fourth movie, where Bishop suggests to Hicks that humans are united against a common enemy, and they must track the Aliens to their source and destroy them. The screenplay was very action oriented, featuring an extended cast, and is considered in some circles as superior to the final film and has a considerable following on the Internet. The producers were on the whole unsatisfied with the screenplay, which Giler described as [...] "a perfectly executed script that wasn't all that interesting", particularly for not taking new directions with the initial pitch. They still liked certain parts, such as the subtext making the Alien {{a metaphor for the}} HIV, but felt it lacking the human element present in Aliens and Gibson's trademark cyberpunk aesthetic. Following the end of the WGA strike, Gibson was asked to make rewrites with Harlin, but declined, citing various other commitments and [...] "foot dragging on the producers' part." ...|$|E
