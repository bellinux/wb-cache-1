Cultured rhesus monkey fibroblasts infected with each recombinant strain were shown to express the expected protein. Three RRV-negative and two RRV-positive rhesus monkeys were inoculated intravenously {{with a mixture of}} these three recombinant RRVs. Expression of SIV Gag was readily detected in lymph node biopsy specimens taken at 3 weeks postimmunization. Impressive anti-SIV cellular immune responses were elicited on the basis of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer staining and gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays. Responses were much greater in magnitude in the monkeys that were initially RRV negative but were still readily detected in the two monkeys that were naturally infected with RRV at the time of immunization. By 3 weeks postimmunization, responses measured by MHC tetramer staining in the two Mamu-A* 01 (+) RRV-negative monkeys reached 9. 3 % and 13. 1 % of all CD 8 (+) T cells in peripheral blood to the Gag CM 9 epitope and 2. 3 % and 7. 3 % of all CD 8 (+) T cells in peripheral blood to the Tat SL 8 epitope. Virus-specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses persisted at high levels up to the time of challenge at 18 weeks postimmunization, and responding cells maintained an effector memory phenotype. Despite the ability of the RRVenv recombinant to express high levels of Env in cultured cells, and despite the appearance of strong anti-RRV antibody responses in immunized monkeys, <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses were below our ability to detect them. Immunized monkeys, together with three unimmunized controls, were challenged intravenously with 10 monkey infectious doses of SIVmac 239. All five immunized monkeys and all three controls became infected with SIV, but peak viral loads were 1. 2 to 3. 0 log(10) units lower and chronic-phase viral loads were 1. 0 to 3. 0 log(10) units lower in immunized animals than the geometric mean of unimmunized controls. These differences were statistically significant. <b>Anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses following challenge indicated an anamnestic response in the vaccinated monkeys. These findings further demonstrate the potential of recombinant herpesviruses as preventive vaccines for AIDS.

40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{expressing the}} envelope (Env) protein {{of the human}} immunodeficiency virus have been relatively ineffective at generating high-titer, long-lasting, neutralizing antibodies {{in a variety of}} animal models. In this study, the murine and human homologues of the complement component, C 3 d, were used in a DNA vaccine to enhance the titers of antibody to Env. Initially, plasmids expressing a secreted form of Env (sgp 120) fused to one, two, or three copies of the murine homologue of C 3 d (mC 3 d) were constructed. Mice were inoculated with four vaccinations of DNA or two DNA vaccinations, followed by two boosts of affinitypurified gp 120 protein. Analyses of titers demonstrated that multiple copies of mC 3 d coupled to sgp 120 induced long-lasting, high-titer <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody.</b> Priming mice with sgp 120 -mC 3 d-DNA, followed by inoculation of purified gp 120 protein, elicited the strongest antibody titers; however, the avidity maturation of the antibody was accelerated in the mice inoculated with sgp 120 -mC 3 d 3 -DNA. In addition, DNAs expressing sgp 120 fused to three copies of the human homologue of C 3 d (hC 3 d 3) efficiently enhanced the <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> in rabbits. Lastly, antisera from both mice and rabbits vaccinated with DNA expressing sgp 120 -C 3 d 3 elicited higher titers of neutralizing antibody than did nonfused forms of Env. These results indicate that C 3 d, conjugated to sgp 120, enhances the antibody responses to Env compared to non-C 3 d fused forms of Env, and this approach may be one way to overcome the poor ability of DNA vaccines to generate antibodies to Env.

40|$|An {{effective}} {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) vaccine must induce protective antibody responses, as well as CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses, that can be effective despite extraordinary diversity of HIV- 1. The consensus and mosaic immunogens are complete but artificial proteins, computationally designed to elicit immune responses with improved cross-reactive breadth, to attempt to overcome the challenge of global HIV diversity. In this study, we have compared the immunogenicity of a transmitted-founder (T/F) B clade Env (B. 1059), a global group M consensus Env (Con-S), and a global trivalent mosaic Env protein in rhesus macaques. These antigens were delivered using a DNA prime-recombinant NYVAC (rNYVAC) vector and Env protein boost vaccination strategy. While Con-S Env was a single sequence, mosaic immunogens were a set of three Envs optimized to include the most common forms of potential T cell epitopes. Both Con-S and mosaic sequences retained common amino acids encompassed by both antibody and T cell epitopes and were central to globally circulating strains. Mosaics and Con-S Envs expressed as full-length proteins bound well {{to a number of}} neutralizing antibodies with discontinuous epitopes. Also, both consensus and mosaic immunogens induced significantly higher gamma interferon (IFN-Î³) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot) responses than B. 1059 immunogen. Immunization with these proteins, particularly Con-S, also induced significantly higher neutralizing antibodies to viruses than B. 1059 Env, primarily to tier 1 viruses. Both Con-S and mosaics stimulated more potent CD 8 -T cell responses against heterologous Envs than did B. 1059. Both antibody and cellular data from this study strengthen the concept of using in silico-designed centralized immunogens for global HIV- 1 vaccine development strategies. IMPORTANCE: There is an increasing appreciation for the importance of vaccine-induced <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses for preventing HIV- 1 acquisition.

A molecularly cloned chimeric murine leukemia virus was used to induce acute lethal neurological disease in neonatal mice. A panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the Gag and Env proteins was tested for protective efficacy. In vitro neutralization assays demonstrated that <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> gave different degrees of neutralization, while no anti-Gag neutralized the virus. In vivo experimental endpoints were onset of clinical signs and premoribund condition. As expected, different <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> demonstrated different degrees of protection which correlated with their neutralizing abilities. Surprisingly, anti-Gag antibodies directed against both p 15 (MA protein) and p 30 (CA protein) were also protective, significantly delaying the onset of disease. No protection was seen with either of two control antibodies. The protection with anti-Gag was dose related and time dependent and was also produced with Fab fragments. Treatment with anti-Gag did not prevent viremia but resulted in a slight slowing in viremia kinetics and decreased levels of virus in the central nervous systems of mice protected from disease.

Vaccination decreased viremia in both the acute and chronic phases of infection after challenge with pathogenic SIVmac 251. Two groups of macaques were vaccinated with DNA plasmids producing different antigen forms, ânativeâ and âmodified,â inducing distinct immune responses. Both groups showed significantly lower viremia during the acute phase of infection, whereas the group immunized with the native antigens showed better protection during the chronic phase (1. 7 log decrease in virus load, P = 0. 009). Both groups developed strong cellular and humoral responses against the DNA vaccine antigens, which included Gag, Pol, Env, Nef, and Tat. Vaccination induced both central memory and effector memory T cells that were maintained at the day of challenge, suggesting the potential for rapid mobilization upon virus challenge. The group receiving the native antigens developed higher and more durable <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies,</b> including neutralizing antibodies at the day of challenge.

We conclude that the antibody responses to Env and Gag antigens are differentially regulated and that changes in the plasma viral load in the measurable range (500 to 10 (8) RNA copies per ml) do not directly affect the antibody responses to these HIV- 1 proteins. We provide quantitative estimates of HIV- 1 -specific immunoglobulin G concentrations in plasma, which can be in excess of 1 mg/ml for both anti-gp 120 and anti-p 24 once the immune response to HIV- 1 has stabilized after seroconversion.

Two DNA vaccine constructs (IC 1 â 90 and IC 48) that differed by point mutations in gag and pol were compared. IC 1 â 90 produces primarily immature (core comprises unprocessed Pr 55 Gag) HIV-like particles (VLPs) and IC 48 produces mature VLP with processed Pr 55 Gag, immature VLP, and intracellular protein aggregates.

We sought to define the contact points between Env and these catalysts to illustrate their potential as therapeutic targets. In lysates of Env-expressing cells, 15 % of the gp 160 precursor, but not gp 120, coprecipitated with CNX, whereas only 0. 25 % of gp 160 and gp 120 coprecipitated with PDI. Under in vitro conditions, which mimic the Env/PDI interaction during virus/cell contact, PDI readily associated with Env.

In addition, a mixture of the latter antibodies interfered with PDI-mediated Env reduction.

Results To explore differential regulation of Gag and Env antibody responses, immunocompetent BALB/c and T cell deficient nude mice were immunized with virus like particles (VLP) of simian {{immunodeficiency virus}} or adenoviral vectors expressing SIV Gag and Env. High levels of antibodies against Gag and Env could only be induced in immunocompetent mice, but not in the immunodeficient mice. Thus, neither cells expressing Env after adenoviral gene transfer nor VLPs induce a T cell independent primary <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> response. However, secondary B cell responses to Env, but not to Gag, were observed in immunodeficient mice after transfer of primed B cells and boosting with VLPs or adenoviral vectors expressing Gag and Env. This T cell independent secondary antibody response to Env was reduced after stimulation with VLPs modified to contain monomeric membrane bound gp 130 surface subunit of Env and undetectable after injection of soluble gp 130. Conclusions Membrane-bound trimeric Env seems to be responsible for the maintenance of high levels of anti-Env antibodies during progression to AIDS. This T cell independent secondary antibody response may prevent T cell-dependent affinity maturation and thus contribute to viral immune escape by favoring persistence of non-protective antibodies. </p...|$|E

However, in most cases examined, antibodies to the variable regions and to the CD 4 -binding site of Env modestly contributed in defining the overall breadth of these responses. Plasmas with broad cross-neutralizing antibody responses were identified that targeted the gp 120 subunit, but their precise epitopes mapped outside the variable regions and the CD 4 -binding site. Finally, although several plasmas were identified with cross-neutralizing antibody responses that were not directed against gp 120, only one plasma with a moderate breadth of heterologous neutralizing antibody responses contained cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against the 4 E 10 epitope, which is within the gp 41 transmembrane subunit. Overall, our study indicates that more than one pathway leads to the development of broad cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies during HIV infection and that the virus continuously escapes their action...|$|R
40|$|The cell {{catalysts}} calnexin (CNX) and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) {{cooperate in}} establishing the disulfide bonding of the HIV envelope (Env) glycoprotein. Following HIV binding to lymphocytes, cell-surface PDI also reduces Env to induce the fusogenic conformation. We sought to define the contact points between Env and these catalysts to illustrate their potential as therapeutic targets. In lysates of Env-expressing cells, 15 % of the gp 160 precursor, but not gp 120, coprecipitated with CNX, whereas only 0. 25 % of gp 160 and gp 120 coprecipitated with PDI. Under in vitro conditions, which mimic the Env/PDI interaction during virus/cell contact, PDI readily associated with Env. The domains of Env interacting in cellulo with CNX or in vitro with PDI were then determined using <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> whose binding site was occluded by CNX or PDI. Antibodies against domains V 1 /V 2, C 2, and the C terminus of V 3 did not bind CNX-associated Env, whereas those against C 1, V 1 /V 2, and the CD 4 -binding domain did not react with PDI-associated Env. In addition, a mixture of the latter antibodies interfered with PDI-mediated Env reduction. Thus, Env interacts with intracellular CNX and extracellular PDI via discrete, largely nonoverlapping, regions. The sites of interaction explain the mode of action of compounds that target these two catalysts and may enable the design of further new competitive agents...|$|R
40|$|An HIV- 1 vaccine remains elusive, in {{part because}} various factors limit the {{quantity}} and quality of the antibodies raised against the viral envelope glycoprotein complex (Env). We hypothesized that targeting Env vaccines directly to B cells, by fusing them to molecules that bind and activate these cells, would improve Env-specific antibody responses. Therefore, we fused trimeric Env gp 140 to A PRoliferation-Inducing Ligand (APRIL), B-cell Activating Factor (BAFF), and CD 40 Ligand (CD 40 L). The Env-APRIL, Env-BAFF, and Env-CD 40 L gp 140 trimers all enhanced the expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme responsible for inducing somatic hypermutation, antibody affinity maturation, and antibody class switching. They also triggered IgM, IgG, and IgA secretion from human B cells in vitro. The Env-APRIL trimers induced higher <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses in rabbits, including neutralizing antibodies against tier 1 viruses. The enhanced Env-specific responses were not associated with a general increase in total plasma antibody concentrations, indicating that the effect of APRIL was specific for Env. All the rabbit sera raised against gp 140 trimers, irrespective of the presence of CD 40 L, BAFF, or APRIL, recognized trimeric Env efficiently, whereas sera raised against gp 120 monomers did not. The levels of trimer-binding and virus-neutralizing antibodies were strongly correlated, suggesting that gp 140 trimers are superior to gp 120 monomers as immunogens. Targeting and activating B cells with a trimeric HIV- 1 Env-APRIL fusion protein may therefore improve the induction of humoral immunity against HIV-...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of cationic microparticles with adsorbed DNA at inducing immune responses {{was investigated in}} mice, guinea pigs, and rhesus macaques. Plasmid DNA vaccines encoding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Gag and Env adsorbed {{onto the surface of}} cationic poly(lactide-coglycolide) (PLG) microparticles were shown to be substantially more potent than corresponding naked DNA vaccines. In mice immunized with HIV gag DNA, adsorption onto PLG increased CD 8 + T-cell and antibody responses by â¼ 100 - and â¼ 1, 000 -fold, respectively. In guinea pigs immunized with HIV env DNA adsorbed onto PLG, antibody responses showed a more rapid onset and achieved markedly higher enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralizing titers than in animals immunized with naked DNA. Further enhancement of antibody responses was observed in animals vaccinated with PLG/DNA microparticles formulated with aluminum phosphate. The magnitude of <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses induced by PLG/DNA particles was equivalent to that induced by recombinant gp 120 protein formulated with a strong adjuvant, MF- 59. In guinea pigs immunized with a combination vaccine containing HIV env and HIV gag DNA plasmids on PLG microparticles, substantially superior antibody responses were induced against both components, as measured by onset, duration, and titer. Furthermore, PLG formulation overcame an apparent hyporesponsiveness of the env DNA component in the combination vaccine. Finally, preliminary data in rhesus macaques demonstrated a substantial enhancement of immune responses afforded by PLG/DNA. Therefore, formulation of DNA vaccines by adsorption onto PLG microparticles is a powerful means of increasing vaccine potency...|$|E

The results of both EIA methods and Western blot (immunoblot) were in agreement for 1, 046 HIV- 1 and 10 HIV- 2 specimens from a panel of known positives. From a prospective panel of 1, 085 specimens, 38 proved to be positive by both EIAs and Western blot, 3 were positive by the recombinant EIA only, and 9 were positive by the peptide EIA only, for calculated specificities of 99. 71 and 99. 04 %, respectively. Of 180 specimens from a seroconversion panel collected from 77 patients, the results for 170 were in agreement by all antibody testing methods and 10 were found to be repeat reactive for HIV antibodies by the recombinant EIA only. All 10 were initial specimens of seroconverting patients; 7 were also reactive for HIV p 24 antigen. An examination of four of these sera by radioimmunoprecipitation assay showed gp 120 and gp 160 bands in each. Analysis of the <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> class in three of these samples showed that one consisted of immunoglobulin M (IgM) only and two contained both IgG and IgM antibodies. Although both EIA procedures were sensitive and specific in the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 and both were capable of detecting early antibodies, the recombinant assay was more sensitive for antibody detection during early seroconversion...|$|E
40|$|A major {{challenge}} for {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) /AIDS vaccines is the elicitation of <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Ab) capable of neutralizing the diversity of isolates in the pandemic. Here, we show that high-avidity, but nonneutralizing, Abs can have an inverse correlation with peak postchallenge viremia for a heterologous challenge. Vaccine studies were conducted in rhesus macaques using DNA priming followed by modified vaccinia Ankara boosting with HIV type 1 (HIV- 1) immunogens that express virus-like particles displaying CCR 5 -tropic clade B (strain ADA) or clade C (IN 98012) Envs. Rhesus granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor {{was used as an}} adjuvant for enhancing the avidity of anti-Env Ab responses. Challenge was with simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) - 162 P 3, a CCR 5 -tropic clade B chimera of SIV and HIV- 1. Within the groups receiving the clade B vaccine, a strong inverse correlation was found between the avidity of anti-Env Abs and peak postchallenge viremia. This correlation required the use of native but not gp 120 or gp 140 forms of Env for avidity assays. The high-avidity Ab elicited by the ADA Env had excellent breadth for the Envs of incident clade B but not clade C isolates, whereas the high-avidity Ab elicited by the IN 98012 Env had excellent breadth for incident clade C but not clade B isolates. High-avidity Ab elicited by a SHIV vaccine with a dual-tropic clade B Env (89. 6) had limited breadth for incident isolates. Our results suggest that certain Envs can elicit nonneutralizing but high-avidity Ab with broad potential for blunting incident infections of the same clade...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{transmission}} of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) depends primarily on breast-feeding; substitution of bottle-feeding {{has reduced the}} transmission rate from 20 % in breast-fed children to 3 % among bottle-fed. To determine the correlates of transmission for long breast-feeding (> or = 6 mo), short breast-feeding (< 6 mo), and bottle-feeding mothers, the antibody titers of transmitter (T) mothers and non-transmitter (nT) mothers were analyzed by using synthetic and recombinant epitopes representing the immunodominant epitopes of gag (Gag 1 a, r 24), env (Env 1 / 5, MTA 1, RE 3), and tax (Tax 8 / 22 - 24) proteins. Seroreactivity to gag and tax epitopes was not significantly different except for anti-r 24 antibody titer, which was significantly higher among T-mothers (geometric mean 134) when compared with nT-mothers (62) in the long-feeding group (P < 0. 001). Profiles of antibody titers against env epitopes were different. Within the long-feeding group, Env 1 / 5, MTA 1, and RE 3 titers were significantly higher among T-mothers (258, 1, 476, and 738, respectively) when compared with nT-mothers (106, 279, and 320, respectively) (P < 0. 01 for all three epitopes). In contrast, within the bottle-feeding group, antibody titers to Env 1 / 5 (269) and RE 3 (418) among nT-mothers {{were significantly higher than}} those among T-mothers (80 and 113, respectively) (P < 0. 01). These data confirm that high-titered anti-HTLV-I antibodies in the long-feeding group correlate with milk-borne {{transmission of}} HTLV-I and, more importantly, imply that maternal <b>anti-env</b> <b>antibodies</b> may reduce the risk of non-milkborne infection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Tat {{is a key}} HIV- 1 {{virulence}} factor, {{which plays}} pivotal roles in virus gene expression, replication, transmission and disease progression. After release, extracellular Tat accumulates in tissues and exerts effects on both the virus and the immune system, promoting immune activation and virus spreading while disabling the host immune defense. In particular, Tat binds Env spikes on virus particles forming a virus entry complex, which favors infection of dendritic cells and efficient transmission to T cells via RGD-binding integrins. Tat also shields the CCR 5 -binding sites of Env rendering ineffective virus neutralization by <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Abs). This is reversed by the anti-Tat Abs present in natural infection or induced by vaccination. FINDINGS: Here we present {{the results of a}} cohort study, showing that the presence of anti-Tat Abs in asymptomatic and treatment-naive HIV-infected subjects is associated with containment of CD 4 + T-cell loss and viral load and with a delay of disease progression. In fact, no subjects with high anti-Tat Ab titers initiated antiretroviral therapy during the three years of follow-up. In contrast, no significant effects were seen for anti-Env and anti-Gag Abs. The increase of anti-Env Ab titers was associated with a reduced risk of starting therapy only in the presence of anti-Tat Abs, suggesting an effect of combined anti-Tat and anti-Env Abs on the Tat/Env virus entry complex and on virus neutralization. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Tat immunity may help delay HIV disease progression, thus, targeting Tat may offer a novel therapeutic intervention to postpone antiretroviral treatment or to increase its efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Immunization with {{recombinant}} serotype 5 adenoviral (rAd 5) vectors or {{a combination}} of DNA plasmid priming and rAd 5 boosting is known to elicit potent immune responses. However, little data exist regarding these immunization strategies and the development of anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) neutralizing antibodies. We used DNA plasmids and rAd 5 vectors encoding the HIV- 1 89. 6 P or chimeric HxB 2 /BaL envelope glycoprotein to immunize macaque monkeys. A single rAd 5 immunization elicited <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> responses, but there was little boosting with subsequent rAd 5 immunizations. In contrast, rAd 5 boosting of DNA-primed monkeys resulted in a rapid rise in antibody titers, including the development of anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibodies. The potency and breadth of neutralization were evaluated by testing plasma against a panel of 14 clade B primary isolates. Moderate levels of plasma neutralizing activity were detected against about one-third of the viruses tested, and immunoglobulin G fractionation demonstrated that virus neutralization was antibody mediated. After a challenge with a chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV 89. 6 P), an anamnestic neutralizing antibody response was observed, although the breadth of the response was limited to the subset of viruses that were neutralized after the primary immunization. These data are the first detailed description of the anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibody response in nonhuman primates elicited by DNA and rAd 5 immunization. In addition to the well-established ability of DNA priming and rAd 5 boosting to elicit potent anti-HIV- 1 cellular immune responses, this immunization strategy elicits anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing antibodies and therefore can be used to study novel Env immunogens designed to elicit more potent neutralizing antibodies...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVery recently, we {{demonstrated}} that {{the replacement of the}} human immunodeficiency virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) gp 41 transmembrane protein by an EpsteinâBarr virus gp 220 / 350 -derived membrane anchor resulted in the incorporation of chimeric envelope (Env) oligomers into Pr 55 gagvirus-like particles (VLPs), exceeding that of wild-type gp 160 by a factor of 10. In this study, we examined the immunostimulatory properties of Pr 55 gagVLPs to both (i) chimeric HIV- 1 gp 120 external envelope proteins and (ii) full-length gp 160 presented on the outer surface of the particles. Immunization studies carried out with VLPs presenting different derivatives of the chimeric and wild-type Env proteins elicited a consistent anti-Pr 55 gagas well as <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> response in complete absence of additional adjuvants. In both cases, the immune sera exhibited anin vitroneutralizing activity against homologous HIV- 1 infection in MT 4 cells. Noteworthy, these VLPs were also capable of inducing a strong CD 8 +cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) response in immunized BALB/c mice that was directed toward a known CTL epitope in the third variable domain V 3 of the gp 120 external glycoprotein. However, the induction of V 3 -loop-specific CTLs critically depended on the amounts of Env proteins that were presented by the Pr 55 gagVLPs. Moreover, the CD 8 +CTL response was not significantly altered by adsorbing the VLPs to alum or by repeated booster immunizations. These results illustrate that Pr 55 gagVLPs provide a safe and effective means of enhancing neutralizing humoral responses to particle-entrapped gp 120 proteins and are also capable of delivering these proteins to the MHC class I antigen processing and presentation pathway. Therefore, antigenically expanded Pr 55 gagVLPs represent an attractive approach in the design of vaccines for which specific stimulation of neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic effector functions to complex glycoproteins is desired...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{vaccines}} {{expressing the}} envelope (Env) of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) have been relatively ineffective at generating high-titer, long-lasting immune responses. Oligomeric or trimeric (gp 140) forms of Env that more closely mimic the native proteins on the virion are often more effective immunogens than monomeric (gp 120) envelopes. In this study, several forms of Env constructed from the HIV- 1 isolate YU- 2 (HIV- 1 YU- 2) were tested for their immunogenic potential: a trimeric form of uncleaved (â) Env stabilized with a synthetic trimer motif isolated from the fibritin (FT) protein of the T 4 bacteriophage, sgp 140 YU- 2 (â/FT), was compared to sgp 140 YU- 2 (â) without a synthetic trimerization domain, {{as well as to}} monomeric gp 120 YU- 2. DNA plasmids were constructed to express Env alone or fused to various copies of murine C 3 d (mC 3 d). BALB/c mice were vaccinated (day 1 and week 4) with DNA expressing a codon-optimized envelope gene insert, alone or fused to mC 3 d. Mice were subsequently boosted (week 8) with the DNA or recombinant Env protein. All mice had high <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibody</b> titers regardless of the use of mC 3 d. Sera from mice vaccinated with DNA expressing non-C 3 d-fused trimers elicited neutralizing antibodies against homologous HIV- 1 YU- 2 virus infection in vitro. In contrast, sera from mice inoculated with DNA expressing Env-C 3 d protein trimers elicited antibody that neutralized both homologous HIV- 1 YU- 2 and heterologous HIV- 1 ADA, albeit at low titers.

To investigate Env properties that favor in vivo persistence, we inoculated rhesus macaques with three closely related CCR 5 -tropic simian-human immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) that differ in ER to cold (ERcold) and ER to sCD 4 (ERsCD 4); these SHIVs were neutralized by antibodies equivalently and thus were similar in ERantibody. All three SHIVs achieved high levels of acute viremia in the monkeys without alteration of their Env sequences, indicating that neither ERcold nor ERsCD 4 significantly influences the establishment of infection. Between 14 and 100 days following infection, viruses with high ERcold and ERsCD 4 were counterselected. Remarkably, the virus variant with low ERcold and low ERsCD 4 did not elicit a neutralizing antibody response against the infecting virus, despite the generation of high levels of <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the in-fected monkeys. All viruses that achieved persistent viremia escaped from any autologous neutralizing antibodies and exhibited low ERcold and low ERsCD 4.

40|$|The {{presence}} or evolution of immune escape variants {{has been proposed}} {{to account for the}} failure of recombinant envelope vaccines to protect macaques against challenge with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVmac). To address this issue, two groups of three cynomolgus macaques were immunized with recombinant SIV Env vaccines using two different vaccine schedules. One group of macaques received four injections of recombinant SIV gp 120 in SAF- 1 containing threonyl muramyl dipeptide as adjuvant. A second group were primed twice with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SIV gp 160 and then boosted twice with recombinant SIV gp 120. Both vaccine schedules elicited neutralizing antibodies to Env. However, on the day of challenge, titres of <b>anti-Env</b> <b>antibodies</b> measured by ELISA were higher in macaques primed with recombinant vaccinia virus. Following intravenous challenge with 10 monkey infectious doses of the SIVmac J 5 M challenge stock, five of the six immunized macaques and all four naive controls became infected. The virus burdens in PBMC of macaques that were primed with recombinant vaccinia virus were lower than those of naive controls, as determined by virus titration and quantitative DNA PCR. Sequence analysis was performed on SIV env amplified from the blood of immunized and naive infected macaques. No variation of SIV env sequence was observed, even in macaques with a reduced virus load, suggesting that the appearance of immune escape variants does not account for the incomplete protection observed. In addition, this study indicates that the measurement of serum neutralizing antibodies may not provide a useful correlate for protection elicited by recombinant envelope vaccines...|$|R
