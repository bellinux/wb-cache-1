5000|$|An eschar ( [...] ; Greek: eschara) is a slough or {{piece of}} dead tissue that is cast {{off from the}} surface of the skin, {{particularly}} after a burn injury, but also seen in gangrene, ulcer, fungal infections, necrotizing spider bite wounds, spotted fevers and exposure to cutaneous anthrax. The term [...] "eschar" [...] is not interchangeable with [...] "scab". An eschar contains necrotic tissue, whereas a scab is composed of dried blood and exudate.Black eschars are most commonly attributed to anthrax, which may be contracted through herd <b>animal</b> <b>exposure,</b> but can also be obtained from Pasteurella multocida exposure in cats and rabbits. A newly identified human rickettsial infection, R. parkeri rickettsiosis, can be differentiated from Rocky Mountain spotted fever by the presence of an eschar at the site of inoculation. Eschar is sometimes called a black wound because the wound is covered with thick, dry, black necrotic tissue.|$|E

50|$|Recently, new gastric (H. suis and H. baculiformis) and {{enterohepatic}} (H. equorum) {{species have}} been reported. H. pylori is of primary importance for medicine, but non-H. pylori species, which naturally inhabit mammals (except humans) and birds, have been detected in human clinical specimens. These encompass two (gastric and enterohepatic) groups, showing different organ specificity. Importantly, some species, such as H. hepaticus, H. mustelae, and probably H. bilis, exhibit carcinogenic potential in animals. They harbour many virulence genes and may cause diseases not only in animals, but also in humans. Gastric species such as H. suis (most often), H. felis, H. bizzozeronii, and H. salomonis {{have been associated with}} chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers in humans and, importantly, with higher risk for MALT lymphoma compared to H. pylori. Enterohepatic species e.g., H. hepaticus, H. bilis, and H. ganmani, have been detected by PCR, but still are not isolated from specimens of patients with hepatobiliary diseases. Moreover, they may be associated with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The significance of avian helicobacters (H. pullorum, H. anseris, and H. brantae) also has been evaluated extensively. H. cinaedi and H. canis can cause severe infections, mostly in immunocompromised patients with <b>animal</b> <b>exposure.</b> Briefly, the role of these species in veterinary and human medicine is increasingly recognised. Several other topics such as isolation of still uncultured species, antibiotic resistance and treatment regimens for infections and pathogenesis and possible carcinogenesis in humans should be evaluated.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{exposure}} to animals {{and risk of}} type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) has had conflicting results with some researchers finding that <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> {{reduces the risk of}} T 1 D and others finding no association between <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and T 1 D. Previously conducted studies on the association between <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and T 1 D are case-control studies that have been limited by recall bias. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the association between early life <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and the risk of persistent, confirmed islet autoantibodies (IA) and T 1 D diagnosis among an eligible cohort of genetically high T 1 D risk participants enrolled in the international prospective cohort study, The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY). It is hypothesized that children who are exposed to animals in early life will have a lower risk of developing IA and T 1 D than children who are not exposed to animals in early life. A total of 7, 432 TEDDY participants were included in the study. The associations between early life <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and the outcomes of interest were explored using Cox proportional hazards models. In order to control for confounding, a propensity score analysis was applied by three different methods: adjustment for the propensity score variable in the Cox proportional hazards model, stratification on propensity score groups, and propensity score pair matching. Early life <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> was not associated with diabetes autoimmunity or T 1 D onset in this genetically high T 1 D risk population. These findings were consistent across all three propensity score analysis methods and when directly adjusting for HLA type. The hypothesis that children who are exposed to animals in early life will have a lower risk of developing IA and T 1 D than children who are not exposed to animals in early life is not supported by this study. The results of this study suggest that there is no association between early life <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and development of T 1 D. Performing this analysis again after longer follow-up has been completed for the study population is recommended as it may elucidate the effect of <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> on T 1 D and IA risk. Further studies are also needed on <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and T 1 D in different types of environments (e. g., high residential density) and the effect of different types of animal exposures (e. g., species, duration) on T 1 D and IA risk. Additionally, studies on differences in perceptions of pets across countries could also aid the interpretation of studies on <b>animal</b> <b>exposure</b> and health outcomes...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} evaluation of an ambient particle concentrator for conducting <b>animal</b> inhalation <b>exposure</b> studies. The system utilizes the principle of virtual impactors to concentrate ambient particles in the size range 0. 1 - 2. 5 microns (aerodynamic diameter; dp) by drawing them {{through a series of}} three virtual impactors. Each impactor contains the majority of ambient fine mass (dp < 2. 5 microns aerodynamic diameter) in a bleed flow (minor flow) that is 20 % of the total flow entering the virtual impactor. The virtual impactors have been characterized using indoor air samples as test aerosols. Fine mass and sulfate concentrations at the outlet of the concentrating system were compared to the ambient fine mass and sulfate levels, which were determined using Harvard-Marple impactors.
