5|$|Another {{element is}} a {{powerful}} attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles {{under a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization).

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} an experimental attempt to condition breathing pattern in rats. In this experiment, a freely moving rat <b>was</b> first <b>rewarded</b> by an electrical {{stimulation of the}} medial forebrain bundle whenever inspiratory duration (TI) exceeded 300 ms. A bidirectional control was then used: TIs longer than 400 ms <b>were</b> <b>rewarded,</b> and then TIs shorter than 300 ms <b>were</b> <b>rewarded.</b> The frequency of TIs longer than 300 ms increased when this event <b>was</b> <b>rewarded,</b> further increased when TIs above 400 ms <b>were</b> <b>rewarded,</b> and decreased during reversal conditioning (TI < 300 ms). At {{the beginning of the}} experiment, stimulation caused increased arousal and motor activity, but after prolonged conditioning, the brain stimulation was associated with quiet wakefulness. Although the general procedure appears to be well-suited to the experimental study of voluntary breathing, some possible improvements are suggested for further, more extensive investigations...|$|R

5|$|Before {{entering}} a stage, the player {{begins in the}} Attraction Information Center, which acts as a hub world. Here, the player can choose a partner and a level to enter, and see which attractions they have already completed. Bonus levels are hidden throughout the zones and can also be triggered by finishing a zone with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free falling and can pick up power-ups as they proceed. Special stages can be entered if finishing a zone with 50 or more rings. In these, the player must collect blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer; players <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> with a Chaos Ring upon completion. Collecting all Chaos Rings rewards the player with the best possible ending, in which Sonic and Tails make cameo appearances.|$|E
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in {{the series}} has become notable for its high difficulty, along with several mechanics that have endured through the years. A key element present since the first Megami Tensei {{is the ability to}} recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle, alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together to create a more powerful demon. Equivalents to these systems appear in the later Persona titles. The game's most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system, first introduced in Nocturne. The Press Turn System is a turn-based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies, where either party <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> an extra turn for striking an enemy's weakness. A Moon Phase System or equivalent, in which phases of the moon or changes in the weather affected the behavior of enemies, is also featured in multiple games.|$|E

5|$|Units are {{classified}} {{into one of}} several classes: infantry, ranged, pikemen, cavalry, or siege. Each unit class has unique strengths and weaknesses, emphasizing the importance of properly matching up units in battle to increase their effectiveness. Hero units are unique in that only one of each can be created; they consist of characters from the novel, such as Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Saruman, Nazgûl, Mouth of Sauron, Arwen and Shelob, or are created via the game's Hero Creator (only accessible via the PC version). If the player kills Gollum, a non-player character, they <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> with the One Ring. The item {{can be used to}} summon one of two ring heroes for a price of 10,000 resources, Galadriel and Sauron, depending on the player's faction. Ring heroes have extremely strong armor and powerful attacks, making them among the game's most over-powered units.|$|E
5|$|During the game, {{players are}} {{frequently}} {{accompanied by the}} voice of Dan Danger, a human who is trapped in the destroyed spaceship. Dan assigns missions to players, occasionally commenting on their performance. The game is set on a space station—the titular Silicon Valley, which consists of four environments: Euro Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari, and Desert Adventure. The environments are unlocked as players progress through the game. Each environment consists of numerous sub-levels, ranging from six to ten, each of which task players with certain objectives; examples include activating switches, disabling electric fences, and gathering a set amount of objects. As players progress through the levels, they collect the scattered remains of Evo's protective shell suit, eventually re-assembling them for the final level. Each level also contains a hidden objective, such as collecting a souvenir or making an animal perform a certain act; as players complete the hidden objectives, they <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> with a gold trophy, and collecting all trophies unlocks a bonus level.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls aim to {{make their way to the}} Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E

5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{version of}} Wild Guns {{was set to}} be {{released}} {{in the third quarter of}} 1994 and was reviewed at the time, but the release was unexpectedly delayed until the third quarter of 1995. Reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly cited the cooperative multiplayer mode and challenging levels as the game's strongest points. They declared it one of the best shooters on the SNES and compared it to the Neo Geo game NAM-1975. GamePro praised the game for its intense action, fun cooperative multiplayer mode, colorful graphics, and ability to shoot almost any on-screen object. They remarked that the game is difficult even on easy, but that players <b>are</b> <b>rewarded</b> for perseverance. Nintendo Power found the game to have good graphics and control, and complimented the presence of both male and female playable characters. However, they believed the game was not as challenging as other shooters. A 32X version was reportedly planned for 1996, but never materialized.|$|E
