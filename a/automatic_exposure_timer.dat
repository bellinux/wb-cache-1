40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> {{control is}} the process of {{controlling}} the exposure time of the digital imaging system to obtain the desired image which can fit the human vision during the imaging process. A new <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> algorithm for astronomical image is proposed. The pixel value weight is determined by exploring the maximum range of the image histogram. Additionally, the structure of the implementation based on FPGA and experiment results for real data are given.

50|$|The first {{camera to}} feature <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> was the {{selenium}} light meter-equipped, fully automatic Super Kodak Six-20 pack of 1938, but its extremely high price (for the time) of $225 ($ in present terms) kept it from achieving {{any degree of}} success. By the 1960s, however, low-cost electronic components were commonplace and cameras equipped with light meters and <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> systems became increasingly widespread.|$|R
50|$|The ELPH 10 {{featured}} a 25mm f/6.7 lens, built-in electronic flash, and simple programmed <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> with two shutter speeds.|$|R

50|$|Many modern {{bridge and}} compact cameras with movie mode have only an <b>automatic</b> <b>{{exposure}}</b> and limited exposure compensation control, and live view that is primarily for framing only.|$|R
5000|$|MD - In 1977, the XD series {{introduced}} an additional tab on the lens which reported the smallest available aperture (f/16, f/22, or f/32) {{to the camera}} to accomplish shutter priority <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> in S mode on the Minolta XD-7 (XD-11 in the U.S.A.), {{and later in the}} P (programmed <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure)</b> mode on the X-700. The proper use of this feature meant that the lenses had to be set to their smallest aperture. In 1981, MD lenses included a minimum aperture lock that prevented the aperture ring from accidentally being moved.|$|R
50|$|The Canonet G-III QL17 is a coupled-rangefinder, leaf-shuttered, fixed-focal-length 35 mm camera first {{manufactured}} by Canon in 1972. It features fully shutter-priority <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> and fully manual shooting modes.|$|R

5000|$|Auto — Designation for F-type lenses {{indicating}} {{an automatic}} diaphragm (aperture). Not {{to be confused}} with <b>automatic</b> <b>exposure</b> or auto focus, the designation fell out of use in the early 1970s and was not carried onto K-type lenses.|$|R
