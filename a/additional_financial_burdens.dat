The distress of this relocation for treatment is particularly intensified for patients with leukaemia and associated haematological disorders and their carers, as they must often relocate {{for long periods of}} time and face invasive and demanding treatments away from the comfort of their own homes. Because such treatments are now highly technical and specialised, even patients from more urbanised areas are also required to relocate for prolonged specialist treatment not available locally.

Currently, wastewater management services are struggling with diverse problems including technical efficiency, economic profitability, and financial sustainability of wastewater treatment facilities. Policy makers envisage the establishment of low-cost, innovative, efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment and reuse schemes in urban and rural communities. This study raises relevant questions pertinent to what type of wastewater technologies are preferable. What sustainable criteria are necessary for the judgment on efficacy, reliability and availability of the technology installed? In the present study, we present the experience gained in two case studies, Alteereh membrane bioreactor (MBR) and Nablus West wastewater treatment plant. The available monthly reports are evaluated regarding the technical efficacy; economic profitability and financial sustainability of both case studies. Albeit the sanitation relevance for both cases, {{the results show that}} both treatment facilities lack optimal utilization of the available reclaimed water and stabilized biosolids. The current management practice at Nablus West WWTP warrants deep analysis compared with a private management contract of Alteereh MBR. The taxation exempt, a unilateral decision by the Israeli water authority exerts <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens</b> on Nablus municipality. The uncontrolled discharge of industrial wastewater in Wadi Zaimer, mixing with treated effluent from Nablus West WWTP, makes the financial and economic profitability questionable.

The limitations of some monitoring tools developed in this study need further investigations.

40|$|Most {{decisions}} {{in public health}} are based on imperfect information, and this is certainly the case for dental health. Relatively {{little is known about}} the cost-effectiveness of the various options available to improve dental status. It is, however, well recognised that regular exposure to fluoride reduces the incidence of caries considerably, and it is no coincidence that oral status throughout the world has improved considerably since the widespread introduction of fluoridated toothpaste in the 1970 s. Dental status is usually measured by dmft and DMFT scores, which indicate the number of decayed, missing and filled teeth in the primary and secondary dentitions at various ages. The World Health Organisation set a target in 1980 of an average DMFT score of 3 or less for 12 year olds by the year 2000. The target has already been achieved by the population as a whole. However, despite the recent improvements in the oral status of Britain’s children, between 10 % and 20 % suffer from poor dental health and are regarded as an at-risk group. These children tend to be concentrated geographically in certain parts of Britain, and poor oral status is often associated with poverty and socio-economic deprivation. This paper explores a number of strategies available for preventing caries. Although caries is seldom life-threatening, it causes unnecessary distress to a minority of the population, many of whom live in deprived inner city areas. Oral health currently represents an appreciable drain on NHS resources, accounting for 4 % of total NHS expenditure per year. In order to affect an improvement in overall dental health, represented by average figures for the whole population, policies need to be targeted towards those most at risk of poor oral status. Two of the possible approaches – promoting improved self-administered oral hygiene and encouraging people to make better use of the general dental service – require people to change their behaviour. Health promotion campaigns requiring behavioural change suggest that it can be very expensive to get the message to those most at risk, and even then there is no guarantee that they will change their behaviour in the desired manner. Furthermore, both approaches suggested above have some financial consequences for the individuals, and those children most at risk of caries often come from families who can ill-afford <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens.</b> Thus neither strategy is particularly cost-effective, and lack of compliance is a major concern. Reducing sugar consumption through dietary change is often promoted as a strategy to improve dental health, but the supporting evidence is very weak. Links between diet and oral status are complex, and many countries have reduced their dmft and DMFT scores in recent years against a background of stable or even rising sugar consumption. Much of this improvement in oral status is considered to be due to increased exposure to fluoride during this period. Dietary change can be very difficult to effect, especially given the pleasure associated with the consumption of sugar-containing foods. There is also a risk that the proportion of fat in the diet will increase if sugar consumption is reduced, especially amongst adolescents, and this may have an adverse impact on the prevalence of coronary heart disease in the near future. Water fluoridation has reduced caries levels by about 50 % in those parts of the world where it has been introduced, and children living in those areas of Britain with fluoridated water consistently enjoy significantly better dental health than children living in similar areas with non-fluoridated water. Water fluoridation is extremely cost-effective, requires no user compliance, and also benefits adults by reducing root caries. However, proposals to introduce it in a number of areas in Britain have encountered strong opposition on the grounds of unproven health risks and dislike of mass medication. It may be possible to a certain extent to target water fluoridation towards the at-risk groups by only fluoridating selected treatment works, such as those serving inner city areas. The community dental service also has an important role to play in improving the oral status of the at-risk groups, since it provides dental services in schools and other local facilities. Prophylactic figure sealants are a proven way of reducing pit and fissure decay. Fluoride has the least effect upon these surfaces. And sealants are a cost-effective way of protecting these surfaces for at-risk children. The majority of children enjoy good oral health status which will be maintained by self-administered oral hygiene and regular contact with the general dental service. However, those with poor oral status often come from families who are unlikely, or even unable, to respond to campaigns to brush their teeth and visit their dentist regularly. Reducing population sugar intake through dietary change, assuming such change can occur, is unlikely to influence dental status, and may adversely affect fat consumption. Increased exposure to fluoride via selectively fluoridated water, combined with fissure sealants and regular contact with the community dental service, are the most cost-effective ways of improving the nation’s oral status. dental health, diet, sugar...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{structures}} of collective bargaining in South Africa have evolved since industrialisation, through the Wiehahn-Commission era until the Farlam one and beyond, {{resulting in a}} number of legislative changes from 1924 to 2014. While dealing with collective bargaining, {{it is not possible to}} divorce the powerful history of mining from the South African story, from the diamond fields in Kimberley to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, where the mine employees’ focused on cheap, unskilled labour and migrant system in the 1900 s to the tragic events at Marikana in 2012. In the advent of the industry revolution, employment relationships changed as competitive demands placed a great need for advancing economic developments which are often expressed through collective-bargaining. The objective of collective bargaining is to arrive at an agreement between the employer and employees to determine mutually beneficial terms and conditions of employment such agreement may prohibit unions to embark on an industrial action for as long as it is in place. Strikes became important during the Industrial Revolution, when many worked in factories and mines. Often when employees’ demands are not met, they resort to strike action. Strike action is when a number of employees stop rendering their service in protest to express their grievances. These strikes are usually led by labour unions to get better pay, working hours or working conditions during collective bargaining as a last resort. While trade union leadership fails to advance employees’ cause, employees resort to informal alternative structures to negotiate on their behalf. South Africans have a tradition of taking to the streets in protest when unhappy about issues and this tradition did not spring up during the apartheid era but has been around from as early as 1922 to date. Protests in South Africa today draw from past repertoires and at the same time push for new political practices and directions. Strikes are often used to: Pressure governments to change its policies like in the Rand Revolt; Strikes can destabilise the rule of a particular political party like a series of strikes by blacks in the 1970 s and 1980 s including the 1973 Durban dockworkers and the 1987 miners’ strikes; Strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance like Treatment Action Campaign and community struggles such Abahlali Base Mjondolo. On the strike issues in South Africa, the researcher draws from the terrible incident that transpired in August 2012 at Lonmin Mine-Marikana and how it has affected the collective bargaining landscape in South Africa. The first real and significant labour unrest, the Witwatersrand miner strike rocked South Africa to the core in 1922 and in 2012, ninety years later the violent strike by the Rock Operational Drillers at Lonmin following the Marikana massacre and as such did not enjoy statutory protection under the LRA because was classified as wildcat strike. Normally, a wildcat strike constitutes a violation of a collective bargaining agreement in place and as such is not protected unless a union joins it and ratifies the protest. The union may, however, discipline its members for participating in a wildcat strike and impose fines. Among other things miners mainly demanded a wage increment of R 12500 per month. The fight between AMCU and NUM for organisational rights also found its way into the equation. A strike wave, not only linked to the mining sector, made 2012 the most protest filled year since the end of apartheid, rolled out across South Africa, closing some industrial operations and crippling others. Commentators argue that the strike wave emerged from a landscape of extreme inequality and poverty, made intolerable by the <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens</b> arising from the migrant labour system. These factors influenced the industrial action and institutions of collective bargaining comprising of both company and union structures and processes, were found wanting in their ability to address the root causes of the crisis. The post-Marikana strike wave made a mark in the workers struggle movement as it drew in thousands of workers to join AMCU and at the same time weakening NUM, the then majority union. The strike led to the rise and growth of AMCU which was seen by miners as the driver for change. The 2012 strike wave and the Marikana massacre not only changed the balance of forces on the ground against the NUM, but also generated divisions within COSATU. The divisions were between those who decided to remain deaf to the workers’ call for transformation and those who had already realised that a decisive turn in economic policy was needed to avoid a social, economic and political crisis. In the aftermath of the strike, a number community struggles increased as 2012 began and on the other side, a number of splinter groups from COSATU mushroomed which was hobbled by in fights. NUM’s collapse is indeed part of a series of recent failures for COSATU...|$|E

PERSPECTIVES: The Challenge aims at implementing several actions to tackle healthcare-associated infections worldwide, regardless of the level of development of healthcare systems and the availability of resources. Implementation strategies include the integration in different healthcare settings of multiple interventions in the areas of blood safety, injection safety, and clinical procedure safety, as well as water, sanitation, and waste management, with the promotion of hand hygiene in healthcare as the cornerstone...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{droughts}} on health outcomes and health expenditures in rural Vietnam. Given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in Vietnam and many developing countries, it is crucial for policy makers {{to be aware of}} the economic impact of such shocks at the micro level. Using local rainfall data, the analysis directly links the incidence of drought to health shocks and health-related expenditures from a multiple-wave panel of rural Vietnamese households. Overall, the results suggest that individuals affected by drought display a deterioration of health conditions and have significantly higher health expenditures. The effect is found to prevail among households with a high degree of agricultural dependency and limited access to coping mechanisms such as selling assets or tapping off-farm income sources. The preferred estimates using an IV strategy reveal that drought-related health shocks can cause non-negligible <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> for many households vulnerable to poverty in rural Vietnam. This paper quantifies the immediate impact of drought on health conditions and contributes to the existing literature which has mostly focused on the long-term consequences...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundEach {{year the}} {{treatment}} and care of {{hundreds of millions of}} patients worldwide is complicated by infections acquired during healthcare. The impact of healthcare-associated infection may imply prolonged stays in hospital, long-term disability, massive <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden,</b> and deaths. ActionPatient safety is a global issue that affects both developed and developing countries. In October 2004, the World Health Organization launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety to co-ordinate and accelerate improvements in patient safety internationally. A core element of the Alliance is the identification of a topic to be addressed as a Global Patient Safety Challenge over a two-year cycle. The first topic chosen for 2005 – 2006 is healthcare-associated infection.

30|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} {{this study has shown}} that the IELTS exam created a negative economic washback on the participants, as they were financially affected by the test. The questionnaire as well as the interview results has shown that the test is expensive. Also, the cost of the test keeps rising from time to time. Those who had to repeat the test because they failed to achieve the minimum requirements, either in the overall score or the sub-scores (especially in the writing module), were the ones who were most affected financially by the price of the test. In fact, all students in the focus group repeated the test at least four times. This created a <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> on their families, as most of them were dependent on their parents to pay for the cost of the test, and, thus, they were pushed to study harder each time. Likewise, travel expenses have influenced the participants negatively, as some of them had to travel into another region or country because the academic module was not offered in their test center every week. By the same token, preparation courses proved to be an <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> on these participants, especially because they were not sure when they would be ready for the test and whether the training that they had received would be enough in helping them to achieve the required test score.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the Civil War, the United States faced a {{financial}} depression {{subsequent to the}} Panic of 1857, an event facilitated by over-expansion of the domestic economy and a European financial meltdown. In the three years preceding the Civil War, the Federal Government incurred a budget deficit exceeding $40 million. Coupled {{with the threat of}} secession, the Federal deficit placed the US government under considerable financial strain. In 1860, the US Treasury paid between 8 and 12 percent interest on government bonds in order to raise additional funds and meet public expenditures. In December 1861, the US Treasury attempted to sell five millions of interest-bearing notes at 12 percent but found itself able to dispose of only four millions. The Treasury's struggles illustrate the precarious nature of the US government's financial state. As the nation edged closer to war, the need to mobilize a volunteer force placed an <b>additional</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> upon the Federal government. While treasury notes with enticing interest rates allowed the US government to raise revenue quickly, they also established a need for additional revenue streams with which to pay off interest.|$|R
