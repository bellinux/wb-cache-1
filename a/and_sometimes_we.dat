500|$|The {{producers}} {{learned from}} an ex-MI5 officer {{that it is}} common for intelligence gatherers who spend most of their work listening in to other people {{to fall in love with}} civilians through just their voices. This story was the basis of Ruth wanting to go out with John in [...] "Love and Death". Khoury based [...] "Outsiders" [...] on Internet security. He already became intoned with the area, as he once worked with an internet company. Although the story is dramatised, Khoury did research on what was feasible, such as if one man and a laptop could theoretically bring Britain to its knees. Also in the episode, the G algorithm is based on an actual computer programme. [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] deals with interrogation and torture. Walters realised that torture is counterproductive as the suspects can say anything the interrogators want to hear, but rationalises that Adam is an expert in that field. To get the interrogation as true as possible, the producers consulted with ex-Army advisors who were trained in questioning terror suspects. As the episode was first broadcast, a prison abuse scandal in Iraq was put on the news. In response to this, Kudos director Stephen Garrett stated [...] "Spooks is really well researched <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> look like we're ahead of the game. It's just we know stuff that's happening, and it'll come out in the news a bit later on." [...] In the same episode, the weapons caches came from a true story that the Russians hid weapons in Britain during the Cold War, according to Collins.|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, [...] "Just One Kiss" [...] can be {{interpreted}} as a song devoted to a female love interest, [...] "but I'm really talking about music and what it did for me. That one guitar line, that certain drum beat, how it turned my life into a ball of gold." [...] The song incorporates cinematic strings, xylophone, and a rolling crescendo. The ballad [...] "Calling", featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza, draws on Motown's late 1950s R roots and doo-wop music, and incorporates Latin style guitar, and Spanish language lyrics. [...] "Staying in Love", an uptempo rhythm and blues song, was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex-girlfriend. Incongruous with its 1960s-inspired sound, [...] "Let's Take a Walk" [...] has sexually forward lyrics and , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest. The midtempo [...] "Never Give You Up" [...] is fashioned in Motown's early 1970 sound and, unlike other songs on the album, also incorporates elements from more modern soul music. [...] "Sometimes", which was inspired by Saadiq's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland, is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism. The line [...] "now I know what they meant by 'keep your head to the sky'" [...] makes reference to Earth, Wind & Fire, whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up. Saadiq said of the song's message, [...] "That's just giving dap to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> have to back up and cry but I'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. <b>And</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

Sharpton called the comments [...] "abominable", [...] "racist", and [...] "sexist", and repeated his earlier demand that Imus be fired. Imus said, [...] "Our agenda is to be funny <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> go too far. And this time we went way too far.

2500|$|Boxing {{has been}} a part of Mayweather's life since his {{childhood}} and he never seriously considered any other profession. [...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they have no idea of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Executive {{producer}} Rick Berman {{said that}} when creating , he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry, and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of Boy Scouts. Berman suggested that [...] "In the Pale Moonlight" [...] was the exception. Taylor said that the episode [...] "pushes the boundaries in a realistic way". In an interview in 2011, when talking about [...] "In the Pale Moonlight", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said [...] "we're not really {{willing to take the}} consequences of our actions, <b>and</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>we</b> have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that. We dealt with issues like that and I don't think... you know... the other shows really went as far as we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production on K.I.S.S. was {{primarily}} handled by local Cleveland native producer Young Yonny with additional contributions from Japanese musicians Jeff Miyahara and Daisuke Imai, Chuck Harmony and longtime collaborators Carvin & Ivan. As always {{and just as}} she did before with her last 3 independently—released projects, Mýa took full creative control of the album. Harrison lent {{a hand in the}} songwriting process; co-writing several of the album's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included Miami rapper Trina, international recording artist Iyaz, reggae star Sean Paul and ex Immature frontman Marques Houston. The album is a representation of Mýa's life today.
