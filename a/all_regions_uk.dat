This paper presents a complete set of labour market flexibility indicators for the <b>UK</b> and its <b>regions</b> over the period 1979 - 1998, based on surveydata sources and relating directly to theoretical considerations existing in the literature. After discussing issues related to the measurement of flexibility and the construction of the indexes, we examine the evolution of labour market flexibility and its various forms, across the <b>UK</b> <b>regions</b> and over the twenty-year period of our study. This examination reveals a number of interesting findings: labour market flexibility increased throughout the period across <b>all</b> <b>UK</b> <b>regions,</b> but specific elements of flexibility have followed divergent and non- linear trends; evidence of convergence in the regional levels of flexibility co-exists with a rather persistent pattern of a North-South dichotomy and regional specialisation in different forms of flexibility; if anything, deregulation {{does not seem to have}} facilitated regional harmonisation in levels and forms of labour market flexibility...|$|R

40|$|As {{interest}} grows {{across the}} world in the potential of NTFPs, and the importance of understanding the diversity of production from forests, a similar concern is now being shown for areas of oak coppice woodland in Britain. Of about 2 million hectares total woodland area, the 1979 – 83 UK census of woodland trees (Locke, 1987), classified 12, 000 ha of woodlands as being coppice with standards, and 26, 000 ha as mixed coppice. Clearly coppice is a significant component of the UK’s woodland resource. However, these figures do not refer to actively worked coppice, which is extremely limited in extent (Rackham, 1967). For example, most oak woods of South West England and Wales classed as scrub or high forest in the UK Census are of coppice origin, but the extent of worked oak coppice in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> of the <b>UK</b> is said to be less than 300 ha (Evans, 1984). Many coppice woodlands have not been managed for 50 - 100 years (BTCV, 1988).

40|$|Objectives: To explore {{utilisation}} {{patterns of}} asthma medication before, {{during and after}} pregnancy as recorded in seven European population-based databases. Design: A descriptive drug utilisation study. Setting : 7 electronic healthcare databases in Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Italy (Emilia Romagna and Tuscany), Wales, and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink representing {{the rest of the}} UK. Participants: All women with a pregnancy ending in a delivery that started and ended between 2004 and 2010, who had been present in the database for the year before, throughout and the year following pregnancy. Main outcome measures: The percentage of deliveries where the woman received an asthma medicine prescription, based on prescriptions issued (UK) or dispensed (non-UK), during the year before, throughout or during the year following pregnancy. Asthma medicine prescribing patterns were described for 3 -month time periods and the choice of asthma medicine and changes in prescribing over the study period were evaluated in each database. Results: In total, 1   165   435 deliveries were identified. The prevalence of asthma medication prescribing during pregnancy was highest in the UK and Wales databases (9. 4 % (CI 95 9. 3 % to 9. 6 %) and 9. 4 % (CI 95 9. 1 % to 9. 6 %), respectively) and lowest in the Norwegian database (3. 7 % (CI 95 3. 7 % to 3. 8 %)). In the year before pregnancy, the prevalence of asthma medication prescribing remained constant in <b>all</b> <b>regions.</b> Prescribing levels peaked during the second trimester of pregnancy and were at their lowest during the 3 -month period following delivery. A decline was observed, in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> except the <b>UK,</b> in the prescribing of long-acting β- 2 -agonists during pregnancy. During the 7 -year study period, there were only small changes in prescribing patterns.

40|$|Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke) is a {{physically}} and economically devastating parasitic trematode whose rise {{in recent years}} has been attributed to climate change. Climate has an impact on the free-living stages of the parasite and its intermediate host Lymnaea truncatula, with the interactions between rainfall and temperature having the greatest influence on transmission efficacy. There have been a number of short term climate driven forecasts developed to predict the following season’s infection risk, with the Ollerenshaw index being the most widely used. Through the synthesis of a modified Ollerenshaw index with the UKCP 09 fine scale climate projection data we have developed long term seasonal risk forecasts up to 2070 at a 25 km square resolution. Additionally UKCIP gridded datasets at 5 km square resolution from 1970 - 2006 were used to highlight the climate-driven increase to date. The maps show unprecedented levels of future fasciolosis risk in parts of the UK, with risk of serious epidemics in Wales by 2050. The seasonal risk maps demonstrate the possible change in the timing of disease outbreaks due to increased risk from overwintering larvae. Despite an overall long term increase in <b>all</b> <b>regions</b> of the <b>UK,</b> spatio-temporal variation in risk levels is expected. Infection risk will reduce in some areas and fluctuate greatly in others with a predicted decrease in summer infection for parts of the UK due to restricted water availability. This forecast is the first approximation of the potential impacts of climate change on fasciolosis risk in the UK. It can be used as a basis for indicating where active disease surveillance should be targeted and where the development of improved mitigation o...|$|R
