5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. <b>Although</b> <b>still</b> relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development and destructive fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite.

In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Casualties {{during the}} {{fighting}} around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended {{to report a}} ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, <b>although</b> <b>still</b> favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese {{are thought to have}} lost 140 killed and 231 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Deforestation {{has also}} caused {{population}} declines for the vulnerable Yunnan and yellow-billed nuthatches. The Yunnan nuthatch can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but <b>although</b> <b>still</b> locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E

Edward responded by seizing Roger's lands and only releasing them on the condition that Roger granted them to the Crown after his death. Roger agreed and Framlingham Castle passed to the Crown on his death in 1306.|$|E
