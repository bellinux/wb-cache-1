40|$|Family {{roles and}} {{well-being}} — 2 As we embark upon {{the early years}} of a new millennium, considerable consternation and debate about what is happening to the family as a social institution in the United States and elsewhere continues (Waite, 2000). During the 20 th century family demography charted historic changes in rates of mortality, marriage, fertility, divorce, remarriage, and household composition (Bumpass, 1990). In contrast to 1900, today both men and women live significantly longer, a smaller proportion of the adult life course is spent married, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of adults cohabit before marriage or in lieu of marriage, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of marriages end in divorce, fewer remarriages follow a divorce, fewer children are born to each woman, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of the population lives in a single-person household, and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of adulthood is spent with living parents over age 65 (and at risk of dependency due to frailty and/or chronic illness...|$|R

Recruiting for a Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) began in mid-September. While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid-1940. Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940, three of which were dispatched to the Middle East. The RAAF's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS), through which almost 28,000 Australians were trained during the war.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, and there is <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon {{for them to have}} a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
