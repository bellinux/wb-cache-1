In grounded theory, researchers engage in excessive conceptualization and defend this as [...] "sensitivity to context." [...] Because of this, convergent conceptualization becomes impossible.? As a result of these two arguments, grounded theory escapes the testing of theory. There is a very thin line between context and regularities. Goldthorpe supports this criticism in a review of three overlapping literatures: historical sociology, comparative macrosociology, and ethnography. On the one hand, historical sociology is good at analyzing long term processes of structural change, but on the other hand, its reliance on secondary sources opens several possibilities of bias. Comparative macro-sociology may be able to contextualize with reference to institutions and historical path-dependencies, but its focus on constellations of singular causal forces makes it difficult to break with long outdated mechanical models of reasoning. Ethnography may closely analyse actual mechanisms of interaction, but it doesn't provide acceptable knowledge about underlying generative processes, since it is unable to deal with variation within and across locales.Goldthorpe's core arguments are in terms of rational action theory and probabilistic statistical models.Grounded Theory can be reductive in the search for general patterns across a population, and even the selective coding process does not fully cover the contextual issues.|$|E

5000|$|... "In {{the nineteenth}} and at the {{beginning}} of the present century, laissez-faire was the dominant creed in America. This creed was associated, in the intellectual sphere, with a certain attachment to what has been called [...] "formalism" [...] in philosophy and the social sciences. This was marked by a reverence for the role of logic and mathematics and a priori reasoning as applied to philosophy, economics and jurisprudence, with but little urge to link these empirically to the facts of life. Yet empirical science and technology were increasing dominating American society and with this development arose and intellectual movement in favor of treating philosophy and the social sciences, and even logic itself, <b>as</b> <b>empirical</b> <b>studies</b> not rooted in abstract formalism. In America this movement was associated with such figures as William James and Dewey in philosophy and logic. Veblen in economics, Beard and Robinson in historical studies, and Mr. Justice Holmes in jurisprudence. It is important to note that this movement was especially hostile to the so-called British empirical school derived from Hume, and to which Jeremy Bentham, Austin and John Stuart Mill adhered. For while it is true that these thinkers were positivist and anti-metaphysical they were for the anti-formalists, not empirical enough, since they were associated with a priori reasoning not based on actual study of the facts, such as Mill's formal logic and his reliance on an abstract [...] "economic man," [...] Bentham's hedonic calculus of pleasures and pains, and the analytical approach to jurisprudence derived from Austin. They were particularly critical of the ahistorical approach of the English utilitarians. Nor, unlike the sociologists of Pound persuasion, were they interested to borrow from Bentham such abstract analyses of society as his doctrine of conflicting to emphasise was the need to enlarge knowledge empirically, and to relate it to the solution of the practical problems of man in society at the present day., ...|$|E

To identify an industrial cluster, we propose the location quotient composite indexes with technological innovation as the major consideration. Meanwhile, the entire life cycle evolution of industrial clusters is divided into emerging, growth, maturity and decline stages with the graphical index theory and the agglomeration degree measurement. Referring to Cobb-Douglas production function model and conduction process of ‘industrial cluster, innovation network, regional innovation’, we develop a mathematical model to measure the dynamic impact.
