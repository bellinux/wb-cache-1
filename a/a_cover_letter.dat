5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. <b>A</b> <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she was supposed to have baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{offers to}} manage Georgia Brooks' (Saskia Hampele) singing career and gets her to sign over {{the rights to}} her song. Paul then gives the song to Amali Ward, but she decides against {{recording}} it. Paul attempts to sue Georgia, but drops the case when he learns Jack has died. He then asks for his fraud conviction {{to be removed from}} his criminal record, so he can run for mayor. Karl unsuccessfully runs against him. Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to enable him to sack Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese and he keeps the hotel within the Lassiter's chain. Paul learns Rebecca works for a civic project called Twin Cities and forges Karl's signature on <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> to get Rebecca to return. Paul tells Rebecca that he became mayor for her because he still loves her. Paul asks Rebecca to move back to Erinsborough, but she refuses. Paul disapproves when Kate gets back together with Mark Brennan. They reconcile just before she is fatally shot. Paul blames Mark for Kate's death.|$|E

40|$|Dillman's Total Design Method (TDM) for mail surveys {{has proved}} effectual in {{attaining}} high response {{rates in the}} U. S. A. The TDM, however, has two drawbacks: its relatively high costs of a mail survey and its susceptibility to response errors. We tested {{the ability of the}} TDM techniques to increase response rates. Furthermore, the influence of the TDM on the response error was investigated. In this experiment, the effects of personalization of the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> and <b>a</b> final reminder by certified mail were tested on a sample of the Dutch population. If the TDM is followed completely the response rate in the Netherlands is comparable to the response rate in the U. S. A (70 %). Omission of personalizing the <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> or sending <b>a</b> reminder by certified mail results in a significantly lower response rate. Using the TDM in toto does not lead to responses of inferior quality. We find that a reminder by certified mail in combination with <b>a</b> personalized <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> does not result in more socially desirable answers, more item non-response, or a more deviating response pattern. However, the use of only <b>a</b> personalized <b>cover</b> <b>letter,</b> i. e., without a certified mailing, did result in more socially desirable answers...|$|R

500|$|In {{the middle}} of the year Baird {{received}} five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them. [...] Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> that was so remarkably negative {{about the quality of the}} manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories [...] "despite the foregoing, or because of it". [...] However, Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to resubmit only one story, [...] "Dagon". [...] It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird's tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to Weird Tales: as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of Frank Owen and Seabury Quinn.|$|E
500|$|Barber's first attempt, modeled for {{the half}} dollar, disregarded Leech's instructions. Instead of a design based on French coinage, it {{depicted}} a standing figure of Columbia, bearing a pileus atop a liberty pole; an eagle spreading its wings stands behind her. The reverse utilized the heraldic eagle from the Great Seal of the United States, enclosed inside a thick oak wreath, with the required legends surrounding the rim. Leech rejected the design, and Barber submitted a revised obverse in mid-September {{with a head}} of Liberty similar to that on the adopted coin. Leech got feedback from friends and from Secretary Foster; on September 28, he wrote Barber that Liberty's lips were [...] "rather voluptuous" [...] and directed him to prepare a reverse without the wreath. Barber did so, and pattern coins based on the revised design were struck. Barber complained, in a letter on October 2 to Superintendent Bosbyshell, but intended for Leech, that the constant demands for changes were wasting his time. Leech replied, stating {{that he did not}} care how much effort was expended in order to improve the design, especially since, once issued, they would have to be used for 25 years. Barber's reply was transmitted to Leech on October 6 with <b>a</b> <b>cover</b> <b>letter</b> from Acting Superintendent Mark Cobb (Bosbyshell was traveling) stating that Barber [...] "disclaims any intention to be captious and certainly did not intend to question your prerogative as one of the officers designed by law to pass upon new designs for coinage". The letter from Barber was a lengthy technical explanation for various design elements, and requested further advice from Leech if he had preferences; the overall tone was argumentative. Leech chose not to write again; he addressed one concern, about whether the olive branches in the design were rendered accurately, by visiting the National Botanical Garden, obtaining one, and sending it to Barber.|$|E
