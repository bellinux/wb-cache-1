It has a considerable impact on flow and sediment transport, as well as processes of river bed deformation and landform evolution throughout a watershed. In this study, considering influences on sediment movement, especially on cohesive sediment transport, Ca 2 + and H+ were chosen as characteristic ions of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter,</b> and the total desorption quantity of Ca 2 + and pH value when the desorption equilibrium is reached were employed as two indexes representing the desorption of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter.</b> By means of an indoor experiment, desorption of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> as influenced by cations in static water was investigated. The results show that the total desorption quantity of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> increases with the initial cation concentration until a maximum desorption quantity value is obtained and maintained. The total desorption quantity of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter</b> depends on properties of the specific cations in static water, and the stronger the affinity is between the cation and sediment surface, the higher the total desorption quantity will be. Finally, a strong approximate linear relationship between desorption quantities for different kinds of <b>soluble</b> <b>matters</b> was obtained, which means that {{variation of}} pH values can accurately reflect the desorption results of <b>soluble</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|R

The proteins of each meal were studied in detail by means of protein fractionation, gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Osborne solubility fractionation of the protein of whole safflower meal showed {{that the amount of}} protein in the <b>alkali</b> <b>soluble</b> fraction was approximately 71 % of the total and the alcohol soluble fraction did not contain any protein. After dehulling and debittering, the amount of protein in the <b>alkali</b> <b>soluble</b> fraction decreased by 30 %, whereas the amount of protein in the insoluble residue increased by 12 %. SDS-PAGE of the proteins of the water-, salt- and <b>alkali</b> <b>soluble</b> fractions revealed that they consisted of 8, 13 and 13 distinct subunits, respectively, with apparent molecular weights ranging from 14. 7 to 88. 0 kDa.

In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes.

The latter organic matter has a D/H ratio of about 0. 002, comparable to the typical D/H values (Penzias, 1980) observed for the interstellar organic molecules in giant clouds.

The TOC and n-alkanes distribution study revealed the major input of terrestrial organic matter into the sediments from higher plants and minor presence of autochthonous microbial sources. Metal (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb) forms study showed that metals in sediments occur mainly in a biogeochemically stable mineral-incorporated form, which comprises up to 98 % of total metal content, while labile (acid soluble) and organically bound (<b>alkali</b> <b>soluble)</b> forms make up to 3 – 11 % and 2 – 12 % of total metal content, respectively.
