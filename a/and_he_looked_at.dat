And I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} ambitious as Lucas {{wanted to create}} fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) {{that had never been}} {{realized}} before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas [...] "didn't want anything [...] to stand out, he wanted it [...] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me and said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
