5|$|During the Classical <b>and</b> <b>Romantic</b> {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed instruments to produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E

It was said of Saran that {{all she had to do}} was look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> scenes.|$|E
5|$|In popular memory, Tamar's {{image has}} {{acquired}} a legendary <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> façade. A diverse set of folk songs, poems and tales illustrate her as an ideal ruler, a holy woman onto whom certain attributes of pagan deities and Christian saints were sometimes projected. For example, in an old Ossetian legend, Queen Tamar conceives her son of a sunbeam which shines through the window. Another myth, from the Georgian mountains, equates Tamar with the pagan deity of weather, Pirimze, who controls winter. Similarly, in the highland district of Pshavi, Tamar's image fused with a pagan goddess of healing and female fertility.|$|E

Miles has earned a generally positive reception, while Quong Tart has been nominated for three Inside Soap Awards.|$|E

5|$|Reports {{exist that}} Bogdan-Pitești's {{politics}} were already a merger of opposite or hardly compatible doctrines. He respected Catholicism and Judaism {{as the most}} elevated religious cultures, rejected Orthodoxy, atheism and communism as ideologies for the mediocre, and depicted himself as a Catholic anarchist. He believed in craniometry, and took scientific racism at face value. At some stage during the late 1880s, Bogdan-Pitești became a supporter of General Boulanger, who attempted to gain power in France {{with support from the}} Orléanist, Bonapartist and socialist camps; he reputedly befriended the prominent Boulangist <b>and</b> <b>Romantic</b> nationalist thinker Maurice Barrès.|$|E
5|$|Riley wrote gentle <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> {{poems that}} were not in dialect. They {{generally}} consisted of sonnets and were strongly influenced by the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems. Still less popular were the poems Riley authored in his later years; most were to commemorate important events of American history and to eulogize the dead.|$|E

The accompanying music video for the track was directed by Rihanna's longtime collaborator and director Anthony Mandler. Its tropical <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> setting features an eighteen foot long bed designed specifically for the video. Rihanna promoted the track with live performances at the ACM Awards, along with Sugarland front woman Jennifer Nettles, {{as well as on}} American Idol, NBC's Today show, and on her Loud Tour (2011).

5|$|Episodes {{typically}} {{depict the}} friends' comedic <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking {{jobs in the}} fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show they repeatedly date and break up, even while Ross briefly marries Emily, he and Rachel have a child, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents in Long Island, Ross's ex-wife and their son, Central Perk barista Gunther, Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice, and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.|$|E

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can be limited by participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
5|$|German {{classical}} music includes works {{by some of}} the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical <b>and</b> <b>Romantic</b> eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic idiom. Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J.R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme to {{decorate}} {{the walls of the}} Oxford Union. None of the painters had mastered the technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the gentle <b>and</b> <b>romantic</b> Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork. Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde, a translation of Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.|$|E
