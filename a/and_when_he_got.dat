25|$|Hafey's {{passion for}} fitness was legendary; every morning {{he woke up}} at 5:20 and went for an 8km run, {{followed}} by 250 push-ups and a swim in Port Phillip Bay, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> home he did 700 crunches and sit-ups. He was a popular figure at St. Kilda beach, often greeting fellow joggers and cyclists.|$|E
25|$|Matthew Hayden {{broke the}} record for fastest World Cup century, taking 66 balls to notch up the hundred, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out two balls later the run rate was still more than seven an over. A 161-run {{partnership}} between Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke followed, with Ponting ending on 91 and Clarke on 92, and though Andrew Hall took wickets near the end, Australia finished on 377 for six.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February {{a formal}} {{reconciliation}} was concluded between Ocko tom Brok, {{the town of}} Groningen, Oostergo, Westergo, Hunsingo, Fivelgo, and the small territories of Vredewold, Langewold, and Humsterland. This took place behind John of Bavaria's back, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> wind of it, he demanded it to be rescinded. But {{at this point he}} had lost almost all his support in the Frisian territories. His last stronghold there was the city of Dokkum, on the north coast, which was held for him mainly by privateers, who preyed on the ships plying the trade route along the North Sea coast. At the end of May a fleet from the cities of Groningen, Hamburg, and Lübeck sailed to Dokkum, and drove the privateers out, thus depriving John of this last foothold on Frisian soil.|$|E
60|$|Ginger Dick was {{so quiet}} and {{satisfied}} about the fight that old Sam and Peter couldn't make 'im out at all. He wouldn't even practise punching at a bolster that Peter rigged up for 'im, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> a message from Bill Lumm naming a quiet place on the Lea Marshes he agreed to it as comfortable as possible.|$|R
60|$|They 'ad {{a miserable}} day. When the dog got sick o' {{sitting in a}} pub 'e made such a noise they 'ad to take 'im out; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> tired o' walking about {{he sat down on}} the {{pavement}} and they 'ad to drag 'im along to the nearest pub agin. At five o'clock in the arternoon Ginger Dick was talking about two-penn'orth o' rat-poison.|$|R
6000|$|... "Much sanctifyin' he'll get," [...] said Miss Roxy, contemptuously. [...] "I don't {{believe he}} loves her any more than fancy; she's the last plaything, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> her, he'll be tired of her, as he always was with {{anything}} <b>he</b> <b>got</b> ever since. I tell you, Moses Pennel is all for pride and ambition and the world; <b>and</b> his wife, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> gets used to her, 'll be only a circumstance,--that's all." ...|$|R
500|$|Bill {{became his}} coach and Henry {{trained in the}} Oldham Baths, and from 1894 in the Chadderton Baths, often on the [...] "dirty water days" [...] because of cheaper admission. During this time he {{continued}} to train in the canal <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{a job at a}} cotton mill, he spent his lunch times swimming in the canal. At 5'5" [...] (1.65m) and weighing , he wore a hand-woven silk swimming costume weighing about an ounce.|$|E
2500|$|Jilani {{played his}} only Test match in England in 1936 during a tour wrecked by infighting between two factions {{supportive}} of the captain Vizzy and the former captain C. K. Nayudu. [...] Jilani belonged to the former group. [...] A {{few days before the}} Test Match at the Oval, Jilani publicly insulted Nayudu while coming down to breakfast. [...] It has been alleged that he owed to this incident his subsequent Test debut, a forgettable affair to which he contributed sixteen runs and fifteen wicketless overs. During the tour, according to Cota Ramaswami, Jilani suffered from high blood pressure, insomnia, sleep-walking and violent outbursts of temper. [...] "Nobody could say when he was normal <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into uncontrollable temper. He was constantly undergoing treatment during the tour".|$|E
2500|$|As a child, Nimoy took {{miscellaneous}} jobs {{to supplement}} his family's income, including selling newspapers and greeting cards, shining shoes, or setting up chairs in theaters, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> older, selling vacuum cleaners. He also began acting {{at the age}} of eight in a children's and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion, so he could always make a living, but his grandfather encouraged him to do what he then wanted to do most, to become an actor. Nimoy also realized he had an aptitude for singing, which he developed while a member of his synagogue's choir. His singing during his bar mitzvah at age 13 was so good that he was asked to repeat his performance the following week at another synagogue. [...] "He is still the only man I know whose voice was two bar mitzvahs good!," [...] said William Shatner.|$|E
60|$|The surgeon's parting advice, {{following}} on {{the quaint}} protest of Rufus, had {{its effect on}} Amelius. He was silent <b>and</b> thoughtful <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into the carriage again.|$|R
60|$|The mystery had conked. I saw all. As I {{dare say}} you know, Jeeves's {{reputation}} as a counsellor has long been established among the cognoscenti, and the first move of any of my little circle on discovering themselves in any form of soup is always to roll round and put the thing up to him. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> A out of a bad spot, A puts B on to him. <b>And</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has fixed up B, B sends C along. And so on, if you get my drift, and so forth.|$|R

2500|$|In May 1986, during Piper's five-month hiatus {{from the}} WWF, Adonis (with Hart) debuted his own talk segment, The Flower Shop. These {{segments}} {{were the primary}} backdrop for Paul Orndorff's slow-building heel turn against his friend Hulk Hogan, with Adonis relentlessly needling Orndorff about living in Hogan's shadow. In August, shortly before Piper's return, Adonis obtained the services of Piper's bodyguard, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton, who took to wearing a pink cowboy hat. A feud with Piper heated up when Adonis, Orton, and Don Muraco attacked him during a [...] "duel" [...] between the two talk segments, injuring his leg, covering him in lipstick and damaging the Pit set. A week later, Piper destroyed the set of The Flower Shop with a baseball bat. It was never rebuilt. On the October 4 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Piper struck Adonis with a crutch, resulting in a two-month absence from TV with an alleged separated shoulder. After Adonis returned in November to attack Piper on the Pit, the two agreed to a hair vs. hair match at WrestleMania III. Piper won the bout with help from Brutus Beefcake, who cut off the majority of Adonis' hair afterward. Piper was initially supposed {{to cut off the}} hair himself, but had such a hard time because the hair was too wet, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> Beefcake to help out, that was the start of Beefcake's gimmick as [...] "The Barber". Adonis then began a feud with Beefcake but was fired in May 1987 for what the WWF claimed were [...] "dress code violations".|$|E

6000|$|Meantime Serge {{had gone}} upstairs {{with the fish}} and the duck and the cheese and the pudding. As he went up he thought. [...] "It is selfish to eat alone. I will give part of the fish to the others." [...] <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a little further up the steps he thought, [...] "I will give them all of the fish." [...] <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> higher still he thought, [...] "They shall have everything." ...|$|E
60|$|Frank, now chilled to the bone, {{was glad}} to paddle, and they were soon alongside. Harry handed him up the birds <b>and</b> guns <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> on board, <b>and</b> then made the painter fast.|$|R

60|$|Fixing {{his eyes}} on the sparrows who were disporting {{themselves}} among the budding elm-boughs, John plunged abruptly into his story, never once looking at his hearer and speaking so rapidly that he was rather red <b>and</b> breathless <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through.|$|R

60|$|He {{leaped to}} his feet. The boys were {{streaming}} up the ladders. Above {{could be heard}} a great scurrying about and shouting, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> through the hatchway he stood still--as if confounded.|$|E
60|$|Batley volunteered as starter, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{them off}} satisfactorily the spectators scattered, {{one or two}} to watch the pace across the plowed land, the others moving toward the stiffest jumps--the course was roughly circular.|$|E

6000|$|So {{that is how}} Pupkin came to Mariposa. <b>And</b> if, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there, his father's friend gave no sign, {{and treated}} the boy with {{roughness}} and incivility, that may have been, for all I know, {{a continuation of the}} [...] "tanning" [...] process of the Maritime people.|$|R
6000|$|So terrible was {{the stroke}} that Chi-gwisa-miti shrivelled {{up as the}} other giants had done; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> back his breath he begged Makoma to take him as his servant. 'For,' said he, 'it is honourable to serve a man so great as thou.' ...|$|R
60|$|Jim {{appeared}} {{just over}} the rim, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up to us, dusty, torn and fagged out, with Don, Tige and Ranger showing signs of collapse, we all blurted out questions. But Jim took his time.|$|E
60|$|But at {{the turn}} of the year Lakatos Pál became ill, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> worse and worse and the doctor seemed unable to do {{anything}} to make him well, he began to talk of his nephew, Andor.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to {{the house}} he knocked {{at the door and}} said, 'My sister dear, open; I'm here.' Then the door opened and the King walked in, and there stood the loveliest maiden he had ever seen.|$|E
60|$|The King thanked him, {{put on the}} shoes, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> to him who was Lord of all {{the fish}} in the sea, he turned the snow shoes round, and back they went just as the others had gone, and he asked once more where Whiteland was.|$|R
60|$|He was {{now using}} his putter for every shot, <b>and,</b> except <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{trapped in the}} cross-lines {{at the top of}} the hill just before {{reaching}} Bayside, he had been in no serious difficulties. He was playing a nice easy game, getting the full face of the putter on to each shot.|$|R
60|$|With {{slow and}} gentle hand this man backed his quiet and docile horse {{deeper into the}} bush; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> so deep into {{the shade of the}} forest as to be {{perfectly}} safe from observation, he leaped on its back with a single bound, and galloped swiftly away.|$|R
60|$|Harry poled {{the boat}} along quite easily through the shallow water, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> farther out {{he found that}} he {{proceeded}} with still greater ease, only {{he did not go}} straight across, but went a little too much down stream.|$|E
6000|$|Then Mr Mortimer Gazebee went, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> home, he {{told his}} wife that Crosbie was taking things with a high hand. [...] "The fact is, my dear, that he's ashamed of himself, and {{therefore}} tries to put a bold face upon it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} my brother-in-law {{going for a}} short sea trip once, {{for the benefit of}} his health. He took a return berth from London to Liverpool; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket.|$|E
