5|$|After {{his time}} on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Hines {{returned}} to practicing law in Frankfort, Kentucky. In 1886, Hines began writing a series of four articles discussing the Northwest Conspiracy for Basil W. Duke's Southern Bivouac magazine. The magazine was dedicated {{to the memory of}} the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, but was less adversarial than similar Southern magazines, gaining a larger Northern readership than similar journals. The first of the articles was printed in the December 1886 issue. However, after consulting with former Confederate president Jefferson Davis at Davis' home in Mississippi, Hines did not name <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> the Northern side who assisted in the conspiracy. After writing the first article, Hines was attacked for not being more forthcoming regarding all the participants from both newspapers' reviewers (particularly from the Louisville Times) and Southern readers, which discouraged Hines from publishing any more accounts of the Northwest Conspiracy.|$|E

500|$|After {{giving his}} team the news, McKechnie had the Reds {{dedicate}} themselves to winning the World Series [...] "for Hershie". His number was retired {{for the season}} by the team as a tribute. McKechnie never publicly revealed what Willard Hershberger said to him during their meeting the day before: [...] "It {{had nothing to do}} with <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> the team", he told reporters. [...] "He told it to me in confidence, and I will not utter it to anyone". The Cincinnati Reds would go on to defeat the American League champion Detroit Tigers in seven games to win the 1940 World Series. Reds players decided to share a portion of their championship money, totaling $5,803, with Hershberger's mother, Maude. Hershberger was buried at Visalia Public Cemetery in Visalia, California.|$|E
500|$|The species' unique {{life cycle}} {{in such a}} harsh {{environment}} has been described in print and visual media. Apsley Cherry-Garrard, the Antarctic explorer, said: [...] "Take it all in all, I do not believe <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin". Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005, the French documentary La Marche de l'empereur, which was also released with the English title March of the Penguins, {{told the story of}} the penguins' reproductive cycle. The subject has been covered for the small screen four times by the BBC and presenter David Attenborough: first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic Life in the Freezer, again in the 2001 series The Blue Planet, [...] once again in the 2006 series Planet Earth, and finally Frozen Planet in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Overnight figures {{indicated}} that the episode averaged 8.7million viewers and a 37% audience share. Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't ever remember hearing <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy gloom of it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

On the following episode of Raw, Sami Zayn defeated Rusev to challenge for the title; however, Ziggler defended his championship against Miz on the 900th episode of SmackDown, and was defeated after a distraction by Maryse, ending his reign at 37 days. On the November 22nd edition of SmackDown, {{it was announced that}} Ziggler would face Miz in a Ladder match at the [...] event for the Intercontinental Championship in what was advertised as their final match, where Ziggler was defeated. On the December 13 edition of SmackDown, Ziggler pinned Dean Ambrose in a fatal four-way elimination match also involving The Miz and Luke Harper, to become the number one contender to AJ Styles' WWE Championship. The following week, Baron Corbin confronted Ziggler, and the two had a match with Ziggler's number one contender's spot on the line. The match ended in a double count-out and Daniel Bryan made the December 27 episode's WWE Championship match a triple-threat between Styles, Ziggler, and Corbin. In that match, Styles retained the WWE Championship after pinning Ziggler.|$|E

500|$|Upon taking power Castillo Armas, {{worried that}} he lacked popular support, {{attempted}} to eliminate all opposition. He quickly arrested many thousands of opposition leaders, branding them communists. Detention camps were built to hold the prisoners when the jails exceeded their capacity. Historians have estimated that more than 3,000 people were arrested following the coup, and that approximately 1,000 agricultural workers were killed by Castillo Armas's troops {{in the province of}} Tiquisate. Acting on the advice of Dulles, Castillo Armas also detained a number of citizens trying to flee the country. He also created a National Committee of Defense Against Communism (CDNCC), with sweeping powers of arrest, detention, and deportation. Over the next few years, the committee investigated nearly 70,000 people. Many were imprisoned, executed, or [...] "disappeared", frequently without trial. In August, the government passed Decree59, which permitted the security forces to detain <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> the blacklist of the CDNCC for six months without trial. The eventual list of suspected communists compiled by the CDNCC included one in every ten adults in the country. Attempts were also made to eliminate from government positions people who had gained them under Árbenz. All political parties, labor unions, and peasant organizations were outlawed. In histories of the period, Castillo Armas has been referred to as a dictator.|$|E
500|$|A {{report about}} the concert at issue {{released}} on May 26, 2010 by topzine.cz stated that [...] "one {{of the things that}} was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe, who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage." [...] The article also contains pictures, one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground. Meanwhile, another report released two days after the concert by metalopolis.net alleged that [...] "Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an impertinent fan, who has climbed the podium several times. The front-man clearly showed that it is his territory, he struck the intruder down, punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium, without even stopping singing (!)" [...] On May 28, 2010, the report by marastmusic.com stated that [...] "some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> the stage", [...] while abysszine.com stated that [...] "the only negative thing about the concert was, to say it mildly, disputable approach of the band towards the stage-divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage, he was brutally swept down." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} both {{original and}} existing music tracks. Tracks composed {{specifically for the}} film include [...] "100 Black Coffins" [...] by Rick Ross and produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, [...] "Who Did That To You?" [...] by John Legend, [...] "Ancora Qui" [...] by Ennio Morricone and Elisa, and [...] "Freedom" [...] by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton. The theme, [...] "Django", was also the theme song of the 1966 film. Musician Frank Ocean wrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that [...] "Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, there just wasn't a scene for it." [...] Frank Ocean later published the song, entitled [...] "Wiseman", on his Tumblr blog. The film also features a few famous pieces of western classical music, including Beethoven's [...] "Für Elise" [...] and [...] "Dies Irae" [...] from Verdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: [...] "I just don't {{like the idea of}} giving that much power to <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> one of my movies." [...] The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012. Ennio Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music in Django Unchained and stated that he would [...] "never work" [...] with the director after this film, but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino's The Hateful Eight in 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music, Hollis Robbins notes {{that the vast majority of}} film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate Django Unchained squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema. Jim Croce's hit I Got A Name was featured in the soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the episode's {{release on}} DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode [...] "wickedly funny, {{no matter how}} offensive." [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that [...] "What, in other hands, {{could have been a}} serious, even heart-wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute {{examination}} of the current abortion clash." [...] Moore also noted, however, that [...] "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode [...] "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters." [...] In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated [...] "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." [...] White went on to comment that it was [...] "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" [...] and that [...] "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter." [...] White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: [...] "That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, should {{be one of the few}} shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas [...] And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Three {{chartered}} trains transported Liverpool {{supporters to}} Sheffield for a match fixture in 1988, {{but only one}} such train ran in 1989. The 350 passengers arrived on the grounds about 2:20pm. Many supporters wished to enjoy the day and were {{in no hurry to}} enter the stadium too early. Some supporters were delayed by roadworks while crossing the Pennines on the M62 motorway which resulted in minor traffic congestion. Between 2:30pm and 2:40pm, there was a build-up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane, eager to enter the stadium before the game began. At 2:46pm, the BBC's football commentator John Motson had already noticed the imbalance of distribution of people in the Leppings Lane pens. While rehearsing for the match off-air, he suggested a nearby cameraman look as well. [...] "There's gaps, you know, in parts of the ground.

2500|$|Acts deemed {{insulting}} to Bhumibol's image {{are also}} considered as criminal offences under {{the doctrine of}} [...] lèse-majesté in Thailand. This includes placing photographs of <b>anybody</b> <b>on</b> a website {{in such a way}} as to appear above photographs of the king. In March 2007 Oliver Jufer, a Swiss man, was sentenced to 10 years in jail for daubing black paint on portraits of Bhumibol while drunk in Chiang Mai, although he received a royal pardon the following month. Suwicha Thakor was arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison, later commuted to 10, for posting a picture on an Internet web board that was deemed insulting to Bhumibol, thereby violating section 112 of the Criminal Code and violating the Computer Crime Act (CCA) of 2007. The CCA was passed by the military junta following the 2006 coup. Suwicha's conviction was the first time that it had been successfully used to prosecute lèse-majesté. A nurse wearing black on Bhumibol Adulyadej's birthday was charged with lèse majesté. In 2015, Prachatai published an infographic showing that bathroom graffiti, a hand gesture, a hearsay report of a taxi conversation, and not standing during the playing of the royal anthem, among other things, could be punished as acts of lèse-majesté.|$|E
