Hotham was returned on 25 April 1952 and simultaneously transferred back to the United Kingdom under the Mutual Defence Assistance Program. The partially stripped vessel was returned to United States custody on 13 March 1956.|$|E

25|$|Alfred's {{view of his}} society overlooks certain {{classes of}} people. The main {{division}} in Anglo-Saxon society was between slave and free. Both groups were hierarchically structured, with several classes of freemen and many types of slaves. These varied at different times and in different areas, but the most prominent ranks within free society were the king, the nobleman or thegn, and the ordinary freeman or ceorl. They were differentiated primarily by {{the value of their}} wergild or 'man price', which was not only the <b>amount</b> <b>payable</b> in compensation for homicide (see above, section 2), but was also used as the basis for other legal formulations such as the value of the oath that they could swear in a court of law. Slaves had no wergild, as offences against them were taken to be offences against their owners, but the earliest laws set out a detailed scale of penalties depending both on the type of slave and the rank of owner.|$|E

60|$|It is a fact--for future consideration--that Isaac Worthington {{proposed}} to Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira Perkins heard him do so. It {{had been very}} carefully prepared, that speech, and was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr. Worthington preferred to offer himself for {{what he was going}} to be--not for what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large <b>amount,</b> <b>payable</b> in some twenty years, with interest. The astonishing thing to record is that in twenty years he could have more than paid the note, although he could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free Library and the Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the church and the great marble monument on the hill--to another woman. All of these things, and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only accepted that promise to pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle more robust than when he came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she doubted his promise to pay.|$|E
