500|$|Rick Rubin had {{produced}} their two previous albums. However, the Chili Peppers {{decided to look}} for other producers for Californication. David Bowie had shown great interest in working with the band and asked to produce the album; however, the Chili Peppers chose to remain with Rubin for Californication. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought necessary for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return. Recording took place at Cello Studios in Los Angeles. In early 1999, following the recording process, the band played [...] "Scar Tissue", [...] "Otherside", and [...] "Californication" [...] to their managers, and {{it was decided that}} [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] would be the lead single for the album. To support their reunited line-up, the band played various proms across the country to promote Californication. It sprouted a competition, which called upon high school students to write essays on [...] "how they could make their schools better, safer, happier, more rocking places, so that they didn't {{have to go to school}} <b>afraid.</b> <b>If</b> you wrote the essay, you got a free ticket to the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them to get out to the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were <b>afraid</b> <b>if</b> they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted to keep us from offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — or anywhere else in New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E
2500|$|During his 2005 {{birthday}} speech, Bhumibol invited criticism: [...] "Actually, I {{must also}} be criticised. I am not <b>afraid</b> <b>if</b> the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know. Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread barrage of criticisms resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions. Lèse-majesté cases rose from five or six a year pre-2005 to 478 in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 October 2008, Al Jazeera {{broadcast}} {{interviews with}} people attending a Sarah Palin 2008 United States presidential election rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, with interviewees making comments about Barack Obama such as [...] "he regards white people as trash" [...] and [...] "I'm <b>afraid</b> <b>if</b> he wins, the blacks will take over". The report received over 2 million views on YouTube and elicited comment by Colin Powell: [...] "Those kind of images {{going out on}} Al Jazeera are killing us." [...] Following this the Washington Post ran an op-ed, claiming the news channel was deliberately encouraging [...] "anti-American sentiment overseas", which was criticized by Al Jazeera as [...] "a gratuitous and uninformed shot at Al Jazeera's motives", as the report {{was just one of}} [...] "hundreds of hours of diverse coverage".|$|E

2500|$|Rudolf von Scheliha, the First Secretary at the German {{embassy in}} Warsaw {{had been working}} as a Soviet spy since 1937, keeping the Kremlin well {{informed}} {{about the state of}} German-Polish relations, and it was due to intelligence provided by him that the Soviets knew that Hitler was seriously considering invading Poland from March 1939 onward, giving the orders for an invasion of Poland in May. On 13 March 1939 Scheliha reported to Moscow that he had conversation with one of Ribbentrop's aides, a Peter Kleist, who told him Germany would probably attack Poland sometime that year. In his reports to Moscow, Scheliha made clear that the Auswärtiges Amt had attempted to reduce Poland down to a German satellite in the winter of 1938-39, and the Poles had refused to play that role. At the same time, the chief Soviet spy in Japan, Richard Sorge had reported to Moscow that the German attempt to convert the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance had failed, as Germany wanted the alliance to be directed against Britain while Japan wanted the alliance to be directed against the Soviet Union. [...] On 5 April 1939, Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, the State Secretary at the Auswärtiges Amt ordered Count Hans-Adolf von Moltke, the German ambassador to Poland, that he was under no conditions to engage in talks with the Poles over resolving the dispute over the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdansk) as the Danzig issue was just a pretext for war, and he was <b>afraid</b> <b>if</b> talks did begin, the Poles might actually agree to Danzig rejoining Germany, thereby depriving the Reich of its pretext. Scheliha in his turn informed Moscow that the Auswärtiges Amt would not engage in talks for a diplomatic solution to the Danzig issue, indicating that German policy towards Poland was not a policy with a high risk of war, but was a policy aimed at causing a war.|$|E
