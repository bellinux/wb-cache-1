40|$|Overall, the glucose/leptin ratio {{can be used}} in {{addition}} to glucose/insulin ratio, Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index, and Homeostasis Model Assessment to accurately assess insulin resistance in subjects with hyperglycemia. Objectives: To identify the fasting glucose/leptin ratio as a new simple method for the detection of insulin resistance in Iraqi diabetes mellitus patients, and to examine its usefulness as a new marker for insulin resistance. Methods: A case control study conducted at the National Diabetes Center, College of Medicine at Al-Mustansiryia University from 1 August 2008 to 30 January 2010. An enzyme spectrophotometric method was used to determine fasting glucose, while HPLC Technique determined leptin and insulin hormones in serum of patients with diabetes mellitus (n= 61) and normal healthy subjects as controls (n= 63). Results: A positive significant correlation with linear regression equations were found between <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> leptin hormones, <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/leptin ratios among the diabetic patient group. While negative, significant correlations were found with linear regression equations between <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/insulin ratio, <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> insulin <b>and</b> <b>fasting</b> glucose/leptin ratio in patients group.

Similar observations are made during reaction between lutetium and water (slow when cold <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> when hot); lutetium hydroxide is formed in the reaction.
