The corrosion processes are constituted by some material degradation, generally metallic material, by means of chemical or electrochemical actions of environment in which the material are and can or cannot be combined with mechanical stress. Corrosion is present in the materials in general. Their deterioration is caused by such physical-chemical interaction between the material and the corrosive environment where it causes major problems in several activities. In order to prevent material losses, anticorrosive techniques are used which include coatings, medium modification techniques, <b>anodic</b> and cathodic <b>protection,</b> and corrosion inhibitors such as the organic compounds use.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} 'F u. E' {{project was}} to improve the stress {{corrosion}} cracking of aluminium alloys by means of modification of the surface or marginal layers. The main results of the examinations are: cathodic corrosion protection (Mg) reduces the susceptibility against stress corrosion cracking and prevents initiation of cracks {{as long as the}} 'sacrificial anode' is not consumed; noble marginal layers (Si) result in a considerable delay of the incubation period for initiation of cracks. The corrosion protection ability of cathodic coatings is better than that of <b>anodic</b> layers; the <b>protection</b> ability of cathodic layers increases with the thickness of the layer; amorphous or partly amorphous marginal layers, studied with the Zr/Al/Si system, inhibit the initiation of stress corrosion cracking for a prolonged period; under the given conditions it seems that pitting is not a prerequisite for stress corrosion cracking of the investigated aluminium alloy.

40|$|Oil or gas {{transportation}} {{requires the}} use of very long pipelines from the source of extraction to the main distribution grids. However, due to the properties of the inner fluids and to the differing environmental conditions, these pipelines are particularly prone to corrosion. To guarantee the longevity of pipelines, protective coatings and/or <b>anodic</b> or cathodic <b>protection</b> are commonly used. In conjunction with protective coatings, cathodic protection is often considered the wisest solution and is therefore widely adopted. In remote areas, where power supply is not easily available from the grid, power units are distributed along the course of the pipeline to overcome this shortage. Thanks to their impressive operating longevity without maintenance, off-grid Stirling engines are well-suited to this purpose as they can be used as power generators in remote areas where operat/are occasional. A 1 kWe Stirling engine has been designed to ensure the protection of over 5 kilometers of pipeline length, conditioning the corrosion protection control units and powering the SCADA systems.

40|$|Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels were {{synthesised}} chemically {{prior to}} the preparation of hydrogel and PPy blends. PAAm hydrogel {{was used as a}} matrix to grow polypyrrole electrochemically in the three dimensional structure. The redox nature of the blends was studied using electrochemical (EC) methods such as cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry. The effect of electropolymerisation time, monomer concentration and dopant size on the preparation of the hydrogel and PPy blend has been investigated. It was found that electropolymerisation time and monomer concentration affected the growth of polypyrrole in the hydrogel network. It was also observed that smaller dopants (N 03 -) can easily be incorporated into the polypyrrole within the hydrogel network during electropolymerisation. Incorporation of polypyrrole into the hydrogel network did not significantly affect the physical properties such as equilibrium water content, de/rehydration behaviour and amount of bound water. Multifunctional polyelectrolytes based on 2 -acrylamido- 1 -methyl- 1 - propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), a polyelectrolyte with low critical solution temperature (LCST), and a polyelectrolyte containing carboxy groups, were synthesised and used as dopants during electropolymerisation of pyrrole. Polypyrrole doped with these polyelectrolytes was prepared potentiostactically and investigated using conventional EC methods. It was found that the chemical composition of the polyelectrolytes significantly affected the polymer formation. With higher AMPS ratio in the polyelectrolytes, deposition potentials decreased. Polypyrrole doped with these polyelectrolytes exhibited redox properties typical of polypyrrole and had high water content. The properties of the resultant polymer films did not vary significantly with temperature. Adhesion of the conducting polymer films to metal substrates was found to be dependant on the carboxy content of the polyelectrolyte. The production of conducting polymer within processable hydrogel blends for large scale coating operations was investigated in a qualitative manner. Firstly, a multiblock copolymer consisting of PEO (polyethylene oxide) and ε-caprolactone was synthesised for the preparation of soluble hydrogel/conducting polymer blends. Secondly, thermal crosslinking of a viscous mixture of poly(acrylic acid) and a glycol compound (2 ̆ 2 polyester hydrogel) 2 ̆ 2 containing polypyrrole colloids was carried out. Thirdly, simultaneous cathodic electropolymerisation of acrylamide and electrocoagulation of conducting polymer colloids was conducted to form a conducting polymer/hydrogel blend on the cathode surface. It was found that the concentration of conducting polymer in the hydrogels significantly affected the electrochemical and physical properties of the blends. An increased concentration of conducting polymer in the hydrogels resulted in good electroactivity and conductivity, but poor mechanical properties. A potential industrial application of the processable hydrogel and polypyrrole blends was investigated. The potentiodynamic technique was used to assess the corrosion protection capabilities of polymer coatings on aluminum. It was found that that the poly(acrylamide) hydrogel/PPy blend provided some corrosion resistance to aluminium. The level provided depended on the counterion used for the oxidation of polypyrrole.

In order to improve understanding of the corrosion and protection of such anodes, the effects of the concentrations of copper, sulphuric acid, cobalt, iron, manganese, chloride and an organic additive (guar) on the corrosion of lead have been studied by means of weight loss tests and surface analysis techniques (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy). The rate of corrosion of lead during current interruptions increases with increasing concentration of sulphuric acid and copper, whereas it decreases markedly in the presence of cobalt and iron and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of chloride and the organic additive.

40|$|Epoxy based {{conducting}} polymer coatings were prepared by using polyaniline (Pani), modified with lignosulfonate (LGS) dopant for the aircraft AA 2024 -T 3 alloy. High-strength, light-weight alloys such as AA 2024 -T 3 {{is widely used}} for the skin construction of an aircraft. This type of coating resulted in enhancement of conductivity upto 4. 88 S/cm compared to 10 - 8 S/cm for epoxy alone. However such a combination Pani-LGS loses its conductivity with time because {{of the loss of}} the dopant. Therefore, the Pani-LGS was further modified by grafting with another polymer i. e. poly(acrylamide co acrylic acid) which maintained the conductivity for longer duration by preventing the loss of dopant. The modification of Pani-LGS with poly (acrylamide co acrylic acid) exhibited conductivity of 3. 9 S/cm but maintains it for longer time and showed 1200 h salt spray test. The aim of the present work was to achieve conductivity of 5 - 10 S/cm and corrosion resistance equivalent to 2000 h salt spray pass for the coating and hence, further improvements were made with the addition of montomorillonite clay (MMT), aluminium oxide nanoparticles (Al 2 O 3) and graphene (G) to the coating. Other properties of these developed conducting coating, such as corrosion resistance, weathering resistance and mechanical properties were also studied. It was found that the modified coating system had better conductivity (8. 76 S/cm in case of graphene), corrosion resistance (2400 h salt spray passes) and enhanced mechanical properties.

40|$|Chromate {{compounds}} {{have been}} widely used to improve the corrosion protection of galvanised steel and aluminium objects in the past decades. The hexavalent chromium in chromate enhances the adherence of coatings to galvanised steel and aluminium. Additionally, if the passive layers on these materials should become damaged, hexavalent chromium supports the repair of these layers to restore passivity. The carcinogenic nature of hexavalent chromium has been well-known for many years, but it is still used because no viable alternatives are available. The mechanism of corrosion protection by hexavalent chromium is heavily researched, as is the development of less toxic alternative corrosion protective treatments. In the near future, the use of chromate will be restricted or even completely banned (chapter 1). As the improvements in corrosion resistance provided by chromate are still necessary, alternative treatments are called for. Solutions are being sought in, among others, the following areas: molybdate and cerate treatments, trivalent chromium compounds, silane coatings and conducting polymers. This thesis exclusively deals with conducting polymer coatings on steel substrates. In chapter 2 some background information on conducting polymers is provided, including the serendipitous discovery of the first of the conducting polymers (polyacetylene) in the 1970 s. Chapter 3 provides a theoretical treatment on semiconductor electrochemistry, which is a relevant topic as conducting polymers may possess semiconductive properties. The main difference between semiconducting and metal electrodes is the presence of a space charge layer in the former, which may dominate the electrochemical behaviour of the electrode under certain circumstances. The potential range in which semiconductive properties dominate this behaviour ismarked by the flatbandpotential. Chapter 4 deals with the production of conducting polypyrrole layers on steel substrates by electrochemical deposition. The method used is wellknown from literature, yet the steps involved in the reaction mechanism have not all been explained. By stressing that the desorption of ferrous oxalate must occur prior to the deposition of polypyrrole, this thesis contributes to the clarification of the reaction mechanism of polypyrrole electrodeposition. Chapter 4 also describes experiments to determine the polypyrrole layer thickness as a function of deposition time. Similar experiments have been performed to determine the influence of large (polymeric) anions on the obtained layer thickness. The chapter concludes with an analysis of semiconducting properties of polypyrrole layers on steel substrates. From this analysis, a flatband potential of approx. - 400 mVNHE is determined. As this potential marks the upper boundary of the range in which the space charge capacity influences the electrochemical behaviour of the electrode, it can be assumed that such influence is not observed in the potential range relevant to corrosion protection (- 400 to + 400 mVNHE). The electrochemistry of polypyrrole layers on steel is described in chapter 5. An overview of several possible mechanisms for corrosion protection of steel by conducting polymers is given. From this overview, it is observed that the mechanism most accepted in literature (<b>anodic</b> <b>protection)</b> requires some refinement. The Schottky barrier model proposed by Jain et al. is scarcely mentioned in literature, but section 5. 2 shows that a combination of this model with the <b>anodic</b> <b>protection</b> model yields an interesting perspective. The remainder of chapter 5 deals with experimental results obtained by open circuit potential monitoring and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Both single and dual layer configurations produced according to the description in chapter 4 were used to examine the influence of the polymeric anions in the dual layer configuration. It is shown that the presence of large anions in the dual layer systems effectively blocks the exchange of ions with the electrolyte solutions. In immersion experiments the time to failure of single layer systems is exceeded significantly by comparable dual layer samples, especially in chloriderich solutions. It is shown that in dual layer samples, the low frequency transport of charges is effectively blocked by the presence of large (polymeric) anions in the layer. In addition to this results, the impedance experiments reported in chapter 5 show that the development of a corrosion process underneath the coating can be detected before the coating physically fails. In other words, the developing corrosion process can be monitored well before it becomes exposed to the electrolyte solution. To date, this has not been reported in literature. Chapter 6 deals with the commercial development of a corrosion protective coating system based on conducting polymers. The poor processability of conducting polymers is circumvented by the used of core/shell latex systems. In such systems, on attempts to combine the processability of the soft core material with the functional properties (e. g. conduction) of the shell material. After several iterations to optimise the system, coatings were produced with satisfactory coating qualities. The experiments described in chapter 6 show that the corrosion protective properties of these coatings were mediocre at best, although many of them could protect the substrates until a defect in the coating occurred. The final chapter of this thesis summarises the conclusions drawn in the preceding chapters. In addition, the general discussion in this chapter links together some of the preceding chapters.

One approach makes use of highly resistant materials, and high thicknesses, redundancies and a program of maintenance are adopted. This requires large capital investments and it is the only feasible approach in situations of "absence of knowledge", where the main resources are materials and energy. The second approach relies on information, and the knowledge of a phenomenological model of the degradation related to historical data. Critical situations are avoided at the design stage in terms of both degradation and recovery, by using inexpensive materials and protecting them if necessary. It consists in scheduled inspection programs for driving the maintenance program and updating the phenomenological model. This way requires a rational use of the resource "information" but it can bring to significant savings of the "materials" and "energy" resources. During the installation phase, the mechanical deformations necessary to make connections, the welding and drilling operations may lead to changes in material microstructure, internal stresses and damage of the coatings. In the case of concrete the distribution of reinforcing bars can lead to an uneven compaction of the concrete, and the use of spacers may allow the use of the desired thickness of the concrete cover. The hydraulic test of the equipment is often made with untreated water that, if not carefully removed at the end, can lead to microbiological corrosion problems. In the start-up phase, and especially where the movement of fluids is markedly different from that during service life can lead to phenomena of sedimentation and localized corrosion. During the service life, the operating conditions may change both for the degradation of the plant itself and for modifications of the treated fluids, the environmental conditions, the operating targets, etc. During the plant shutdowns a problem that can arise is whether or not, and how, to empty the plant and the answer depends on the properties of the materials used. Several good practice rules can be adopted in the design stage. It is important to avoid water stagnation and infiltration by using correct geometries and drainages, and to prevent condensation, caused by thermal bridges and indoors environments. The crevices caused by welding spots and unwanted deposits must be avoided. As well as the percolation of a material on another in the case that the products of atmospheric corrosion of the first material can act as cathodic sites for the corrosion of the second one. Check the galvanic coupling between different materials and, if the coupling is unwanted, use insulating joints or materials with intermediate properties or interpose parts that are easily replaced. Avoid situations that make difficult the maintenance operations and the hydrodynamic conditions that can enhance corrosion phenomena. Consider the galvanic coupling between metallic materials placed in different environments...|$|E
40|$|Disk {{refining}} {{has become}} an increasingly important process for the manufacture of mechanical pulp {{for the production of}} newsprint and other "groundwood" speciality papers. The history of the development of chip refiners beginning with their use in pulp property modifications in the early 1900 's and their use for semichemical and mechanical pulping processes at present is briefly renewed. [...] Disk refining, as a pulping process, has in spite of its promise to replace chemical pulp not been without its technical difficulties; the major ones being the high energy inputs required as compared to stone groundwood, variations in quality and inadequate plate life. Each of the variables associated with these difficulties is reviewed in an extensive literature review. [...] Since refiner plate wear and refiner plate corrosion both involve loss of plate material and are critical factors in plate life, the review of literature was extended to cover these variables. Although literature on wear and corrosion of refiner plates is extensive, little was found directly pertaining to refiner plate life. Because of this deficiency of information in both these important areas, experimental work was conducted on both the wear and corrosion of Ni-hard refiner plates. [...] The wear of refiner plates run on a Sprout Waldron 42 - 1 B refiner at Price (Nfld.) Pulp and Paper Company Limited, Grand Falls, Newfoundland, was monitored using a systems analytical approach coupled with standard v metallurgical techniques. The refiner plates after use were found to have worn in sharply defined annular zones at randomly defined radii. In each zone the wear was asymmetrical, with one of the opposing plates wearing more than the other. The location of the wear zone and the disk experiencing wear (rotor or stator) were found to be random. [...] At first, it was believed that this unusual wear pattern was the result of plate clashing and/or damage by foreign material. Metallurgical and electrochemical studies of the plates within the framework of systems analysis clearly showed that this was not the case, and that the metal removal patterns observed were indicative of that produced by a process not dissimilar to electrochemical machining. [...] The corrosion characteristics of Ni-Hard plates were analyzed by potentiostatic polarization methods using an intact refiner plate as the working electrode. A potential was impressed upon this electrode causing it to corrode. The resultant current density as a function of applied potential was plotted giving a polarization curve for Ni-Hard. The procedure followed was based upon ASTM Standard Method G 5, modified such that an intact refiner plate could be used. No attempt was made to duplicate the temperature and consistency conditions in the refining zone of a commercial refiner because of the experimental difficulties involved and the fact that these conditions are still not well understood. In spite of this limitation, the results gave some interesting insights into the effect that additives have in extending refiner plate life. Results showed that corrosion rates were lower when dissolved oxygen was high, bringing into question the belief that the role played by Na₂SO₃ in enhancing refiner plate life is via a mechanism of oxygen scavenging. [...] The potential for extending refiner plate life by corrosion control techniques is discussed. These include: [...] 1 [...] control of O₂ content, [...] 2. alloying of plates, [...] 3. <b>anodic</b> <b>protection,</b> [...] 4. cathodic protection...|$|E
