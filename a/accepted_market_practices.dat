40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{speculative}} nature {{of the stock market}} in Romania, emphasizing the basic rules and risks associated with stock transactions. On the one hand, the speculative nature may be considered as a mandatory feature of the stock market, for the purposes of supporting a fair and efficient functioning stock system. On the other hand, the term "speculative" can be also interpreted in a negative direction, i. e. in combination with market manipulation or market abuse. Related to this latter interpretation, the study refers to European legislation on market abuse, <b>accepted</b> <b>market</b> <b>practices</b> and those that constitute market manipulation. capital market, market abuse, market manipulation, risk, speculation, stock market. ...|$|E
40|$|Updated May 2012 and reposted: In 2011, an EU {{legislative}} package on market abuse was proposed, which comprises {{two sets of}} documents: 1) a draft Regulation that will largely replace the existing Market Abuse Directive (MAD) and the level 2 measures; and a new Directive dealing with criminal sanctions. Market abuse rules are needed to ensure market integrity and investor confidence, and to allow companies to raise capital and contribute to economic growth, thereby increasing employment. This ECMI Policy Brief argues that rules on market abuse should be technically well designed, proportionate and crystal clear, but also subject to more efficient and harmonised supervision than before. The paper focuses particularly on the draft Regulation. The use of a regulation is welcome, as (in integrated financial markets) abuses should be regulated in a harmonised manner by member states, which {{has not always been}} the case, as the 2007 report from the European Securities Markets Expert (ESME) Group extensively demonstrated. At the same time, this paper criticises some of the provisions contained in the draft Regulation, notably the new notion of inside information not to abuse (Art. 6 (e)) and the unchanged definition of inside information for listed companies to disclose, and it proposes new definitions. The extension of disclosure obligations to issuers whose shares are traded on demand only on ‘listing’ multilateral trading facilities is also widely criticised. Other comments deal with the proposed rules on managers’ transactions, insiders’ lists and <b>accepted</b> <b>market</b> <b>practices...</b>|$|E

The model needs modifications for high-end consumer products, {{in which case}} relationship management is a factor. Services have some unique marketing issues to be factored into decision-making. Tactics for marketing industrial products should consider elements of long-term contractual agreements. Regardless of the modifications needed in some cases, the 4Ps remain a generally <b>accepted</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>practice</b> to influence buyers and its concepts still are espoused in contemporary textbooks. Further, the 4Ps marketing mix that McCarthy popularized has become a foundational and widely adopted marketing framework into the 21st century. This {{is partly due to}} the simplicity of the model, which makes it adaptable for changes in the marketing area, such as internet commerce. Rather than creating a new model, G.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{diversity}} of <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> across firms {{operating in the}} same market. It develops a novel conceptual framework, the Marketing Configurational Framework, and proposes a typology of Configurational Profiles of <b>Marketing</b> <b>Practices.</b> The literature review reveals a {{diversity of}} <b>marketing</b> <b>practices.</b> Mainstream <b>marketing</b> thinking adopts a contingency rationale to explain this plurality. However, several studies have contradicted the contingency hypothesis and invited further research to this issue. These observations form {{the background of the}} formulation of the central research question of this study. The thesis integrates theoretical insights from marketing, organisational theory and strategic management. The interdisciplinary approach allows identifying an alternative rationale for understanding diversity in <b>marketing</b> <b>practices,</b> the configurational approach. This perspective develops multivariate frameworks, adopts a holistic stance, proposes that key forces/imperatives form configurations and accepts diversity of configurational profiles in a given context. Diversity is limited by the coherency principle, i. e. only a few configurational profiles are viable. The literature review identifies three imperatives that interact to form viable configurational profiles of <b>marketing</b> <b>practices.</b> These are managers’ frame of reference, conceptualisation of the environment, and <b>marketing</b> <b>practice.</b> Each of the proposed configurational profile represents a different way of relating to the market. Two case studies are conducted adopting a mixed method approach. The findings from the case studies correspond with the conceptual framework and supply evidence of the existence of diverse, yet viable, configurational profiles in the same market. The value of this thesis is that the Marketing Configurational Framework and the Configurational Profiles of <b>Marketing</b> <b>Practices</b> <b>accept</b> diversity and suggest a rationale for understanding its occurrence. From the configurational perspective, the diversity of <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> is inter-related to the diversity found in the other two imperatives. Diversity is acknowledged, however, diverse <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> are viable only when they integrate a coherent configurational profile.

The objective was to investigate the mediating role of organizational justice between the internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> of businesses and the task and contextual performance of employees. A model was created to realize the objective. In this model, the perception of organizational justice was considered with distributive, procedural and interactional justice sub-dimensions and performance criteria were considered with contextual and task performance sub-dimensions. Data gathered from 157 service business employees were used to test the hypothesis. Initially, the effects of the internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> of businesses on employees perceptions of organizational justice were evaluated and meaningful effects were observed. In the second phase, the effects of internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> on task and contextual performance were evaluated and it was concluded that internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> had significant positive effects on employee performance. In the last phase of the study, the mediating role of organizational justice between internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> and employee performance was evaluated and it was observed that procedural and interactional justice had a mediating role between internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> and task performance and procedural justice had a mediating role between internal <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> and contextual performance.

This study not only evaluates the responsible variables for the unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> but also compare who is more responsible for these unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in Pakistan. This study also examines, who has initiated these unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in Pakistan and {{who is responsible for}} the continuation of these practices in Pakistan. In this study researcher focuses six variables that can be a major cause of unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in Pakistan i. e. Pharmaceutical marketing and Sales personnel, doctorsâ€™ community, retail and whole sales pharmacies, government and private hospitals personnel, government officials and patients or their attendantsâ€™. All these six variables have been taken and gathered the data through survey questionnaire, compile and analyze through Statistical tools like descriptive and inferential Statistics both and conclude the main cause of unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in Pakistan. In the under taken study four different hypotheses were developed and tested through Z and F test and also analyze the data through descriptive Statistics, for the descriptive Statistics four different parameters were developed and presented in the form of graphs and tables. The conclusion of the study was that initially pharmaceutical industry was responsible to introduce the unethical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> to their customers i. e. doctors community, and hospitals and later on unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> became the norm of the pharmaceutical industry. Now the doctors are the main cause or reason for the continuation of these unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in Pakistan. It is further concluded in the study that foreign visits are more common tools in order to get maximum output from the doctor community and now doctors have become more demanding and they ask themselves regarding the foreign and local tours and conferences. Cash incentive and home appliances are another form of unethical practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Clinic and home decoration are also the findings of unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in the under taken study. However, it is also found that some demands from the doctorsâ€™ community or the offers by the pharmaceutical companies are quite ethical genuine regarding the scientific meeting and local & international scientific conferences. It is further concluded that all the stakeholders are agreed that these unethical pharmaceutical <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> can be stopped. They are also agreed non-qualified doctorâ€™s practice should be eradicated. Pharmaceutical companies should strictly abide the rules and regulations, which are already mentioned and given in the pharmaceutical marketing code of ethics, at the same time Pakistan Medical Association and Pakistan Medical and Dental Association should restrict to the doctors community to practice in the limit of ethical and moral grounds.

Small firms typically possess certain characteristics, which serve to differentiate them from larger organizations. These characteristics include inherent weaknesses with respect to capitalization and <b>marketing</b> awareness and <b>practice.</b> Many observed problems stemmed from businesses failing to <b>practice</b> <b>marketing</b> or produce marketing strategy and plans.

40|$|The {{world of}} Marketing is a {{multifaceted}} broad discipline and over recent {{years it has}} fundamentally changed. Marketing is consistently evolving and many authors are calling for a new definition. A shift in thinking is {{necessary in order to}} identify new opportunities and re-examine the conventional models. The recent Contemporary <b>Marketing</b> <b>Practice</b> series of research has looked at describing <b>Marketing</b> <b>practices</b> within the <b>marketing</b> context. This programme analyses the multiple disciplines within marketing. It does not, however deconstruct or examine <b>marketing</b> <b>practices.</b> It merely examines the multiple marketing activities but does not consider practice theory. The social theory of practice provides an opportunity to examine Marketing using a ‘practice lens’. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to investigate <b>Marketing</b> <b>practices</b> using the theory of social practice. This theory defines practices as understanding, procedures and engagement and these three components have been applied to the marketing context. This research uses case study methodology in a large financial services organisation to explore <b>marketing</b> <b>practices</b> in more detail. This provides a deeper understanding of these components within the marketing department. It was found that the social theory of practice provides a rich exploration into the field of marketing highlighting a new way to describe <b>marketing.</b> The <b>practices</b> etymology and terminology have been explored using the anatomy of practices as defined by the social theory of practice to ensure construct validity and a common platform for academics and practitioners.
