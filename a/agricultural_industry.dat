A priority ranking {{was given to the}} key issues raised within industry groups at the interactive workshop. Knowledge gaps for major <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> were specifically listed to enable researchers and funding bodies alike to set future directions in sodicity research. A. Surapaneni, K.

5000|$|In 1931, as {{a result}} of the depression, the IWC’s {{leadership}} was questioned. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> were the ones with most women employment but they were also the hardest to regulate. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> gained exclusion from the eight-hour law because of their “volatility typical of agricultural commodities and seasonal labor.” [...] The IWC attempted to use various methods in attempting to regulate the <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries.</b> One method enforced by the IWC was the canning audit, which allowed businesses some freedom while protecting their worker’s interests and keeping regulatory costs to a bare minimum.|$|R

5|$|Most {{severely}} damaged was the <b>agricultural</b> <b>industry.</b> The worst loss in agriculture was from bananas and coconuts, of which about 75 {{percent of the}} crop was destroyed. Banana fields were completely destroyed, and in the southern portion of the island most coconut trees were blown down. Citrus trees fared better, due to the small yet sturdy nature of the trees. In addition, David's winds uprooted many trees {{on the tops of}} mountains, leaving them bare and damaging the ecosystem by disrupting the water levels.|$|E
5|$|Omak is {{a planned}} city. Throughout the 20th century, Ross {{designed}} {{what would become}} the city of Omak. Within a year of its establishment, the town had a central business district with a public bank and hotel supported by the local <b>agricultural</b> <b>industry.</b> The town was provided with a post office, previously known as Epley. Ross founded Omak School District in 1906; soon after this its first school, Omak Schoolhouse, was built. In 1910, a meat market, hardware shop, law office, stationery and confectionery store were constructed in Downtown Omak. A steel bridge built the following year collapsed into the Okanogan River upon initial use. It was quickly rebuilt with no further problems.|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} part of a project {{exploring}} the potential for new industries and enterprises to fill land-use opportunities in areas where current <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> may be strongly challenged by future climates. The specific aims were to identify the regions and industries where climate change will alter the current mix of <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries,</b> determine the plant traits required for successful new industries in future climates, and suggest new industries that meet these criteria. Climate change has the potential to substantially alter the mix of <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> across many regions of Australia because of increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns. These climatic changes will threaten the viability of some existing <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> and create opportunities for new industries that are better adapted to future climates. The importance of this report is that it brings together climate projections with an assessment of the vulnerability of existing <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries,</b> and suggests possible production opportunities. A number of opportunities for new industries are described, the plant traits necessary for productive crops in these conditions are discussed, and new industries options that fit these requirements are suggested. Six broad agricultural regions were identified that encompassed a range of climates and agricultural production systems across Australia: northern Australia, north eastern Australia, Murray-Darling basin, marginal cropping fringe of southern Australia, southern Australia high rainfall and western Australia high rainfall. A review of the literature on the impacts and adaptation options for mainstream <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> was conducted, and this information was combined with recent climate and future climate projections to determine the vulnerability of <b>agricultural</b> <b>industries</b> in each of the regions. For industries and regions identified as under particular threat from climate change, a suite of plant traits necessary for adaptation to new production opportunities was identified. Industry options suited to these regions were identified through a project workshop, searching the national and international literature, and using a plant modelling approach. Snow Barlow...|$|R
