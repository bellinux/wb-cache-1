For the sustainable development of the whole community GAIL is also supporting integrated livelihood programmes in villages especially for small and marginal farmers. This would be considered as a drop in the vast ocean but GAIL along with other Oil PSUs is contributing towards provision of LPG connections to BPL families under Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitrak Yojana.

In almost all studies except four [40, 48 – 50], reviewing and reconsidering previously set behavioural goals was included in {{the application}}.

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to gain insight into website use and to predict the surfing depth on <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> website and its effect on behaviour. Two hundred eight highly educated adults from the intervention condition of a randomised trial received access to a medical intervention, individual coaching (by e-mail, post, telephone or face-to-face) and <b>a</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> website. Website use (e. g. surfing depth, page view duration) was registered. Online questionnaires for physical activity and fat intake were filled out at baseline and after 6 months. Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict surfing depth and its effect on behaviour. Seventy-five per cent of the participants visited the website. Fifty-one and fifty-six per cent consulted the physical activity and fat intake feedback, respectively. The median surfing depth was 2. The total duration of interventions by e-mail predicted deeper surfing (beta= 0. 36; p< 0. 001). Surfing depth did not predict changes in fat intake (beta=- 0. 07; p= 0. 45) or physical activity (beta=- 0. 03; p= 0. 72). Consulting the physical activity feedback led to more physical activity (beta= 0. 23; p= 0. 01). The findings from the present study can be used to guide future website development and improve the information architecture of behaviour change websites...|$|E
