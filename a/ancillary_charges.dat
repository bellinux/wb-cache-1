40|$|The University of Rochester, Department of Surgery, in {{response}} to an experimental community-wide limit on hospital budgets, studied high-cost general surgical patients as a potential source of leverage for containment of hospital costs. It was found that a small number of patients impact significantly on hospital costs. In 1980, 3935 patients at Strong Memorial Hospital (SMH) had at least one contact with a general surgical patient care or intensive care unit; 261 patients (6. 6 %) had total 1980 charges of more than $ 20, 000 each. They contributed 32 % of the total of both general surgical charges and patient days. A subset of 2021 patients was selected to represent more precisely the general surgical patient. The 85 high-cost patients (4. 2 %) of this subset were chosen for intensive study. These patients generated a significant and disproportionate per cent of total (2021) general surgical charges (26. 8 %) and hospital days (27. 6 %). Average total charges were more than 8 times those of the complementary general surgical subset (1936). Nineteen of the 85 patients (22. 3 %) died in the hospital and 42 patients (49. 4 %) were dead within 2 1 / 2 years. Forty patients (of the 85) were then further identified as "complex", based on multiple, usually unrelated, illnesses and multiple annual admissions. Tending to be elderly with poor prognoses, 60 % of them had died by April 1983. The major criterion of complexity was the lack of a well-focused medical problem; the cure for one problem simply relinquished primacy to another. A parallel study of hospital ancillary procedures disclosed a similar high-cost pattern. Of approximately 4000 ancillary procedures, 100 (2. 5 %) had annual charges of $ 100, 000 or over, accounting for two-thirds of total 1980 <b>ancillary</b> <b>charges.</b> Roughly 20 % of a single patient's ordered procedures accounted for 80 % of the patient's <b>ancillary</b> <b>charges,</b> thus allowing concentrated study of {{a relatively small number of}} charges. Means for cost containment may be applied logically to the high-cost patient and particularly toward the complex patient. The complex patient is especially suited for consideration, since it is postulated that these patients are endemic to all general hospitals and to all clinical services. Strategies to be developed should include: 1) a managerial system in which physicians have an incentive to contain costs, 2) an online data system, 3) an accurate, efficient way to identify prospective high-cost and complex patients and, 4) awareness by physicians, patients, and society that less expensive modes of diagnosis and therapy are an appropriate response to rationed health resources...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{escalating}} {{health care}} costs have prompted legislators, third-party payers, and {{the public at large}} to demand health care reform and focus much of their attention on the largest component of health care expenditures, hospital care. One strategy used to stem inefficiencies in hospitals and to ensure their financial viability is to redesign/restructure the work or care delivery system. Nursing case management is one popular approach. The specific aims of this study were to: (1) describe a nursing case management care delivery system for medical-surgical patients, and (2) empirically test its effect on hospital output and costs. A multivariate matched sampling methodology, nearest available matching on the estimated propensity score, was used to secure 182 matched pairs from the case-managed and non-case-managed groups. An exact match was required on DRG. The additional matching variables were: age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, marital status, route of admission, day of admission, payer group, physician, nursing unit. For each patient in the matched pair, the following additional data were collected: presence of caregiver at home, ICU stay, ICU case management, discharge destination, severity of illness and nursing intensity. A stepwise multiple regression analysis of matched pair differences was used to control for non-matched covariates and to examine the differences in LOS and resource consumption (total cost, room and board costs, and ancillary costs) between the case-managed and non-case-managed groups. The results indicate nursing case management significantly increased length of stay (p-value =. 001). Differences in total costs were not significant (p-value =. 08).

40|$|This {{research}} {{has studied the}} low cost airline sector and whether the well established short haul airline model (1 - 2 hours flying time) operating in domestic and regional markets can be adapted for low cost, longhaul airline operations. The research to date in this area has been somewhat generalised and speculative. Whilst there is broad agreement that cost reduction strategies applied by short haul low cost airlines are not all transferable to longhaul airline operations given its different characteristics, researchers have stopped short of determining whether the low cost concept can achieve a cost advantage compared to full service airlines. For this research, "longhaul" means Australia to Europe in a market served by more than 12 airlines. More recently, Australia and the European Union have concluded an open skies agreement which creates a strategic window opportunity for new airline entrants. The Agreement applies only to airlines domiciled in Australia or the EU with a majority shareholding held in the country – or bloc (EU). However, as this research shows, a number of Asian and Gulf State airlines operates from Australia via their home hub point into the EU and carry what is termed "fifth freedom" traffic (the freedoms of the air is discussed in Chapter 2) thereby circumventing the above condition. The growth and presence of Gulf State airlines permitted access into Australia is described in chapter 5 as "the elephant in the room" meaning that the capacity granted by the Australian government has placed Australia's international airlines (Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin) under some pressure. Despite a move towards open skies in aviation markets, much of the industry remains highly regulated. Bilateral agreements between sovereign states still dictates much of international aviation in which government policymakers {{play a major role}} in the extent of regulation or opening routes and markets to greater competition. The underlying theory for this research is the strategic windows concept which belongs in the strategic management and strategic marketing literature. The literature tells us that strategic windows "open" (and close) according to a range of factors and that organisations need to scan and monitor the external environment to detect changes in market conditions that create new opportunities providing the organisation has the capabilities and resources to compete effectively. Strategic window opportunities in the airline industry arise from deregulation and liberalisation; new routes and new markets such as serving a tourist destination; airport development and incentives offered by airport companies to attract airlines; routes where full service airlines have withdrawn due to high costs or routes overlooked by full service airlines; new business models and new generation longhaul, fuel efficient aircraft. The low cost airline industry has been described in the literature in many ways – from a concept, a philosophy, a business model, evolution and revolution to a "simplified value proposition to a wider market potential". Most researchers agree that there are "core principals" that distinguish low cost airlines from full service airlines. The main difference is that low cost airlines have "unbundled" the product to its bare basics and charge passengers for an array of optional extras from using a check-in counter, to stowed baggage, food and beverages and inflight entertainment. On the one hand low cost airlines adopt cost reduction strategies and on the other hand enhance revenue from <b>ancillary</b> <b>charges</b> and strive to achieve high load factors in all one class seating configuration that has more seats than full service airlines. Longhaul, low cost is not a contemporary concept. It evolved from charter airlines that emerged post World War 2 predominantly in Europe and the late Sir Freddie Laker who first pioneered the "no frills" concept in the 1970 's carrying over 4 million passengers across the North Atlantic before the airline's collapse due to a number of factors that all conspired against the airline. Some three decades later further attempts by independent entrepreneurs to establish the longhaul, low cost concept in different markets have also failed, for example Oasis Airlines of Hong Kong which flew from Hong Kong to London Gatwick in what one aviation critic described as "wrong aircraft, wrong model, and wrong management". In contrast to the rich abundance of literature written on the short haul model, the concept of low cost, longhaul has received very little attention from academic researchers. This {{research has}} used the case study method which is suited to "a phenomena in the making" to gain novel and rich insights where the research is of a strategic, evaluative nature. This description was imminently suitable for the type of research investigated. Eisenhardt (1989) adds that case study research has legitimacy where there are situations where there are few theoretical foundations and exact measures for the key variables. The strength of the case study approach is that it enables one to capture reality in considerable detail; more than is possible with surveys, experiments or field studies. Two case studies on low cost airlines have been developed. Jetstar is a subsidiary airline of Qantas and has migrated from being a domestic airline to an international airline which has its different set of operating characteristics. Kuala Lumpur based Air Asia – now Asia's largest low cost airline and with reportedly the lowest unit cost as measured by cost per seat kilometre has transitioned from short haul to medium and longhaul operations. In contrast to Jetstar, Air Asia is an independent airline which has established franchise operations but more recently has concluded a share swap with government owned Malaysian Airlines. Both airlines have competitive advantages in their respective markets. The key findings from this research has determined that a longhaul, low cost airline entering the Australia-EU market could attain a minimum of 13 per cent cost saving (measured in terms of cost per available seat kilometre) compared to the lowest cost full service airline model (Emirates Air) and that a figure of 17 per cent differential is realistically attainable for a carrier such as Jetstar compared to its parent owner, Qantas operating between Australia and Europe. In order to build a longhaul low cost airline model a total of 20 different factors were examined and analysed – mainly operating characteristics and marketing issues. It was found that there are some important differences between short haul and longhaul, for example aircraft utilisation, airports required including major hubs, turnaround times, crew numbers and rest periods, the use of alliances, distribution and branding. Whilst some elements are transferable, others are not or would require some adaptation. The findings were verified by two external aviation sources and verified by comparing the cost differential established, vis. a vis longhaul versus shorthaul. One source observed that flight management is very critical for longhaul sectors because of its impact on fuel consumption, the highest airline expense cost. Two further analyses were undertaken to validate the findings. First, a comparison of the data between Qantas and Jetstar's operating cost on routes between Australia and Asia; and secondly, a comparison with modelling [g]undertaken by the Boeing Airplane Company. The findings from this research will develop a greater understanding of the commercial airline industry for future action on three levels. Firstly, an understanding of bilateral agreements that govern the operation of air services between countries and aviation policy settings and in particular where strategic window opportunities arise for new market entry. Secondly, a business model for longhaul low cost airline operations; and thirdly, markets where the carrierwithin- a-carrier strategy supported by strong financial parent owners could be deployed in which a low cost subsidiary operation complements a full service parent owner operation. The research has illustrated the difficulty for independent; longhaul low cost airlines to have sustainable business models and operate in markets where there are well established full service airlines. Finally, aviation research in the Asia-Pacific region is relatively in its infancy compared to the depth and scope of airline research conducted in Europe and North America. From an Australian perspective, international airline services are vitally important as links to the world for trade and tourism. If inbound tourism is to grow and prosper and draw tourists from distant markets, the concept of a low cost longhaul airline operating between Europe and Australia could potentially develop new market segments. There has been much change in the aviation landscape in recent years in the Asia Pacific region, identified by IATA as the world's fastest growing region for airline traffic. Therefore, this research provides invaluable insights and adds immeasurably to the body of airline literature from an Asia-Pacific perspective...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{businesses}} {{have started to}} charge fees for services that were previously provided for free (Fruchter, Gerstner and Dobson 2010). According to Morwitz et al. (2009, p. 6) partitioned pricing “is now being used in more situations, and in more sophisticated ways, than ever before. ” This paper investigates consumer perceptions of ancillary fees for people-processing services and the effect on negative emotions and behavioral outcomes. The airline industry, in particular, has attracted considerable attention in the media by effectively “unbundling” services in separate elements formerly included in airfares and instituting a panoply of ancillary fees (Vinod and Moore 2009). While airlines continue to “unbundle” services, consumer frustration has grown, as widely reported in the media, leading to various forms of retaliatory behavior. For instance, an online survey of 1, 396 travelers by the Consumer Travel Alliance (CTA), the Business Travel Coalition (BTC) and the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), customers have experienced widespread surprise and anger over airline fees for services such as telephone reservations, checked baggage, seating and priority boarding. Drawing on a sample of 464 business and leisure customers of a large travel agency, and building on a “perceived betrayal” theoretical model proposed by Grégroire and Fisher (2008), we demonstrate that ancillary fees lead to retaliatory behavior, e. g. vindictive complaining, negative word-of-mouth, and third party complaining for publicity. Although airlines {{are likely to continue}} the practice of <b>charging</b> <b>ancillary</b> fees, the results underscore the need to better understand passenger reactions and to improve communication when developing new types of ancillary services.

In addition, the system can be reconfigured into a compact mode by removing the clover detectors and re-arranging the 3 He tubes in order to maximize the neutron detection performance. Both operation modes shows a rather flat and high average efficiency. In summary, we have designed a system which shows an average efficiency for hybrid mode (3 He tubes + clovers) of 68. 6 % and 64 % for neutron energies up to 1 and 5 MeV, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and characterisation of lanthanide complexes of the macrocyclic ligand calix[2]phenylene[2]pyrrolide. The reactivity of these complexes is investigated and discussed. The reductive abilities of these complexes are tested through reaction {{with a series}} of pyridines and diazines. The flexibility and reactivity of the macrocyclic ligand is contrasted with a related, more rigid ligand. Chapter 1 establishes a background of the lanthanide metals and organolanthanide chemistry. Organolanthanide complexes of the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands are introduced. Non-cyclopentadienyl ligands are briefly discussed, with a focus on the use of calix[4]pyrrolide as a macrocyclic ligand. Modifications of the calix[4]pyrrolide ligand are introduced, with a focus on trans-N,N'-dimethyl-meso-octaethylcalix[4]pyrrolide and meso-octamethyl-calix[2]phenylene[2]pyrrolide. Chapter 2 discusses the preparation and characterisation of precursors, key reagents and benchmark lanthanide(II) and (III) reference complexes. Conformational characteristics of these complexes are compared, with a focus on detail of the solid state structures obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The contrasting structures of dilithiated calix[2]phenylene[2]pyrrole and an analogous potassium complex are described. Metathesis of the dilithiated macrocycle with samarium diiodide is shown to form complexes with samarium bound within the macrocyclic cavity. The effect of ancillary coordinated solvent molecules on the conformation of these complexes is investigated. The oxidation state of lanthanides in macrocyclic complexes is discussed. Unambiguous europium(II) and samarium(III) complexes are synthesised and characterised in order to identify whether conformational changes to the macrocycle indicate the oxidation state of the lanthanide metal centre. An interesting polymeric samarium complex free of ancillary ligands is described. Chapter 3 focuses on the preparation of a series of samarium calix[2]phenylene[2]pyrrolide complexes with pyridine and pyridine-based ligands. Where possible, analogous europium complexes are also described in order to compare their structural characteristics in the solid state. This investigation produced some unexpected results, such as an easily-reducible molecule observed acting as neutrally <b>charged</b> <b>ancillary</b> ligand. This Chapter covers the reactivity of selected pyridines, diazines, and sterically bulky linked- or fused-ring heterocyclic molecules with a samarium macrocyclic complex.
