25|$|Seedman {{established}} himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the detective commander for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he did not say that had been the reason for another 40 years.|$|E
2500|$|One of the <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> {{in which}} Lane {{did not support}} shorter {{sentences}} was rape. In 1982, Lane stated that sentences for rape should include immediate prison time, except in the most exceptional circumstances, which was taken as an implied rebuke for a Judge who had attracted controversy for fining a rapist £2,000 and saying that the victim was [...] "guilty of {{a great deal of}} contributory negligence". Lane made it clear he rejected the general concept that victims of rape could have given their attackers an excuse. Much later in his career, Lane was responsible for a judgment in the case of R v R which for the first time held that a husband could be guilty of raping his wife, overturning the irrebuttable presumption at common law that a wife consented to sex with her husband.|$|E

5000|$|Many victimless crimes begin {{because of}} a desire to obtain illegal {{products}} or services that are in high demand. Criminal penalties thus tend to limit the supply more than the demand, driving up the black-market price and creating monopoly profits for those criminals who remain in business. This [...] "crime tariff" [...] encourages the growth of sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups. Organized crime in turn tends to diversify into other <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> Large profits provide ample funds for bribery of public officials, as well as capital for diversification.|$|E
