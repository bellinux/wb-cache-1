Existing summarization methods {{enhance the}} visualization with blocked views, but have {{adverse effect on}} the latent influence structure. How can we visually summarize a large graph to maximize influence flows? In particular, how can we illustrate the impact of an individual node through the summarization? Can we maintain the appealing graph metaphor while preserving both the overall influence pattern <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> <b>readability?</b> To answer these questions, we first formally define the influence graph summarization problem. Second, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the new problem. Last, we report our experiment results. Evidences demonstrate that our framework can effectively approximate the proposed influence graph summarization objective while outperforming previous methods in a typical scenario of visually mining academic citation networks.

40|$|Visually mining a large {{influence}} graph {{is appealing}} yet challenging. People are amazed by pictures of newscasting graph on Twitter, engaged by hidden citation networks in academics, nevertheless often {{troubled by the}} unpleasant readability of the underlying visualization. Existing summarization methods enhance the graph visualization with blocked views, but have adverse effect on the latent influence structure. How can we visually summarize a large graph to maximize influence flows? In particular, how can we illustrate the impact of an individual node through the summarization? Can we maintain the appealing graph metaphor while preserving both the overall influence pattern <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> <b>readability?</b> To answer these questions, we first formally define the influence graph summarization problem. Second, we propose an end-to-end framework to solve the new problem. Our method can not only highlight the flow-based influence patterns in the visual summarization, but also inherently support rich graph attributes. Last, we present a theoretic analysis and report our experiment results. Both evidences demonstrate that our framework can effectively approximate the proposed influence graph summarization objective while outperforming previous methods in a typical scenario of visually mining academic citation networks.

40|$|Visually {{analyzing}} citation networks {{poses challenges}} to many {{fields of the}} data mining research. How can we summarize a large citation graph according to the user's interest? In particular, how can we illustrate {{the impact of a}} highly influential paper through the summarization? Can we maintain the sensory node-link graph structure while revealing the flow-based influence patterns <b>and</b> preserving a <b>fine</b> <b>readability?</b> The state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms can detect the most influential node in a citation network, but fail to summarize a graph structure to account for its influence. On the other hand, existing graph summarization methods fold large graphs into clustered views, but can not reveal the hidden influence patterns underneath the citation network. In this paper, we first formally define the Influence Graph Summarization problem on citation networks. Second, we propose a matrix decomposition based algorithm pipeline to solve the IGS problem. Our method can not only highlight the flow-based influence patterns, but also easily extend to support the rich attribute information. A prototype system called VEGAS implementing this pipeline is also developed. Third, we present a theoretical analysis on our main algorithm, which is equivalent to the kernel k-mean clustering. It can be proved that the matrix decomposition based algorithm can approximate the objective of the proposed IGS problem. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments with real-world citation networks to compare the proposed algorithm with classical graph summarization methods. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous ones in optimizing both the quantitative IGS objective {{and the quality of the}} visual summarizations.
