25|$|The 160 and 165 are {{the current}} entry level {{offering}} from Caterham; the 160 {{is for the}} United Kingdom while the 165 is intended {{for sale in the}} European Union. It is only available with the S3 chassis, doors and windscreen as standard. There is a list of optional extras such as carpets, spare wheel, weather package and heater. It is powered by a turbocharged Suzuki 660cc kei car K6A engine producing 80 horsepower. Price starts at £14,999 in semi-kit form. This model, with its skinnier tyres and Suzuki driveshafts, is actually compact enough to be classified as a kei car in Japan, except for its power which is above the 64PS limit enforced for the class. The car's gearbox and live rear axle is also supplied by Suzuki; this is the first Caterham with a live rear axle since the supply of Morris Marina rears dried up after the Seven Beaulieu ended production in 2003. The car received a large amount of publicity for a low-powered entry-level model, with Suzuki even displaying it at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show.

30|$|These {{findings}} {{are in line}} with Almeida and Carneiro (2012). There, the authors find that, in a response to a rise in labor inspections, there is also an increase in formal employment, together with a decrease in informal employment, a rise in non-employment, a decline in wages {{at the top of the}} formal wage distribution, and an increase in informal wages. Their argument is that as inspectors started enforcing compliance with mandated benefits, formal workers pay for more generous mandated benefits by receiving lower wages. The value that workers place on these benefits is potentially higher than their cost to employers because they are untaxed. In addition, wage rigidity (e.g., through minimum wages) prevents downward adjustment at the bottom of the wage distribution. This causes formal sector jobs at the bottom of the wage distribution, to become more attractive to informal workers, leading them to switch to the formal sector. In the process, wages in the informal sector <b>adjust</b> <b>upwards.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} concept of vector {{autoregression}} (VAR) and cointegration using a bivariate model of global oil prices and headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) in South Africa. The study aims {{to determine how much}} of inflation is driven by oil prices. Particular attention is paid to the theoretical underpinnings of cointergration analysis and the application of STATA software to undertake such analysis and perform test statistics. This study has observed that global oil prices are one of the key drivers of inflation in South Africa. Further, the estimate of the coefficient for the CPI show that when the price of oil is high, the consumer price index slowly <b>adjusts</b> <b>upwards</b> to match the oil prices, while the oil price attempts to adjust down, probably due to high commodity prices and reduced consumer demand, leading to reduced demand for oil. Increase in oil prices in South Africa is associated with higher inflation compared to other countries. This is not surprising since South Africa is an oil importing country and has limited policy control over oil prices...|$|R

40|$|Anchoring is a {{judgmental}} {{bias that}} final judgments are assimilated toward {{the starting point}} of the judge's deliberations. The anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic holds that anchoring bias is caused by insufficient adjustment. With the manipulation of some subjective factors, previous research found that anchoring is an effortful process. However, there is little evidence supporting that the effortful process is an adjustment process. In the present work, number accuracy was introduced as an objective factor which involves in an adjustment process. An event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment on young normal subjects examined the impact of number accuracy on anchoring processes responding to anchors which were generated by subjects themselves. A dot-image paradigm was firstly employed to explore anchoring effects. Behavioral results found less accurate anchors which determined a coarser mental scale diminished the anchoring biases responding to self-generated anchors. A positive deflection at 250 - 800 ms after target onset can be taken as a direct electrophysiological evidence of the adjustment process, whose amplitude was more positive on more accurate anchors condition.
