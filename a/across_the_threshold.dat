Several factors affect the Fundy tides {{including}} water depth and the shape of the coastline. Both contribute to a natural Fundy tidal oscillation, or flow of water back and forth, of about half a day, almost matching the half-day tidal cycle of the outside North Atlantic. This matching tidal cycle amplifies Fundy's tidal range as water flows in and out of the Bay <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of the Gulf of Maine.|$|E

40|$|Thresholds in {{transmission}} {{are responsible}} for critical changes in infectious disease epidemiology. <b>The</b> epidemic <b>threshold</b> indicates whether infection invades a totally susceptible population. <b>The</b> reinfection <b>threshold</b> indicates whether self-sustained transmission occurs in a population that has developed a degree of partial immunity to the pathogen (by previous infection or vaccination). In models that combine susceptible and partially immune individuals, <b>the</b> reinfection <b>threshold</b> is technically not a bifurcation of equilibria as correctly pointed out by Breban and Blower. However, we show that a branch of equilibria to a reinfection submodel bifurcates from the disease-free equilibrium as transmission crosses this <b>threshold.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> full model indicates that levels of infection increase by two orders of magnitude {{and the effect of}} mass vaccination becomes negligible as transmission increases <b>across</b> <b>the</b> reinfection <b>threshold.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface water and deeper water (down to 100 meters or more) are mixed during winter because of the steady cooling of the surface and wind. In the deep fjords there is still fresh water from the summer with less density than the saltier water along the coast.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{properties}} of an N-site tight-binding ring with parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetric, Hermitian, site-dependent tunneling {{and a pair of}} non-Hermitian, PT-symmetric, loss and gain impurities ±iγ. The properties of such lattices with open boundary conditions have been intensely explored over the past two years. We numerically investigate the PT-symmetric phase in a ring with a position-dependent tunneling function tα(k) = [k(N − k) ]α/ 2 that, in an open lattice, leads to a strengthened PT-symmetric phase, and study the evolution of the PT-symmetric phase from the open chain to a ring. We show that, generally, periodic boundary conditions weaken the PT-symmetric phase, although for experimentally relevant lattice sizes N ∼ 50, it remains easily accessible. We show that the chirality, quantified by the (magnitude of the) average transverse momentum of a wave packet, shows a maximum at <b>the</b> PT-symmetric <b>threshold.</b> Our results show that although the wavepacket intensity increases monotonically <b>across</b> <b>the</b> PT-breaking <b>threshold,</b> <b>the</b> average momentum decays monotonically on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>threshold.</b> 1...|$|R
