25|$|On May 22, 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} it is {{constitutional}} to impose {{the death penalty for}} rape if the victim is a child. Ruling on an <b>appeal</b> <b>brought</b> in the case of defendant Patrick Kennedy, Justice Jeffrey Victory wrote for the court that the Louisiana law allowing the imposition of the death penalty under those circumstances was consistent with Coker because an aggravating circumstance, the age of the victim, justified the death penalty.|$|E

60|$|Cynthia {{scarcely}} {{heard her}} at first. She {{was thinking of}} Coniston mountain, and how the sun had just set behind it. The mountain would be ultramarine against the white fields, and the snow on the hill pastures to the east stained red as with wine. What would she not have given to be going back to-morrow--yes, with Bob. She confessed--though startled by the very boldness of the thought--that {{she would like to}} be going there with Bob. Susan's <b>appeal</b> <b>brought</b> her back to Boston and the gas-lit parlor.|$|E

Annulments were more likely where the ‘private investor test’ was raised as a ground. On appeal, selectivity-related issues are prominent; first instance judgments were rarely set aside...|$|R

50|$|The <b>appeal</b> <b>brought</b> {{attention}} to the abuses and inequities of slavery {{and the role of}} individuals to act responsibly for racial equality, according to religious and political tenets.

50|$|Berry was an {{appointed}} {{member of the}} Legislative Council from 1829 to 1861. He was a conservative, opposing moves towards democracy, and local government.

50|$|Eisenhower, a {{war hero}} and {{moderate}} Republican who had pledged to maintain popular New Deal Democratic policies, had wide appeal {{beyond the boundaries of}} the traditional Republican coalition.

5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} <b>appeals</b> <b>brought</b> by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|R
5000|$|Within the Justice Department, the Solicitor General exerts {{significant}} influence on all <b>appeals</b> <b>brought</b> by the department. The Solicitor General is the only U.S. officer that is statutorily required to be [...] "learned in law." [...] Whenever the DOJ wins at the trial stage and the losing party appeals, the concerned division of the DOJ responds automatically and proceeds to defend the ruling in the appellate process. However, if the DOJ is the losing party at the trial stage, an appeal can only be brought {{with the permission of}} the Solicitor General. For example, should the tort division lose a jury trial in federal district court, that ruling cannot be appealed by the Appellate Office without the approval of the Solicitor General.|$|R
5|$|The Italian Jewish <b>appeals</b> <b>brought</b> the {{attention}} of Sir Moses Montefiore, {{the president of the}} Board of Deputies of British Jews, whose willingness to travel great distances to help his co-religionists—as he had over the Damascus blood libel of 1840, for example—was already well known. From August to December 1858 he headed a special British committee on Mortara that relayed reports from Piedmont to British newspapers and Catholic clergymen, and happily noted the support expressed by British Protestants, particularly the Evangelical Alliance led by Sir Culling Eardley. After unsuccessfully attempting to have the British government lodge an official protest with the Vatican, Montefiore resolved to personally travel to Rome to present a petition to the Pope calling for Edgardo to be returned to his parents. He arrived in Rome on 5 April 1859.|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later the Government {{announced}} that it would appeal the judgement.

The government accepted the ruling and paid the compensation.|$|E

50|$|Charles T. Wells (born March 4, 1939) was {{a member}} of the Florida Supreme Court from 1994 until March 3, 2009, when he retired. He was {{appointed}} by Governor Lawton Chiles.

He is perhaps most noted for presiding over <b>appeals</b> <b>brought</b> to the Court as part of the dispute over Florida's electoral votes in the U.S. presidential election, 2000, which were broadcast live to a worldwide audience. Wells dissented from the majority opinion that ordered a recount to decide the presidential election. He is the author of Inside Bush v. Gore, which was released in April 2013, which is the first book to be published by one of the judges at the center of the Bush v. Gore controversy.|$|R
