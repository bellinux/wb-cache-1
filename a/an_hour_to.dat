Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language.

5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the first hour of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E
5|$|Jardine's batting {{performance}} in 1928 {{was similar to}} that from the previous season. He played 14 matches, scoring 1,133 runs at an average of 87.15. He was successful in high-profile matches, scoring 193 for Gentlemen at the Oval, where the crowd had booed his slow start (at one stage, he took half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> score two runs) but later cheered him as his last fifty runs were scored in half an hour. For the same team at Lord's, he scored 86 and 40. He captained The Rest against England in a Test trial and made the highest score in each innings, scoring 74 not out in the fourth innings to help his team to draw the game on a difficult pitch, against international bowlers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.|$|E

King George V {{was represented by}} Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13km) journey to the cemeteries, {{it was estimated that}} 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.|$|E

He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.|$|E
5|$|Ring was {{overlooked}} for the Second Test at Lord's as Bradman {{retained the}} same XI, despite the incumbent spinner Johnson managing only 1/85 in the First Test. Australia won convincingly by 409runs. The next match was against Surrey, starting {{the day after}} the finish of the Test. Ring took 3/51 from 21.2 overs in the first innings, leading the way in terms of wickets and overs; most of the Test bowlers were given a light workload. He then contributed an unbeaten 15 in Australia's first innings of 389. After Australia took a first innings lead of 168, Ring bowled another 24 overs in the second innings and took 1/54. He twice dismissed Jack Parker, who had top-scored in each innings with 76 and 81. Australia then chased down the 122runs for victory in less than <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>to</b> complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. As the Test players were tired, Bradman gave them a lighter {{workload}} and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain Laurie Fishlock and Eric Bedser to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so {{he was not able to}} bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a duck, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E
5|$|Weyland is {{the billionaire}} founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Lindelof {{described}} him as having a massive ego and suffering from a god complex. Applying the necessary prosthetics and make-up to transform Pearce into the aging Weyland took five hours, and <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> remove it. Pearce observed elderly individuals to gain insight into the movement for his character, as he found replicating the impeded physical movement {{the most difficult part}} of the role. Max von Sydow was Scott's original choice to play Weyland, but the casting of Pearce made it possible for him to portray Weyland as both an elderly character, and a younger man who appeared in an earlier script draft.|$|E
5|$|While the Japanese {{were able}} to launch 108 {{aircraft}} in just seven minutes, it took Enterprise and Hornet over <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> launch 117. Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the enemy {{as soon as possible}} was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that he would find Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Brodie and Hall {{opened the}} Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 {{in ten minutes}} before Brodie was caught at long off by Tabart and was {{replaced}} by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Phillpot was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Roger Phillpot, who scored just a single, was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.|$|E
5|$|During an altercation on {{a crowded}} subway platform, John Lange (Vincent D'Onofrio) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and {{the edge of the}} platform.

Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>to</b> live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (Bruce MacVittie), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.|$|E
