It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perfect for it".|$|E
500|$|HIStorys {{music videos}} {{displayed}} different themes and elements, {{while some of}} them encouraged awareness of poverty and had {{a positive effect on}} their shooting locations. The promo for [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] was directed by Spike Lee; Jackson said that Lee chose to direct the video because the song [...] "has an edge, and Spike Lee had approached me. It's a public awareness song and that's what he is all about. It's a protest kind of song... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perfect for it". Jackson also collaborated with 200 members of the cultural group Olodum, who played music in the video. The resulting media interest exposed Olodum to 140 countries, bringing them worldwide fame and increasing their status in Brazil. Lúcia Nagib, of The New Brazilian Cinema, said of the music video: ...|$|E
2500|$|British prime {{minister}} Theresa May {{said that the}} foreign minister's comments did not represent the government's view. Other Conservatives however defended Johnson. Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson said: [...] "I think Boris Johnson was absolutely right about {{what he said about}} proxy wars and about Iran. And I agree with his analysis. Now, that might not be the position of the UK Government but guess what - I am not in the UK Government <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right." [...] Later that month, Johnson visited Bahrain, met Saudi leaders and praised Saudi Arabia, saying it was [...] "securing itself from bombardment by the Hootis" [...] in Yemen.|$|E
5000|$|... “… it {{was also}} true {{that he could have}} been better known and many people were aware of this. It was not in his nature to seek the limelight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needed the peace and quiet which allowed him to produce the wonderful, {{sensitive}} and ‘innocent’ works which he did. Over exposure would have destroyed his talent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knew it” ...|$|R
5000|$|While Yuan Zai is careless, he {{made peace}} among the {{internal}} eunuchs) and external officials, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{is a good}} subject.|$|R
60|$|SMITH. The {{benefit of}} the doubt. Even your master, the {{petroleum}} millionaire, {{has a right to}} that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needs it more.|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there. He went through the process with us, and now he's like a brother. He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, {{and that was the}} one thing that we consciously decided. For this record we wanted to go out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN dogged {{them all}} day, without asking their leaves; For his {{sergeant}} he told, aside, That JIMMY and JANE were notorious thieves (<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> justified).|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Frank, [...] "that is, I saw {{him coming}} and {{kept out of}} the way. He walked close by me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{carrying}} a spade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means. But {{you know}} he has a roving disposition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has a sort of fondness for Jackson--the boss of the ranch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I don't--but for Manfredi's sake, of course, I do. But for his sake {{more than}} my own, <b>I</b> admit. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> knows it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That {{would be}} delightful,' said Clem. 'Mr. Charles Tudor does come in {{sometimes}} at twelve o'clock, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> does it almost {{as well as}} Victoire.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. While I {{was busy}} baiting the sea-birds the mutineers were {{catching}} them, {{and of a}} surety they must have caught some that had eaten of my various poisons.|$|E
6000|$|Deringham nodded. [...] "Still, he {{had some}} provocation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right. So far as I could follow the discussion, the other man meant to {{question}} his ability to dismiss him, with the pistol." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{agreed that}} the {{arrangement}} {{was a very good}} one; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to ask some questions in regard to my nun, but I began my recital, and cut off any further conversation on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is obvious}} that <b>he</b> has tact, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has feeling," [...] said Father Agustin. [...] "But has he not some news for us, perhaps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} doing a little figuring, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can count on at least thirty-one votes. But I am not so sure of the other eleven." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{screened}} for Bob Evans at Paramount <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> locked {{it up in}} chains," [...] said Reynolds years later. [...] "It's never been heard from since." ...|$|R
6000|$|Once more Hank Stiger {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "I {{think he got}} afraid and went to Mexico. A good many people around Gonzales do not like him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> afraid I would expose him," [...] he ventured.|$|E
6000|$|At midnight they returned, {{announcing that}} they were [...] "highly respectable gondoliers," [...] and that oysters and stout were what they chiefly needed. The eminent novelist was still with them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> calling them by their shorter names. I am certain {{that he said he}} had been moving in worlds not realised, and that they had shown him the Empire in a new light.|$|E
6000|$|I {{never saw}} little Fyne less solemn. He hissed {{through his teeth}} in {{unexpectedly}} figurative style {{that it would take}} a lot to persuade him to [...] "push under the head of a poor devil of a girl quite sufficiently plucky"--and snorted. He was still gazing at the distant quarry, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> affected by that sight. I assured him that I was far from advising him to do anything so cruel. I am convinced he had always doubted the soundness of my principles, because he turned on me swiftly as though he had been on the watch for a lapse from the straight path.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then good night, monsieur. May {{the good}} God bless you and aid you to-morrow, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will! <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> {{you are the}} bravest man I ever met." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in another}} interview, Adams did clarify {{that he did}} not dislike Williams, stating [...] "I think Robin himself is compassion, {{generosity}} <b>and</b> funny. <b>I</b> like to <b>think</b> that that's who <b>I</b> am, <b>and</b> so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was the only actor I wanted to play me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> did a fabulous job." [...] Williams also had actively supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for several years.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it," [...] {{said the}} other, warmly; [...] "he is a good man, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has brains that you can count on. Is it all settled?" ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{not even}} good-looking; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the Commissariat or Transport. But, {{in spite of all}} these things, she loved him very madly; and {{there was some sort of}} an {{engagement}} between the two when Schreiderling appeared and told Mrs. Gaurey that he wished to marry her daughter. Then the other engagement was broken off--washed away by Mrs. Gaurey's tears, for that lady governed her house by weeping over disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received in her old age. The daughter did not take after her mother. She never cried. Not even at the wedding.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, {{my uncle}} {{knew very well}} {{that there was some}} mystery in the matter, and that {{everything}} had passed exactly as he used to relate it. He remained staunch to the great oath he had sworn to the beautiful young lady, refusing several eligible landladies on her account, and dying a bachelor at last. He always said what a curious thing it was that he should have found out, by such a mere accident as his clambering over the palings, that the ghosts of mail-coaches and horses, guards, coachmen, and passengers, were in the habit of making journeys regularly every night. He used to add, that he believed he was the only living person who had ever been taken as a passenger on one of these excursions. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right, gentlemen--at least I never heard of any other.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was good}} company {{when he was}} awake. He was refined, sensitive, charming, gentle, generous, honest himself and unsuspicious of other people's honesty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the purest male I have known, in mind and speech. George Dolby was {{something}} of a contrast to him, but the two were very friendly and sociable together, nevertheless. Dolby was large and ruddy, full of life and strength and spirits, a tireless and energetic talker, and always overflowing with good-nature and bursting with jollity. It was a choice and satisfactory menagerie, this pensive poet and this gladsome gorilla. An indelicate story was a sharp distress to Stoddard; Dolby told him twenty-five a day. Dolby always came home with us after the lecture, and entertained Stoddard till midnight. Me too. After he left, I walked the floor and talked, and Stoddard went to sleep on the sofa. I hired him for company.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so, but I don't see any one. Come on, but don't {{make any}} noise, {{or he may}} run away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> ought to be {{captured}} and locked up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} give him such good advice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has taken it," [...] said Mrs. Jo, smiling, as the bee spread his dusty wings and flew away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{the head}} of the house and claim my right," [...] he said and kissed her. [...] "Some day Jim will take my place <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will fill it well." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had to go}} quite {{outside of}} the station grounds to get a cab for our hotel, but from this blow to our dignity I {{recovered}} {{a little later in}} the day, when the king, attended by as small a troop of cavalry as I suppose a king ever has with him, came driving by in the street where I was walking. As he sat in his open carriage he looked very amiable, and handsomer than most of the pictures make him. He seemed to be gazing at me, and when he bowed I could do no less than return his salutation. As I glanced round to see if people near me were impressed by our exchange of civilities, I perceived an elderly officer next me. He was smiling as I was, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the delusion that the king's bow, which I had so promptly returned, was intended for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, out he went prospecting, before he'd been in {{the country}} twenty-four hours, {{and he came back}} quite cheerful. Then he spoke to Cathcart about {{starting}} work, and Cathcart was a perfect beast. He as good as told him that he'd come out under false pretences, that the whole affair was a swindle and that the road could not be made. Trent didn't hesitate, I can tell you. There were no arguments or promises with him. He chucked Cathcart on the spot, turned him out of the place, and swore he'd make the road himself. I asked if I might stop, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> glad, anyhow we've been ever such pals ever since, and I never expect to have such a time again as long as I live! But do you know, Auntie, we've about made that road. When I see what we've done, sometimes I can't believe it. I only wish some of the bigwigs who've never been out of an office could see it. I know I'll hate to come away.|$|E
60|$|Understand, I do {{not blame}} Schriederling. He {{was a good}} husband {{according}} to his lights, and his temper only failed {{him when he was}} being nursed. Which was some seventeen days in each month. He was almost generous to his wife about money matters, and that, for him, was a concession. Still Mrs. Schreiderling was not happy. They married her when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart to another man. I have forgotten his name, but we will call him the Other Man. He had no money and no prospects. He was not even good-looking; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in the Commissariat or Transport. But, in spite of all these things, she loved him very madly; and {{there was some sort of}} an engagement between the two when Schreiderling appeared and told Mrs. Gaurey that he wished to marry her daughter. Then the other engagement was broken off--washed away by Mrs. Gaurey's tears, for that lady governed her house by weeping over disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received in her old age. The daughter did not take after her mother. She never cried. Not even at the wedding.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she said, [...] "if {{you have}} it to spare, give the schimmel yonder a drink of that stuff, for he has saved all your lives <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> needs it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know," [...] said Jimmy {{with some}} surprise. [...] "Bob claimed he hadn't a gun <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had not. Sometimes I'm puzzled, but <b>I</b> really <b>think</b> the unlucky shot was mine." ...|$|R
50|$|He had a gay, lively, {{bubbling}} spirit: he {{was ready}} for every prank: he survives in my memory as a natural actor; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could also, on occasion, produce a merry poem.|$|R
