5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word elf {{began to be}} used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature,</b> at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E
5|$|The Moon {{has been}} the subject of many works of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> and the {{inspiration}} for countless others. It is a motif in the visual arts, the performing arts, poetry, prose and music.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It caused a fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature,</b> and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} centuries, rolls of arms {{included}} invented arms for kings of foreign lands (Neubecker, 30). Around 1310, Jacques de Longuyon wrote the Voeux de Paon ("Vows of the Peacock"), {{which included a}} list of nine famous leaders. This list, divided into three groups of three, became known in <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, was assigned a gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E
5|$|Gerðr has {{inspired}} works of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote {{a series of}} poems referencing Gerðr as collected in (1819) Nordens Guder. Esaias Tegnér's (1782–1846) unfinished epic poem Gerda also references the goddess. K. Ehrenberg depicted the goddess in his illustration (1883) Freyr und Gerda, Skade und Niurd. Her story was retold in free verse by the Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný in her Blóðhófnir, which won the 2010 Icelandic Literature Award.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature,</b> from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years at Lancing, Waugh {{achieved}} success as a house captain, editor of the school magazine {{and president of the}} debating society, and won numerous <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing about around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College, Oxford, and left Lancing in December 1921.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{prosperity}} and cultural life, the Komnenian period {{was one of}} the peaks in Byzantine history, and Constantinople remained the leading city of the Christian world in size, wealth, and culture. There was a renewed interest in classical Greek philosophy, as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular Greek. Byzantine <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> held a pre-eminent place in Europe, and the cultural impact of Byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long lasting significance.|$|E
5|$|It is salient to {{note that}} in {{taxonomy}} and binomial nomenclature, the genus name of the martins (the larger-bodied among swallow genera) is Progne, a Latinized form of Procne. Other related genera named after the myth include the Crag Martins Ptyonoprogne, and Saw-wings Psalidoprocne. Coincidentally, {{although most of the}} depictions of the nightingale and its song in <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> are of female nightingales, the female of the species does not sing—it is the male of the species who sings its characteristic song.|$|E

It will not only benefit industry workers to check the index, but will also further design and plan the e-learning curricula related to <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> culture. Under the Plan, there are five sub-plans, which includes; 1) set up of related curricula and e-learning contents in conjunction with related national plan; 2) integration of <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> cultural information, enhancement and development of contents standards for <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> culture through e-learning; 3) development of design for multimedia e-learning databank, inquiry interface and indexing system; 4) promotion of digitalization of <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> learning information, <b>and</b> holding of seminars on intellectual property right related to e-learning; and 5) setup of e-learning databank, compile and add-value to the related original information for subsequent exhibitions and the basis for collection of information. By using the above-mentioned information on <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts,</b> design various e-learning classrooms for <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>arts</b> training of interdisciplinary specialists good at both <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> The courseware for <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> is divided into basic promotion and advanced stage {{to meet the requirements}} of <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature</b> professionals with different background.

5|$|Milo's legendary {{strength}} and death {{have become the}} subjects of modern <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> His death was a popular subject in 18th-century art. In many images of this period his killer is portrayed as a lion rather than wolves. In Pierre Puget's sculpture Milo of Croton (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.|$|E
5|$|Some notable {{feats of}} {{problem-solving}} {{provide evidence that}} the common raven is unusually intelligent. Over the centuries, {{it has been the}} subject of mythology, folklore, <b>art,</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god.|$|E

Gray Lectures, editing and annotating them as Plants and Plant Lore in Ancient Greece (1990). In 1993, he and Eldwyth Ruth Stearn translated and expanded Baumann's Die griechische Pflanzenwelt in Mythos, Kunst und Literatur (1986) as The Greek Plant World in Myth, <b>Art,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Literature.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU {{continued}} its battle against censorship of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> In 1948, the New York affiliate of the ACLU received mixed {{results from the}} Supreme Court, winning the appeal of Carl Jacob Kunz, who was convicted for speaking without a police permit, but losing the appeal of Irving Feiner who was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace, based on his oration denouncing president Truman and the American Legion. The ACLU lost the case of Joseph Beahharnais, who was arrested for group libel when he distributed literature impugning the character of African Americans.|$|E

5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical {{in his introduction to}} his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin had a {{taste for}} culture, {{including}} music, <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> He was a familiar figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His {{concern for the environment}} was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen skier and an accomplished sailor. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the Paris Review, which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the Review awards the Aga Khan Prize for Fiction (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.|$|E
5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade {{was founded}} in 1787. The next year Parliament passed the first law {{regulating}} the slave trade, {{to limit the number}} of slaves per ship. Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of <b>art</b> <b>and</b> <b>literature.</b> It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the African slave trade. A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E
