The present study examines whether counterexplaining inaccurate judgments will increase fraud detection rates and whether <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> can counterexplain more effectively compared to individual auditors. The possible negative effect of counterexplanation is examined by requiring <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> and individual auditors to counterexplain accurate judgments. The purpose of this 2 ̆ 7 inanipulatiori is to determine whether counterexplaining accurate judgments will lead to negative belief revision, and whether this negative belief revision will be mitigated by the use of <b>audit</b> <b>groups.</b> A 2 x 2 x 2 experiment which examined groups/individuals, initial judgment and explanation/ counterexplanation was carried out.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{methods have}} been used to {{determine}} the prevalence and treatment of diabetes. Despite the large number of studies, previous estimations of prevalence and treatment have been carried out on relatively small numbers of patients, and then in only a few practices in single geographical regions. AIM: To investigate the feasibility of collating data from multi-practice audits organized by primary care <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in order to estimate the prevalence and treatment of patients with known diabetes, and to discuss the methodological issues and reasons for variation. METHOD: A postal questionnaire survey of all primary care <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in England and Wales that had conducted a multi-practice audit of diabetes between 1993 - 1995. Prevalence rates and patterns of diabetic care were compared with other community-based surveys of known diabetes from 1986 - 1996 identified on MEDLINE. RESULTS: Twenty-five (43 %) <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> supplied data from multi-practice audits of diabetes. Seven (28 %) multi-practice audits involving 259 practices fulfilled the inclusion criteria for prevalence estimation. The overall prevalence of diabetes based on a population of 1, 475, 512 patients was 1. 46 % (range between <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> = 1. 18 % to 1. 66 %; chi 2 = 308; df = 6; P < 0. 0001). Male to female ratio was 1. 15 : 1. Treatment of diabetes could be ascertained for 10 (40 %) <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> comprising 319 practices. Of these, 23. 4 % (range = 16. 5 %- 27. 4 %) were controlled by diet, 48. 5 % (range = 43. 6 %- 55. 8 %) were prescribed oral hypoglycaemic drugs, and 28. 2 % (range = 25. 0 %- 32. 4 %) were treated with insulin. There were significant variations between <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in treatment pattern (chi 2 = 250; df = 18; P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Prevalence and treatment rates of diabetes and other chronic diseases can be assessed and compared using data from multi-practice audits. Collation of audit data could improve the precision of quantitative estimates of health status in populations. A standard method of data recording and collection may provide a new approach that could considerably improve our ability to monitor disease and its management...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 1991, all general {{practices}} have {{been encouraged to}} undertake clinical <b>audit.</b> <b>Audit</b> <b>groups</b> report that participation is high, and some local surveys have been undertaken, but no detailed national survey has been reported. AIM: To determine audit activities in general practices and the perceptions of general practitioners (GPs) regarding the future of clinical audit in primary care. METHOD: A questionnaire on audit activities was sent to 707 practices from 18 medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>group</b> areas. The <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> had been ranked by annual funding from 1992 to 1995. Six groups were selected at random from the top, middle, and lowest thirds of this rank order. RESULTS: A total of 428 (60. 5 %) usable responses were received. Overall, 346 (85 %) responders reported 125. 7 audits {{from the previous year}} with a median of three audits per practice. There was no correlation between the number of audits reported and the funding per GP for the medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>group.</b> Of 997 <b>audits</b> described in detail, changes were reported as 'not needed' in 220 (22 %), 'not made' in 142 (14 %), 'made' in 439 (44 %), and 'made and remeasured' in 196 (20 %). Thus, 635 (64 %) audits were reported to have led to changes. Some 853 (81 %) of the topics identified were on clinical care. Responders made 242 (42 %) positive comments on the future of clinical audit in primary care, and 152 (26 %) negative views were recorded. CONCLUSION: The level of audit activity in general practice is reasonably high, and most of the audits result in change. The number of audits per practice seems to be independent of the level of funding that the medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>group</b> has received. Although there is room for improvement in the levels of effective audit activity in general practice, continued support by the professionally led <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> could enable all practices to undertake effective audit that leads to improvement in patient care...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of three different methods of promoting secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care. DESIGN: Pragmatic, unblinded, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Warwickshire. SUBJECTS: 21 general practices received intervention; outcome measured in 1906 patients aged 55 - 75 years with established coronary heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Audit of notes with summary feedback to primary health care team (audit group); assistance with setting up a disease register and systematic recall of patients to general practitioner (GP recall group); assistance with setting up a disease register and systematic recall of patients to a nurse led clinic (nurse recall group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 18 months' follow up: adequate assessment (defined) of 3 risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status); prescribing of hypotensive agents, lipid lowering drugs, and antiplatelet drugs; blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and plasma cotinine levels. RESULTS: Adequate assessment of all 3 risk factors was much {{more common in the}} nurse and GP recall groups (85 %, 76 %) than the <b>audit</b> <b>group</b> (52 %). The advantage in the nurse recall compared with the <b>audit</b> <b>group</b> was 33 % (95 % confidence interval 19 % to 46 %); in the GP recall group compared with the <b>audit</b> <b>group</b> 23 % (10 % to 36 %), and in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 9 % (- 3 % to 22 %). However, these differences in assessment were not reflected in clinical outcomes. Mean blood pressure (148 / 80, 147 / 81, 148 / 81 mm Hg), total cholesterol (5. 4, 5. 5, 5. 5 mmol/l), and cotinine levels (% probable smokers 17 %, 16 %, 19 %) varied little between the nurse recall, GP recall, and audit groups respectively, as did prescribing of hypotensive and lipid lowering agents. Prescribing of antiplatelet drugs was higher in the nurse recall group (85 %) than the GP recall or audit groups (80 %, 74 %). After adjustment for baseline levels, the advantage in the nurse recall group compared with the <b>audit</b> <b>group</b> was 10 % (3 % to 17 %), in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 8 % (1 % to 15 %) and in the GP recall group compared with the <b>audit</b> <b>group</b> 2 % (- 6 % to 10 %). CONCLUSIONS: Setting up a register and recall system improved patient assessment at 18 months' follow up but was not consistently better than audit alone in improving treatment or risk factor levels.

40|$|This study {{examined}} three methods of improving audit judgment, namely inoculation, the group process, and counter explanation. Prior research found that auditors 2 ̆ 7 judgments {{were not always}} optimum. An important question this study asked was whether the use of inoculation, the group process and counter explanation leads to more effective judgments. In Experiment One, I proposed that inoculation will reduce the effect of framing so that participants exposed to the inoculation treatment will not display a framing effect, while participants not exposed to the treatment will. In addition, I hypothesised that the relation between audit experience and responsiveness to training has an inverted-U shaped value function. The results showed {{this to be the}} case. No interaction effect between framing and inoculation was observed, but the order of writing supporting and opposing arguments as required by the inoculation treatment led to a primacy effect. The second experiment posited that the use of audit groups will improve individual auditors 2 ̆ 7 judgments in a going-concern evaluation task.

SETTING [...] All 85 general practices in Oxfordshire; all 95 medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>groups</b> in England and Wales. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Level of practices' audit activity as measured by rating scale and grid. Use of scale nationally together with perceptions of strengths and weaknesses as perceived by chairs of medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>groups.</b> RESULTS [...] After one year Oxfordshire practices more than attained the target standards set in 1991, with 72 % doing audit involving setting target standards or implementing change; by 1993 this had risen to 78 %. Most audits were confined to chronic disease management, preventive care, and appointments. 38 of 92 medical <b>audit</b> advisory <b>groups</b> used the Oxfordshire group's rating scale. Its main weaknesses were insensitivity in assessing the quality of audits and failure to measure team involvement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{find out}} {{to what extent}} nurses were {{perceived}} to be participating in audit, to identify factors thought to impede their involvement, and to assess progress towards multidisciplinary audit. RESEARCH DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: Focus groups and interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Chairs of <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> and <b>audit</b> support staff in hospital, community and primary health care and audit leads in health authorities in the North West Region. RESULTS: In total 99 audit leads/support staff in the region participated representing 89 % of the primary health care <b>audit</b> <b>groups,</b> 80 % of acute hospitals, 73 % of community health services, and 59 % of purchasers. Many <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> remain medically dominated despite recent changes to their structure and organisation. The quality of interprofessional relations, the leadership style of the audit chair, and nurses' level of seniority, audit knowledge, and experience influenced whether groups reflected a multidisciplinary, rather than a doctor centred approach. Nurses were perceived to be enthusiastic supporters of audit, although their active participation in the process was considered substantially less than for doctors in acute and community health services. Practice nurses were increasingly being seen as the local audit enthusiasts in primary health care. Reported obstacles to nurses' participation in audit included hierarchical nurse and doctor relationships, lack of commitment from senior doctors and managers, poor organisational links between departments of quality and audit, work load pressures and lack of protected time, availability of practical support, and lack of knowledge and skills. Progress towards multidisciplinary audit was highly variable. The undisciplinary approach to audit was still common, particularly in acute services. Multidisciplinary audit was more successfully established in areas already predisposed towards teamworking or where nurses had high involvement in decision making. Audit support staff were viewed as having {{a key role in}} helping teams to adopt a collaborative approach to audit. CONCLUSION: Although nurses were undertaking audit, and some were leading developments in their settings, a range of structural and organisational, interprofessional and intraprofessional factors was still impeding progress.
