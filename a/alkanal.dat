40|$|Oxidative {{cleavage}} of carotenoids and {{peroxidation of lipids}} lead to apocarotenals and aliphatic aldehydes called <b>alkanals,</b> which {{react with}} vitally important compounds, promoting cytotoxicity. Although many enzymes {{have been reported to}} deactivate <b>alkanals</b> by converting them into fatty acids, {{little is known about the}} mechanisms used to detoxify apocarotenals or the enzymes acting on them. Cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic organisms must cope with both classes of aldehydes. Here we report that the Synechocystis enzyme SynAlh 1, encoded by the ORF slr 0091, is an aldehyde dehydrogenase that mediates oxidation of both apocarotenals and <b>alkanals</b> into the corresponding acids. Using a crude lysate of SynAlh 1 -expressing Escherichia coli cells, we show that SynAlh 1 converts a wide range of apocarotenals and <b>alkanals,</b> with a preference for apocarotenals with defined chain lengths. As suggested by in vitro incubations and using engineered retinal-forming E. coli cells, we found that retinal is not a substrate for SynAlh 1, making involvement in Synechocystis retinoid metabolism unlikely. The transcript level of SynAlh 1 is induced by high light and cold treatment, indicating a role in the stress response, and the corresponding gene is a constituent of a stress-related operon. The assumptions regarding the function of SynAlh are further supported by the surprisingly high homology to human and plant aldehyde dehydrogenase that have been assigned to aldehyde detoxification. SynAlh 1 is the first aldehyde dehydrogenase that has been shown to form both apocarotenoic and fatty acids. This dual function suggests that its eukaryotic homologs may also be involved in apocarotenal metabolism, a function that has not been considered so far. Aldehyde dehydrogenases play an important role in detoxification of reactive aldehydes. Here, we report on a cyanbacterial enzyme capable in converting two classes of lipid-derived aldehydes, apocaotenals and <b>alkanals.</b> The corresponding gene is a constituent of a stress-related operon, and homology to eukaryotic enzymes points to a yet not considered possibility of their being involved in scavenging of apocarotenals. © 2013 FEBS...|$|R

40|$|Interactions and {{structure}} of alkanone, or <b>alkanal</b> or dialkyl carbonate + alkane mixtures, or of 2 -alkanone + 2 -alkanone, or of ketone + dialkyl carbonate systems have been investigated {{by means of a}} set of thermodynamic properties and by the application of the Flory model. The properties considered are excess molar quantities: enthalpies, HmE, volumes, VmE, or isobaric heat capacities, CpmE, and liquid-liquid equilibria. Experimental data show that alkane mixtures are characterized by rather strong dipolar interactions. In the case of systems containing ketones with the same number of C atoms and a given alkane, dipolar interactions become weaker in the sequence: aromatic > cyclic > linear. In addition, the mentioned interactions become also weaker in the order: dialkyl carbonate > linear alkanone > linear <b>alkanal.</b> This is an important result, as carbonates show lower effective dipole moments than the other compounds, and it suggests that the group size may be relevant when evaluating thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures. Results on HmE from the Flory model show that orientational effects (i. e., non-random mixing) are rather similar for systems with linear, cyclic or aromatic ketones or alkanals and alkanes. In contrast, orientational effects become weaker in dialkyl carbonate + alkane mixtures. The behavior of 2 -alkanone + 2 -alkanone systems and of mixtures of longer 2 -alkanones or cyclohexanone with dialkyl carbonate is close to random mixing.

Its presence in a luciferase [alkanal monooxygenase (FMN-linked); <b>alkanal,</b> reduced-FMN:oxygen oxidoreductase (1 -hydroxylating, luminescing), EC 1. 14. 14. 3] reaction mixture causes a striking color change, {{and an increase in}} bioluminescence intensity, as well as a faster rate of intensity decay, so that the quantum yield is not changed. The emission spectrum shows two distinct color bands, one at 490 nm attributed to the unaltered emission of the luciferase system, the other peaking in the yellow around 540 nm due to YFP emission. The kinetics of the two color bands differ, so the spectrum changes with time. The yellow emission reaches its initial maximum intensity later than the blue, and then both blue and yellow emissions decay exponentially with nearly the same pseudo-first-order rate constants, linearly dependent on [YFP] (from 0. 01 sec- 1 with no YFP to a maximum of approximately 0. 1 sec- 1 at 4 degrees C) but exhibiting a saturation behavior. The data can be interpreted by assuming the interaction of YFP with the peroxyhemiacetal intermediate in the luciferase reaction to form an unstable new complex whose breakdown gives the yellow emitter in its excited state.

The chosen aldehydes were fourteen alkanals (the C 2 –C 11 n-alkanals, 2 -methyl propanal, 2 -methyl butanal, 3 -methyl butanal, and 2 -ethyl hexanal), six alkenals (2 -propenal, 2 -methyl 2 -propenal, 2 -butenal, 3 -methyl 2 -butenal, 2 -methyl 2 -butenal, and 2 -undecenal), benzaldehyde, and furfural. The product ion fragmentations patterns were determined for both dry air and humid air (3. 5 % absolute humidity) used as the matrix buffer/carrier gas in the drift tube of the SRI-TOF-MS instrument.

The maximum mixing ratios were 1. 4 ppbv (H 2 O 2), 0. 64 ppbv (methylhydroperoxide), and 0. 22 ppbv (hydroxymethyl-hydroperoxide). H 2 O 2 was formed through photochemical activity, but originated also from vertical transport from air residing above the local inversion layer in the morning hours. Sometimes a second maximum was observed in the late afternoon-evening: This H 2 O 2 might be formed from ozonolysis of biogenic alkenes.

40|$|The {{main effect}} of lipid peroxidation, which often occurs in {{response}} to oxidative stress, is the production of different toxic aldehydes. In particular, over the years, the lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde 4 -hydroxy-trans- 2 -nonenal (HNE) has received much attention for its dual role in the pathogenesis of several diseases and as signaling molecule. HNE metabolism is reported to mainly occur through its conjugation with glutathione (GSH) and the subsequent formation of 3 -glutathionyl- 4 -hydroxynonanal (GSHNE) [1, 2]. This molecule is susceptible to both oxidative and reductive transformations, which occur through the action of either the NADPH-dependent activity of aldose reductase (AKR 1 B 1) [1] or through the NAD(P) + -dependent activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively [3, 4]. Recently, we have demonstrated the implication of a new NADP+-dependent enzymatic activity able to oxidize GSHNE to its corresponding acid 3 -glutathionyl-nonanoic-γ-lactone (GSHNA-γ-lactone) [5]. The enzyme was purified from a human astrocytoma cells line (ADF) to electrophoretic homogeneity as protein doublet in SDS-PAGE, with an apparent molecular weight of 31 - 32 kDa. Proteomic analysis identified both proteins as human CBR 1, also known as NADP+ 15 -hydroxyprostaglandine dehydrogenase with 74 % of homology and proved their migration differences due to the occurrence of a carboxyethyl moiety at Lys 239 [5]. This modification has been already described for the human enzyme and has been demonstrated to {{have no effect on}} the protein activity and specificity [6, 7]. The enzyme efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of GSHNE, while it is practically inactive towards 4 -hydroxy trans- 2 -nonenal and other HNE-S-thiolated adducts containing an incomplete glutathionyl moiety [5]. Nucleotide sequence analysis of hCBR 1 cDNA from ADF cells completely matched with the human wild type counterpart [5], excluding any gain-of-function mutations in the cDNA-derived protein sequence of hCBR 1 [8, 9]. Highly purified human recombinant carbonyl reductase 1 (E. C. 1. 1. 1. 184, hCBR 1), which preserves its ability to oxidize specifically GSHNE, is also shown to efficiently act as aldehyde reductase on glutathionylated <b>alkanals,</b> namely 3 -glutathionyl- 4 -hydroxynonanal (GSHNE), 3 -glutathionyl-nonanal, 3 -glutathionyl-hexanal and 3 -glutathionyl-propanal [10]. The presence of the glutathionyl moiety appears as a necessary requirement for the susceptibility of these compounds to the NADPH-dependent reduction by hCBR 1. In fact the corresponding <b>alkanals</b> and alkenals, and the cysteinyl and γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl <b>alkanals</b> adducts were either ineffective or very poorly active as CBR 1 substrates [10].

Volatile compounds derived from the oxidation of linoleic acid were at higher levels in meat from lamb due to the higher concentration of the latter, while compounds formed from α-linolenic acid were at higher levels in goat. It can be concluded that lamb meat has a stronger flavour profile compared to goat meat because it has the highest concentrations of lipid-derived volatile compounds, primarily straight saturated <b>alkanals,</b> pyrazines and thiazole...|$|R
40|$|Reactions between {{lipid peroxidation}} {{products}} and proteins in foods have detrimental nutritional effects, most importantly, losses of essential amino acids. One {{of the major}} products of the reaction of malondialdehyde and <b>alkanals</b> with amino groups are 4 -substituted 1, 4 -dihydropyridine- 3, 5 -dicarbaldehyde derivatives. The product of the reaction of lysine with malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde, N,N‘-di-(4 -methyl- 1, 4 -dihydropyridine- 3, 5 -dicarbaldehyde) lysine (MDDL), has been synthesized and used for in vitro and in vivo bioavailability studies. Release of free lysine did not occur in incubations of MDDL with tissue homogenates. After oral administration of radioactively labeled MDDL, radioactivity was only recovered in feces. Radioactivity was not incorporated into hepatic microsomes after intraperitoneal administration, which would have indicated release of available lysine. These results show that MDDL {{is a form of}} unavailable lysine, because it is not metabolized to free lysine and cannot be absorbed from the gut. Thus, formation of this derivative in foods would result in loss of available lysine. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} annual evolution {{and composition of}} soluble cuticular waxes of Actinidia deliciosa Chev. cv Hayward leaves. Soluble cuticular waxes of foliar blade were extracted in chloroform and analysed by GC-MS. The seasonal weighted mean of the wax coverage was about 24 microg cm(- 2). The alkyl alkanoates were the main class of components (10 microg cm(- 2)) followed by hydrocarbons (6 microg cm(- 2)), terpenes (3 microg cm(- 2)), alkanols (1 microg cm(- 2)), ketones (1 microg cm(- 2)), alkanoic acids (1 microg cm(- 2)), <b>alkanals</b> (0. 7 microg cm(- 2)), and sterols (0. 6 microg cm(- 2)). The concentration of the soluble cuticular components reached a peak (43 microg cm(- 2)) on the 83 rd day after bud break. Different causes were proposed to explicate the seasonal evolution of the leaf waxes: biosynthesis of the waxes prevalently during rapid leaf growth; natural wax erosion and evaporation; progressive reduction in the extractability of the intracuticular free compounds due to the slow polymerization of the cutin matrix...|$|R
40|$|Reversed-phase h. p. l. c. {{was used}} to detect 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine-reactive {{carbonyl}} products, which excludes malonaldehyde, in malaria-parasite (Plasmodium vinckei) -infected murine red blood cells (RBCs). A number of <b>alkanals,</b> 4 -hydroxyalk- 2 -enals and alka- 2, 4 -dienals were tentatively identified by comparison with authentic standards. The formation of 4 -hydroxynon- 2 -enal, deca- 2, 4 -dienal and hexanal was greater in P. vinckei-infected RBCs than in their uninfected counterparts and was increased {{by the presence of}} t-butyl hydroperoxide. Several of these aldehydes have previously been shown to be toxic to various types of cells, including P. falciparum, in vitro. The iron chelator desferrioxamine and the free-radical scavenger butylated hydroxyanisole inhibited the formation of these aldehydes. These experiments demonstrate that products of lipid peroxidation other than malonaldehyde are formed during the exposure of malaria-infected RBCs in vitro to drugs that generate reactive oxygen species and have anti-parasitic activity. The formation of products of this type during the natural course of malaria infection may have implications for the mechanisms underlying intra-RBC parasite death and the tissue damage associated with the disease...|$|R
40|$|Three {{batches of}} oats were {{extruded}} under four combinations of process temperature (150 or 180 °C) and process moisture (14. 5 and 18 %). Two of the extrudates {{were evaluated by}} a sensory panel, and three were analyzed by GC-MS. Maillard reaction products, such as pyrazines, pyrroles, furans, and sulfur-containing compounds, {{were found in the}} most severely processed extrudates (high-temperature, low-moisture). These extrudates were also described by the assessors as having toasted cereal attributes. Lipid degradation products, such as <b>alkanals,</b> 2 -alkenals, and 2, 4 -alkadienals, were found at much higher levels in the extrudates of the oat flour that had been debranned. It contained lower protein and fiber levels than the others and showed increased lipase activity. Extrudates from these samples also had significantly lower levels of Maillard reaction products that correlated, in the sensory analysis, with terms such as stale oil and oatmeal. Linoleic acid was added to a fourth oat flour to simulate the result of increased lipase activity, and GC-MS analysis showed both an increase in lipid degradation products and a decrease in Maillard reaction products...|$|R
40|$|The {{anaerobic}} degradation of tetradecylamine and other long-chain alkylamines by a newly isolated denitrifying bacterium was studied. Strain ZN 6 was isolated from {{a mixture of}} soil and active sludge and was identified as representing Pseudomonas stutzeri, based on partial 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strain ZN 6 was a mesophilic, motile, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium {{and was able to}} grow on a variety of compounds including even-numbered primary fatty amines with alkyl chains ranging from C 4 to C 18 coupled to nitrate reduction. Alkylamines were used as sole carbon, energy and nitrogen source and were completely mineralized. Nitrate was dissimilated by ZN 6 to nitrite. When strain ZN 6 was grown under nitrate limitation, nitrite was slowly dissimilated further. When cocultivated with the complete denitrifier Castellaniella defragens ZN 3, {{anaerobic degradation}} under denitrifying of alkylamines by strain ZN 6 was slightly faster. Strain ZN 3 is a complete denitrifier, unable to convert tetradecylamine, and was copurified from the same enrichment culture as strain ZN 6. The proposed pathway for the degradation of alkylamines in strain ZN 6 starts with C¿N cleavages to <b>alkanals</b> and further oxidation to the corresponding fatty acid...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFine {{particulate}} matter (PM 2. 5) {{samples were collected}} during a three week winter period in Fresno (CA). A composite sample was characterized by isolating several distinct fractions and characterizing them by infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. More than 80 % of the organic matter in the aerosol samples was recovered and characterized. Only 35 % of the organic matter was water soluble with another third soluble in dichloromethane and the remainder insoluble. Within the isolated water soluble material, hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic acids plus neutrals fractions contained the largest amounts of carbon. The hydrophobic acids fraction appears to contain significant amounts of lignin type structures, spectra of the hydrophilic acids plus neutrals fraction are indicative of carbohydrates and secondary organic material. The dichloromethane soluble fraction contains a variety of organic compound families typical of many previous studies of organic aerosol speciation, including alkanes, alkanols, <b>alkanals</b> and alkanoic acids. Finally the water and solvent insoluble fraction exhibits a strong aromaticity {{as one would expect}} from black or elemental carbon like material; however, these spectra also show a substantial amount of aliphaticity consistent with linear side chains on the aromatic structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{hyperactivity}} of aldose reductase (AR) on glucose in diabetic {{conditions or}} on glutathionyl-hydroxynonenal in oxidative stress conditions, {{the source of}} cell damage and inflammation, appear to be balanced by the detoxifying action exerted by the enzyme. This detoxification acts on cytotoxic hydrophobic aldehydes deriving from membrane peroxidative processes. This {{may contribute to the}} failure in drug development for humans to favorably intervene in diabetic complications and inflammation, despite the specificity and high efficiency of several available aldose reductase inhibitors. This paper presents additional features to a previously proposed approach, on inhibiting the enzyme through molecules able to preferentially inhibit the enzyme depending on the substrate the enzyme is working on. These differential inhibitors (ARDIs) should act on glucose reduction catalyzed by AR without little or no effect on the reduction of alkenals or <b>alkanals.</b> The reasons why AR may be an eligible enzyme for differential inhibition are considered. These mainly refer to the evidence that, although AR is an unspecific enzyme that recognizes different substrates such as aldoses and hydrophobic aldehydes, it nevertheless displays a certain degree of specificity among substrates of the same class. After screening on edible vegetables, indications of the presence of molecules potentially acting as ARDIs are reported...|$|R
40|$|Pollution of {{soil and}} aqueous environments by crude oil has been, and still is, an {{important}} environmental threat. Remediation of polluted areas {{has proven to be}} challenging 3. In this research, we propose a synthetic biology approach for sustainable solutions. This work puts forward a toolkit that enables the conversion of alkanes by Escherichia coli and presents a proof of principle of its applicability. The toolkit consists of multiple standard interchangeable parts (BioBricks) 9 addressing the conversion of alkanes, regulation of gene expression and survival in toxic hydrocarbon-rich environments. A three-step pathway for alkane degradation was implemented in E. coli to enable the conversion of medium- and long-chain alkanes to their respective alkanols, <b>alkanals</b> and ultimately alkanoic-acids. The latter were metabolized via the native β-oxidation pathway. To facilitate the oxidation of medium-chain alkanes (C 5 -C 13) and cycloalkanes (C 5 -C 8), four genes (alkB 2, rubA 3, rubA 4 and rubB) of the alkane hydroxylase system from Gordonia sp. TF 6 8, 21 were transformed into E. coli. For the conversion of long-chain alkanes (C 15 -C 36), the ladA gene from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans was implemented 7, 15, 18, 22. For the required further steps of the degradation process (from the alcohol, to the aldehyde and finally to the alkanoic acid), ADH and ALDH (alcohol and aldehylde dehydrogenase, also originating from G. thermodenitrificans...|$|R
