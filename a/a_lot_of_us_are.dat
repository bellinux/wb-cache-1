500|$|In late June, {{the three}} Republican Representatives from Wisconsin commented on Thompson's campaign. Though Representative Tom Petri {{identified}} himself as a supporter and hailed Thompson for doing [...] "a lot {{for the country and}} the state and the Republican Party of Wisconsin" [...] he called Thompson [...] "a long shot" [...] and stopped short of endorsing him. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner described Thompson's campaign as [...] "anemic" [...] and Representative Paul Ryan commented that [...] "I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> hoping the best for Tommy and are wishing him well but are just sort of watching the field to see how it materializes." [...] Other Republicans wondered if Thompson was running just to [...] "get it out of his system." [...] Strategist Mark Graul argued that the former governor [...] "had a profound impact" [...] on party members in Wisconsin, which had created a familiarity complex that caused people to say [...] "'Oh, come on'" [...] after hearing of his run. Despite the qualms, spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked that Thompson wants [...] "for people to give him a chance... he knows he has a lot to prove, and he is working 90 hours a week to prove it." [...] A Strategic vision poll of Iowa voters placed Thompson in fifth place among the candidates, with only 6 percent support. To improve his standing ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, Thompson planned to escalate his Iowa campaign after July 4 in a swing labeled the [...] "Common Sense Solutions Tour". Communications director Rennick Remley remarked that despite low amounts of capital, Thompson would spend [...] "scads of time in Iowa in July." [...] He compared Thompson's strategy to Jimmy Carter's 1976 [...] "retail politics" [...] strategy that led to victory in the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
2500|$|Frontman James Veck-Gilodi {{has spoken}} {{at length about}} the themes of each song on the album, {{describing}} them as 'very personal and each is a small story that depicts {{a part of my}} life'. Much of the album is about nostalgia, underachievement and anxiety, which are all topics which are personal to him as he wrote all the lyrics for the album. The opening track [...] "The Past Six Years", from whose lyrics the album takes its title, is described as 'an ode to... not really achieving as much as we'd have liked'. The lyrics make reference to friends and fellow bands Lower Than Atlantis and Young Guns and how James feels 'a perpetual bitterness and jealousy towards them in terms of their achievements, {{despite the fact that they}} are close friends'. [...] "I'm a Bore, Mostly" [...] also deals with the topic of underachievement, with James explaining that the song is about 'the mundane daily routine I had when I was living in London. ...I couldn't deal with city life, I rarely left the house and found myself sinking into this terrible routine. I didn't really appreciate anything at the time and I had no enthusiasm'. He has claimed he wrote the song [...] "Filthy Rotten Scoundrel" [...] about himself; 'I need to learn to be grateful and appreciate the opportunities that I have been given. It's also about my fear of living, dying and never really achieving anything'. [...] "The World or Nothing" [...] continues this trend, with James describing the theme as 'the vicious cycle of feeling lost and resorting to the aid of alcohol while also feeling lost because of alcohol. It talks about how self-destructive <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> and how we enjoy abusing our bodies'. Of [...] "Nelson's County", Veck-Gilodi has said: 'This song is about the county of Norfolk and how a lot of the people who reside there seem to have no real ambition other than working a 9-5, raising a family and living a normal life'.|$|E

For <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> Herbie captured the democratic spirit of the ballgame. He brought people together in laughter and made the experience more special and more fun. Some of his bosses apparently wished he'd do his job unnoticed, but Herbie was determined to assert his individuality and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> appreciated him for that."

5000|$|Andriano doesn't go into {{details as}} to the {{inspiration}} for the lyrics of this song; he simply says: [...] "It's definitely one of my favorites on the album, though, because the sentiment is real. Most of us don't need anything; we're lucky in that regard. But <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> missing a lot of things — maybe it's people, maybe it's answers, or hope, love, trust, whatever. If you're looking, I really do hope you find it".|$|E

I just want {{to let him know}} how he influenced the whole South in Hip-Hop." [...] 2 Chainz went on, [...] "We used to argue people like they ain’t understand why we appreciated Master P and his music. It was more than that. I felt like it was his grind, his hustle. He actually put music out like every week. I even heard stories about some of the songs never even being mixed before. It was just about giving the fans what they needed.

5000|$|The term [...] "" [...] {{means to}} be very nervous or anxious about something. About the lyrics, Dave Mustaine stated [...] "I wrote that about myself. It was {{pointed out to me}} that I'm kind of {{schizophrenic}} and that I live inside my head. Which is something I don't subscribe to, but I enjoyed the theory nonetheless.", and [...] "I think all of us are sweating bullets all the time. Society's a joke right now, and people are getting more and more hostile. When you think about having an evil twin or schizophrenia, I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> schizo, because we live inside our heads. There's someone we all confer with; it's called our conscience. Some people cannot control their other side; it takes them over. Everybody has that psychotic side.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The Body Politic {{during his visit to}} promote Helmet of Flesh, Symons articulated his philosophy of sexual identity: [...] "I am certainly a devoted homosexual.

It doesn't cover what we are. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> not very joyous. We have a hard life to live, against the current. Gay doesn't cover that — and worst of all, it labels us. They can dismiss you and put you off in a corner: [...] "Oh, he's gay," [...] and that's it. That's the end. You can no longer be central to what's going on. That's tragic....The world loses central contact {{with some of the most}} beautiful, sentient, sensitive and agitated, creative and emotional people in our society. The result is that a lot of people who operate centrally in our society can't let on that they're gay. It's tragic. It's very dangerous." ...|$|E

How we understand what we have learned is reviewed from the historical approach, instead of cognitive science. In this work I promote learning cryptography by testing. A simple cipher is used to illustrate how this can be done. Software testing is not used as its original intent, but as a driving force for learning and understanding. JUnit will be used to serve as the automatic testing framework. New JUnit 4 release has less “distracting ” effect on learning the innards of Vernam; we will discuss why it is so. Refactoring of code and design that have the capacity of enhancing learning and understanding are suggested and discussed. 1 – Learning and Understanding. The word understanding can be too abstract to be generally used, because it relates to individual thought or perception of things. When come to learning, more and more educationists sanction the word understanding and, instead, looking to cognitive psychology for solution. Piagetian theory (usually not in its original form) is generally held true among curriculum developers. But understanding is what working scientists...|$|E
