40|$|<b>Unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> {{with civil}} {{aviation}} {{has become a}} major concern for the world aviation community. The misuse of aircraft as {{a weapon of mass destruction}} has created new challenges. Air terrorism has moved from hijacking or <b>unlawful</b> seizure <b>of</b> aircraft to an in-flight explosion caused by sabotage and finally to September 11, 2001, to the use of a civil airplane as a weapon of destruction. The events of September may be the biggest security challenge ever faced by the aviation industry. The impact of this tragic event on the global economy has been very harsh. The events have tended to obscure the fact that civil aviation continues to be an inherent safe mode of transport. Great efforts are being made at the national and international levels to create a security net which is global in nature and so tight that not one further potential <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> can slip through. However, the fact remains that, in weaving the net and designing measures with the objectives of preventing, combating and eradicating <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> terrorism involving civil aviation, it is prudent to be imaginative in assessing the threat, which could come from new directions and in new forms. This thesis explores the implications of the 11 September 2001 events. A global strategy is initiated by ICAO and endorsed by the States, with the aim of protecting lives, restoring public confidence in air travel, and promoting the financial health of air transport. I will therefore examine the measures initiated by ICAO in response to the new challenges in aviation and which form the basis of the aviation security action plan. The perspective is that the events of 11 September have changed the world, and changed irrecoverably. Nothing will be the same for the aviation industry...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{passenger}} and baggage {{security in}} airport screening system {{is one of}} the most important factors that determine air transport safety and security. It prevents objects and materials that could be used to commit an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> from being placed on board an aircraft. The security screening system consists of x-ray screening devices, walk-through metal detectors and specialised software. However, a key element of the security screening system is the human – the security screener (SSc). The equipment and software helps the screener to find prohibited items, but also detects and records his/her errors. The whole security control point (SCP) can be regarded as a complex socio-technical system. It's effectiveness is dependent, inter alia, on the type of x-ray devices used, a variant of SCP organisation or the technical condition of the equipment, but mainly on the quality of the security screeners’ work. Special attention is paid to the types of errors and their frequency. We analyze the quantitative relationships between types of errors and also between the frequency of errors and the frequency of virtual threat images projection (TIP). This last technology is a kind of intelligent support system and at the same time verifies the screener's work. The study was based on measurements under real conditions at the Katowice-Pyrzowice International Airport. In the framework of this research two basic types of errors made by SSc were identified. The results show that the number of errors is dependent from the frequency of the stimulus, represented by TIP images. As a result, it was possible to determine the recommended frequency of threat images projections. The study is supplemented by a comparison of the screeners’ effectiveness in laboratory conditions against real conditions, while working at the security control point...|$|R

40|$|Maritime {{container}} transport {{plays a major}} role in international trade. As such, it can be an attractive target of <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference,</b> e. g., smuggling, piracy or terrorism. One major issue of maritime security is the container screening at ports, which is the main focus of this thesis. The goal of this thesis is to study the efficiency of different designs of screening systems using simulation. The literature review covers contemporary laws and requirements, container screening equipment and processes related to screening that take place in seaports. Next, operation of three screening checkpoints models, which symbolize predominant approaches to container screening, is simulated in Arena Simulation Software. The simulated cases are a representation of shipping containers through the transatlantic route from the European Union to the United States. The results are subsequently analyzed in order to gain insight into various aspects of checkpoint operation. Furthermore, recommendations on implementation of container screening at maritime terminals are provided to both policy makers and terminal designers. ...|$|E

40|$|International Protection of Civil Aviation Safety. This {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the idea that the obligation of states to protect civil aviation against <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference,</b> especially terrorist attacks, has certain limits. These limits find its source in international treaties. States are not only subjects of treaties, which protect civil aviation, but also subjects of treaties, which protect individuals and there human rights. Both kind of obligation should be respected. These days we can see, that states do not respect obligations and principles set by international human rights treaties and justify their invasive interference with human rights by stating that they are fighting against terrorism. Its mostly visible by interference with the human dignity, right to privacy, data protection. But there are also other right which can be affected - for example right to free movement or health protection. In my paper I try to analyse impacts of some measures adopted by states on human rightst and show that they sometimes do not respect requirements, which are set for limitations of these rights. The most important documents I am working with are the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Treaty on Human Rights.

40|$|Post 9 / 11 we have {{witnessed}} the introduction and further strengthening {{of a range of}} trans-border security programs designed to protect international supply chains against <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference.</b> In some cases compliance with these programs is mandatory. In other cases compliance results in a preferential treatment by appropriate authorities. To a great extent, these programs comprehend the introduction of situational measures. In most instances, however, operators within the supply chain-being made responsible for their actual implementation-are left with limited guidance. In this paper it is argued that a lack of guidance may result in measures being introduced without taking full account of their potential consequences. Based on an analysis of previous research findings and on the outcome of a literature review, direct and indirect implementation costs have been differentiated from a range of (consequential costs provoked by) potential reverse effects, and from a series of generic preconditions, enabling practitioners in industry to conduct a proper cost analysis and come to an informed decision on what particular measure(s) best to implement. It is argued that criminology and management science can support this decision making process, provided that policy makers allow operators a certain freedom of choice between alternative measures and approaches...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} "European {{legal aspects}} of {{the protection of the}} private and family life of the child" focuses on the protection of privacy, particularly on data protection of children in the context of traditional and modern communication technologies. The family - parents plays the most important role in the environment of traditional and modern communication technologies for ensuring the right to privacy of children. Although the right to privacy and protection of personal data belongs directly to the child, parents have to provide the exercise of these rights of the child with regard to his/her age and mental capacity of the child. Particularly with regard to the constant development of modern technologies, it is possible to imagine that the increasingly threatening situations in terms of privacy and children's personal data will be more frequent. In selected cases, the analysis focuses on the question of who constitutes the cause <b>of</b> <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> into the right of privacy, particularly data protection, individualization of the right or combination of rights to which an <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> has been occurred and how the judicial authorities and national data protection authorities define in individual cases the permissible level of interference with the right to privacy and the [...] ...|$|R
