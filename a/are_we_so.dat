500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{thought the}} episode {{was similar to}} Flowers for Algernon, but was skeptical of the premise that Milo could predict every event before they happened. She criticized the decision to make Milo [...] "coldly calculating", writing [...] "This is but another version of the tired cliché of the stoic intellectual, the intelligent person who has no heart or emotions. Why <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>so</b> afraid of smart people?... It always annoys me when science fiction writers, of all people, diss their own audience {{with the idea that}} intellectuals are dangerous." [...] Stegall was pleased to have the first [...] "standalone" [...] episode of the season, explaining that it was the first where she could [...] "relax and enjoy... the tying together of a standalone with a mythology theme was absolutely brilliant." [...] Fearnet contributor Alyse Wax enjoyed the episode, but also thought [...] "the idea that [...] could turn someone into a cartoonish evil genius is pretty farfetched." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool {{dominated}} the opening exchanges, but struggled to create clear-cut chances. They almost went a goal behind when Frank Stapleton's header forced goalkeeper Ray Clemence into action. Seven {{minutes before the}} interval, Terry McDermott scored for Liverpool. The midfielder collected a pass from Ray Kennedy who surged through the centre, turned left and from outside the penalty area struck the ball low into the bottom left-hand corner. Arsenal began the second half with more vigour, but struggled to suppress Liverpool's attacks. Alan Kennedy found space to shoot after a one-two with Ray, but his effort went over the post. Arsenal were forced to make a substitution around the hour mark after Sammy Nelson collided with McDermott and was concussed; Willie Young replaced him. Liverpool extended their lead minutes later. Alan Hansen intercepted an Arsenal attack, strode forward and passed the ball to Dalglish. The striker approached the penalty area, cut inside Steve Walford and curled {{the ball into the}} right-hand corner. John Hollins came on for David Price, at which point Liverpool scored their third. Dalglish dispossessed Liam Brady, but tripped himself in the process. Johnson collected the ball and played it back to Dalglish, who charged forward and sprayed a pass towards McDermott, the furthest forward player on the right. The midfielder's shot went under the legs of Pat Jennings and into the goal. Alan Sunderland scored a late goal for Arsenal having combined well with Stapleton. This did not dampen the spirits of the Liverpool spectators, who chanted, [...] "What's it like to be outclassed?" [...] and, [...] "Why <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>so</b> great?" [...] {{during the course of the}} 90 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Feed Us A Fetus, the 1986 LP by Canadian thrash band Dayglo Abortions, adapted a {{photograph}} of Mr. and Mrs. Reagan [...] with the U.S. Presidential Seal in the background, adding to it is a fetus being served to the president on a plate. Earlier in his political career, Ronald Reagan had signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act six weeks into his first gubernatorial term, bringing California's statewide total of legal abortion procedures from 518 in 1967 {{to an average of}} around 100,000 annually throughout his two terms as governor—more than any other state prior to Roe vs. Wade. In 1972 Nancy Reagan make a public statement regarding her husband's decision, saying, [...] "If we accept the right to take life before birth <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>so</b> far from making the decision after birth?" [...] She went on to say, [...] "I agree with the California abortion law passed under my husband, however, I believe it has been terribly abused". By the end of the Reagans' first term in the White House, they had changed their position on abortion, and in 1986 the president addressed a joint session of Congress, saying, [...] "Today there is a wound in our national conscience. America will never be whole as long as the right to life granted by our Creator is denied to the unborn". By the 1990s, Nancy Reagan reasserted her public opinion of being [...] "somewhere in the middle" [...] in not supporting abortion while believing in women's right to choose. The Dayglo Abortions's name caused the band problems in both the United States and Canada, and the cover of Feed Us A Fetus resulted in an obscenity charge that was ultimately brought before and overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
