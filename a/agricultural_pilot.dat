40|$|Thesis (PhD (Physics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Radioactivity is {{well known}} and well understood, but its {{usefulness}} in industrial applications to optimise processes or increase economic viability is not yet fully utilised by many industries. This study focuses on the measurement of natural radioactivity and its application in heavy mineral separation and vineyard soil classification. The gamma radiometry set-up consisted of a high purity germanium detector, a Marinelli beaker as sample container and associated electronics. It was calibrated for laboratorybased measurements by minimising the background radiation {{with the use of}} lead castle and energy and resolution calibrations. Furthermore, detection parameters were optimised; these included the counting time, the selection of gamma rays used for analysis of a sample, the peak area calculation for the detector dead time and the detector efficiency. Given that the samples had different densities and volumes, the detector efficiency had to be corrected for volume and density effects. After implementation of the corrections and optimisations the detection system was tested and found able to accurately measure radioactivity concentrations. The systematic measurement errors for 238 U were 5. 1 % {{in the case of the}} heavy mineral sands and 34. 3 % for the vineyard soils, 4. 5 % for the 232 Th concentrations and 4. 7 % for 40 K concentrations. Statistical errors were kept below 2 %. The application of radiometry has not been done before at any South African heavy mineral separation plant. For this reason radiometry is suggested as an easier, faster and cheaper alternative to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) for effective implementation of grade control for zircon to improve the cost benefit of the heavy mineral separation process. Zircon is an example of a heavy mineral that is worldwide in demand with a consumption of more than a million tonnes per year. It is used in a wide range of industrial applications and products that include tiles, sanitary ware and plasma displays. South Africa is the second largest producer of zircon in the world and also has the second largest reserve of available zircon, making this mineral a viable source of income for several years to come. Radioactivity, in the form of uranium and thorium, and other impurities such as iron oxide and titanium oxide are found in the crystal lattice of zircon. For it to be a sellable product, the sum of the uranium and thorium concentrations must be less than 500 parts per million for prime or first grade zircon and less than 1000 parts per million for second grade zircon. At present the concentrations of uranium and thorium in zircon concentrates are measured on a whole rock basis by XRF during and at the end of the processing cycle before the final products are ready to be shipped. This is not an ideal situation as the grab samples are taken periodically and are not necessarily representative of the stream or final assignment and has resulted in significant losses by the producer. The solution is to accurately measure the uranium and thorium concentrations fast or immediately, preferably the measurements must be made online and in real time so that processing decisions can be implemented quickly to optimise the final product. Heavy mineral sand samples were obtained from the various separation processes in a Mineral Separation Plant and their 238 U and 232 Th concentrations determined. The results indicated that the samples’ uranium to thorium ratios together with their total concentrations can be used to differentiate between the samples (i. e. separation processes). The measurement results were compared with those obtained with XRF. The correlations with radiometry were excellent for the uranium (r 2 = 0. 992), thorium (r 2 = 0. 998) and total concentrations (r 2 = 0. 998). Radiometric measurements were also conducted by decreasing the counting time from 3600 s to 1 s to investigate its effect on the accuracy of the results. Correlations between the different times and 3600 s ranged from excellent to good. The obtained results are then used to recommend that radiometry is used in a Mineral Separation Plant to verify that the zircon and zirkwa meet the specifications, to optimise the entrance feed and the other separation processes and to monitor the tailings streams. Finally the practical aspects of the implementation of radiometry are discussed. As a second application was radiometry applied in an <b>agricultural</b> <b>pilot</b> study to demonstrate the applicability of radiometry as a possible useful tool in soil classification. The creation of a vineyard is a long term and expensive investment and its yield and quality will be influenced by many factors such as the type of soil, viticultural preparations and climate. Information on the different soil types in a vineyard is therefore indispensable for the optimisation of land use with respect to vine cultivar, wine quality and production. Soil samples were obtained from Kanonkop, Simonsig and Spier vineyards and their 238 U, 232 Th and 40 K concentrations determined, assuming that fertilisers would have no effect on the results. The difference in 40 K concentrations were related to the clay fraction of the soil and demonstrated that the Kanonkop and Simonsig soils are fine-grained and clay-rich compared to the sandy coarse-grained soils of Spier. The uranium and thorium concentrations were indicators of whether the mineralogy of the soil is the same as the underlying bedrock as well as soil maturity. The measurement results were compared with those obtained with XRF. The correlation with radiometry were poor for the uranium concentrations (r 2 = 0. 314), as many of the samples concentrations were below the XRF detection limit. The correlations were excellent for both thorium (r 2 = 0. 985) and potassium (r 2 = 0. 999). As a positive result from the findings of the study was an in-situ measurement performed by Newman et al. for the radiometric mapping of a Simonsig vineyard for soil classification. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Radioaktiwiteit is wel bekend en word goed verstaan, tog is die gebruik daarvan in industriele toepassings om prosesses te optimiseer of winsgrense te verhoog nog nie deur baie industrië ten volle benut nie. Hierdie studie fokus op die meting van natuurlike radioaktiwiteit en die toepassing daarvan in swaar mineraal skeiding en wingerd grond klassifikasie. Die gamma radiometrie opstelling het bestaan uit ‘n hoë suiwerheid germanium detektor, 'n Marinelli beker as monster houer en verwante elektronika. Dit was gekalibreer vir laboratorium gebaseerde metings deur die vermindering van die agtergrondstraling met die gebruik van lood kasteel en energie en resolusie kalibrasies. Verder was deteksie parameters geoptimaliseer, dit sluit in die teltyd, die keuse van gammastrale wat gebruik word vir die ontleding van 'n monster, die piek area berekening, die korreksie vir die detektor se dooie tyd en die detektor doeltreffendheid. Gegee dat die monsters van mekaar verskil het in terme van dighteid en volume was dit nodig om die detektor doeltreffendheid te korrigeer vir volume en digtheid effekte. Na die implementering van die korreksies en optimalisasie was die detektor stelsel getoets en was gevind dat radioaktiwiteit konsentrasies akkuraat gelewer kan lewer. Die sistematiese meet foute vir 238 U was 5. 1 % vir die mineraal sand en 34. 3 % vir wingerd grond, 4. 5 % vir 232 Th konsentrasies en 4. 7 % vir 40 K konsentrasies. Statistiese foute was onder 2 % gehou. Die toepassing van radiometrie was nog nie voorheen by enige Suid-Afrikaanse swaar mineraal skeidings aanleg gedoen nie. Vir die rede is radiometrie voorgestel as ‘n makliker, vinniger en goedkoper alternatief teenoor XSF vir effektiewe implementering van graad beheer vir zirkon om die koste voordeel van die swaar mineral skeiding proses te verbeter. Zirkon is ‘n voorbeeld van ‘n swaar mineraal wat wêreldwyd in aanvraag is met ‘n verbruik van meer as ‘n miljoen ton per jaar. Dit word in ‘n wye reeks van industriele toepassings en produkte gebruik onder andere teëls, sanitêre ware en plasma skerms. Suid Afrika is die tweede grootste vervaardiger van zirkon in die wêreld en het ook die tweede grootste reserwe van besikbare zirkon. Dit veroorsaak dat die mineraal ‘n lewensvatbare brom van inkomste is vir nog etlike jare. Radioaktiwiteit, in die vorm van uraan en thorium, word tesame met ander onsuiwerhede soos ysteroksied en titaanoksied in zirkon se kristal rooster gevind. Om ‘n verkoopbare produk te wees moet die som van die uraan en thorium konsentrasies minder wees as 500 dele per miljoen vir prima en eerste graad zirkon en minder wees as 1000 dele per miljoen vir tweede graadse zirkon. Huidiglik word die uraan en thorium konsentrasies in die zirkon konsentraat gemeet op ‘n heel gesteente basis met X-straal fluoroskopie (XSF) gedurende en op die einde van die prosesering siklus net voor die finale produk reg is om versend te word. Dit is nie die ideale situasie nie, want die monsters word periodies geneem en is nie noodwendig verteenwoordigend van die stroom of die finale produk nie en het al tot beduidende verliese deur die vervaardiger gelei. Die oplossing is om die uraan en thorium konsentrasies vinnig of onmiddelik te meet, verkieslik moet die metings inlyn en intyds gedoen word om verwerkings besluite vinnig geimplementeer kan word om die finale produk te optimaliseer. Swaar mineraal sand monsters was verkry van die verskeie skeidingsprosesse in ‘n Mineraal Skeidings Aanleg en hul 238 U en 232 Th konsentrasies bepaal. Die resultate het aangetoon dat die monsters se uraan en thorium verhoudings saam met hul totale konsentrasies gebruik kan word om te onderskei tussen die monsters (oftewel die skeiding prosesse). Die meting resultate was vergelyk met dié verkry met XSF. Die korrelasies met radiometrie was uitstekend vir die uraan (r 2 = 0. 992), thorium (r 2 = 0. 998) en totale konsentrasies (r 2 = 0. 998). Radiometriese metings was ook uigevoer deur die teltyd te verminder van 3600 s tot 1 s om die uitwerking daarvan op die akkuraatheid van die resultate te ondersoek. Korrelasies tussen die verskillende tye en 3600 s het gewissel van uitstekend tot goed. Die bevindinge was dan gebruik om aan te beveel dat radiometrie in a Mineraal Skeidings Aanleg gebruik kan word om te verifeer dat daar aan die zirkon en zirkwa spesifikasies voldoen word, om die begin voer en ander skeidings prosesse te optimaliseer en ook die uitskot strome te monitor. Laastens is die praktiese aspekte van die implementering van radiometrie bespreek. Vir die tweede toepassing was radiometrie toepgepas in ‘n loods studie in die landbou om die toepaslikheid van radiometrie as ‘n moontlike nuttige instrument in grond klassifikasie te demonstreer. Die skepping van ‘n wingerd is ‘n lang termyn en duur belegging waarvan die opbrengs en kwaliteit beinvloed sal word deur vele faktore, onder andere die tipe grond, wynbou voorbereidings en die klimaat. Inligiting oor die verskillende grond tipes in ‘n wingerd is daarom onmisbaar vir die optimalisering van land gebruik in betrekking tot die wingerdstok kultivar, wyn kwaliteit en produksie. Radiometrie is toegepas om te demonstreer die toepaslikheid daaran as ‘n moontlike nuttige instrument in grond klassifikasie. Grondmonsters was verkry vanaf Kanonkop, Simonsig en Spier wingerde en hul 238 U, 232 Th en 40 K konsentrasies bepaal met die aanname dat kunsmis nie ‘n uitwerking op die resultate sou hê nie. Die verskil in 40 K konsentrasies was verwant aan die kleifraksie van die grond en het getoon dat die Kanonkop en Simonsig gronde is fyn korrelrig en kleiryk is in vergelyking met die sanderige growwe korrel grond van Spier. Die uraan en thorium konsentrasies het gedui op die samestelling van die grond en ook aangedui watter grond dieselfde is as die onderliggende rots. Die meting resultate was vergelyk met dié verkry met XSF. Die korrelasie met die radiometrie was sleg vir die uraan konsentrasies (r 2 = 0. 314) aangesien baie van die monster konsentrasies laer was as die XSF deteksie limiet. Die korrelasies was uitstekend vir beide thorium (r 2 = 0. 985) en kalium (r 2 = 0. 999). As ‘n positiewe resultaat van die studie se bevindinge was ‘n in-situ meting gedoen deur Newman et al. om ‘n Simonsig wingerd radiomeries te karteer vir grond klassifasie...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Application of crop {{production}} and protection materials {{is a crucial}} component in the high productivity of American agriculture. Agricultural chemical application is frequently needed at specific times and locations for accurate site‐specific management of crop pests. <b>Piloted</b> <b>agricultural</b> aircraft are typically used to treat large, unobstructed, continuous acreage crops and are not as efficient when working over small or obstructed plots.

This research developed a low volume spray system for use on a fully autonomous UAV to apply crop protection products on specified crop areas. This article discusses the development of the spray system and its integration with the flight control system of a fully autonomous, unmanned vertical take‐off and landing helicopter. Sprayer actuation can be triggered by preset positional coordinates as monitored by the equipped Global Positioning System (GPS). The developed spray system has the potential to provide accurate, site‐specific crop management when coupled with UAV systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a recent pilot project aimed at obtaining optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates from a group of ancient irrigation dams in central India. The dams are all situated within an area of 750 km 2 around the wellknown Buddhist site of Sanchi, the latter established in c. third century B. C. and having a continuous constructional sequence up to the twelfth century A. D. They were documented during earlier seasons of the Sanchi Survey, initiated in 1998 in order to relate the site to its wider archaeological landscape. The pilot project builds upon earlier hypotheses regarding the chronology and function of the Sanchi dams and their relationship to religious and political history in Central India. The principal suggestion is that the earliest phase of dam construction coincided with the rise of urbanization and the establishment of Buddhism in central India between c. third and second centuries B. C.; and that they were connected with wet-rice cultivation as opposed to wheat, the main agricultural staple today. Similarities with intersite patterns in Sri Lanka, where monastic landlordism is attested from c. second century B. C. onward, have also led to the working hypothesis that the Sanchi dams were central to the development of exchange systems between Buddhist monks and local <b>agricultural</b> communities. The <b>pilot</b> project focused on two {{out of a total of}} 16 dam sites in the Sanchi area and involved scraping back dam sections created by modern road cuttings. This cast new light on aspects of dam construction and allowed for the collection of sediments and ceramics for OSL dating. The results confirmed the suitability of local sediments to OSL dating methods, as well as affirming our working hypothesis that the dams were constructed-along with the earliest Buddhist monuments in Central India-in the late centuries B. C. Sediment samples were also collected from cores hand drilled in the dried-up reservoir beds, for supplementary OSL dating and pollen analysis, which shed useful insights into land use.

40|$|Malnutrition, {{especially}} {{protein deficiency}} among children, continues to affect many rural areas in Malawi. Poverty, exacerbated by declining soil fertility, erosion and drought, has lead to many poor households {{being unable to}} meet their subsistence requirements. Government programmes promoted hybrid maize, which requires expensive seed and fertilizers to achieve high yields. Credit schemes were established to provide these inputs, yet failure to repay loans lead to reprisals and resulted in farmers avoiding such schemes. Through its pastoral network the Christian Service Committee of the Churches in Malawi (CSC) recognized these problems and established its <b>Pilot</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Programme. Ten Agricultural Development Workers, each covering around 50 congregations, were deployed in eight districts {{under the supervision of}} an Agricultural Advisor. The objective was to show that churches can be an effective channel for disseminating agricultural messages - particularly to women. To achieve this, it was necessary to demonstrate, and have accepted, appropriate agricultural practices that are suited {{to the needs of the}} community. Soya beans are a palatable, readily accepted, protein source and a particularly valuable food for young children. However, they are not widely grown since the need to inoculate seed with rhizobium before planting requires a high labour input. To overcome this, a local variety known as 'Magoye' was used, which is self-inoculating using rhizobia found naturally in the soil. Yields reaching 1, 000 kg/ha under smallholder conditions indicate that soya beans can match the energy production of maize grown under similar conditions, while producing a valuable protein supplement and maintaining soil fertility. To improve soil fertility and reduce the risk of erosion, the indigenous Msangu tree (Faidherbia albida) and vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides) were introduced. The Msangu tree is unusual in that it drops its leaves at the start of the rains, providing a rich mulch and nutrients to the top soil. As a legume, it is capable of fixing nitrogen and its deep tap root mean that it can recycle nutrients leached below the reach of crops. The use of vetiver grass planted along the contour has also proved an effective means of reducing soil erosion. Farmers are now establishing their own Msangu nurseries and the demand for vetiver grass has exceeded supply.

40|$|Iran is an arid country, {{surplus water}} {{existing}} only in small {{areas in the}} northern and western parts. Much of the cultivated and potentially arable land of Iran is a considerable distance from the zones of high precipitation. For successful crop production in such areas water has to be transported from regions with excess water. In many cases this {{can be achieved by}} tapping rivers which rise in the uplands, or ground water reserves which are replenished in zones of abundant water supply. To overcome the problems associated with water supply, Iran has started {{one of the most significant}} developments within the field of water resource management, through the construction of a number of large reservoir dams. This has taken place over the last three decades. Multi-purpose dam construction schemes constitute part of the overall five national development plans of Iran which have been carried out since the Second World War. The early development plans placed emphasis on the provision of water for agricultural use. At a later stage more attention was paid to the provision of water supplies to meet the rapidly increasing demands of water for industrial and domestic use. So far the Mohamad Reza Shah Pahlavl Dam in Khuzestan has-been the largest and the most expensive dam Iran has yet commissioned. The Mohamad Reza Shah Pahlavl Dam is part of the integrated regional development plan of Khuzestan which has always been given the highest priority. The master-plan for the Khuzestan region was drawn up by the Development and Resources Corporation of New York in 1959. The plan has aimed at the maximum utilization of the land and water resources of the five major rivers of the region. The Mohamad Reza Shah Pahlavl Dam has been in operation since 1963. The objectives of the scheme are: the utilization of water from the reservoir to irrigate 124, 000 ha of the Khuzestan lowlands. In addition 520, 000 Kw-of electricity will be produced to meet the industrial and domestic electricity demands of the region. The achievement of these objectives will improve the economic and social status of the local population, who until recently were poor and their standards of living low. The objective of this study is a full appraisal of the Dez scheme, and the establishment of a proper basis for development project evaluation. With the construction of the dam, a new cropping pattern for the area was prepared, providing a diversification of crop types together with changes in the areas of crops already cultivated. Improvement of agricultural methods raised crop yields by large amounts in the Dez <b>Pilot</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Project which constituted l 6 % of the Dez Irrigation Project. The implementation of the Khuzestan lowlands project was not, however, without its problems. After the supply of regulated water, there was not the necessary incentive for the peasant farmers tousle water resources more efficiently and to raise agricultural production under the old system of landlord-peasant share cropping. As a result land reform was carried out in the Dez Irrigation Project area in 1962. By 1965 the Khuzestan Water and Power Authority, which had been established in 1960 to control and distribute the water and power from the dam, found it difficult to develop the DIP. This was because the bulk of the development budget had already been spent for the construction of the dam and its associated hydro-power installations. In addition landlords refused taco-operate in the development programme and the small farmers were incapable of large financial undertakings. The costly water from the dam was used inefficiently by the farmers and they were not able to pay water charges. In order to use water resources more efficiently and to increase agricultural production in order to become largely independent of food imports, a new phase in agrarian reform was introduced in 1968. On the lands downstream of large dams irrational fragmentation of land was prevented through the consolidation of land. As a result agro-business farms and farm corporations are being set up as alternatives to small family farms. Agro-businesses are large mechanized farms run on a commercial basis and capitalized by foreign equity participation. So far five of these companies have been established on 68, 000 ha of the Dez Irrigation Project land which were bought from the farmers and leased to companies for a long term of 30 years. In addition four farm corporations were established on a further 12, 500 ha of the land of the Dez Irrigation Project. In the long run farm corporations which are backed by free grants from the government will eventually achieve high yields as an inevitable consequence of large scale capitalist farming. Against this advantage stands the disadvantage of the rural unemployment as an unavoidable result of mechanized farming. The performance of agro-businesses has been somewhat unsuccessful. Their cost, which is imposed on the government, is high and their social impacts have been devastating. As a result a number of them have been taken over by the government and the future of the rest is a controversial topic. The only successful project of the Dez scheme is the government sugar cane project of Haft-Tappeh. Although the project is costly, its great advantage is the creation of Jobs for thousands of skilled and unskilled local people. The hydro-power project of the Dez dam scheme has been in operation since 1963 and all the generators were installed by 1971. The social Impacts of the project have been considerable. However, the high electricity tariff has discouraged the development programmes to a higher extent than was initially expected. As a result of the lack of an electricity market in Khuzestan, electricity has been transferred to Tehran at a low price. Consequently the hydro-power project has been a losing proposition so far. A consistent objective evaluation of the Dez scheme through the application of a cost-benefit analysis technique established a proper basis for the appraisal of government Investment in the supply of infrastructure for the regional development. This made it possible to determine the objective priorities and to consider alternatives for resource allocation in regional development planning. The water pricing mechanism has been used as one of the most important and immediate means for the modification of the political framework of water resource management In the Dez Irrigation Project. It is very likely that the new price of water will encourage efficiency in water use in the Dez Irrigation Project. The model outlined in this study for water pricing can be tested and applied for other irrigation schemes, yet its application is conditional to reliable statistics and data availability. Today after almost two decades of operation of the Mohamad Reza Shah Pahlavl Dam it is well recognised that the operation of the dam has not had the expected beneficial effect on the local agricultural economy. The reasons for this are varied and Include environmental, economic and social factors. These factors are defined in an analytical way in this study...|$|R
