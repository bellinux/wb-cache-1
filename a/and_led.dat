40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze various power quality indices and {{luminous}} efficacy of different types of luminaries (Incandescent Lamp, Fluorescent Lamp, Compact Fluorescent Lamp and Light Emitting Diode). CFLs <b>and</b> <b>LEDs</b> are considered as highly energy efficient luminaries as compared to widely prevalent, low cost incandescent lamps. The replacement of Incandescent Lamps by CFLs <b>and</b> <b>LEDs</b> have resulted in reduction in active power consumption, a reduction in peak current and reduction in distribution system losses. All these aspects have positive impact on energy consumption. However, the other aspect – viz. harmonic distortions in CFLs <b>and</b> <b>LEDs</b> is not being appropriately addressed, which might cause unforeseen problems in the power supply grids, particularly in rural feeders in India. The paper represents comparative analysis of luminous efficacy, distortion power and power factor occurring in different types of luminaries (as defined in IEEE – 1459 : 2000 Standard) ...|$|R
