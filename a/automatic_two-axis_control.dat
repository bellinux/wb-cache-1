Researchers predict the need for an integrated platform in order to implement useful computation, and decades of advancements in silicon microelectronics fabrication lends itself to this challenge. However, fundamental concerns have been raised about the MOS interface (e. g. trap noise, variations in electron g-factor and practical implementation of multi-QDs). Furthermore, <b>two-axis</b> <b>control</b> of silicon qubits has, to date, required the integration of non-ideal components (e. g. microwave strip-lines, micro-magnets, triple quantum dots, or introduction of donor atoms).

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} theoretical-experimental {{study of the}} dynamical decoupling (DD) of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We investigate the DD sequences applied to suppress the dephasing of the electron spin of the NV center induced by the coupling to a spin bath composed of the substitutional nitrogen atoms. The decoupling efficiency of various DD schemes is studied, including both periodic and aperiodic pulse sequences. For ideal control pulses, {{we find that the}} DD protocols with the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) timing of the pulses provides best performance. We show that, as the number of control pulses increases, the decoupling fidelity scaling differs qualitatively from the predictions of the Magnus expansion, and explain the origin of this difference. In particular, more advanced symmetrized or concatenated protocols do not improve the DD performance. Next, we investigate the impact of the systematic instrumental pulse errors in different periodic and aperiodic pulse sequences. The DD protocols with the single-axis control do not preserve all spin components {{in the presence of the}} pulse errors, and the <b>two-axis</b> <b>control</b> is needed. We demonstrate that the <b>two-axis</b> <b>control</b> sequence with the CPMG timing is very robust with respect to the pulse errors. The impact of the pulse errors can be diminished further by symmetrizing this protocol. For all protocols studied here, we present a detailed account of the pulse error parameters which make the strongest impact on the DD performance.

For three-axis control more than one offset boom (orthogonal to each other) is required. For <b>two-axis</b> <b>control</b> with a single boom offset from a symmetrical hub, an analytic solution is obtained; when this system is used for nutation decay the time constant is one order of magnitude smaller than previously achieved using non-optimal control logic.

Anticipating potentially deleterious effects of physiological deconditioning from orbital living (simulated here by 10 days of enforced bedrest) upon a shuttle pilot's ability to manually control his aircraft (should that be necessary in an emergency) a comprehensive battery of measurements was made roughly every 1 / 2 minute on eight military pilot subjects, over two 20 -minute reentry Gz vs. time profiles, one peaking at 2 Gz and the other at 3 Gz.

We further demonstrate that the strong capacitive coupling allows fast conditional Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferences with conditonal π phase flip time about 80 ps, showing promising pathways toward multi-qubit entanglement control in semiconductor quantum dots.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} three axis control can be {{achieved}} with magnetorquers as sole actuators in a low Earth orbit. It considers the problem from a time-varying, nonlinear system {{point of view and}} suggests controllers for three-axis stabilization. A rigorous stability analysis is presented, and detailed simulation results show convincing performance over the entire envelope of operation of the Danish Ørsted satellite. Key words: Attitude control, satellite control, time-varying systems, periodic motion, Lyapunov stability, quaternion feedback. 1 Introduction Several control methods have been developed over the past years since the first satellite was launched. Generally speaking all those techniques may be classified as active or passive. Active techniques are needed for missions where high pointing accuracy is vital, and typical actuators are: gas jets, reaction or momentum wheels and electromagnetic coils. Magnetic torquing is attractive for small, cheap satellites in low Earth orbits. Magnetic control systems are relatively lightweight, require low power and are inexpensive. These were the main reason to suggest this actuation principle for the Danish Ørsted satellite mission in an early phase when a spin-stabilized mission, i. e. <b>two-axis</b> <b>control</b> Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 17 February was foreseen. Later redefinition of the scientific objectives required an alternation of the control requirements to three-axis stabilization. The challenge was that three-axis control was not possible with an actuation principle that leaves the system controllable in only two degrees of freedom because the control torque can only be generated perpendicular to the local magnetic field of the Earth. There is extensive literature covering satellite attitude control design. [...] ...|$|R

The 2. 3 -kW ion engine, which provided primary propulsion and <b>two-axis</b> attitude <b>control,</b> thrusted for more than 16, 000 hr and consumed more than 70 kg of xenon propellant. The Deep Space 1 spacecraft was launched on October 24, 1998, to validate 12 futuristic technologies, including the ion-propulsion system.
