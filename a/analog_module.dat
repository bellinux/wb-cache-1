40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, a new {{approach}} of fuzzy modeling with emphasis on analog hardware implementation is suggested. In the suggested approach, the input space of each input variable is partitioned independently through the modified form of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to generate the membership functions. By considering all the possible combinations between the membership functions of the input variables and the cluster centers, the complete rule-base is generated through reference to the available input-output data. The output membership functions are taken to be singletons for easy and straightforward implementation in analog domain. The created rule-base is then optimized through the exhaustive search techniques suggested by the authors. The suggested approach has been applied on fuzzy controller data for rapid Nickel-Cadmium batteries charger developed [1]. The data for the batteries charger has been obtained through experimentation with an objective to charge the batteries as fast as possible. Special purpose <b>analog</b> <b>modules,</b> designed by the authors and realized with operational amplifiers (op-amps), diodes, resistors are considered for hardware implementation.

In recent years, both electric utility and customer very concern about power quality changing because of some reasons such as more load devices are more sensitive to it than past time. Therefore, there is demand of power quality monitoring system which encouraged by the need of improving system power quality performance. This final project is purposed to arrange monitoring system that consists of resistive voltage dividers, clamp-on current transformers, data acquisition devices (DAQ) SCXI and monitoring program which is designed by using graphical programming language LabVIEW 8. 6. Parameters which are used as monitoring basis are 3 phase voltage signals to neutral (Van, Vbn, Vcn), neutral voltage to ground (Vng), 3 phase current signals and neutral current (Ia, Ib, Ic, In). Monitoring {{can be carried out}} based on either real signal or simulation signal which can be used for power quality study. Monitoring results can be compared with power quality standard to detect deviation. Afterwards it is can be saved in different formats. Measurement result testing was undertaken by comparing measurement result of monitoring system with power quality analyzer Analyst 3 Q which is used as reference. Testing result shows that measurement results with small error are voltage, current, frequency, phase angle cos phi, active power, apparent power, voltage unbalance factor and low order harmonics measurement whereas measurement results with high error are reactive power and high order harmonics. These errors are caused by some factors such as current transformers phase angle shift and the existence of Low Pass Filter in <b>analog</b> <b>module</b> input.
