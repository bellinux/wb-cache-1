500|$|In July 2006, {{she started}} working with Danja, who {{contacted}} songwriters such as Keri Hilson, Jim Beanz, Marcella Araica and Corte Ellis to work with him. The team wrote seven tracks for Spears: [...] "Gimme More", [...] "Break the Ice", [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)", [...] "Hot as Ice", [...] "Perfect Lover", [...] "Outta This World" [...] and [...] "Get Back". Danja explained that the creative process was not difficult at first since he was [...] "left to do pretty much whatever I wanted to", and [...] "if she felt it, she was gonna ride with it. If she didn't, you'd see it in her face." [...] Hilson wrote [...] "Gimme More" [...] with Spears in mind after Danja played her the instrumental, saying, [...] "I just started singing, 'Give me, Give me' and added a little more in and just having fun and messing around really." [...] Spears began recording with them at Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas in August 2006, while she was seven months pregnant with Jayden James. Recording continued at Spears' house in Los Angeles, three weeks after she gave birth. Hilson commented that [...] "She gave 150 percent. [...] I don't know any other mother that would do that." [...] Danja added that despite all her problems in her personal life, [...] "As far as her work ethic, I haven't seen anybody come in like that <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> go to do." [...] Regarding {{the sound of the}} album, he deemed it as bigger, more mature and [...] "a new Britney", explaining: [...] "I come from hip-hop, so it's underlined with , but I throw it down." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Gaskarth, [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)" [...] is a up-tempo {{track that}} begins the album with [...] "a great guitar hook {{and lots of}} energy." [...] He said the song talks about [...] "feeling like you're being {{stretched}} to your limits by somebody. Gaskarth visited Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo at his house and ended up co-writing [...] "I Feel Like Dancin'". He called Cuomo [...] "such a cool guy to work with." [...] Gaskarth said the track was [...] "an ode to {{having a good time}} and not taking yourself too seriously." [...] Barakat called the track [...] "a great song ... It has a cool Weezer/All Time Low/party hybrid-vibe to it." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Forget About It" [...] details [...] "that place in a relationship where people have been together for a really long time and they're afraid to let go." [...] Despite this, he said it was [...] "a totally fun song." [...] Gaskarth said [...] "Guts" [...] was [...] "about finding within yourself the ability to say <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want no matter what the repercussions might be." [...] Maja Ivarsson from The Sounds provides guest vocals on the track. Gaskarth said Ivarsson was [...] "someone I’ve always respected vocally". He added that the pair [...] "both sound really similar ... she definitely sounds like a girl and I sorta sound like a girl so there’s a weird mix that happens but trust me it works for the song." [...] He called the track [...] "a departure for us as it's more universal and timeless than we've ever been." ...|$|E

40|$|Software {{development}} within regulated settings {{is becoming}} more and more common place. Compliance typically involves saying <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say. However, in some domains, especially safety-critical ones, it needs to be more than simply following the rules, and should be something which everybody in the organisation supports in their daily tasks. This can be difficult to achieve and requires an organisational transformation, but once begun, sets the foundation on which the software development process can evolve...|$|R

5000|$|... "Rebel Love Song" [...] is {{the fifth}} single by American rock band, Black Veil Brides, and the third single from their second album Set the World on Fire.
