5|$|In 1907, John Clark Udall oversaw {{construction}} of a north wing, {{increasing the number of}} rooms to 150. In 1909, Udall oversaw a 72-room seven-story west wing, further increasing the rooms to 221. In Germany, it was advertised in January 1909 that the management of the Briarcliff Lodge and its architect Guy King planned to construct the platform to launch and dock <b>airships,</b> to cost $100,000. The platform would extend over the whole roof, and the tracks for the airship launch would be on an incline 105 meters long. The plans also included the purchase of a searchlight to guide the <b>airships.</b> A mooring mast for docking <b>airships</b> was constructed on top of the west wing, however no record exists of it having been used. The mooring mast nonetheless was the first built for docking <b>airships.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first hydrogen-filled balloon {{was invented}} by Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen {{provided}} the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid <b>airships</b> lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; {{the first of which}} had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident. Hydrogen-lifted <b>airships</b> were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.|$|E
5|$|An {{offer of}} four Type Zero <b>airships</b> {{was turned down}} due to doubts about their {{usability}} above 6,000feet and the expense of replacing the envelopes, which were estimated to have a useful life of only three months in the harsh South African sunshine.|$|E
50|$|SSSR-V6 OSOAVIAKhIM (СССР-В6 ОСОАВИАХИМ) was a {{semi-rigid}} <b>airship</b> {{constructed as}} part of the Soviet <b>airship</b> program and designed by the Italian engineer and <b>airship</b> designer Umberto Nobile. The <b>airship</b> was named after the Soviet organisation OSOAVIAKhIM. V6 was the largest <b>airship</b> built in the Soviet Union {{and one of the most}} successful. In October 1937, it set a new world record for <b>airship</b> endurance of 130 hours 27 minutes under command of Ivan Pankow, beating the previous record by the German <b>airship</b> Graf Zeppelin.|$|R

5|$|Helium {{produced}} between 1930 and 1945 {{was about}} 98.3% pure (2% nitrogen), which was adequate for <b>airships.</b> In 1945, {{a small amount}} of 99.9% helium was produced for welding use. By 1949, commercial quantities of Grade A 99.95% helium were available.|$|E
5|$|Myers made {{passenger}} balloons for the St. Louis Fair in 1904. He was {{the superintendent}} of the Aeronautic Concourse of the St. Louis World's Fair. He {{was one of the}} managers in charge of a purse of $200,000 prize money for various balloon tournaments and races. He pointed out that building <b>airships</b> was very expensive and took knowledge of advanced balloon techniques that basically nobody in America had. Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six <b>airships</b> he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge. The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75,000 to 100,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It has {{important}} scientific and engineering applications for near-space platform {{to design the}} buoyancy-lifting aircraft with both bigger volume and higher aerodynamic efficiency. This paper provided a design of a new concept V-shaped <b>airship</b> which has a capacity of buoyancy-lifting configuration than the same-weight class conventional <b>airship.</b> In addition, two engines could provide rolling, yawing and pitching moments for the V-shaped <b>airship</b> by changing directions and creating different thrust. Based on the thick aerofoil, the geometry of this V-shaped configuration was then used to develop an aerodynamic estimating model for the V-shaped <b>airship.</b> It renewed estimating methods for the added mass, inertia, the forces and the moments including aerodynamic and engine thrust of the V-shaped <b>airship.</b> Then this paper described a 6 Degree of Freedom (DOF) dynamic model for the V-shaped <b>airship.</b> The open-loop disturbance characteristic of the dynamic model was analyzed {{across a range of}} flight conditions and the added mass of the V-shaped <b>airship</b> were compared with the same weight-class teardrop-shaped dull-hull <b>airship.</b> Finally, the characteristics of buoyancy and lift between V-shaped <b>airship</b> and dull-hull <b>airship</b> were compared at different velocity. The results show that the aerodynamic efficiency of the V-shaped <b>airship</b> is improved obviously from the same-weight class dull-hull <b>airship</b> across a range of flight velocity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Airship</b> virtual {{simulator}} {{was developed}} by programming {{the solution of the}} <b>airship</b> equations of motion to Matlab GUI. This paper shows a case study done by applying the physical data of a designed <b>airship</b> called ‘UTHM’s Airship’ in the <b>airship</b> equations of motion for development of <b>airship</b> virtual simulator. In this study, the approximate and calculated stability modes of the designed <b>airship</b> were compared for validation purposes. The virtual simulator operates by selecting the desired control angle of elevator, rudder or vectored thrust as input and the response outputs are shown in motion of pitch, yaw or roll angle through a moving <b>airship</b> figure in the simulator. At the end of this paper, the virtual simulator had successfully helped interprets the response of the designed <b>airship</b> into an interesting and easy to understand visualization. </p...|$|R
5|$|The GA sector {{operates}} {{a range of}} aircraft, including balloons and <b>airships,</b> gliders, hang gliders, paragliders, microlights, gyrocopters, helicopters, amateur built and mass-produced light aircraft, ex-military aircraft, and business jets. Flights can be broadly categorised as public transport, aerial work, and private flying, the first {{two of which are}} commercial activities.|$|E
5|$|The aerial robots vary {{in design}} from fixed wing airplanes, to {{conventional}} helicopters, to ducted fans, to <b>airships,</b> and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of the United States set up the National Helium Reserve in 1925 at Amarillo, Texas, {{with the goal of}} supplying military <b>airships</b> in time of war and commercial <b>airships</b> in peacetime. Because of the Helium Control Act (1927), which banned the export of scarce helium on which the US then had a production monopoly, together with the prohibitive cost of the gas, the Hindenburg, like all German Zeppelins, was forced to use hydrogen as the lift gas. The helium market after World War II was depressed but the reserve was expanded in the 1950s to ensure a supply of liquid helium as a coolant to create oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel (among other uses) during the Space Race and Cold War. Helium use in the United States in 1965 was more than eight times the peak wartime consumption.|$|E
50|$|From 1942-1944, <b>airship</b> {{military}} personnel grew from 430 to 12,400 and approximately 1,400 <b>airship</b> pilots and 3,000 support crew were formally {{trained in the}} military <b>airship</b> crew training programs.|$|R
50|$|Again {{the example}} of an <b>airship</b> is {{convenient}} for discussing the forces that are at work. When the <b>airship</b> has a velocity relative to the Earth in latitudinal direction then {{the weight of the}} <b>airship</b> {{is not the same as}} when the <b>airship</b> is stationary with respect to the Earth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>airship</b> {{was built}} in 1967 by Malcolm Brighton. It was only the second British <b>airship</b> to be built post-war, the first being the <b>Airship</b> Club's 1951 Bournemouth. It {{was also the first}} British <b>airship</b> to be mainly filled with helium rather than hydrogen, though it was topped up with hydrogen.|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, young {{children}} tell their {{versions of the}} invasion. They draw pictures of their families, kids with harnesses and the alien <b>airships.</b> Tom Mason's (Noah Wyle) son, Matt, tells Anne Glass (Moon Bloodgood) that his mother died during the attacks and his older brother, Ben, was kidnapped. He then shows her {{a picture of his}} father and oldest brother, Hal (Drew Roy). Matt informs Anne that they are fighting.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to be mounted with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German <b>airships.</b> The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E
5|$|Myers {{said that}} he was working on defense {{balloons}} that could stop them in case of an attack against the United States through a company in Chicago, known as the Chicago Captive Balloon Company. The newspapers printed a counterview that warned against Jingoism and starting rumors that could lead to developing unwanted war <b>airships</b> or a cause for other nations to make military equipment against this new war technology.|$|E

5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with <b>airships</b> and ducted fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, <b>airships</b> and {{balloons}} are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
5000|$|Italia was an N-class {{semi-rigid}} <b>airship,</b> designation N-4. In design it {{was almost}} identical to the N-1 Norge but slightly larger in gas capacity. Little is known of <b>airship</b> N-2. <b>Airship</b> N-3 was sold to Japan and became [...] "Naval <b>Airship</b> No. 6". Nobile {{and some of his}} staff traveled to Japan in 1926 or 1927 to deliver this <b>airship.</b> According to Italian sources, <b>airship</b> N-5 (which was larger and had three times the lifting capacity of N-1) was Nobile's preferred design for the Arctic expedition, but when funding was refused by the Italian government he built N-4 with the assistance of private backers and the City of Milan. In May 1928 the Italia set off for the Arctic Circle, stopping at a German <b>airship</b> hangar at Stolp, Pomerania, and the <b>airship</b> mast at Vadsø in Norway.|$|R

5|$|Mist is {{responsible}} for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large <b>airships,</b> and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.|$|E
