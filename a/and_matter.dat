5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved. QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make a clear {{distinction}} between the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic theology differentiates between soul <b>and</b> <b>matter.</b> Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies contributes to the karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising the body and the passions.|$|E
5|$|Matter falling onto {{a compact}} object {{is one of}} the most {{efficient}} mechanisms for releasing energy in the form of radiation, <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> falling onto black holes is thought to be responsible for some of the brightest astronomical phenomena imaginable. Notable examples of great interest to astronomers are quasars and other types of active galactic nuclei. Under the right conditions, falling matter accumulating around a black hole can lead to the formation of jets, in which focused beams of matter are flung away into space at speeds near that of light.|$|E

With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, {{he was the first}} to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation. William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether <b>and</b> <b>Matter,</b> a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Universe can {{be defined}} as {{everything}} that exists, everything that has existed, and everything that will exist. According to our current understanding, the Universe consists of spacetime, forms of energy (including electromagnetic radiation <b>and</b> <b>matter),</b> and the physical laws that relate them. The Universe encompasses all of life, all of history, and some philosophers and scientists suggest that it even encompasses ideas such as mathematics and logic.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|Second, all {{solutions}} {{suggest that}} there was a gravitational singularity in the past, when R went to zero <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> and energy were infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain because {{it is based on the}} questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, R grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when R had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the Big Bang model of the Universe. Understanding the singularity of the Big Bang likely requires a quantum theory of gravity, which has not yet been formulated.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{evolution}} of galaxies is by the incompatibility between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter.</b> Due to the structural difference, baryonic <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> dark <b>matter</b> are incompatible {{to each other as}} oil droplet and water in emulsion. In the interfacial zone between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter,</b> this incompatibility generates the modification of Newtonian dynamics to keep dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter</b> apart. The five periods of baryonic structure development in the order of increasing incompatibility are the free baryonic matter, the baryonic droplet, the galaxy, the cluster, and the supercluster periods. The transition to the baryonic droplet generates density perturbation in the CMB. In the galaxy period, the first-generation galaxies include elliptical, normal spiral, barred spiral, irregular, and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In the cluster period, the second-generation galaxies include modified giant ellipticals, cD, evolved S 0, dwarf elliptical, BCD, and tidal dwarf galaxies. The whole observable expanding universe behaves as one unit of emulsion with increasing incompatibility between dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter.</b> The properties of dark <b>matter</b> <b>and</b> baryonic <b>matter</b> are based on cosmology derived from the two physical structures: the space structure and the object structure. Baryonic matter can be described by the periodic table of elementary particles. Comment: 43 pages, 13 figures, 2 table...|$|R
5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit <b>and</b> <b>matter.</b> Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E

25|$|The mind–body {{problem in}} {{philosophy}} examines {{the relationship between}} mind <b>and</b> <b>matter,</b> {{and in particular the}} relationship between consciousness and the brain. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind <b>and</b> <b>matter.</b> Monism maintains {{that there is only one}} kind of stuff, and that mind <b>and</b> <b>matter</b> are both aspects of it. The problem was addressed by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, and was famously addressed by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism.
