However,most of these operators {{were designed for}} images and do {{not take into account}} the temporal consistencyinherent in a video sequence. Consequently, the appearance of temporal artifacts impairs the qualityof the tone mapped video content. We propose, in this article, to classify temporal artifacts into differenttypes: flickering, temporal contrast and object incoherency.

5000|$|The {{neurotransmitter}} systems {{involved in}} wheel-running behavior have received considerable study. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} changes in both dopaminergic and serotonergic <b>tone</b> <b>alter</b> running-wheel activity. For example, one study in mice has shown that several antidepressant medications (all of which directly or indirectly enhance serotonergic tone) suppress running-wheel activity without suppressing general locomotion. The endocannabinoid system also contributes to wheel running in a sex-specific manner in rodents. [...] Mice from lines that have been selectively bred for high levels of voluntary wheel running have altered responsiveness to drugs that alter dopamine and endocannabinoid signalling, and enlarged midbrains.|$|R

We were driving one {{afternoon}} on the hills beyond the town, among the myrtle and lentisk scrub, when we noticed in front of us a nice victoria, containing two ladies in very deep mourning. We followed it, unintentionally, as far as Le Grand Pin--that big pine tree that looks across the bay towards Antibes. There, the ladies descended and sat down on a knoll, gazing out disconsolately towards the sea and the islands. It was evident they were suffering very deep grief. Their faces were pale and their eyes bloodshot. [...] "Poor things!" [...] Amelia said. Then her <b>tone</b> <b>altered</b> suddenly.|$|R

40|$|Tone is an {{essential}} component for word formation in all tone languages. It plays {{a very important role}} in the transmission of information in speech communication. In this paper, we look at using support vector machines (SVMs) for <b>automatic</b> <b>tone</b> recognition in continuously spoken Cantonese, which is well known for its complex tone system. An adaptive log-scale 5 -level F 0 normalization method is proposed to reduce the tone-irrelevant variation of F 0 values. Furthermore, an extended version of the above normalization method that considers intonation is also presented. A tone recognition accuracy of 71. 50 % has been obtained in a speaker-independent task. This result compares favorably with the results reported earlier for the same task. Considerable improvement has been achieved by adopting this tone recognition scheme in a speaker-independent Cantonese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task...|$|R

40|$|Acute {{exposure}} to alveolar hypoxia triggers reversible hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), whereas prolonged exposure, as occurring in high-altitude inhabitants or {{in patients with}} respiratory diseases, causes pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH is characterized by potentiated vascu-lar <b>tone,</b> <b>altered</b> reactivity to agonists, and profound vascular remodeling, eventually leading to right heart (RV) hypertrophy and failure. 1 Although the mechanism of pathogenesis is com-plex, the intrinsic changes in Ca 2 + homeostasis in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) are the major determi-nants contributing to PASMC proliferation and vasoconstric-tion in chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CHPH). 2 Cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration is regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + release and extracellular Ca 2 + influx, which is gated by voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels and voltage-independent nonselec-tive cation channels.
