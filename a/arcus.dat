5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, <b>arcus,</b> pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|High {{cholesterol}} levels normally do not cause any symptoms. Yellow deposits of cholesterol-rich fat {{may be seen}} in various places on the body such as around the eyelids (known as xanthelasma palpebrarum), the outer margin of the iris (known as <b>arcus</b> senilis corneae), and in the tendons of the hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the Achilles tendon (known as a tendon xanthoma).|$|E

5|$|P. c. <b>arcus</b> was {{the name}} given to populations that {{are found in the}} Rainbow Mountains area and {{headwaters}} of the Dean and Bella Coola Rivers of the central Coast Ranges, British Columbia. Described by Miller in 1950, it is often recognized as P. c. obscurus.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal <b>arcus</b> may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus <b>arcus</b> clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

5|$|Friends of the High Line {{maintains}} an office on Washington Street, near the park's southern end. The organization has 80 full-time year-round employees and roughly 150 full-time employees {{during the summer}} season. It has been run by president and co-founder Josh David after former Executive Director Jenny Gersten stepped down in 2014. Previously, fellow co-founder Robert Hammond served as executive director until stepping down in February 2013. Friends of the High Line also has a 38-member board of directors consisting of many New York City businesspeople and philanthropists, including Amanda Burden of Bloomberg Associates, Jane Lauder of Estée Lauder Companies, Jon Stryker of the <b>Arcus</b> Foundation, and Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, <b>arcus</b> are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of King Henry I, in 1100, his wife Queen Matilda (or Maud), {{directed}} that the road should be routed further south, and paid for two bridges, one to cross the Lee {{and the other to}} cross the Channelsea River, from her own funds. She also paid for the road to be built between them, and the location of the bridge became known as Stratford-atte-Boghe, later Stratford-le-Bow, and finally dropped Stratford to become Bow or Bow Bridge. John Leland, writing in the 1500s, gives a more fanciful account, in which the queen falling into the water prompted the action. The addition of le-Bow probably had less to do with the shape of the bridge than the fact that arch was derived from <b>arcus,</b> meaning bow. This was the style of French bridges rather than the Anglo Saxon straight construction, and its design gave it its name.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{the inverse}} {{trigonometric}} functions (occasionally also called <b>arcus</b> functions, antitrigonometric functions or cyclometric functions) are the inverse {{functions of the}} trigonometric functions (with suitably restricted domains).
