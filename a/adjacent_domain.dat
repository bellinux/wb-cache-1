60|$|Meanwhile {{the light}} quickened, and {{gradually}} disclosed {{the form and}} outline of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain.</b> An avenue cut through a park-like wood, carefully cleared of the undergrowth of gigantic ferns peculiar to the locality, led {{to the entrance of}} the canada. Here began a vast terrace of lawn, broken up by enormous bouquets of flower-beds bewildering in color and profusion, from which again rose the flowering vines and trailing shrubs that hid pillars, veranda, and even the long facade of a great and dominant mansion. But the delicacy of floral outlines running to the capitals of columns and at times mounting to the pediment of the roof, the opulence of flashing color or the massing of tropical foliage, could not deprive it of the imperious dignity of size and space. Much of this was {{due to the fact that}} the original casa--an adobe house of no mean pretensions, dating back to the early Spanish occupation--had been kept intact, sheathed in a shell of dark-red wood, and still retaining its patio; or inner court-yard, surrounded by low galleries, while additions, greater in extent than the main building, had been erected--not as wings and projections, but massed upon it on either side, changing its rigid square outlines to a vague parallelogram. While the patio retained the Spanish conception of al fresco seclusion, a vast colonnade of veranda on the southern side was a concession to American taste, and its breadth gave that depth of shadow to the inner rooms which had been lost in the thinner shell of the new erection. Its cloistered gloom was lightened by the red fires of cardinal flowers dropping from the roof, by the yellow sunshine of the jessamine creeping up the columns, by billows of heliotropes breaking over its base as a purple sea. Nowhere else did the opulence of this climate of blossoms show itself as vividly. Even the Castilian roses, that grew as vines along the east front, the fuchsias, that attained the dignity of trees, in the patio, or the four or five monster passion-vines that bestarred the low western wall, and told over and over again their mystic story--paled before the sensuous glory of the south veranda.|$|E

40|$|The dipole {{patterns}} in the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric structures are drawn according to experimentally determined symmetry changes in the ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. For the ferroelectrics the dipoles of the unit cells for one domain are oriented in parallel and the directions of the polarisation in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> are at definite angles to each other. It is assumed for the antiferroelectrics, that the superstructural unit cell is formed by the adjacent cells of the paraelectrical modification; the subcells having the antiparallel directions of the polarisation. It is these superstructural cells of the antiferroelectrics that are determined during the experimental investigations of the antiferroelectrics. The superstructural cells of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> are different. In one case, {{the difference is that}} in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains,</b> the directions of the polarisation in the subcells form an angle (e. g., in PbZrO 3).

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{proteins}} to regulate their own enzymatic activity can be facilitated {{by changes in}} structure or protein dynamics in response to external regulators. Because many proteins contain SH 2 and SH 3 domains, transmission of information between the domains is a potential method of allosteric regulation. To determine if ligand binding to one modular domain may alter structural dynamics in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain,</b> allowing potential transmission of information through the protein, we used hydrogen exchange and mass spectrometry to measure changes in protein dynamics in the SH 3 and SH 2 domains of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck). Ligand binding to either domain {{had little or no}} effect on hydrogen exchange in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain,</b> suggesting that changes in protein structure or dynamics are not a means of SH 2 /SH 3 crosstalk. Furthermore, ligands of varying affinity covalently attached to SH 3 /SH 2 altered dynamics only in the domain to which they bind. Such results demonstrate that ligand binding may not structurally alter adjacent SH 3 /SH 2 domains and implies that other aspects of protein architecture contribute to the multiple levels of regulation in proteins containing SH 3 and SH 2 domains...|$|E

Classical cadherins are trans-membrane glycoproteins that use their extracellular domains to establish calcium-dependent trans homophilic interactions with cadherins in neighboring cells. To enhance adhesive strength, cadherin ectodomains oligomerize through lateral (cis) inter-actions, whereas their cytoplasmic domains anchor to the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins is highly conserved and binds to proteins called catenins. p 120 -catenin (p 120) associates with the transmembrane <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> (juxtamembrane; JMD) of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail, whereas -catenin interacts with the more distal portion of cad-herin’s cytoplasmic domain. -Catenin in turn, binds -catenin, which, through multiple interactions, both indirect and direct...|$|E

Although various components of the ECM have been enumerated, mechanisms that evolve the sophisticated ECM architecture remain to be addressed. Here we show that periostin, a matricellular protein, promotes incorporation of tenascin-C into the ECM and organizes a meshwork architecture of the ECM. We found that both periostin null mice and tenascin-C null mice exhibited a similar phenotype, confined tibial periostitis, which possibly corresponds to medial tibial stress syndrome in human sports injuries. Periostin possessed <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> that bind to tenascin-C and the other ECM protein: fibronectin and type I collagen, respectively. These <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> functioned as a bridge between tenascin-C and the ECM, which increased deposition of tenascin-C on the ECM. The deposition of hexabrachions of tenascin-C may stabilize bifurcations of the ECM fibrils, which is integrated into the extracellular meshwork architecture.

40|$|The {{human growth}} hormone (hGH) gene is {{controlled}} by a long-range enhancer, HSI, located 14. 5 kb 5 ′ to the hGH promoter. HSI establishes a domain of noncoding transcription that is ‘looped ’ to the hGH promoter as an essential step in initiating hGH gene expression. Thus, defining how HSI generates its do-main of noncoding transcription is central to under-standing its long-range function. Here, we demon-strate that activation of noncoding transcription re-flects an HSI-autonomous activity fully independent of interactions with linked gene promoters and oc-curring in spatial and temporal synchrony with initia-tion of GH expression in the embryonic pituitary. HSI establishes its noncoding transcription start sites (TSS) over a defined distance from its core deter-minants and in a manner independent of local pri-mary sequences. The interval between HSI and it TSS co-maps with a domain of disordered and/or highly mobile nucleosomes specific to the pituitary locus. Thus, a localized chromatin reconfiguration by HSI and consequent establishment of an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> of noncoding transcription constitute initi-ating events in long-range enhancer function within the hGH locus...|$|E

Here, we investigate the existence of cell lineage restrictions along the proximal–distal (PD) axis of the wing disc. We rule out the existence of classical compartment boundaries in the hinge region, but demonstrate that there are clonal restrictions corresponding to the expression domains of two transcription factors, Nubbin (Nub) and Teashirt (Tsh), present in distal and proximal cells, respectively. Unlike classical compartments, the Nub and Tsh domains do not define absolute lineage restrictions. Instead, due to regulation by Wingless signaling, the Nub and Tsh expression boundaries shift during development. Once established, the Nub and Tsh domains, and the intervening region in which neither factor is expressed, grow independently, because the progeny of cells present in one domain do not freely populate an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain.</b> We also show that despite shifting position, the Nub and Tsh domain boundaries, like compartment boundaries, impact the expression of secreted signaling molecules.

DNA strands are modelled using a coarse-grained dynamic bonding model [C. Svaneborg, Comp. Phys. Comm. 183, 1793 (2012) ]. We observe a complex transition {{path from the}} initial state to the final state of the AND gate.

We have also characterised the bound and unbound kinetics of single strandsÂž {{and in particular the}} kinetics of the total AND operation and the three distinct distinct DNA transitions that it is based on. We observe a exponential kinetic dependence on the toehold length of the competitive displacement operation, but that the gate operation time is only weakly dependent on both the toehold and <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> length. Our gate displays excellent logical fidelity in three input states, and quite poor fidelity in the fourth input state. This illustrates how non-ideality can have very selective effects on fidelity.
