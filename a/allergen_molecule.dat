40|$|The {{characterization}} of an allergen is a troublesome and difficult process, as it requires both the precise biochemical {{characterization of}} a (glyco) protein molecule {{and the establishment}} of its susceptibility to IgE antibodies, as they are themain link to histamine release in some hypersensitivity states (type I allergies). As the characterization of an allergen includes molecular weight determination of the allergenic molecule, its structure determination, physicochemical properties, IgE binding properties of the <b>allergen</b> <b>molecule,</b> and its allergenicity, an overal review of which biochemical and immunochemical methods are used in achieving this goal are presented in this paper. The information on the molecular level on the stuctures of allergens indicates that allergens are considerably heterogeneous protein structures, and that there is no particular aminoacid sequence which is responsible for the allergenicity. Therefore, information gained from detailed structural, functional and immunochemical studies of these intriguing molecules, which nowadaysmodulate a variety of pathophysiological conditions, would greatly improve our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms, and the way to handle them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon; {{subfamily}} Chloridoideae) is {{an important}} source of seasonal aeroallergens in warm tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide. Improved approaches to diagnosis and therapy of allergic diseases require a thorough understanding of the structure and epitopes on the <b>allergen</b> <b>molecule</b> that are crucial for the antigen-antibody interaction. This study describes the localization of the human IgE-binding regions of the major group 1 pollen allergen Cyn d 1 from Bermuda grass. Methods A cDNA library was constructed from Bermuda grass pollen (BGP) using a Lambda gt 11 expression vector. The gene encoding the Cyn d 1 allergen was isolated by screening the library with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against grass group 1 allergen. In order to characterize the IgE epitopes on Cyn d 1, seven overlapping fragments and three deletion mutants were cloned and over-expressed in E. coli. The recombinant fragments and deletion mutants were evaluated for their comparative IgE reactivity with sera of non atopic individuals and grass pollen allergic patients by ELISA and a dot-blot assay. Results Analysis of IgE binding regions by overlapping fragments and deletion mutants identified two major allergenic regions corresponding to amino acids 120 – 170 and 224 – 244. Deletion of either or both regions led to a significant reduction in IgE binding, emphasizing the importance of the C-terminal region on Cyn d 1 in epitope-IgE interaction. Conclusion Anti-Cyn d 1 IgE antibodies from allergic human sera recognize two epitopes located at the C-terminal end of the molecule. These data will enable the design of improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for BGP hypersensitivity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Food allergy is phenotypically an {{extremely}} heterogeneous group of diseases affecting multiple organs, sometimes {{in an isolated}} way, sometimes simultaneously, with the severity of reactions ranging from mild and local to full-blown anaphylaxis. Mechanistically, it {{is defined as a}} Th 2 -driven immune disorder in which food-specific IgE antibodies are at the basis of immediate-type adverse reactions. The sites of sensitization and symptoms do not necessarily overlap. Food allergy, which is the theme of this paper, is often confused with other adverse reactions to food of both animmune (e. g., celiac disease) and non-immune (e. g., lactose intolerance) nature. To reliably diagnose food allergy, a careful history (immediate-type reactions) needs to be complemented with demonstration of specific IgE (immune mechanism) and confirmed by an oral challenge. Co-factors such as exercise, medication, and alcohol may help trigger food allergy and further complicate accurate diagnosis. Where food extract-based diagnostic tests are poorly correlated to symptom severity, new generation molecular diagnostics that measure IgE against individual food allergens provide clinicians and patients with more reliable symptom severity risk profiles. Molecular diagnostics also support establishing whether food sensitization originates directly from exposure to food or indirectly (cross-reactivity) from pollen sensitization. Epidemiological surveys have indicated that allergy to peach primarily originates from peach consumption in Europe, whereas in China it is the result of primary sensitization to mugwort pollen, in both cases mediated by an <b>allergen</b> <b>molecule</b> from the same family. Epidemiological surveys give insight into the etiology of food allergy, the size of the problem (prevalence), and the risk factors involved, which together support evidence-based strategies for prevention. Over the past decade, food allergy has increased in the affluent world. Economic growth and urbanization in upcoming economies are likewise expected to lead to increased prevalence of food allergies, sometimes to different foods due to dietary habits. Molecular allergology and biotechnology now offer the possibility to combat the increasing burden of food allergy by developing safe immunotherapies for food allergy, using hypoallergenic mutant recombinant molecules. The first clinical trials to evaluate such approaches are underway. Last but not least, the identification and clinical risk characterization of a more and more complete list of food allergens additionally provides the allergenicity risk assessment of genetically modified foods a firmer basi...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sensitization {{in early}} {{childhood}} may precede respiratory allergy in adolescence. Methods: IgE reactivity against 132 <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> was evaluated using the MeDALL microarray in sera obtained from {{a random sample of}} 786 children at the age of 4, 8 and 16  years in a population based birth cohort (BAMSE). Symptoms were analyzed by questionnaire at ages 4, 8 and 16  years. Clinically and independent relevant <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> accounting for ≥ 90 % of IgE reactivities in sensitized individuals and at all time-points were identified as risk molecules and used to predict respiratory allergy.

Sera were obtained from children at the ages of 3, 5, 8 and 11  years (N =  248) and the outcome was studied at 11  years. Findings: In the BAMSE cohort 4 risk molecules could be identified, i. e. : Ara h 1 (peanut), Bet v 1 (birch), Fel d 1 (cat), Phl p 1 (grass). For MAAS the corresponding number of molecules was 5 : Der p 1 (dust mite), Der f 2 (dust mite), Phl p 1 (grass), Phl p 5 (grass), Fel d 1 (cat).

This also concerns allergen immunotherapy (AIT), which may be prescribed more precisely based on the component-resolved diagnosis results. However, the advance in diagnosis needs to be mirrored in AIT. According to consensus documents and to expectations of specialists, therapy {{should be based on}} standardized extracts containing measured amounts of the clinically relevant molecules, ie, the major allergens. The new generation of extracts for sublingual immunotherapy fulfills these requirements and are thus defined as biomolecular (BM). BM refers to natural extracts with a defined content of major allergens in micrograms. All Staloral BM products are indicated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis with or without asthma. The effectiveness of AIT is related to its ability to modify the immunological response of allergic subjects. The 5 -grass and house dust mite extracts were evaluated addressing the T helper 1, T helper 2, and T helper 3 cells by polymerase chain reaction array on mRNA extracted from Waldeyer&# 39;s ring tissue (adenoids). Sublingual immunotherapy with a defined content of major allergens in micrograms induced a strong downregulation of genes involved in T helper 2 and T helper 1 activation and function, allowing the definition of the immunologic effect as "bio-homeostatic". This clinical and immunological model must be implemented with respect to other allergens, thus expanding the application of a treatment with a unique disease-modifying capacity.

40|$|Recombinant Der p 2, {{expressed}} in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{was used as a}} tool to determine IgE- and monoclonal antibody (mAb) -binding sites on this allergen. For this purpose, mutant molecules were produced by application of site-directed mutagenesis. The amino-acid residues spanning cys 21 -cys 27 and cys 73 -cys 78 were deleted, thus preventing loop formation through disulfide bonds. Charged residues in three predicted antigenic sites (residues 45 - 48, 67 + 69, and 88 - 90) were replaced by alanine residues, IgE- and mAb reactivity to these mutants was compared to that to "wild type" Der p 2. Residues spanning cys 73 -cys 78 were involved in the antigenic binding site for mAb alpha DpX. Mutations in the areas adjacent to this loop (i. e., 67 + 69 and 88 - 90) had similar effects on this mAb (10 - to 20 -fold decreases in reactivity were observed), supporting the suggestion that these areas are involved in this antigenic structure. The area of residues 45 - 48 was shown to be involved in an epitope for mAb 2 B 12. The reactivity of mAb 7 A 1 was influenced by substitutions of residues 45 - 48 as well as 88 - 90. Deletion of the residues spanning cys 21 -cys 27 resulted in decreased reactivity to three mAbs (10 E 11, alpha DpX, and 7 A 1). From these observations, it may be concluded that binding of different mAbs is influenced by the same mutations and that the binding of single mAbs is influenced by two or more mutations scattered over the <b>allergen</b> <b>molecule.</b> These findings can point in two directions: minor amino-acid changes result in disruption of the overall conformation of the allergen, or distant sites are close together in the three-dimensional structure of the allergen. Decreased IgE reactivity was observed with all mutant molecules, varying between patients. The observed effects ranged from 5 - to 1000 -fold. Deletion of the amino-acid residues spanning cys 21 -cys 27 and cys 73 -cys 78 had the strongest effect on IgE reactivity, where decreases up to 1000 -fold were observed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the molecular and immunological {{characterization of the}} major group 1 pollen allergen Cyn d 1 from Bermuda grass. A Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) pollen cDNA library was constructed and a full length cDNA encoding Cyn d 1 gene was selected for further molecular and immunological characterization. Earlier studies had shown that bacterially expressed recombinant Cyn d 1 protein was non-IgE reactive {{due to lack of}} post-translational glycosylation in prokaryotic expression system. But in the present study, the expression of biologically active recombinant Cyn d 1 in E. coli was found to be reactive with serum IgE from Bermuda grass pollen sensitive patients. Further studies were undertaken to determine the IgE-binding regions of Cyn d 1 by generating a series of overlapping fragments of varying lengths covering the entire <b>allergen</b> <b>molecule.</b> These fragments were individually expressed in E. coli and the purified proteins were analysed to compare their IgE reactivity using sera pool from grass pollen allergic patients. This study led to the identification of two major IgE-binding regions and, deletion of either or both regions resulted in a significant reduction in the IgE reactivity. This information gathered from epitope mapping along with modern computational tools provided important clues to select residues to target for site directed mutagenesis for producing low IgE binding variants of Cyn d 1. To characterize the amino acid residues from Cyn d 1 which interact with IgE, the sequence was scanned by site-directed mutagenesis taking into account the sequence of homologous non allergenic 0 -expansin gene, EXPB 1, from Arabidopsis. Cyn d 1 hypoallergenic mutant forms with reduced IgE binding have been engineered based on the structural homology of non allergenic Arabidopsis beta expansin protein EXPB 1 as a model. Nine potential IgE-interacting residues were identified and characterized, and based on these residues eight mutant Cyn d 1 variants with different combinations of mutated residues were designed and produced. Three out of the eight mutants showed reduced IgE-binding capacity as studied in vitro by immunodot blot and direct ELISA analysis. Hypoallergenic forms of the Cyn d 1 allergen can aid in the development of immunotherapeutic reagents for treatment of grass pollen allergy. Due to IgE-cross-reactivity, allergic patients exhibit broad sensitization to pollens of most grass species. Allergens from different sources can show immunological cross reactivity, often resulting from conservation of IgE epitopes. Therefore, immunoblot inhibition assays were performed using recombinant proteins to test the specific pattern of cross reactivity between allergens from Bermuda grass pollen (Chloridoedeae sub family) and Rye grass pollen (Pooideae sub family). The allergen profile of Rye grass pollen comprises Lol p 1 (group 1) and Lol p 5 (group 5), the two major allergen groups, Bermuda grass pollen on the other hand contains only Cyn d 1 (group 1) allergen. The group 1 allergens show very high amino acid sequence identity (80 %) and share common epitopes. The inhibition studies revealed a high degree of cross reactivity between the group 1 allergens from both grasses but none was observed between group 1 allergen from Bermuda grass and group 5 allergen from rye grass pollen. Rye grass pollen extract completely inhibited Bermuda grass pollen extract but not vice versa. These results suggest that basis of overall low level of cross reactivity between the Pooids and Chloridooids as observed by RAST can be attributed to absence of group 5 allergen from Chloridoids. Sequence comparison has identified a homologue ((3 -expansin clone At 2 g 20750 or EXPB 1) in Arabidopsis of the Cyn d 1 gene. The EXPB 1 protein is 42 % similar to the Cyn d 1 protein. The function of some pollen allergen genes has been suggested based on their homologies with genes of known sequence. Expansins are a family of proteins that are known to induce extension of plant cell walls. A study was undertaken to determine the expression pattern of EXPB 1 in Arabidopsis. RT-PCR analysis, in situ hybridization and GFP-promoter construct were used to study the pattern of gene expression of EXPB 1 in Arabidopsis. RT-PCR analysis revealed EXPB 1 transcripts only in floral tissue and the EXPB 1 transcripts were localized in pollens by in situ hybridization. The absence of EXPB 1 transcripts in any other tissues like leaf, stem and root indicates that the EXPB 1 gene has pollen specific expression. GFP-promoter fusions showed high level of expression in tri-cellular pollen. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Molecular Allergology User's Guide (MAUG) provides comprehensive information on important allergens and describes the diagnostic options using CRD. Part A of the EAACI MAUG introduces <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules,</b> families, composition of extracts, databases, and diagnostic IgE, skin, and basophil tests. Singleplex and multiplex IgE assays with components improve both sensitivity for low-abundance allergens and analytical specificity; IgE to individual allergens can yield information on clinical risks and distinguish cross-reactivity from true primary sensitization. Part B discusses the clinical and molecular aspects of IgE-mediated allergies to foods (including nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, milk, egg, meat, fish, and shellfish), inhalants (pollen, mold spores, mites, and animal dander), and Hymenoptera venom. Diagnostic algorithms and short case histories provide useful information for the clinical workup of allergic individuals targeted for CRD. Part C covers protein families containing ubiquitous, highly cross-reactive panallergens from plant (lipid transfer proteins, polcalcins, PR- 10, profilins) and animal sources (lipocalins, parvalbumins, serum albumins, tropomyosins) and explains their diagnostic and clinical utility.

Treatment of allergic diseases with peptides may offer substantial advantages over treatment with native <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> because of the reduced potential for cross-linking IgE bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils. Methods and Findings In this study we address the mechanism of action of peptide immunotherapy (PIT) in cat-allergic, asthmatic patients. Cell-division-tracking dyes, cell-mixing experiments, surface phenotyping, and cytokine measurements were used to investigate immunomodulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after therapy. Proliferative responses of PBMCs to allergen extract were significantly reduced after PIT. This was associated with modified cytokine profiles generally characterised by an increase in interleukin- 10 and a decrease in interleukin- 5 production. CD 4 + cells isolated after PIT were able to actively suppress allergen-specific proliferative responses of pretreatment CD 4 neg PBMCs in co-culture experiments. PIT was associated with a significant increase in surface expression of CD 5 on both CD 4 + and CD 8 + PBMCs. Conclusion This study provides evidence for the induction of a population of CD 4 + T cells with suppressor/regulatory activity following PIT. Furthermore, up-regulation of cell surface levels of CD 5 may contribute to reduced reactivity to allergen. </p...|$|R

40|$|Allergic {{diseases}} {{have been}} described already in 900 AD but today allergic diseases have reached epidemic proportions. About 30 % of the world population is affected. Typical allergic symptoms of the immune system’s reaction to allergens are runny nose, red eyes or skin reactions like itching, eczema, urticaria, {{as well as more}} severe symptoms like asthma and anaphylactic reactions. The overall aim of this thesis was to identify and characterize new pet allergens and to use these to improve diagnostics and prediction of pet allergy. Furthermore, to provide a relevant platform, a mouse model reflecting chronic asthma, for the development of novel treatment strategies for cat allergy. In the first paper we studied dog saliva as a source of new <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> for improved diagnostics of allergy to dog. We show that there are at least 12 protein bands in dog saliva that are recognized by IgE antibodies from dog-allergic patients. Several of those bands were not identified in dog dander extract. Furthermore, we demonstrate that about one-fifth of patients with symptoms to dog, but lacking IgE antibodies to dog dander, were IgE positive to saliva. Dog saliva was shown to be a significant allergen source that should be taken into account for improved diagnostics of dog allergy. Combining dog dander and dog saliva or spiking dog dander extract with dog saliva would be beneficial for developing enhanced dog allergy diagnostics. In the second paper of this thesis we investigated the prevalence of sensitization to the novel cat allergen Fel d 7 in 94 cat-sensitized patients and elucidated Fel d 7 ’s allergenicity and crossreactivity with the homolog major dog lipocalin allergen Can f 1 on an epitope level. More {{than a third of the}} Swedish cat dander-sensitized patients, 39 %, were IgE positive to Fel d 7 and we could show that Fel d 7 is a biologically active allergen. Our results demonstrate that Fel d is crossreactive with Can f 1 and indicate that Fel d 7 has epitopes in common with Can f 1 which contributes to the co-sensitization observed in patients with allergy to cat and dog. Also, Can f 1 peptides spanning the Can f 1 sequence were used to map Fel d 7 binding epitopes in a 3 D model based on the known structure of a human lipocalin homolog. Paper III describes the association between sensitization patterns to individual cat and dog <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> during childhood and symptoms to these furry animals up to 16 years of age. We investigated sensitization to individual cat and dog <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> in childhood through adolescence using the BAMSE (Barn/Children Allergy/Asthma Milieu Stockholm Epidemiologic study) birth cohort. Sera and questionnaire data from 779 randomly collected children at 4, 8 and 16 years were examined. IgE reactivity to cat and dog <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> were analyzed with the MeDALL (Mechanisms for the Development of ALLergy) chip. This is the first study to elucidate the usefulness of analyzing the individual cat and dog <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> as predictors of cat and dog allergy development from childhood to adolescence. We report that IgE to Fel d 1 is as good as IgE to cat extract for diagnosis of cat allergy and IgE to Can f 1 is superior to IgE to dog allergen extract for diagnosis of dog allergy. Thus, molecular-based allergy diagnostics may offer new opportunities for improving diagnosis of pet allergy and in particular allergy to dog. The last paper presents a relevant model for cat allergen-induced asthma in mice, exhibiting features of human chronic disease. Female BALB/c mice were presensitized with rFel d 1 adsorbed to Alum and subsequently challenged intranasally (i. n.) with cat dander extract (CDE) three consecutive days per week during five weeks. The new animal model displays hallmarks of chronic allergic asthma mimicking human disease, e. g. airway hyperresponsiveness, a mixed neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammatory response in the lung, proinflammatory cytokines and remodeling in lung tissue. This paper provides a relevant model for studying chronic allergic disease induced by a natural airway allergen. Thus, the model is suitable for testing novel strategies for cat allergy vaccination, for evaluating and developing new treatments of human disease...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTSera from 27 {{patients}} with mite-sensitive allergic rhinitis, without atopic dermatitis and bronchial asthma, were examined for anti-Der f I and anti-Der f II IgE antibody contents by {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Anti-Der f I and anti-Der f II IgE antibody levels were 14. 78 ± 1. 34 and 32. 68 ± 0. 88 ng/mL (mean ± SEM), respectively. The anti-Der f II IgE antibody was predominant over the anti-Der f I IgE antibody in these patients. In comparison {{with the results of}} a previous study the present study indicates that the ratio between serum anti-Der f I and II IgE antibodies in {{patients with}} allergic rhinitis indicated the same pattern as in that of patients with bronchial asthma, while the inverse was the case in patients with atopic dermatitis. These results indicate that immunological features and major <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> could be different in different atopic diseases. At present it is not clear where this difference comes from, but the route of immunological sensitization (via respiratory tract vs via skin) might result in the difference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Anti-idiotypic {{antibodies}} (anti-ids) {{are part}} of natural immune responses with regulatory capacity. Their effect on an antigen-specific, so-called Ab 1 antibody response, is dependent on 1) the original antigen, which they mirror, being Ab 2 antibodies, and 2) their isotype. In the case of IgE-mediated allergy, natural anti-ids against allergen-specific IgE represent internal images of <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules.</b> A key biologic feature of allergens {{is that they can}} crosslink IgE, expressed by B-lymphocytes or passively bound via high affinity receptors to effector cells, which renders cellular activation. Therefore, the IgE cross linking capability of anti-ids determines whether they dampen or enhance immediate-type hyper-sensitivity. Correspondingly to classic antiallergen blocking IgG anti-bodies, anti-ids may also interact with inhibitory FcRIIb receptors and, thereby, down-regulate TH 2 -type inflammation. Anti-ids and other B-cell epitope mimetics, like mimotopes and DARPins, represent an-tigen surrogates, which can be used for vaccination. Intriguingly, they may induce antibody responses without activating potentially proin-flammatory, antiallergen T-lymphocytes. Taken together, collective evidence suggests that anti-ids, although representing immunologic classics, are a timeless concept in allergology...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleRespiratory allergy represents an overall public health problem because of its prevalence, morbidity, impact on quality of life and cost [1 - 4]. Pollen [5, 6] and house-dust mites (HDM) [7] are the most common allergens related to respiratory diseases, followed by animal dander and moulds [8]. Polysensitisation, defined as the presence of more than one specific IgE sensitisation against non-related allergen sources, is frequent in Spain [6]. However, times difficult to establish and, consequently, allergists may have difficulty in deciding which is the most appro-priate composition for allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for each patient. For this purpose, the recognition of the sen-sitisation profile (identification of primary sensitisation markers with respect to detection of specific IgE against cross-reactive <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules)</b> has been suggested as a tool to define better the relevant or irrelevant allergens in each patient [5]. The efficacy of AIT in monosensitised patients has been proven in both children and adults and with both route...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Oral allergy {{syndrome}} (OAS) {{is defined}} as a set of clinical manifestations caused by IgE-mediated allergic  reactions  that  occur  at  oral  and  pharyngeal  mucosae  in  the  patients  with  pollen  sensitization  after ingestion of certain fruits, vegetables, nuts and spices. OAS arises from cross-reactivity between specific pollen and food allergens, due to similarity of a configuration and amino acid sequence of allergenic molecules. OAS is considered as class II food allergy, being caused by thermo- and chemolabile allergens, and it is rarely combined with generalized manifestations of food allergy. Prevalence and spectrum of the causal allergens depend on a kind of pollen sensitization. In Moscow region, as well as in Northern Europe, allergic sensitization most commonly occurs to the pollen of leaf trees, whereas OAS is mostly connected with ingestion of fruits from Rosaceae family and nuts. Since last years, a newly developed technique of component-resolved molecular diagnosis (CR diagnostics) allows of more precise detection of OAS-causing <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules.</b> These data are of extreme importance for administration of adequate nutritional therapy and prediction of SIT efficiency.

40|$|In June 2005, {{the work}} of the EU Integrated Project EuroPrevall was started. EuroPrevall is the largest {{research}} project on food allergy ever performed in Europe. Major aims of the project are to generate for the first time reliable data on the prevalence of food allergies across Europe and on the natural course of food allergy development in infants. Improvement of in vitro diagnosis of food allergies is another important aim of the project. The present review summarizes current knowledge about the clinical presentation of food allergy and critically reviews available diagnostic tools {{at the beginning of the}} project period. A major problem in diagnosis is a relatively poor 'clinical specificity', i. e. both positive skin tests and in vitro tests for specific IgE are frequent in sensitized subjects without food allergy symptoms. So far, no in vitro test reliably predicts clinical food allergy. EuroPrevall aims at improving the predictive value of such tests by proceeding from diagnosis based on allergen extracts to purified <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules,</b> taking into account the affinity of the IgE-allergen interaction, and evaluating the potential of biological in vitro tests such as histamine release tests or basophil activation tests including assays performed with permanently growing cell line...|$|R

40|$|The Component Resolved Diagnostic (CRD) {{approach}} has been developed when highly purified or recombinant <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> have become available. These molecules are the allergenic proteins toward which the specific and clinically relevant IgE immune response is directed. So, the identification of protein families and cross-reactivity patterns of importance in allergy have been possible. The Italian advisory BOARD for ISAC was born: to evaluate the advantages, disadvantages and placement in diagnosis of CRD studying its application in allergic patients; to facilitate the interpretation of molecular diagnostics for clinical allergists; {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of CRD in improving diagnostic risk assessment and early preventive treatment of allergic diseases. In the last years, its fields of interest have been: the evaluation of the performance of CRD on multi-sensitized allergic patients with respiratory symptoms and on poly-sensitized athletes; the evolution of IgE repertoire directed to single allergenic components by evaluating allergic patients with different age at a molecular level; the relevance of results obtained using allergen microarray technique for describing the IgE repertoire in allergic patients by reviewing the main articles focused on CRD published in the last 2 years; the need for an educational program focused on this new diagnostic tool also through the creation of an exhaustive and interactive explanation of the laboratory report molecular allergy; the investigation of the performance and potential additional diagnostic values of the ISAC microarray in a real-life clinical setting, taking into account also the economic values...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Allergy {{diagnosis}} {{needs to}} be improved in patients suffering from pollen polysensitization due {{to the existence of}} possible confounding factors in this type of patients. OBJECTIVE To evaluate new diagnostic strategies by comparing skin responses to pan-allergens and conventional allergenic extracts with specific IgE (sIgE) to purified <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules.</b> METHODS One thousand three hundred and twenty-nine pollen-allergic patients were diagnosed by a combination of an in vitro method with a panel of 13 purified allergens, including major allergens and pan-allergens, using a high-capacity screening technology (ADVIA-Centaur®) and skin prick test (SPT) to pan-allergens and conventional extracts. RESULTS There was a high concordance (κ index) between in vitro (sIgE to major allergens) and in vivo (SPT to conventional extracts) methods in patients who were not sensitized to pan-allergens, but SPT with conventional extracts failed to diagnose patients with sensitization to pan-allergens. In patients who were simultaneously sensitized to polcalcins and profilins, there was a duplication both in the number of sensitizations to major allergens and in the years of disease evolution. There was a statistical association between sensitization to profilins and/or lipid transfer proteins and food allergy (P< 0. 0001). CONCLUSION The novel diagnostic strategy {{has proven to be a}} valuable tool in daily clinical practice. Introduction of routine SPT to pan-allergens is a simple and feasible way of improving diagnostic efficacy. Patients sensitized to pan-allergens should be tested by an adequate panel of allergenic molecules in order to identify the allergens that are responsible for the allergic disease...|$|R
50|$|The high {{affinity}} IgE receptor plays {{a central}} role in allergic disease, coupling allergen and mast cell to initiate the inflammatory and immediate hypersensitivity responses that are characteristic of disorders such as hay fever and asthma. The allergic response occurs when 2 or more IgE receptors are crosslinked via IgE molecules that in turn are bound to an <b>allergen</b> (antigen) <b>molecule.</b> A perturbation occurs that brings about the release of histamine and proteases from the granules in the cytoplasm of the mast cell and leads to the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes—potent effectors of the hypersensitivity response. The IgE receptor consists of 3 subunits: alpha (this protein), beta, and gamma; only the alpha subunit is glycosylated.|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} studies on intranasal tolerance induction demonstrated reduction of allergic responses with different allergen constructs. The underlying mechanisms varied {{depending on their}} conformation or size. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the uptake of two structurally different <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> within the respiratory tract following intranasal application. The three-dimensional Bet v 1 (Bv 1 -Protein) and the T cell epitope peptide of Bet v 1 (Bv 1 -Peptide) were labelled with 5, 6 -Carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and their uptake was investigated in lung cells and cells of the nasal associated lymphoid tissue from naive and sensitised BALB/c mice. Phenotypic characterisation of FAM+ lung cells after antigen incubation in vitro and after intranasal application was performed by flow cytometry. Impact of Bv 1 -Protein and Bv 1 -Peptide on cytokine profiles and gene expression in vivo or in an alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cell line were assessed in mono- and co-cultures with monocytes using ELISA and quantitative real-time PCR. Both antigens were taken up preferably by ATII-like cells (ATII-LCs) in naive mice, and by macrophages in sensitised mice. After intranasal application, Bv 1 -Peptide was taken up faster and more efficiently than Bv 1 -Protein. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that Bv 1 -Protein induced the transcription of thymic stromal lymphopoietin mRNA while Bv 1 -Peptide induced the transcription of IL- 10 and MCP 1 mRNA in ATII-LCs. Both tested antigens were taken up by ATII-LCs under steady state conditions and induced different polarisation of the immune responses. These data may have an important impact for the generation of novel and more effective prophylactic or therapeutic tools targeting the respiratory mucosa...|$|R
40|$|Asthma, rhinitis, and eczema {{are complex}} {{diseases}} with multiple genetic {{and environmental factors}} interlinked through IgEassociated and non-IgE-associated mechanisms. Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy (MeDALL; EU FP 7 -CP-IP; project no: 261357; 2010 - 2015) studied the complex links of allergic diseases at the clinical and mechanistic levels by linking epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic research, including in vivo and in vitro models. MeDALL integrated 14 European birth cohorts, including 44, 010 participants and 160 cohort follow-ups between pregnancy and age 20 years. Thirteen thousand children were prospectively followed after puberty by using a newly standardized MeDALL Core Questionnaire. A microarray developed for <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> with increased IgE sensitivity was obtained for 3, 292 children. Estimates of air pollution exposure from previous studies were available for 10, 000 children. Omics data included those from historical genome-wide association studies (23, 000 children) and DNA methylation (2, 173), targeted multiplex biomarker (1, 427), and transcriptomic (723) studies. Using classical epidemiology and machine-learning methods in 16, 147 children aged 4 years and 11, 080 children aged 8 years, MeDALL showed the multimorbidity of eczema, rhinitis, and asthma and estimated that only 38 % of multimorbidity was attributable to IgE sensitization. MeDALL has proposed a new vision of multimorbidity independent of IgE sensitization, and has shown that monosensitization and polysensitization represent 2 distinct phenotypes. The translational component of MeDALL is shown by the identification of a novel allergic phenotype characterized by polysensitization and multimorbidity, which {{is associated with the}} frequency, persistence, and severity of allergic symptoms. The results of MeDALL will help integrate personalized, predictive, preventative, and participatory approaches in allergic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Background Grass pollen allergens {{are known}} to be present in the {{atmosphere}} in a range of particle sizes from whole pollen grains (approx. 20 to 55 μim in diameter) to smaller size fractions < 2. 5 μ (fine particles, PM 2. 5). These latter particles are within the respirable range and include allergen-containing starch granules released from within the grains into the atmosphere when grass pollen ruptures in rainfall and are associated with epidemics of thunderstorm asthma during the grass pollen season. The question arises whether grass pollen allergens can interact with other sources of fine particles, particularly those present during episodes of air pollution. Objective We propose the hypothesis that free grass pollen <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules,</b> derived from dead or burst grains and dispersed in microdroplets of water in aerosols, can bind to fine particles in polluted air. Methods We used diesel exhaust carbon particles (DECP) derived from the exhaust of a stationary diesel engine, natural highly purified Lol p 1, immunogold labelling with specific monoclonal antibodies and a high voltage transmission electron -microscopic imaging technique Results DECP are visualized as small carbon spheres, each 30 – 60 nm in diameter, forming fractal aggregates about 1 – 2 μ in diameter. Here we test our hypothesis and show by in vitro experiments that the major grass pollen allergen, Lol p I. binds to one defined class of fine particles, DECP. Conclusion DECP are in the respirable size range, can bind to the major grass pollen allergen Lol p I under in vitro conditions and represent a possible mechanism by which allergens can become concentrated in polluted air and thus trigger attacks of asthma...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a complex}} chronic inflammatory disease where allergens can act as specific triggering factors. AIM: To characterize the specificities of IgE-reactivity in patients with AD to a broad panel of exogenous allergens including microbial and human antigens. METHODOLOGY: Adult patients with AD were grouped according to the SCORAD index, into severe (n = 53) and moderate AD (n = 126). As controls 43 patients were included with seborrhoeic eczema and 97 individuals without history of allergy or skin diseases. Specific IgE reactivity was assessed in plasma using Phadiatop®, ImmunoCap™, micro-arrayed allergens, dot-blotted recombinant Malassezia sympodialis allergens, and immune-blotted microbial and human proteins. RESULTS: IgE reactivity was detected in 92 % of patients with severe and 83 % of patients with moderate AD. Sensitization to cat allergens occurred most frequently, followed by sensitization to birch pollen, grass pollen, and to the skin commensal yeast M. sympodialis. Patients with severe AD showed a significantly higher frequency of IgE reactivity to allergens like cat (rFel d 1) and house dust mite (rDer p 4 and 10), to Staphylococcus aureus, M. sympodialis, and to human antigens. In contrast, {{there were no significant}} differences in the frequencies of IgE reactivity to the grass pollen allergens rPhl p 1, 2, 5 b, and 6 between the two AD groups. Furthermore the IgE reactivity profile of patients with severe AD was more spread towards several different <b>allergen</b> <b>molecules</b> as compared to patients with moderate AD. CONCLUSION: We have revealed a hitherto unknown difference regarding the molecular sensitization profile in patients with severe and moderate AD. Molecular profiling towards allergen components may provide a basis for future investigations aiming to explore the environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors which could be responsible for the different appearance and severity of disease phenotypes in AD...|$|R
