50|$|Images of {{the target}} region {{produced}} by ISAR can be a useful tool in locating scattering regions on the target. ISAR images are often produced by rotating the target and processing the resultant Doppler histories of the scattering centers. If the target rotates in azimuth at a constant rate through a 'small' angle, scatterers will approach or recede from the radar at a rate depending only on the cross range position- the distance normal to the radar line of sight with the origin at the target axis of rotation. The rotation {{will result in the}} generation of cross range dependent Doppler frequencies which can be sorted spatially by a Fourier transform. This operation is equivalent to (but the inverse of) the generation of a large synthetic aperture phased array antenna formed by the coherent summation of the receiver outputs for varying target / antenna geometries. For small angles, an ISAR image is the 2-dimensional Fourier transform of the received signal as a function of frequency and target <b>aspect</b> <b>angle.</b>|$|E

Strong aspect sensitivities of up to 10 dB per degree have been observed at small aspect angles while large <b>aspect</b> <b>angle</b> measurements show much weaker and highly variable aspect sensitivities. It {{is the purpose of}} this thesis to attempt to understand the different results at the large aspect angles.;For this study, data from the radars and optical instruments of the CANOPUS ground based system in central Canada have been examined. The two radars (the BARS radars) operate at VHF (48. 5 MHz) and have large aspect angles. A statistical study of the spatial relationship between the radar echoes and the optical aurora during 13 hours was performed. Also, data from the radar during daylight periods were examined for evidence of aspect sensitivity.;The most noticeable observation of the statistical study was that there was a strong tendency for the radar echoes to occur {{on the side of the}} optical aurora remote from the radar.

Images at a resolution of 10 cm and 30 cm have been used for a complete aspect range of 360 degrees. The data covered four military targets: T 72, ZSU 23 / 4, T 62, and BMP 2. For the study we composed several feature vectors out of individual features extracted from the images. The features are divided into three categories: radiometric, geometric and polarimetric. We found that individual features show a strong variability as a function of <b>aspect</b> <b>angle</b> and cannot be used to discriminate between the targets irrespectively of the <b>aspect</b> <b>angle.</b> Using feature vectors and a maximum likelihood classifier reasonable discrimination (about 80 %) between the four targets irrespective of the <b>aspect</b> <b>angle</b> was obtained at 10 cm resolution.

For observations perpendicular to the electrojet ¯ow, spectra were more symmetrical (average skewness was around 0) and the sign of the skewness was sometimes opposite to the sign of the mean Doppler shift.

The traditional techniques do not account for such noise and, consequently, cannot provide a robust classification of signals.

We use this framework to introduce two distances {{that can be used}} for signal classification: (a) a y-distance, which is the distance between the aligned signals, and (b) an x-distance that measures the amount of warping needed to align the signals.
