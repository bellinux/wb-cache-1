5|$|Charles Smithson – {{the main}} male character. Though born into <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>with</b> {{close ties to}} nobility, Smithson does not possess a title but has a sizable income and {{considerable}} education.

5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>with</b> a hereditary thyroid {{cancer and}} discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999.

5|$|From <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>with</b> no {{background}} of ballet or music, MacMillan was determined {{from an early}} age to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a member of her company.
