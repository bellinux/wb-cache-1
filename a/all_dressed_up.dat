5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get <b>all</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

Kelly is dressed as Dorothy Gale, but Michael makes an insensitive remark about Bend It Like Beckham.

500|$|Andrew Hampp of Billboard {{magazine}} commended the memorability of {{the lyrics}} and wrote that [...] "'Partition' is yet another 'gettin’ freaky with my baby' jam, with some of Bey's most frankly sexual lines yet." [...] Similarly, Eliana Dockterman of Time magazine hailed the lyrical content of [...] "Partition"; she noted that it suitably exemplifies [...] "embodiment of modern feminism for a generation that {{has been reluctant to}} claim the word" [...] and further praised how Beyoncé [...] "express her desire to please [...] while still projecting a fierce, independent persona". Melissa Locker, also writing for Time magazine, suggested that Beyoncé should work with Timbaland more often as [...] "his sultry beats paired with her R-rated lyrics and the catchy chorus 'It took 45 minutes to get <b>all</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>up</b> / And we ain’t even gonna make it to this club', make a captivating combination". Chris Bosman of the same publication wrote an extensive review of the song: ...|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Her performance garnered positive {{reviews from}} critics, who considered {{it one of}} the highlights in the event. Performing barefoot, Clarkson sang the song as rain cascaded onto the audience. Clarkson told People that one of her favourite moments on television was performing [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] at the MTV Video Music Awards, saying [...] "I hate being <b>all</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>up,</b> so the fact that I was soaking wet with mascara smeared all over my face was definitely the highlight of my evening!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator thought that the performance was Clarkson's most memorable live performances while Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times thought Clarkson's performance was very solid despite the feeling that she sounded better dry than drenched. Clarkson performed the song on Saturday Night Live in 2005, along with the 2006 BRIT Awards which took place in Earls Court, London.|$|E
500|$|Many live {{instruments}} were {{used during the}} album's production, especially violin. Milian named [...] "You Make Me Laugh" [...] {{one of her favorite}} songs on the album. It was the first song written by Milian for the album, and she worked with Bloodshy for the song's production. The album's second and final single, [...] "When You Look at Me", was written by Milian. Using her school days as the inspiration for the song, Milian said that [...] "when I was growing up, I found people were always trying to label me. The first day of school it would be like 'Here comes this girl <b>all</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>up.</b> She thinks she's all that' and they didn't even know me. The message behind 'When You Look At Me' is never judge a book by its cover." [...] Milian asked Ja Rule to appear on her album, however {{she did not want to}} put him [...] "on just any song", and wanted to make sure it was the right song for him. Milian hoped Ja Rule would appear on the track [...] "A Girl Like Me", but he ended up rapping on [...] "Get Away". Milian co-wrote the track [...] "Twitch" [...] with R singer Montell Jordan, which explains that men have a certain twitch of their shoulders whenever they tell lies.|$|E

[...] The scandal became notorious as the [...] "Rome Walkout". Callas brought a lawsuit against the Rome Opera House, {{but by the time the}} case was settled thirteen years later and the Rome Opera was found to be at fault for having refused to provide an understudy, Callas's career was already over.|$|E

There were two teams, {{and the object}} of the game was to knock over as many members of the {{opposing}} team as possible by any means." [...] Another game was called the 'Whip' game. [...] "Elvis's idea of an exciting game was that it should be as dangerous as possible", such as the game that involved fireworks. [...] "Some of the Memphis Mafia would buy up to $15,000 worth of fireworks in today's money, including skyrockets, baby giants, firecrackers, and ... chasers, which moved rapidly and unpredictably until they exploded. Since the emphasis was on large and potentially lethal fireworks, everyone had to wear air force jump-suits plus gloves, helmets, and goggles. When they were <b>all</b> <b>dressed</b> <b>up,</b> they divided themselves into Blue and Red teams, and started hurling fireworks at the other team ... Elvis was left with a big scar on his neck from one firework, and one of his friends nearly lost an eye." ...|$|E

40|$|La Vie parisienne, {{illustrated}} society journal, {{reflects the}} dominant social discourse and therefore constitutes a stimulating observation point to analyse the common representations of female homosexuality {{in the late}} nineteenth century. However, the journal also uses the figure of the female homosexual as the basis for its reading contract and builds an analogy between bawdy press and female homosexuality. La Vie parisienne draws itself as a young and attractive woman, seems to address exclusively a female readership, and dedicates its short stories and articles solely to the female intimacy, to an obsessive "glorification of woman" (Jules Lemaître). By doing so, la Vie parisienne invents a new kind of journal, built on a participative fiction. In this fiction, the journal, its writers, male and female readers join in a fête galante where they <b>all</b> <b>dress</b> <b>up</b> as decorative lesbians.

Holly picks up the buttoner, and prods him hard, then they become friends, because Greg explains to her what happened. On the coach home, Greg sat next to Holly, his girlfriend.|$|R
