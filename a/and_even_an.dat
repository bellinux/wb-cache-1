5|$|Kirby's Dream Land {{has since}} spawned dozens of sequels across {{more than a}} half-dozen video game consoles. The first direct sequel Kirby's Adventure, {{released}} on the Nintendo Entertainment System, introduced the ability to steal powers from enemies, an ability which would become {{a staple of the}} series following it. The series has featured several spin-offs, in differing genres including a racing game Kirby Air Ride, pinball game Kirby's Pinball Land, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> Action-Golf hybrid game Kirby's Dream Course. Kirby's Dream Land would receive a Game Boy sequel in 1995 Kirby's Dream Land 2, which incorporated the copy mechanic from Kirby's Adventure.|$|E

5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by From Hell artist Eddie Campbell, the series' direction {{was taken}} over by Paul Jenkins in 1995. He had been former editor of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and other Mirage Studios lines. He had pitched to several comic houses, having tired of editing, and eventually managed to gain stewardship of Hellblazer, the first largely untested writer to achieve this. Jenkins' run is more traditionally English in its themes, with Albion, Arthurian legend, and old English battles all featuring, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> appearance by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and a speculative explanation of the writing of Kubla Khan, and what the interruption of the 'man from Porlock' may have been. He also returns to Jamie Delano's coverage of anarchist lifestyles, and the effects of the Criminal Justice Act of 1994, a controversial law which restricted the ability of the public to throw raves and large demonstrations.|$|E

25|$|The {{introduction}} of Vista and Microsoft Surface (now known as Microsoft PixelSense) {{introduced a new}} set of input APIs that were adopted into Windows 7, allowing for 50 points/cursors, all controlled by independent users. The new input points provide traditional mouse input; however, they were designed with other input technologies like touch and image in mind. They inherently offer 3D coordinates along with pressure, size, tilt, angle, mask, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> image bitmap to see and recognize the input point/object on the screen.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the line}} was not profitable. Given the {{communities}} it served, private investors {{were not interested in}} making necessary investment. In 1992, under the liberal economic practices of the central government, it was decided to close the line. However there was a national <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> international outcry at the decision to close a line which had become emblematic of a bygone age and of that region. The two provincial governments came together to keep the line open.|$|E
25|$|Ives {{moved to}} New Haven, Connecticut in 1893, enrolling in the Hopkins School, where he captained the {{baseball}} team. In September 1894, Ives entered Yale University, studying under Horatio Parker.

This original plan speculated that the completed park would be spread over ten phases.

The bus is run by local company Reay's, and calls once every two hours in either direction during the day. However, Dubmill today is a very small settlement, consisting of a single farm, and thus has no amenities or facilities of its own. In nearby Allonby, there is a convenience store, leisure centre, post office, fish-and-chip shop, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> antiques shop, as well as several pubs and restaurants. There is also a pub in Mawbray, called The Lowther.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Beyoğlu {{was one of}} {{the first}} parts of İstanbul to have {{telephone}} lines, electricity, trams, municipal government <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>an</b> underground railway, the Tünel, inaugurated in 1875 as the world's second subway line (after London's Underground) to carry the people of Pera up and down from the port of Galata and the nearby business and banking district of Karaköy, where the Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street), the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, is located. The theatre, cinema, patisserie and café culture that still remains strong in Beyoğlu dates from this late Ottoman period. Shops like İnci, famous for its chocolate mousse and profiteroles, predate the founding of the republic and survived until recently.|$|E
