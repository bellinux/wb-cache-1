5|$|On 24 November 1932, Le Petit Vingtième {{published}} a fictional interview between Jamin and Tintin {{in which the}} reporter {{announced that he would}} be travelling to China via Egypt, India, Ceylon, and Indochina. On 8 December 1932, the story began serialisation in the supplement under the title of The Adventures of Tintin, Reporter, in the Orient. As the story began in Egypt rather than China, Hergé briefly renamed the story to The Cairo Affair. The story was not following <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> or pre-written plot, with Hergé as usual devising the story on a week-by-week basis.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|In Vancouver, the {{organization}} Save the Grizzlies {{was established to}} find a local investor to purchase the team. Led by among others Peter Ufford, they had a plan to create a public entity which could take over ownership of the team. Ufford retrospectively stated that had the attempt been given more time, {{they may have been}} able to secure a deal to keep the team in town, but that the relocation decision came too quickly for <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> to be finalized. Heisley stated that he had been willing to sell the team with a 30% discount to a Vancouver investor if he could secure a guarantee that the team would remain in town.|$|E

5|$|The {{compromise}} proposal {{was referred to}} a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though {{it was believed that}} Republicans in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to the floor for a vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.|$|E
5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into the program, and the churches were advised to create a plan. Because the government wanted to deal with one body, not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} proposal was widely criticized on various grounds, including {{claims that it}} exceeded the board's concentration of media ownership limits {{and that it was}} overly ambitious and financially unsustainable. As well, it failed to include <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> for local news content on any of its individual stations beyond possibly the metropolitan Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver markets.|$|E
25|$|Though Gilbert had {{threatened}} legal action, he soon conceded his narrow loss. According to Gilbert, the attorney that he consulted said that any appeal {{had to be}} presented by midnight December 20 but more time was needed to prepare for any challenge which {{was likely to be}} successful. Gilbert further indicated that <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> for legal action died when the Webster Parish Democratic Executive Committee certified Batton as the party nominee for sheriff.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, the Twins {{assembled}} a 130-member advisory group, dubbed Minnesotans for Major League Baseball, which met to discuss possible stadium alternatives. Their deliberations included {{a meeting with}} Bud Selig, commissioner of baseball, to discuss economic issues within the sport. Their final report did not recommend a site (and did not even mention Rapid Park), but did provide advice to the team on how to proceed in winning public approval for <b>any</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although a {{group of}} Los Angeles {{businessmen}} had endorsed the secret talks, they had no legal power over the prosecutor, Fredericks. Fredericks refused to sanction <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> which let the McNamaras go free. The National Erectors' Association had learned of the talks (both the defense and prosecution had their paid spies in the other's camp), and was pressing Fredericks to reject any plea bargain. As a compromise, Fredericks demanded that J.B. receive life in prison and J.J. receive a much shorter term.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{had noted}} on his site {{that he had}} made pipe bombs, in {{addition}} to a hit list of individuals (he did not post <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> on how he intended to attack targets). As Harris had posted on his website that he possessed explosives, Guerra wrote a draft affidavit, requesting a search warrant of the Harris household. The affidavit also mentioned a suspicion of Harris being involved in an unsolved pipe bomb case in February 1998. The affidavit was never filed. It was concealed by the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show 60 Minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} the thirteenth best-selling entertainment-related retail {{software}} in its week of release. A month after release, the game had sold 700,000 copies in the US and Europe. Sega was {{not satisfied with}} the game's commercial performance, and announced that there would not be a sequel to the game. The game gained a cult following upon release, mainly due to the game's handling of players' choices. Obsidian Entertainment had publicly revealed its intention to develop a sequel for Alpha Protocol, and that the development team had new ideas for the game. However, any new game must develop with the approval of IP owner Sega, which had not announced <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> for a new game.|$|E

25|$|British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin heard Marshall's radio {{broadcast}} speech and immediately contacted French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault to begin preparing a quick European response to (and acceptance of) the offer, {{which led to}} the creation of the Committee of European Economic Co-operation. The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that Stalin would almost certainly not participate, and that <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to be approved by Congress.|$|E
25|$|Some 15,000 Palestinians held {{a protest}} march in Gaza City, and militants vowed renewed attacks against Israel. In Nablus, {{hundreds}} chanted anti-Abbas slogans during a protest. Most business {{owners in the}} Gaza Strip began shutting down their stores in protest of the operation, thereby launching a spontaneous general strike. All the armed Palestinian organizations except Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades issued statements threatening to harm Israel should it not halt the operation. Meanwhile, the Israel Prison Service decided to raise the alert level in all Israeli prisons where Palestinian security prisoners were being held. All prison guards were asked to be extremely alert to the prisoners' behavior {{in order to prevent}} <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> of initiating riots.|$|E
25|$|In 1862, he and Satyendranath Tagore {{were the}} first two Indians to sail to England to prepare for and appear in the Indian Civil Service examinations. The {{competition}} {{was one of the}} stiffest, if not the stiffest, in the world at that time, but more so because <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> to cross the seas and travel to Europe was bound to meet with the strongest opposition from the Indian society. Preparations for the examination was tough, as they had to pick up many subjects not taught in India. Moreover, Ghose was subject to racial discrimination. The examination schedules and syllabus were altered. He sat for the examinations twice but failed to succeed. Satyendranath Tagore went through and became the first Indian to join the ICS.|$|E

25|$|Some of the British {{officers}} later {{claimed that}} the rebels had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the British. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of the betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre-planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre {{was the result of}} confusion, and not of <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come.|$|E
25|$|In June 1958 the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was {{expected}} to propose a plan to resolve the Cyprus issue. In light of the new development the Turks rioted in Nicosia to promote the idea that Greek and Turkish Cypriots could not live together and therefore <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> that did not include partition would not be viable. This violence was soon followed by bombing, Greek Cypriot deaths and looting of Greek Cypriot-owned stores and houses. Greek and Turkish Cypriots started to flee mixed population villages where they were a minority in search of safety. This was effectively the beginning of segregation of the two communities. On 7 June 1958 a bomb exploded {{at the entrance of}} the Turkish Embassy in Cyprus. Following the bombing Turkish Cypriots looted Greek Cypriot properties. On June 26, 1984 the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktaş, admitted on British channel ITV that the bomb was placed by the Turks themselves in order to create tension. On January 9, 1995 Rauf Denktaş repeated his claim to the famous Turkish newspaper Milliyet in Turkey.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon, {{despite his}} youth, was France's most {{successful}} {{general in the}} Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of Italy and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on 18 Brumaire (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the Consulate, which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself Emperor. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria (Third Coalition), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, {{while at the same}} time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the Battle of Trafalgar, ending <b>any</b> <b>plan</b> to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz, forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see Treaty of Pressburg) and dissolving the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, a Fourth Coalition was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at Friedland. The Treaties of Tilsit divided Europe between France and Russia and created the Duchy of Warsaw.|$|E
