This <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> is mounted {{on the tip of}} the wind turbine blade. The tip brake (<b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake)</b> consists of two primary members, namely, 1) main tip brake and 2) spoiler flaps. The loads acting on the main tip brake and spoiler flaps are 3. 15 kpa and 3. 95 kpa respectively. The material chosen for the design is CFRP because of its high stiffness and strength. The design is base on the the regular spar and rib construction.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the selection and}} preliminary design of a new <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> system for use on the stall-regulated AWT- 26 / 27 wind turbines. The goal was to identify and design a configuration that offered improvements over the existing tip brake used by Advanced Wind Turbines, Inc. (AWT). Although the design objectives and approach of this report are specific to <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> of AWT- 26 / 27 turbines, {{many of the issues}} addressed in this work are applicable to a wider class of turbines. The performance trends and design choices presented in this report should be of general use to wind turbine designers who are considering alternative <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> methods. A literature search was combined with preliminary work on device sizing, loads and mechanical design. Candidate configurations were assessed on their potential for benefits in the areas of cost, weight, aerodynamic noise, reliability and performance under icing conditions. As a result, two configurations were identified for further study: the {open_quotes}spoiler-flap{close_quotes} and the {open_quotes}flip-tip. {close_quotes} Wind tunnel experiments were conducted at Wichita State University to evaluate the performance of the candidate <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brakes</b> on an airfoil section representative of the AWT- 26 / 27 blades. The wind tunnel data were used to predict the braking effectiveness and deployment characteristics of the candidate devices {{for a wide range of}} design parameters. The evaluation was iterative, with mechanical design and structural analysis being conducted in parallel with the braking performance studies. The preliminary estimate of the spoiler-flap system cost was $ 150 less than the production AWT- 26 / 27 tip vanes. This represents a reduction of approximately 5 % in the cost of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> system. In view of the preliminary nature of the design, it would be prudent to plan for contingencies in both cost and weight...|$|R

The mockup is provided with two electric motors that appropriately drive the gearbox at the nominal rotating speed. A suitable <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> {{is attached to the}} rotor must in order to reproduce the load effect of the rotor blades. Peaks at the gear meshing frequencies reveal amplitudes very close to those acquired during in-flight measurements.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{new type}} of non-adhesion brake mode used to {{high-speed}} train brake by unfolding the brake panel {{on the roof of the}} high speed train to increase aerodynamic resistance. This brake mode is effective especially in the condition of high speed. The article is aimed at designing a set of opening and closing mechanism to control the movement of the brake panel. The opening and closing mechanism mainly include three components of guide mechanism, the center of rotation and drive mechanism. The guide mechanism as auxiliary orientation is a functional unit of the bearing parts used to improve the movement and load conditions of the brake panel. The center of rotation is the key component to support the brake panel and transmit the braking force. The drive mechanism, the power source of the opening and closing mechanism, is designed to drive the brake panel up and down in the reciprocating motion. This paper focuses on the design of the three components, using the method of combining structural design and reliability design and aiming at the final optimal design...|$|E

Capable of reaching speeds in excess of Mach 10 without the necessity of any moving parts, scramjets may prove to be a viable solution to the problem of dependable hypersonic transport. However, further research into a scramjet’s operation is required and therefore provides an impetus for further flight tests. The Hy-V Scramjet Experiment has been established in order to verify scramjet research done at the University of Virginia and elsewhere. Furthermore, a first-ever scramjet recovery is being investigated by the Hy-V researchers at the University. A conceptual design of an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> that may provide a reliable means of recovery at hypersonic flight conditions has been completed. The brake area required to slow the scramjet payload from Mach 5 to Mach 1 was shown to be conducive to a manageable and symmetric 4 -brake system.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the preliminary testing {{results of an}} active gearbox strut control system on a helicopter mock-up, {{with the goal of}} improving tonal vibration reduction, under real operative conditions. The gearbox is driven by two electric motors at the nominal rotating speed and a suitable <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> is attached to the rotor must to reproduce the load effect of the rotor blades. The normalised FXLMS adaptive control algorithm was implemented to control the rear struts, each equipped with three pairs of piezoelectric patches. The reference signal was supplied by accelerometers positioned on the upper gearbox attachment. Error signals were derived by accelerometers positioned both outside the cabin, on the lower struts attachment devices, and inside the cabin. Appropriate band-pass digital filters were designed and used to limit the required control voltages. Different control configurations, in terms of number and position of actuators and sensors, were tested. Advantages and limitations were discussed, as well as power actuation requirements and convergence rate. In these preliminary tests, only one tone at a time has been considered; results showed {{that it is possible to}} reject large-Amplitude high frequency tonal vibration disturbances...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} consolidates the {{aerodynamic}} sizing of an innovative tip brake. The innovativeness {{in the design}} {{lies in the fact}} that the tip brake, in the braking position, not only provides a braking surface to retard the rotor, but also spoiles the flow over the outboard portion of the wind turbine rotor lifting aerofoil blade. At the same time, in its non-braking position, when the flaps are inline with the main blade, it acts as leading edge flaps and trailing edge slats and thereby augments the power to consequently improve the performance of the rotor. The present report consolidates the aerodynamic design and analysis of the primary tip brake and spoiler flaps that has been worked out for the braking mode. The augmentation due to the presence of the flaps in the non braking mode has also been worked out. The loads during the braking (aerodynamic pressure / loads acting on the surface of the tip brake) have been quantified. The sizing was done for three configurations of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake</b> with different primary tip brake width (0. 6 m, 1 m, 1. 25 m and 1. 5 m). Finally, after intra-divisional discussions, the final configuration with primary tip brake width of 1. 5 m was chosen for further structural design...|$|E
40|$|Every athlete aims to {{establish}} the best performances in his sport activities. This {{can be reached by}} means of indications to the athlete on specific parameters to check during his training and so optimizing the effectiveness of the athletic gesture. The present study is developed within a research project on the evaluation, validation and application of efficiency indexes of the athletic gesture in cycling, by means of the measurements of the effective force to the pedal carried on by an Instrumented Pedal (iPed) and displaying measurement results in real time: the final aim is to provide a feedback to the athlete, on the basis of some efficiency indexes, in order to improve the efficiency of the sport performance. The specific goal of this contribution deals with the set-up of the measurement chain and with the implementation of the system calibration. In particular, calibration was performed with known dead weights. During calibration the crosstalk effects between measurement channels have been evaluated and modeled with a cross sensitivity matrix. Accuracy on force measurement is between 3 % and 5 %. Also angle and power measurements underwent a calibration procedure with a relative uncertainty between 8 % and 15 % of the measured value. The obtained results validate the iPed and the measurement chain and open wide scenarios for the system applicability.

It is not structurally intrusive, and it has the potential for small actuating loads. It is shown that simultaneous achievement of a low lift/drag ratio and high drag is the determinant of device effectiveness, and that these attributes must persist up to an angle of attack of 45 {degree}.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} of a model {{representative}} of a single-engine tractor-type airplane {{for the purpose of}} determining the stability and control effects of a propeller used as an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>brake.</b> The tests were made with single-and dual-rotation propellers to show the effect of type of propeller rotation, and with positive thrust to provide basic data with which to compare the effects of negative thrust. Four configurations of the model were used to give the effects of tilting the propeller thrust axis down 5 deg., raising the horizontal tail, and combining both tilt and raised tail. Results of the tests are reported herein. The effects of negative thrust were found to be significant. The longitudinal stability was increased because of the loss of wing lift and increase of the angle of attack of the tail. Directional stability and both longitudinal and directional control were decreased because of the reduced velocity at the tail. These effects are moderate for moderate braking but become pronounced with full-power braking, particularly at high values of lift coefficient. The effects of model configuration changes were small when compared with the over-all effects of negative-thrust operation; however, improved stability and control characteristics were exhibited by the model with the tilted thrust axis. Raising the horizontal tail improved the longitudinal characteristics, but was detrimental to directional characteristics. The use of dual-rotation propeller reduced the directional trim charges resulting from the braking operation. A prototype airplane was assumed and handling qualities were computed and analyzed for normal (positive thrust) and braking operation with full and partial power. The results of these analyses are presented for the longitudinal characteristics in steady and accelerated flight, and for the directional characteristics in high- and low-speed flight. It was found that by limiting the power output of the engine (assuming the constant-speed propeller will function in the range of blade angles required for negative thrust) the stability and control characteristics may be held within the limits required for safe operation. Braking with full power, particularly at low speeds, is dangerous, but braking with very small power output is satisfactory from the standpoint of control. The amount of braking produced with zero power output is equal to or better than that produced by conventional spoiler-type brakes...|$|E
50|$|<b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is {{a method}} used in landing {{aircraft}} to assist the wheel brakes in stopping the plane. It is often used for short runway landings or when conditions are wet, icy or slippery. <b>Aerodynamic</b> <b>braking</b> is performed immediately after the rear wheels (main mounts) touch down, but before the nose wheel drops. The pilot begins to pull back on the stick, applying elevator pressure to hold the nose high. The nose-high attitude exposes more of the craft's surface-area to the flow of air, which produces greater drag, helping to slow the plane. The raised elevators also cause air to push down on {{the rear of the}} craft, forcing the rear wheels harder against the ground, which aids the wheel brakes by helping to prevent skidding. The pilot will usually continue to hold back on the stick even after the elevators lose their authority, and the nose wheel drops, to keep added pressure on the rear wheels.|$|R
