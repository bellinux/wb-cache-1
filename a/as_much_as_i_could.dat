25|$|I knew Germany was in {{a terrible}} crisis; I felt {{responsible}} for German music, {{and it was my}} task to survive this crisis, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like.|$|E

He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and I decided I needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> And I learned how to hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Biggs {{played in}} two more internationals for Wales, {{both in the}} 1894 Championship and both {{resulted}} in losses. The {{first game of the}} 1894 Championship was against England, and Wales suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24–3. In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle Harry Bradshaw, who scored the first try; Biggs responded [...] "Tackle him? It was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to get out of his way!". In his final game against Ireland, Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three-quarters, along with Tom Pearson, Dai Fitzgerald and Jack Elliott. The very next international saw Biggs' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time, the brothers missing each other by just one match.|$|E

500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

He {{was a strong}} {{aggressive}} player, and he {{got the better of}} me quite a few times. With the ball in his hands JK was very determined. He had a job to do and it did not matter who was in front of him." [...] Kirwan is recorded as saying of Campese that, [...] "It was difficult and daunting to play him because he had all the tricks. I tried to intimidate him <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> by getting close to him before I'd step and using my physicality against him." ...|$|E

I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Sam Strike plays Jackson, born Jedidiah Sawyer, {{as one of}} {{the four}} inmates that escape the mental institution, before {{ultimately}} becoming the eponymous Leatherface after enduring tragedies that destroy his cognitive stability. Leatherface is a mentally disabled serial killer seen throughout the TCM franchise, known for wearing masks made of human skin, and using a chainsaw and mallet as his signature weapons. Strike joined the film after reading the script, which he opined was, for a horror film, very character-driven. He felt that there needed to be a contrast between {{the two sides of the}} character, to show how a somewhat kind person can become such a killer: [...] "It could happen to anybody. He had it in him because of his mother, but was at the mercy of his environment." [...] Strike integrated aspects from the original film into his performance out of respect, but wanted to give his own interpretation instead of imitating what came before. To make the character's transformation more believable, Strike intentionally tried to gain physical body weight before filming: [...] "I was trying to eat <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to just feel physically capable. Chainsaws, in reality, are very heavy, especially ones that are manufactured back in the '50s and '60s. Leatherface looks like he could take your head off with a slap; I wanted to be able to feel that way." [...] Strike believed that the character's bursts of rage throughout the film contributed to his final permanent state as a monster. He developed a [...] "battle cry" [...] for whenever Leatherface lost his temper. As someone who was taken from his biological family and put into foster care at an early age, Jedidiah Sawyer was written in the screenplay to have been adopted at one point by a family that wanted a little girl, forcing him to wear drag clothing as a child and foreshadowing his gender ambiguity in the 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. This plot point was absent from the final cut of the film.|$|E
