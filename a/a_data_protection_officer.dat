5000|$|The Bahamas has an {{official}} {{data protection law}} that protects the personal information of its citizens in both {{the private and public}} sector: Data Protection Act 2003 (the Bahamas Law). The Bahamas Law appoints a data protection commissioner to the Office of Data Protection to ensure that data protection is being held. Even though there is legislation enforced in the Bahamas through the Data Protection Act 2003, the act lacks many enforcements since <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer</b> doesn't need to be in office nor does any group or organization need to notify the Office of Data Protection when a hacker has breached privacy law. Also, there are no requirements for registering databases or restricting data flow across national borders. Therefore, the legislation does not meet European Union standards, which was the goal of creating the law in the first place.|$|E

30|$|Key {{elements}} of the new regulation include, for example: the need for clear and affirmative consent by the data subject concerned, destruction of data if storage is no longer necessary for the initial purpose or after withdrawal of consent by the data subject (‘the right to be forgotten’); the right to obtain rectification of his/her personal data; {{the right of the}} data subject to transfer personal data to another service provider (‘data portability’); the right of the data subject to be informed when his/her data have been hacked. The new GDPR implies that all organisations processing personal data must be able to prove that they comply with the rules. It also proposes <b>a</b> European <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> Board and requires institutions which process certain types or volumes of <b>data</b> to have <b>a</b> designated <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer</b> (DPO), who is in contact with the national <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> authorities. The legislation also specifies that ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’ penalties or financial fines may apply in the case of non-compliance with the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> rules.|$|R

40|$|The {{reform of}} the EU’s {{personal}} <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> regulations introduces {{the institution of the}} <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer,</b> assigning it <b>a</b> key role in the new personal <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> system thereto. Regulation (EU) 2016 / 679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95 / 46 /EC, builds the personal <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> model, wherein the main responsibility for adequate assessment of the risk associated with the processing of personal data and for the implementation of internal procedures to assure compliance of the referenced operations with the personal <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> regulations rests with a database administrator. Simultaneously, a database administrator should be capable of proving that he/she has duly met the requirements under the regulations, thus following the crucial rule for the processing of personal data, i. e. data accountability. The EU regulations describe the means and mechanisms to be used by <b>a</b> <b>data</b> processor to <b>a</b> lesser extent than those in force hitherto, focusing more on ensuring the standard of the protection of individual rights through data controllers' ethical and responsible activities. The key part in the new personal <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> model will be played by the institution of the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer,</b> intended to become a real guarantor of due observance of the personal <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> regulations. In this context, the appointment of the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer</b> by database administrators, not bound to do so by law, should be judged a sign of the organization's corporate social responsibility for the impact of its decisions and activities on society through transparent and ethical conduct. It is therefore essential to emphasize the important function to be performed, the authority to be had, and the necessary preparatory action to be taken by the <b>Data</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Officer</b> to that effect. The new regulations should be regarded as a chance to professionalize both the individuals, serving as information security officers and, in the near future, the data controllers, as well as the entire occupational group.

40|$|Defence date: 6 July 2011 Examining Board: Professor Giovanni Sartor, European University Institute (EUI Supervisor) Prof. Andrew Murray	 London School of Economics and Political Science Prof. Hans-W. Mickltz, European University Institute Dr. Alfonso Scirocco	 European Economic and Social CommitteeIn {{the context}} of the {{continuous}} advance of information technologies and biomedicine, and of the creation of economic blocs, this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the role <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> plays in the integration of markets, with a special emphasis on financial and insurance services. Moreover, it is also concerned with the identification of differences in the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> systems of EU member states and with the development of common standards and principles of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> that could help to build <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> model for Mercosur, keeping in mind the need to establish a high level of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> without creating unnecessary constraints for the flow of information. The thesis is divided into four parts. The first one deals with the evolution of the right to privacy, focusing on the last few decades, taking into account the development of new technologies. In this part an analysis of the European framework of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and of its standards developed is carried out. Then, in the second part, the interaction between <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and the industries selected as case studies, namely insurance, bank and credit reporting, is discussed. This discussion concentrates on specific issues, such as generalisation and discrimination, adverse selection and the processing of sensitive and genetic data. The focus of the third part is the analysis of the legislation of three EU member states (France, Italy and UK). In order to perform this comparative exercise, some important issues are taken into account: the concepts of personal and anonymous <b>data,</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> principles, the role of the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> authorities, the role of the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> <b>officer,</b> <b>data</b> subjects’ rights, the processing of sensitive data, the processing of genetic data and the experience of the case studies in processing data. Moreover, issues related to the specific member states are also considered. Subsequently to the comparative analysis, some recommendations are proposed for updating EU legislation on <b>data</b> <b>protection,</b> so as to reduce the barriers to the establishment of an internal market, mainly for financial and insurance services. Finally, the proposal of <b>a</b> model for <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> that could be adopted by Mercosur, taking into account the different levels of <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> that exist in its member states, is conducted in the last part. The thesis concludes by emphasising the important role <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> can play in the process of markets’ integration...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 the European Union adopted <b>a</b> Directive on <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> Article 25 of this Directive compels all EU member {{countries}} to adopt <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> legislation {{and to prevent}} the transfer of personal data to non-EU {{member countries}} ('third countries') that do not provide an adequate level of <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> Article 25 results in the Directive having extra-territorial effect and exerting an influence in countries outside the EU. Like South Africa, New Zealand is a 'third' country {{in terms of the}} EU Directive on <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> New Zealand recognised the need for <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> and adopted <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> Act over 15 years ago. The focus of this article is on the <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> provisions in New Zealand law with a view to establishing whether South Africa can learn any lessons from them. In general, {{it can be said that}} although New Zealand law does not expressly recognise a right to privacy, it has <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> regime that functions well and that goes a long way to providing adequate <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> as required by the EU Directive on <b>data</b> <b>protection.</b> Nevertheless, the EU has not made a finding to that effect as yet. The New Zealand <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> act requires <b>a</b> couple of amendments before New Zealand might be adjudged ‘adequate’. South Africa’s protection of the right to privacy and identity is better developed and more extensive than that of New Zealand. Privacy is recognised and protected in the law of delict and by the South African Constitution. Despite South Africa’s apparently high regard for the individual’s right to privacy and identity and our well-developed common and constitutional law of privacy, South Africa does not meet the adequacy requirement of the EU Directive, because we do not have <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>protection</b> Act. This means that South African participants in the information technology arena are at a constant disadvantage.
