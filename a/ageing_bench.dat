40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this CRADA was the {{improvement}} of performance and/or development of alternate systems for conventional fuel, flex-fuel, and alternate fuel vehicles {{in order to meet}} stringent future emission standards. The objectives had three major thrusts: (1) the characterization of the structural and chemical evolution of the precious metals and washcoat during <b>aging</b> under <b>bench</b> flow reactor, engine dynamometer, and vehicle conditions; (2) the correlation of measured catalyst performance and degradation over time with details of microstructural changes under bench flow reactor and engine dynamometer conditions; and (3) the simulation and testing of an in-cylinder catalyst system to determine the effect on emissions of a single-cylinder engine. Catalyst formulations for both gasoline and natural gas applications were studied. The emission testing and structural characterization were performed on alternate formulations and processing variables in order to evaluate the relative conversion efficiency, lifetime, and stability. The aging parameters were correlated with the evolving structure and properties of the tested catalytic converters. A major portion of the second thrust area was the construction and validation of both the bench flow reactor and engine dynamometer test facility and the identification of deactivation/regeneration mechanisms associated with alternative fuels relative to those for conventional fuel. A number of microstructural changes were identified that could contribute to the deactivation of the catalyst during aging. The stability of several catalyst formulations and alternate processing procedures relative to these microstructural changes and changes in conversion efficiency and lifetime were studied...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn view {{of their}} {{potential}} for high dielectric breakdown strengths, low dissipation factors, and good dielectric stability {{over a wide range}} of frequencies and temperature, metallized films capacitors are very used components for aeronautic applications. Nevertheless, capacitors remain unreliable components; a good acquaintance of their deterioration over time would enable us to perform a predictive maintenance on the component and thus improve the availability of the whole system. This operation requires the knowledge of the capacitor ageing law and their failure mechanisms associated with the application. In a standard six pulses rectifier-fed pulse width modulation inverter, dc-link capacitors are generally subjected to gradients of temperature due to the encountered electrical stresses. Since traditional floating ageing tests, which consist on applying constant voltages and temperature across the component, do not reflect the normal ageing of the component, we propose in this paper to study the degradation kinetics of metallized films capacitors under high ripple currents, alone or combined with a dc voltage across the devices terminals. It will therefore reproduce with a more representative way the ageing of the component in comparison with the traditional floating ageing tests. Based on the resonant circuit properties, the <b>ageing</b> test <b>bench</b> especially developed for our study provides high currents and voltages from a low power source. Through the study and analysis of the capacitors parameters evolution under high ripple currents, an original ageing law is proposed to model the capacitance decrease with time based on the electrochemical corrosion of the capacitors electrodes. The adequacy between the experimental points and the model proved the validity of the proposed law...|$|R
40|$|Turnstedt, M. – Background. Resistance {{training}} has many {{positive effects on}} {{the human body and}} can be beneficial for people all <b>ages.</b> The <b>bench</b> press exercise is a commonly used exercise that targets many upper body muscles such as pectotralis major, triceps brachii, deltoideus, serratus anterior and the abdominal muscles. Variations of the bench press exercise are common where grip width variations are supposed to largely impact the muscles targeted. Some research has been done to accurately decide whether these theories are true, however {{more research is needed to}} definitely decide the effect on muscle activity of grip width in bench press. Aim. The aim of this study was to compare the muscle activity with surface electromyography (EMG) in pectoralis major and triceps brachii between wide, regular and narrow grip width in the bench press exercise. Method. 21 healthy males (23. 19 ± 2. 5 years) volunteered to participate in this study. The raw EMG data from the bench presses were converted to root mean square and then average root mean square. The mean average muscle activation (in µV) was divided by a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and expressed as percent MVIC (%MVIC). Result. The results of the present study showed a statistically significantly higher muscle activation in the wide grip width compared to the narrow grip width in pectoralis major (p< 0. 005) and a statistically significantly higher muscle activation could be found in the narrow grip width compared to the wide grip width in triceps brachii (p< 0. 033). Conclusion. Practical use of this study is to use the narrow grip width in bench press when increased tricep brachii strength and size is desired and if increased pectoralis major strength and size is desired the wide grip bench press exercise is preferable...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} benches on nunataks of Alexander Island (Antarctica) are described. An {{increase}} in bench size with distance {{away from the}} retreating glacier suggests an <b>age</b> spectrum. The <b>benches</b> have thermal contraction cracks (in bedrock) on shallower, upper sections of the risers as well as salt encrusted runnels on the steeper lower section of the tread. The benches also show a distinct orientational preference (orientated to the north through to west) and, from first principles, these {{seem to be the}} aspects with optimal freeze-thaw cycles and temperatures conducive to thermal stress fatigue. The extensive dilatation associated with the retreating glaciers is thought to {{play a significant role in}} the origin and development of the benches as the combination of extensive jointing and optimal process conditions are thought to constrain where benches begin. The jointing, aided by the thermal contraction cracking, then facilitates extension and continued weathering of the treads. It would appear that these benches are examples of so called “cryoplanation terraces” that have been reported as fossil forms in Europe and North America. The study of such active forms in the Antarctic may provide good analogues for fossil features found in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|This letter notifies {{industry}} that the Air Resources Board (ARB) has approved, with modifications, {{the test procedure}} proposed by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers (AAM) and the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM) for certifying 2008 and later model-year (MY) gasoline vehicles to the optional zero-fuel evaporative emission standards. Beginning with MY 2008, manufacturers should use the procedure described in this MAC {{in lieu of the}} procedure outlined in MAC 2001 - 03 to demonstrate compliance with the zero-fuel evaporative emission standards. Other procedures may be used if approved, in advance, by the ARB. In summary, the modifications to MAC 2001 - 03 include, use of 150, 000 mile fuel evaporative emission level from rig tests as a deterioration factor for whole-vehicle evaporative emission standard compliance, wet and dry rig stabilization protocol, addition of manufacturer’s ARB-approved <b>bench</b> <b>aging</b> procedure to age wet rig, addition of ozone exposure protocol, policy clarifying the carry-over and carry-across of 2007 and earlier MY zero-fuel evaporative rig emission data to 2008 and subsequent MY, and reordering of rig test description for overall clarity. The Exhaust/Evaporative Emissions Trading Factors provided in MAC 2001 - 03 remain valid for MY 2008 and later vehicles. The trading factors remain at 0. 1 grams per test (g/test) of evaporative emissions per 0. 002 grams per mile (g/mi) of exhaust non-methane organic gas (NMOG). The trading factors and calculations for determining the factors are included in this MAC for ease of reference. If you have any additional questions, please contact Ms. Rhonda Runyon, Staff...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of {{washcoat}} composition on lean NOx trap (LNT) aging characteristics, fully formulated monolithic LNT catalysts containing varying amounts of La-stabilized CeO 2 (5 wt% La 2 O 3) or CeO 2 -ZrO 2 (Ce:Zr = 70 : 30) were subjected to accelerated <b>aging</b> on a <b>bench</b> reactor. Subsequent catalyst evaluation revealed that aging resulted in deterioration of the NOx storage, NOx release and NOx reduction functions, whereas the observation of lean phase NO 2 slip {{for all of the}} aged catalysts indicated that LNT performance was not limited by the kinetics of NO oxidation. After aging, all of the catalysts showed increased selectivity to NH 3 in the temperature range 250 – 450 °C. TEM, H 2 chemisorption, XPS and elemental analysis data revealed two main changes which can explain the degradation in LNT performance. First, residual sulfur in the catalysts, present as BaSO 4, decreased catalyst NOx storage capacity. Second, sintering of the precious metals in the washcoat was observed, which can be expected to decrease the rate of NOx reduction. Additionally, sintering is hypothesized to result in segregation of the precious metal and Ba phases, resulting in less efficient NOx spillover from Pt to Ba during NOx adsorption, as well as decreased rates of reductant spillover from Pt to Ba and reverse NOx spillover during catalyst regeneration. Spectacular improvement in LNT durability was observed for catalysts containing CeO 2 or CeO 2 -ZrO 2 relative to their non-ceria containing analog. This was attributed to (i) the ability of ceria to participate in NOx storage/reduction as a supplement to the main Ba NOx storage component; (ii) the fact that Pt and CeO 2 (-ZrO 2) are not subject to phase segregation; and (iii) the ability of ceria to trap sulfur, resulting in decreased sulfur accumulation on the Ba component...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to identify single chemical agents that exhibit a desirable rheological property whereby if such a chemical is dissolved in salt water it increases the solution viscosity significantly with time. We term that behavior as 'self-thickening' and have nicknamed this as 'T 85 technology'. As detailed in the original project proposal, such single chemical products {{can be applied to}} advantage as agents for selectively slowing or blocking high flow water channels in subsurface oil reservoirs. The net effect is a decrease in water and an increase in oil flow and production. The initial testing has focused on five different synthetic co-polymers that have two or more chemical groups. These chemicals were dissolved at a concentration of 2500 ppm into different salt solutions (sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride) that encompass a range of dissolved salt concentrations. For the sodium chloride and potassium chloride solutions the salt concentration ranged from 1 - 5 wt%. The calcium chloride dihydrate sample concentrations ranged from 0. 1 - 1 wt%. One set of samples being aged at 25 C and a second set at 50 C. Viscosity measurements versus aging time show two of these agents may exhibit apparent self-thickening behavior under certain salinity and temperature conditions. Generally the effect is greater in lower salinity NaCl brines and at 25 C. Preliminary flow experiments confirm that the aged fluids exhibit increased effective viscosity while flowing through a porous medium (sand pack). These flow tests include the case of the chemical fluid being <b>aged</b> on the <b>bench</b> before injection into a sand pack, and also a second series of sand packs where fresh chemical fluid is injected and allowed to age in-situ. Thus, the results of the static ageing tests together with the flow tests are a technical validation of the T 85 concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of oak wood {{contribution to the}} Canadian whisky ageing process was studied. A direct injection – gas chromatography mass spectrometry method was developed and optimized to accurately monitor thermally degraded wood extracts derived from hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. Thermally degraded wood extracts included furfural, 5 -methylfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, cyclotene, guaiacol, cis-whisky lactone, creosol, trans-whisky lactone, maltol, 4 -ethylguaiacol, eugenol, 4 -ethylphenol, syringol, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural, vanillin, and syringaldehyde. A three year ageing process of base Canadian whisky in brand new casks with 2 mm and 4 mm depth char, once used American Bourbon casks, and refurbished rechar casks were monitored over time for the thermally degraded wood extracts and compared. New casks had 80000 ppb of extract/LAA (litres of absolute alcohol), once-used AB casks had 20000 ppb of extract/LAA, and refurbished – rechar casks had 18000 ppb of extract/LAA {{at the end of}} the three year period. Extractions of wood compounds were logarithmic profiles. The time taken to extract half the total wood components of the three year ageing process was 30 - 50 days. To predict the ageing process in Canadian whisky the chemical structure of oak wood staves were determined using various alkaline and acid gravimetric digestions, and the results were calibrated with a fibre optic accessory from an NIR. The calibration models developed were neutral detergent solubles (RMSECV = 2. 65), hemicellulose (RMSECV = 2. 13), lignin (RMSECV = 2. 42), cellulose (RMSECV = 7. 22), and char (RMSECV = 7. 07). The models developed were adequate for screening purposes with RPD values of 1. 53 – 3. 74. A 60 day disc <b>ageing</b> study for <b>bench</b> top <b>ageing</b> experiments was developed to correlate the compound changes over time and the wood derived extracts in the surrounding spirit. It was determined that hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin derived compounds extract at different rates, and the error of the developed calibration models was too great in order to correlate loss in hemicellulose, lignin, and cellulose to the amount of wood extract that entered the whisky. The 60 day disc protocol was used to directly calibrate total wood extract in the spirit to the NIR probe. It was determined that NIR could be successfully used to predict the thermally degraded wood extract available on the surface layer below the char on a bench top level. The calibration model had a RMSECV of 914 ppb, R 2 of 0. 94, RPD of 3. 98, and a RER of 32. 53...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{knowledge}} of the most relevant deactivation mechanisms of Pd/Rh three-way catalysts under different ageing conditions, the deactivation correlation of laboratory scale ageing and engine bench/vehicle ageings, and the evaluation of the deactivation correlation. In the literature review, the phenomena involved in the three-way catalyst operation and its deactivation are considered. In the experimental section, ageing-induced phenomena in the catalyst are studied and deactivation correlations between laboratory scale and engine bench/vehicle ageings are presented, {{based on the results of}} several surface characterization techniques. The effects of ageing atmosphere and temperature, and time are considered in particular. Fresh and aged catalysts used in this study were metallic monoliths designed for Euro IV emission limits. Thermal ageings were carried out in the reductive, oxidative and inert atmospheres in the temperature range of 800 °C to 1200 °C, and in the presence of water vapour (hydrothermal ageing). The engine ageing was carried out in the exhaust gas stream of a V 8 engine during a 40 hour period. The ageing procedure composed of rich and stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratios carried out consecutively. The vehicle ageing was accomplished under real driving conditions (100 000 kilometres). According to the results, deactivation of a Pd/Rh monolith is a combination of several ageing phenomena. The most important deactivation mechanisms are the sintering of active phase, the collapse in surface area and ageing-induced solid-solid phase transitions in the bulk washcoat. Furthermore, poisoning is a relevant deactivation mechanism of the vehicle-aged catalyst. High ageing temperature, gas phase composition and exposure time are essential variables to the deactivation of a Pd/Rh three-way catalyst. This thesis presents an approach to discover the deactivation correlation between the laboratory scale ageing and under the vehicle's operation in an engine bench or on-road. Based on the characterization results, the accelerated laboratory scale air ageing does not correspond to the ageing-induced changes in the catalyst under the vehicle's operation. Therefore, there is a need for a modified ageing cycle and according to the results, a deactivation correlation between the laboratory scale ageing and the engine <b>bench</b> <b>ageing</b> can be presented as a function of ageing temperature and atmosphere, and time. Instead, after the vehicle operation, the deactivation correlation cannot be presented based solely on the studied variables because, after 100 000 kilometres of driving, the role of poisoning should be taken into account in the ageing cycle. The results of this thesis can be utilized and applied in the development of laboratory scale ageing cycles, which corresponds closely to the ageing-induced changes in the catalyst during the vehicle operation. This enables a rather fast testing of the catalyst's performance and reduces the cost during the manufacturing of catalysts...|$|R
