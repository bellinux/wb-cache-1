50|$|The {{dimensions}} <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of {{the human}} vagina are of great importance in medicine and surgery; {{there appears to be}} no one way, however, to characterize the vagina's size <b>and</b> <b>shape.</b> In addition to variations in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> from individual to individual, a single woman's vagina can vary substantially in size <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> during sexual arousal and sexual intercourse. Parity is associated with a significant increase in the length of the vaginal fornix. The potential effect of parity may be via stretching and elongation of the birth canal at the time of vaginal birth.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} {{geometric}} approach for formation control that explicitly decouples translation dynamics from the orientation <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> dynamics. The formation dynamics are modeled as controlled Lagrangian systems on Jacobi <b>shape</b> space, <b>and</b> measurements of <b>shape</b> variables {{are used as}} feedback to control the entire formation. This geometric approach allows {{each member of the}} formation, modeled as a Newtonian particle, freedom to choose different coordinate frame <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> variables to describe observed orientation <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> of the formation. We derive a class of cooperative control laws <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> consensus algorithms with provable convergence. They can be implemented in a distributed fashion thanks to gauge covariance and coordinate independence associated with the geometric approach. I...|$|R

Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the geometry of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E

30|$|Traffic {{policing}} <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> algorithms {{are commonly}} used when traffic limits are known or pre-determined in advance (e.g., for enforcing compliance with a contract). The difference between policing <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> is minor yet subtle: policing does not implement any queueing and excess packets are immediately dropped. Shaping, on the other hand, can absorb short bursts of packet, where the burst size {{is determined by the}} allocated buffer. When the buffer is full, all incoming packets are immediately dropped <b>and</b> traffic <b>shaping</b> effectively acts as traffic policing. Both policing <b>and</b> <b>shaping</b> are examples of non-work-conserving scheduling methods.|$|R

5|$|The Poveiro is a {{specific}} genre of boat characterized by a wide flat-bottom and a deep helm. There were diverse boats with different sizes, uses <b>and</b> <b>shapes.</b> The most notable of which, the Lancha Poveira, {{was believed to be}} derived from the Drakkar Viking, but without a long stern and bow and with a lateen sail. Each boat carried carvings, namely a sigla poveira mark for boat identification and magical-religious protection at sea. According to a tradition that persists to this day, the youngest son is the heir of the family, as in old Brittany and Denmark, because it was expected that he would take care of his parents when they became old. Women govern the family, because men were usually away from home fishing.|$|E

40|$|Tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> {{estimation}} of flexible robots that navigate through the human anatomy are prerequisites to safe intracorporeal control. Despite extensive research in kinematic and dynamic modelling, inaccuracies <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> deformation of the robot due to unknown loads and collisions with the anatomy make shape sensing important for intra-operative navigation. To address this issue, vision-based solutions have been explored. The task of 2 D tracking <b>and</b> 3 D <b>shape</b> reconstruction of flexible robots as they reach deep-seated anatomical locations is challenging, since the image acquisition techniques usually suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or slow temporal responses. Moreover, tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> estimation are thus far treated independently despite their coupled relationship. This paper aims to address tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> estimation in a unified framework based on Markov Random Fields (MRF). By using concentric tube robots as an example, the proposed algorithm fuses information extracted from standard monoplane X-ray fluoroscopy with the kinematics model to achieve joint 2 D tracking <b>and</b> 3 D <b>shape</b> estimation in realistic clinical scenarios. Detailed performance {{analyses of the}} results demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} method for both tracking <b>and</b> <b>shape</b> reconstruction...|$|R
5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to sizes <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> that enable oxygen to reach {{and carbon dioxide}} to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies by simple diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E

5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae <b>and</b> <b>shapes</b> of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E
