5|$|From {{its western}} {{terminus}} to <b>Aspen,</b> Highway 82 is a four-lane road, frequently divided. As it leaves <b>Aspen,</b> it narrows to two lanes and remains {{that way to}} its eastern terminus. Two sets of gates {{on either side of}} Independence Pass allow the road to be closed in winter.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} was halted {{during the war}} years afterward, although the Tenth Mountain Division, which trained at nearby Camp Hale, came to appreciate <b>Aspen</b> and its skiing. Many of them came back to <b>Aspen</b> after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited <b>Aspen</b> with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to <b>Aspen</b> again to live, work and play. While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to <b>Aspen</b> {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to <b>Aspen</b> despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
40|$|Quaking <b>aspens,</b> Populus tremuloides, are {{a widely}} used tree by many homeowners and {{professional}} landscapers. <b>Aspens</b> are fast growing and their ornamental beauty is sought after {{because of their}} white bark and leaves that shimmer and flutter in the slightest breeze. Unfortunately, <b>aspens</b> are prone to disease problems and as landscape maintenance professionals, {{it is important to}} recognize and be able to diagnose common problems associated with <b>aspens.</b> This report will address a problem commonly referred to as “black leaf spot ” on quaking <b>aspens...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Aspens</b> {{are one of}} {{the more}} popular forest trees in the Intermountain West. They add a {{brilliant}} yellow glow to the collage of fall colors. In an attempt to enjoy these beautiful trees around the home environment, many well-intentioned homeowners purchase or otherwise acquire <b>aspens</b> and transplant them into their landscapes. Unfortunately, <b>aspens</b> are not adapted to the environmental conditions of the valleys, and many problems develop...|$|R

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the <b>Aspen</b> connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the Rio Grande Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to <b>Aspen</b> in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into <b>Aspen</b> five months later.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, an FAA {{specialist}} {{had informed}} the crew {{that it would}} be illegal to land at night in <b>Aspen</b> under instrument flight rules. In addition, the crew were aware that due to noise abatement restrictions, their jet aircraft was required to land at <b>Aspen</b> by the 18:58 MST night curfew. Following the delayed departure from LAX, their estimated arrival time was 18:46 MST, twelve minutes before the curfew took effect.|$|E
5|$|In November, {{the three}} {{principal}} Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states in <b>Aspen,</b> Colorado. While officials left the meeting (later {{known as the}} <b>Aspen</b> Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could be charged {{with any of the}} murders.|$|E

60|$|The {{wilderness}} began all at once, {{as if by}} magic, to take on autumn colors. Then {{the forest}} became an enchanted region of white <b>aspens,</b> golden-green <b>aspens,</b> purple spruces, dark green pines, maples a blaze of vermilion, cerise, scarlet, magenta, rose--and slopes of dull red sumac. These were the beginning of Indian summer days, the melancholy days, with their color and silence and beauty and fragrance and mystery.|$|R

Of the larger islands, <b>Aspen</b> Island {{is located in}} Central Basin while Springbank and Spinnaker Island {{are located in the}} West Lake. <b>Aspen</b> Island is connected to dry land by a footbridge, and is the site of the Australian National Carillon.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{destroying}} suspected vampires varied, with staking {{the most commonly}} cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia. <b>Aspen</b> was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ's cross was made from <b>aspen</b> (<b>aspen</b> branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of <b>Aspen</b> was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment {{was added to the}} areas that receive no sun in the winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and <b>Aspen.</b> At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside <b>Aspen,</b> a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E

5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached <b>Aspen.</b> A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to <b>Aspen</b> within a decade. Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis for}} the highway.|$|E
5|$|Urnula craterium, when {{grown in}} liquid culture, {{produces}} bioactive chemicals that inhibit {{the growth of}} other fungi that are pathogenic to aspen; specifically, these chemical are antagonistic to <b>aspen</b> blue-stain fungi Ophiostoma crassivaginatum and O. piliferum, {{as well as the}} wood-decay fungus Phellinus tremulae. Chemicals produced by U.craterium include pestalotin, 5,6-dehydropestalotin, 4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-pyran-2-one, and (4S)-3,4-dihydro-4,8-dihydroxy-1(2H)-napthalenone. However, none of these isolated compounds inhibits the <b>aspen</b> pathogens in vitro, suggesting {{the true nature of the}} antifungal mechanism in the devil's urn has not yet been resolved.|$|E
5|$|West of <b>Aspen</b> {{the highway}} follows {{the route of}} an early Colorado Midland Railroad route from the city to Glenwood Springs. Paved during the 1930s, this road has been {{gradually}} expanded to four lanes {{over the course of}} the 20th and early 21st centuries. The increased traffic resulting from Aspen's economic rebirth as a resort town has required high-occupancy vehicle lanes, bypasses and the replacement of at least one old bridge. More improvements are planned for both <b>Aspen</b> and Glenwood Springs.|$|E
60|$|The next {{place to}} stir Helen to enthusiasm was the glen {{at the bottom}} of this canuon. Beech-trees, maples, <b>aspens,</b> {{overtopped}} by lofty pines, made dense shade over a brook where trout splashed on the brown, swirling current, and leaves drifted down, and stray flecks of golden sunlight lightened the gloom. Here was hard riding to and fro across the brook, between huge mossy boulders, and between <b>aspens</b> so close together that Helen could scarce squeeze her knees through.|$|R
60|$|He {{skirted the}} curve of the valley and led Bolly a little way up the wooded slope to a dense thicket of <b>aspens</b> in a hollow. This thicket encircled a patch of grass. Hare pressed the lithe <b>aspens</b> aside to admit Bolly and left her there free. He drew his rifle from its sheath and, after assuring himself that the mustang could not be seen or heard from below, he bent his steps diagonally up the slope.|$|R
60|$|And the <b>aspens</b> grew as no <b>aspens</b> {{had ever}} grown before. In each day they added a year's growth, and each night they added a year's growth, and at dawn, when the stars faded {{out of the}} sky, they grew three years' growth in the {{twinkling}} of an eye, and their boughs swept across the palace windows. And when the wind moved them softly, the emperor would sit and listen to them all the day long.|$|R

While he had little experience as a skier, he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an <b>Aspen</b> to Vail record of 59h, 53min, 30s in February 1998, and an <b>Aspen</b> to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.|$|E

6000|$|The {{poor little}} babies had found no rest {{even in their}} graves.

50|$|Like other <b>aspens,</b> {{it spreads}} {{extensively}} by suckers (root sprouts), {{which may be}} produced up to 40 m from the parent tree, forming extensive clonal colonies.|$|R
5|$|Beyond the airport, Highway 82 turns due south. It {{bends to}} the {{southeast}} to cross the new Maroon Creek Bridge, with the original, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, immediately to its south. At this point, with a golf course on the north side, the <b>Aspen</b> city limit begins to follow the road, {{and by the time}} it goes through a roundabout and passes the Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of <b>Aspen.</b> Another stream crossing, Castle Creek, brings the highway into the developed portion of the city.|$|E
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and honeysuckle (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth <b>aspen</b> (Populus grandidentata) and quaking <b>aspen</b> (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Half of {{the trees}} in the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are northern hardwood trees. The remainder includes oak trees, which make up 29 percent of the watershed's trees, red maple (4 percent), <b>aspen</b> and gray birch (3 percent), Virginia pine, white pine, and hemlock (1 percent each).|$|E
