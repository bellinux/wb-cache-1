She favored the association with married couples and older people, and rather shunned the pairing off peculiar to vacationists at summer hotels. She {{had always loved}} to play and romp with children, but here she found herself growing to avoid them, somehow hurt by sound of pattering feet and joyous laughter. She filled the days as best she could, and usually earned quick slumber at night. She staked all on present occupation and the truth of flying time.|$|R

As part of this project, he constructed a bridge over the Petrel Lake, known as the [...] (Black Bridge), and another in Cáhuil, connecting that town with its saltworks. He also founded several schools in the Pichilemu area, which only had one, located in Ciruelos.

Belmond Tchoumba of the Centre Camerounais pour l'Environnement et le Développement (Cameroun Environment and Development Centre) deplored that [...] "all these people hold us in unacceptable contempt". Euloge N'Zobo, of the Observatoire Congolais des Droits de l'Homme (Congolese Observatory for Human Rights) noted that [...] "the acts of conservation do not pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> primarily concerned".|$|E
2500|$|On December 12, 2007, in {{response}} to the death of Robert Dziekański, Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day requested that the federal Commission for Public Complaints Against the RCMP (CPC) prepare recommendations for immediate implementation.

2500|$|Critiques of the {{doctrine}} have suggested that it embodies [...] "imperial feminism", the promotion of feminist values {{in order to justify}} militarism and a modern-day U.S. empire. Another line of concern is that U.S. actions put women at risk over time, with particular <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who were encouraged to take a more prominent role in pushing for women's rights in Afghanistan and anxiety for their safety following the planned withdrawal of U.S. forces from that country. Indeed, Hudson and Leidl consider the condition of Afghan women to be a litmus test for whether the Hillary Doctrine can achieve realization. Other theories to explain the root causes of conflict and international instability also exist, such as the Clash of Civilizations hypothesis, democratic peace theory, and an emphasis on environmental poverty and scarcity.|$|E

The discussion also covers large eddy simulations and turbulence modeling...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, I {{had so much}} {{confidence}} in myself, that I was quite convinced that I could escape. In the second, my family, though of good repute, has never been wealthy, and I could not bring myself to take anything from the small income of my mother. On the other hand, it would never do for a man like me to be outshone by the bourgeois society of an English country town, or to be without the means of showing courtesies and <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> ladies whom I should attract. It was for these reasons that I preferred {{to be buried in}} the dreadful prison of Dartmoor.
