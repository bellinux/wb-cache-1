Consequently, it doesn't need the current limiting reactors and has a quickly response for a load variation.

40|$|A {{potential}} upgrade for the front-end {{electronics and}} signal digitization and {{data acquisition system}} of the ATLAS hadron calorimeter for the high luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is described. A Demonstrator is being built to readout {{a slice of the}} TileCal detector. The on-detector electronics includes up to 48 Analog Front-end Boards for PMT analog signal processing, 4 Main Boards for data digitization and slow controls, 4 Daughter Boards with high speed optical links to interface the on-detector and off-detector electronics. Two super readout driver boards are used for off-detector data acquisition and fulfilling digital trigger. The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter on-detector electronics is housed in the drawers at the back of each of the 256 detector wedges. Each drawer services up to 48 photomultiplier tubes. The new readout system is designed to replace the present system as it will reach component lifetime and radiation tolerance limits making it incompatible with continued use into the HL-LHC era. With demonstrator, we are preparing test samples of each of the components needed for the full upgrade. It is envisioned that at least one drawer of the new electronics will be installed in the detector for the LHC RUN- 2 in 2014. This will permit us to acquire experience and detail studies with fully digital trigger scheme without reconfiguring the present <b>analog</b> <b>trigger</b> system for data taking in 2015 - 2022...|$|E
40|$|The ATLAS {{experiment}} {{is one of}} the two general-purpose detectors designed to study proton-proton collisions (14 TeV in the center of mass) produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and to explore the full physics potential of the LHC machine at CERN. The ATLAS Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeters are high precision, high sensitivity and high granularity detectors designed to provide precision measurements of electrons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy. ATLAS (and its LAr Calorimeters) has been operating and collecting p-p collisions at LHC since 2009. The on-detector electronics (front-end) part of the current readout electronics of the calorimeters measures the ionization current signals by means of preamplifiers, shapers and digitizers and then transfers the data to the off-detector electronics (back-end) for further elaboration, via optical links. Only the data selected by the level- 1 calorimeter trigger system are transferred, achieving a bandwidth reduction to 1. 6 Gbps. The <b>analog</b> <b>trigger</b> sum signals are formed on the front-end electronics boards and sent, via copper cables, to the receiver part of the trigger system. The number of channels in the LAr readout is ~ 200 K. The front-end electronics is composed of 58 electronics crates, housing 1524 signal processing boards (FEBs) plus 300 other electronics boards. Each crate is powered by a radiation tolerant power supply. There are ~ 1600 optical links between the front- end and the back-end system. The back-end electronics consists of 16 crates, 192 Read Out Drivers (ROD). Each ROD receives data from up to 8 FEBs and calculates the energy deposited and the time of the deposition using an optimum filtering algorithm. The current front-end electronics need to be upgraded to sustain the higher radiation levels and data rates expected at the upgraded LHC machine (HL-LHC), which will have 5 times more luminosity than the LHC in its ultimate configuration. The complexity of the present electronics and the obsolescence of some of components of which it is made, will not allow a partial replacement of the system. A completely new readout architecture scheme is under study and many components are being developed in various R&D programs of the LAr collaboration group. The new front-end readout will send data continuously at each bunch crossing through high speed radiation resistant optical links. The data (~ 100 Gbps for each board) will be processed real-time with the possibility of implementing trigger algorithms for clusters and electron/photon identification at a higher granularity than that which is currently implemented. The new architecture simplifies the system design while keeping many options open, such as pipeline design, shaping, gain setting, etc. Moreover it will eliminate the intrinsic limitation presently existing on Level- 1 trigger acceptance. This talk will cover architectural design aspects of the new electronics as well as some detailed progress on the development of several ASICs needed, e. g. new ADCs and/or new optical links. Preliminary studies with FPGA’s to cover the backend functions including part of the Level- 1 trigger requirements will also be presented...|$|E

Patient(s) : 24 women who were treated with GnRH agonist or hCG for triggering of ovulation. Interventions: GC collection. Main Outcome Measure(s) : The expression of genes related to steroidogenesis and OHSS in mural GCs Results: The fertilization rate was similar in the two groups. The mRNA expression of CYP 19 A 1 (0. 50 vs 1, arbitrary unit), CYP 11 A 1 (0. 6 vs. 1) and 3 beta hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (0. 39 vs 1) was significantly lower in the GnRH group.

40|$|N 6 -isopentenyladenosine (i 6 A), a {{naturally}} occurring modified nucleoside, inhibits {{the proliferation of}} human tumor cell lines in vitro, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Treatment of MCF 7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells with i 6 A or with three synthetic analogs (allyl 6 A, benzyl 6 A, and butyl 6 A) inhibited growth and altered gene expression. About 60 % of the genes that were differentially expressed in response to i 6 A treatment were also modulated by the analogs, and pathway enrichment analysis identified the NRF 2 -mediated oxidative stress response as being significantly modulated by all four compounds. Luciferase reporter gene assays in transfected MCF 7 cells confirmed that i 6 A activates the transcription factor NRF 2. Assays for cellular production of reactive oxygen species indicated that i 6 A and analogs had antioxidant effects, reducing basal levels and inhibiting the H 2 O 2 - or 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) -induced production in MCF 7 or dHL- 60 (HL- 60 cells induced to differentiate along the neutrophilic lineage) cell lines, respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Polymeric {{fibronectin}} (polyFN) assembled on suspended {{breast cancer}} cells {{is required for}} metastasis. Conceivably, drugs that target such polyFN may fight against cancer metastasis. While stilbene <b>analogs</b> <b>trigger</b> pro-apoptotic effect on attached cancer cells, whether they prevent polyFN assembly and metastasis of suspended cancer cells via an apoptosis-independent manner remains unexplored. Methods We depleted suspended Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells of polyFN by silencing the endogenous FN expression or pterostilbene (PS) to examine whether metastasis of lung cancer cells could thus be suppressed. We investigated whether PS regulates AKT-ERK signaling axis to suppress polyFN assembly in suspended LLC cells independently of apoptosis. We tested the therapeutic effects of orally administered PS against cancer metastasis. Results Both FN-silencing and PS among the three stilbenoids indeed significantly reduced polyFN assembly and lung metastasis of suspended LLC cells in an apoptosis-independent manner. Mechanistically, PS-induced AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) and suppressed ERK phosphorylation (pERK) in suspended LLC cells, whereas pretreatment with a PI 3 K inhibitor, LY 294002, effectively reduced pAKT, rescued pERK, and consequently reversed the PS-suppressed polyFN assembly on LLC cells; these pretreatment effects were then overturned by the ERK inhibitor U 0126. Indeed, PS-suppressed lung metastasis was counteracted by LY 294002, which was further overruled with U 0126. Finally, we found that PS, when orally administered in experimental metastasis assays, both significantly prevented lung colonization and metastasis of LLC cells and reduced the already established tumor growth in the mouse lungs. Conclusions PS suppressed AKT/ERK-regulated polyFN assembly on suspended LLC cells and pulmonary metastasis. PS possesses potency in both preventing and treating lung metastasis of lung cancer cells in apoptosis-independent and apoptosis-dependent manners, respectively...|$|R
