The new models treat, respectively, further linear effects within the solar panel load circuit and non-linear effects associated with the plasma interactions. Results of computer calculations with the models show common-mode voltage transients of the electrically floating solar panel struck by an arc comparable to the early model but load transients that differ substantially from the early model.

This paper focuses on this issue with regards to small turboprop aircraft. An electrochemical propulsion system would employ liquid hydrogen in an air breathing fuel cell that would generate electricity to run electric motors which in tum power the props. The major question this paper addresses is: under what conditions will <b>a</b> hydrogen/fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> be superior to a state of the art hydrogen/gas turbine power system? The systems are compared on a fuel consumption basis, a cost basis, and a reliability/ maintainability basis.

In general, the fuel <b>cell</b> <b>system</b> is heavier but more efficient than the gas turbine.

40|$|Small hopping robots {{have been}} {{proposed}} that offer the potential to greatly increase the reach of unmanned space exploration. Using hopping, bouncing, and rolling, a small spherical robot could access and explore subterranean areas, such as craters and caves, on distant planets. Hopping mobility allows the robot to overcome larger obstacles than conventional wheeled rovers. Bouncing and rolling allows the robot to infiltrate underground areas too challenging and dangerous for manned exploration. The robots would use onboard sensors to explore and search for signs of water, biological material, and other items of interest to scientists. This thesis studies the power and mobility feasibility of the Microbot hopping robot concept. One {{of the most important}} mobility issues for autonomous robots is the availability of energy and how that energy is used. The Microbot utilizes <b>a</b> hydrogen fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>system.</b> <b>A</b> fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> design is proposed and an experimental prototype device was constructed and tested. The results presented indicate that a miniature hydrogen fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> is <b>a</b> feasible energy generation option for the Microbot system concept. The feasibility of the hopping mobility system is also investigated. An integrated power consumption model of the Microbot is proposed and the ability of the Microbot power and mobility systems to complete a Martian reference mission is demonstrated. Simulated studies of the mobility system's capacity to overcome obstacles and navigate the Martian terrain are presented. The results of these simulations are analyzed and the mobility and power system design tradeoffs are examined. Finally, recommendations for future research are made. by Samuel. B. Kesner. Thesis (S.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} experimental {{results of an}} hybridization between a classic ventilated facade and photo-voltaic panels <b>powering</b> <b>a</b> Peltier <b>cells</b> <b>system</b> to improve the inner summer comfort with an environmental friendly approach. The outer layer of the facade is made of photovoltaic panels while a pair of light alloy heat exchanger, coupled on the {{opposite sides of the}} Peltier cells, are fitted between the internal space and the air chimney of the facade. The Peltier cells are electrically wired directly with the solar cells: the more the sun affects the front, the more the solar <b>cells</b> produce <b>power</b> to feed the Peltier cells that work as a static heat pump, cooled by the air flowing through the interspace of the ventilated facade. This will result in an inside cooling effect and this effect shall be summed with the well-known passive good performance of the ventilated facade in summer sunny days. During the winter, a simple switch of the power polarity would result in a free inner heating effect, partially using the solar energy incident on the front: the risk of icing on the cold exchanger in the chimney would be reduced because of the heat transmitted by the rear side of the photo-voltaic cells. A small scale prototype has been tested during summer, showing an improvement of the inner air temperature of about 3 - 4 K during the sunniest hours, in comparison with the unequipped case...|$|R
40|$|The {{operational}} capacity of an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) {{is limited by}} many different challenges. Limited energy storage and loss of wheel traction can interrupt completion of the robot's mission. To prevent these disruptions to robot operation, three different problems are considered: trajectory planning for an area coverage mission with energy considerations, efficient <b>power</b> management for <b>a</b> hybrid <b>power</b> system, and traction control to prevent wheel slip. An area coverage mission consists of driving the robot within sensor range of every point in a region. To plan operation, the energy usage characteristics of the robot are required. A method to determine motor efficiency and energy usage is presented. To balance the mission goals and the energy required for operation, a novel cost function, weighting motor torques, area covered and motor efficiency, is used to plan the trajectory. This trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path planned using existing techniques. We show how the cost function {{can be used to}} tradeoff between energy usage and time required to complete the mission. To increase onboard energy storage, we propose <b>a</b> hybrid <b>power</b> system for <b>a</b> UGV. This combination of power sources requires additional control algorithms to determine which sources should be used throughout the mission. Our control algorithm is based on forming a model of the hybrid power system with <b>power</b> demands from <b>a</b> particular mission. To make the control optimization problem tractable, the model is simplified by using averaged dynamics. Using this model, power management is optimized to limit energy losses. Simulation and Experimental results with <b>a</b> battery/fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> are presented and show 5 % decrease in energy usage compared to a baseline control strategy. Both lateral and longitudinal wheel slip must be controlled to prevent loss of traction. Using a slipping UGV model, based on automotive friction models, we develop two control algorithms: a novel switching controller and a sliding mode controller. The switching controller considers both lateral and longitudinal wheel slip and completes turning maneuvers. The sliding mode controller, based on automotive techniques, only controls longitudinal wheel slip, possibly losing traction while turning...|$|R

All fuel <b>cell</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> consist {{of one or more}} fuel cell stacks in combination with appropriate balance-of-plant hardware. Traditional PEM fuel cells are characterized as flow-through, in which recirculating reactant streams remove product water from the fuel cell stack.
