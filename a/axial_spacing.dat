5000|$|Three-dimensionality in {{turbomachine}} increases {{complexity in}} flow field so, determination of losses becomes difficult unlike two-dimensional losses where equation complexity is little. Three-dimensionality includes large pressure gradients in every direction, design/curvature of blade, shock wave, heat transfer, cavitation and viscous effects, which generates secondary flow, vortices, tip leakage vortices and other losses. Viscous effects in turbomachinery causes blockage to the flow by formation of viscous layers around blade profile which effect pressure rise/fall and reduce effective area of flow field. Interaction between these losses in rotor increase instability and decreases in efficiency of turbomachinery. In calculation of three-dimensional losses every parameter comes into picture of flow path like <b>axial</b> <b>spacing</b> between vane and blade rows, end wall curvature, radial distribution of pressure gradient, hup/tip ratio, dihedral, lean, tip clearance, flare, aspect ratio, skew, sweep, platform cooling holes, surface roughness, off take bleeds.

Correlation based on geometric similarity has been developed by many industries in form of charts, graphs, data statistics and performance data.

The three dimensional solver models the unsteady flow field due to blade vibration using the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The formulation enables {{the study of the}} effect of blade row interaction through the inclusion of coupling modes between blade rows.

40|$|Results of an {{analytical}} and experimental investigation, {{directed at the}} understanding of the impact of periodic unsteadiness on the time-averaged flows in axial flow turbomachines, are presented. Analysis of available experimental data, from a large-scale rotating rig (LSRR) (low speed rig), shows that in the time-averaged axisymmetric equations the magnitude of the terms representing the effect of periodic unsteadiness (deterministic stresses) are as large or larger than those due to random unsteadiness (turbulence). Numerical experiments, conducted to highlight physical mechanisms associated with the migration of combustor generated hot-streaks in turbine rotors, indicated that the effect can be simulated by accounting for deterministic stress like terms in the time-averaged mass and energy conservation equations.

Comparison with IGV surface unsteady pressure experimental data indicates good agreement at the IGV trailing edge across the span for both spacing configurations; therefore, validating the modeling {{of the high}} speed, highly loaded transonic compressor. The strongest effect on the tip clearance flow physics was caused by decreasing the <b>axial</b> <b>spacing.</b> The 12 % <b>axial</b> <b>spacing,</b> baseline configuration {{had a significant effect}} on the cross location of the leading edge tip vortex and the rotor bow shock (i. e. the lambda shaped interaction region).

The back pressure influence was important. The high loading at the near stall condition prevented any significant IGV wake interaction effect on the tip clearance flow. For the chocked flow condition, the bow shock structure change (going from a normal shock to an oblique shock) reduces the bow shock strength. The IGV wake caused the tip vortex to intensify, this is mainly caused by a decrease in the bow shock strength. Vortex breakdown occurs due to deceleration after passing a strong shock, which for the choked case does not happen until the vortex reaches the passage shock...|$|E
