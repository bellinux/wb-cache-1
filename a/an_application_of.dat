5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG image format is <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration was a {{diplomatic}} statement issued on July 23, 1940 by Sumner Welles, the United States' acting Secretary of State, condemning the June 1940 occupation by the Soviet Union {{of the three}} Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and refusing to recognize their annexation as Soviet Republics. It was <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the 1932 Stimson Doctrine of non-recognition of international territorial changes that were executed by force. It was consistent with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s attitude towards territorial expansion.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of continued control of Alberta's resources {{by the federal}} government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the electrical grid, Calgary Power made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper Bow River. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made <b>an</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by Charles Stewart, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.|$|E
