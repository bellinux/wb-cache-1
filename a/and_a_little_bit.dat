500|$|They {{sought to}} make Enterprise more {{character}} driven than the previous series in the Star Trek franchise, and hoped that this would gain viewers who had watched The Next Generation but had lost interest with Deep Space Nine and Voyager. It was intended to link the series directly into The Original Series by having T'Pau as a main character, who had previously appeared in the episode [...] "Amok Time". Instead, this character was developed into an original Vulcan character, T'Pol. Berman explained his vision for the series at launch, saying that [...] "we'll be seeing humanity when they truly are going where no man has gone before. We are seeing people who don't take meeting aliens as just {{another part of the}} job. It's not routine. Nothing is routine. Also, by bringing it back 200 years from Voyager, we're making the characters closer to the present, and by doing that they can {{be a little bit more}} accessible <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more flawed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more familiar to you and me." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Ocean, {{the music}} video for [...] "Novacane" [...] {{was a simple}} process.

500|$|Allison Mack was {{disappointed}} that the character [...] "lost some of her backbone" [...] in the second season.

[...] "Cowboy Style" [...] is a Celtic pop song that lasts a duration of four minutes and forty-four seconds. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "Cowboy Style features a tribal percussion break and a string quartet that sounds more Celtic than country." [...] Online music critic Adrian Denning compared the song {{to the work of}} Icelandic recording artist and songwriter Björk.
