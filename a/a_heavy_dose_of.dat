5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> influenza that {{forced him to}} miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed {{in the next two}} tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E

50|$|Polenin {{returns to}} the command deck after helping put out the torpedo room fire, dejected because only one {{survivor}} remained. He sees Vostrikov handcuffed to a ladder, then deceives the mutineers into handing over their weapons and places them under arrest; he then frees Vostrikov. Believing the repairs to have failed and unaware that Radtchenko had gone in alone to patch up the new leaks, Vostrikov, {{at the behest of}} Polenin, tells the crew what has happened, and his rationale for a subsequent dive to attempt another repair; he is afraid that if the reactor were to overheat, it could set off the actual nuclear warheads carried by the K-19 and the accident would destroy not just the K-19 but also the nearby American ship, provoking an American retaliatory attack and possibly inciting nuclear war. Vostrikov then waits for the crew to respond to his recommendation; the crew subsequently responds in the affirmative, and the K-19 dives. Vostrikov then goes back to the reactor section after hailing Radtchenko and receiving no reply. Radtchenko's repairs were successful, but he received <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> radiation than earlier teams, having stayed in 18 minutes to complete his repair. Unable to see and too weak to properly extricate himself from the reactor chamber, Radtchenko is dragged out personally by Captain Vostrikov. The repairs prevent a reactor meltdown, but radiation is leaking throughout the submarine due to irradiated steam leakage from the reactor's damage.|$|R

Fasolt is a fine scholar, and when he turns to the central chapters of the book, on the work of Hermann Conring (1606 - 1681), he has many adroit and interesting things to say...|$|R
5000|$|Language {{peaked at}} #52 on the Billboard 200 while {{receiving}} nearly universal acclaim among progressive metal circles. Jeff Stevens of Prog Metal Zone said the album [...] "strikes a seamless balance between <b>heavy</b> technicality and <b>a</b> strong progressive melodic approach along with <b>a</b> very <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> jazz fusion {{to really make}} their sound {{one of the most}} exciting and sophisticated approaches in modern metal." [...] Chris Grenville of The Monolith described the second and third tracks as [...] "ten of the best minutes of progressive songwriting I’ve heard all year." [...] He went on to draw parallels with previous progressive metal works stating that [...] "comparisons with Cynic are easily made - the light/dark dynamic of the record; the timbre and intensity of the throaty screams; the feeling of weightlessness it gives you." [...] Weid Reitz of This is Not A Scene praised the album stating [...] "The song concept and structure, as well as sound quality, are superior to any of the band’s previous releases." [...] Chris Kemp of The Circle Pit lauded the band's potential to [...] "lead the way for an entire genre" [...] and concluded his review asserting the album would [...] "take them very far, not just within the Prog metal scene but in all things artistic and entertaining.". Stefan Andonov from Djent Mag praises the philosophical approach in the album by stating [...] "Language reviews enormous subjects about the metaphysics in the universe and communication as a celestial phenomenon, the depth of the lyrics is mind-blowing." ...|$|R
5000|$|The By the Way World Tour {{was another}} {{successful}} tour {{for the band}} behind another chart-topping album.

25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help him stay with Nencini on Col de Perjuret.

Another UMass punt and then three plays later running back James White scores on a 51-yard touchdown run. UMass then put together a nice drive that got down to the Badgers 38-yard line but Wisconsin CB Sojour Shelton intercepted the UMass pass. The Badgers took over at their own 22-yard line and five plays later they were in the end zone again with a 57-yard touchdown pass to Jared Abbrederis from Joel Stave. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, Wisconsin led 38–0. The Badgers would close out the scoring less than two minutes into the fourth quarter with a 23-yard touchdown run by true freshman running back, Corey Clement, his first career touchdown. UMass then used a 12-play drive to get down to the Badgers 33-yard line but failed on a fourth down conversion. <b>A</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> running the ball with Corey Clement help the Badgers run off the final seven and a half minutes of the game and giving Wisconsin a 45–0 victory.|$|E

6000|$|If {{the champions}} of “Unity” were wise, {{they would take}} Esmond as a battle-horse, for it is certain that, great as are its parts, the whole is greater than almost any one of them—which is {{certainly}} not the case with Pendennis. And it is further certain that, of these parts, the personages of the hero and the heroine stand out commandingly, which {{is certainly not the}} case with Pendennis, again. The unity, however, is of a peculiar kind: and differs from the ordinary non-classical “Unity of Interest” which Thackeray almost invariably exhibits. It is rather a Unity of Temper, which is also present (as the all-pervading motto Vanitas Vanitatum almost necessitates) in all the books, but here reaches a transcendence not elsewhere attained. The brooding spirit of Ecclesiastes here covers, as it were, with the shadow of one of its wings the joys and sorrows, the failures and successes of a private family and their friends, with the other the fates of England and Europe; the fortunes of Marlborough and of Swift on their way from dictatorship, in each case, to dotage and death; the big wars and the notable literary triumphs as well as the hopeless passions or acquiescent losses. It is thus an instance—and the greatest—of that revival of the historical novel which was taking place, and in which the novel of Scott(1)—simpler, though not so very simple as is sometimes thought—is being dashed with <b>a</b> far <b>heavier</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> the novel-element as opposed to the romance, yet without abandonment of the romance-quality proper. Of these novel-romance scenes, as they may be called, the famous mock-duel at the end is of course the greatest. But that where the Duke of Hamilton has to acknowledge the Marquis of Esmond, and where Beatrix gives the kiss of Beatrix, is almost as great: and there are many others. It is possible that this very transcendence accounts to some extent for the somewhat lukewarm admiration which it has received. The usual devotee of the novel of analysis dislikes the historic, and has taught himself to consider it childish; the common lover of romance (not the better kind) feels himself hampered by the character-study, as Émile de Girardin’s subscribers felt themselves hampered by Gautier’s style. All the happier those who can make the best of both dispensations! ...|$|R

It begins with Mahesh bathing in a pond, humming a popular song from 2000's Narasimham (a cult action film). It also alludes to the doomed character Sethumadhavan's vengeance in Kireedam (1989) and Chenkol (1993).

Jaan Uhelszki of Alternative Press felt that the album is made of [...] "sterner stuff", with the band's prog-metal foundation [...] "enhanced by an unexpectedly powerful sense of melody".

500|$|MTV Buzzworthy's Chris Ryan gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} video, stating that it [...] "marks {{a change in the}} way we look at music videos as a medium -- it's less a music video, more a modern art montage with <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian imagery and possible references to Michelangelo's [...] "The Creation of Adam" [...] (with a fair Kanye-esque helping of chesty females). In it, Kanye West ironically builds an unattainable artistic empire fit for a king (or pharaoh), while condemning the role power plays in our lives. So much to think about."

500|$|Nolan {{began with}} the {{structure}} of a heist movie, since exposition is an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious. Or, as Denby surmised, [...] "the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper". Kristin Thompson argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>dose</b> <b>of</b> exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, in Inception this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming. Three-quarters of the film, until the van begins to fall from the bridge, are devoted to explaining its plot. In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterisation. Their relationships are created by their respective skills and roles. Ariadne, like her ancient namesake, creates the maze and guides the others through it, but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious, and as the sole student of dream sharing, helps the audience understand the concept of the plot.|$|E
