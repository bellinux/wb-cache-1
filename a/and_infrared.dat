5|$|Bioluminescence occurs widely among animals, {{especially}} in the open sea, including fish, jellyfish, comb jellies, crustaceans, and cephalopod molluscs; in some fungi and bacteria; and in various terrestrial invertebrates including insects. About 76% of the main taxa of deep-sea animals produce light. Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum. However, some loose-jawed fish emit red <b>and</b> <b>infrared</b> light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral remote-sensing in the {{reflected}} <b>infrared</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>infrared</b> regions offers {{a unique and}} efficient alternative for mineral mapping, as most minerals exhibit spectral features in these regions, mainly in the shortwave <b>and</b> longwave <b>infrared.</b> Airborne hyperspectral data in both spectral regions, acquired with the AisaFENIX and AisaOWL (Specim) sensors over Makhtesh Ramon in Israel, were analyzed. Calculating the reflectance and emissivity spectra of each pixel in the shortwave <b>infrared</b> <b>and</b> longwave <b>infrared</b> region images, respectively, and determining mineral indices enabled identifying the dominant minerals in this area—kaolinite, calcite, dolomite, quartz, feldspars and gypsum—and mapping their spatial distribution in the surface. The benefit of using hyperspectral data from both reflected <b>infrared</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>infrared</b> regions to improve mineral identification was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of earth surface processes at {{a global scale}} requires high temporal frequency remote sensing observations provided up to now by moderate spatial resolution sensors (from 250 m to 7 kin). Non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables derived from remote sensing data can be biased by the surface spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel. Quantifying this surface spatial heterogeneity is thus required to correct non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables. The first step in this process is to properly characterize the scale of spatial variation of the processes structuring the landscape. Since the description of land surface processes generally involves various spectral bands, a multivariate approach to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote sensing observations has to be established. This work aims at quantifying the landscape spatial heterogeneity captured by red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> high spatial resolution images using direct and cross-variograms modeled together with the geostatistical linear model of coregionalization. This model quantifies the overall spatial variability and correlation of red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> reflectances over the scene. In addition, it provides an explicit understanding of the landscape spatial structures captured by red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> reflectances <b>and</b> is thus appropriate to describe landscapes composed of areas with contrasted red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> spectral properties. The application of the linear model of coregionalization to 18 contrasted landscapes provides a spatial signature of red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> spectral properties characterizing each type of landscape. Low vegetation cover sites are characterized by positive spatial correlation between red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared.</b> The mosaic pattern of vegetation fields and bare soil fields over crop sites generates high and negative spatial correlation between red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> <b>and</b> increases the spatial variability of red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared.</b> On forest sites, the important amount of vegetation limits the spatial variability of red and the shadow effects mainly captured by near infrared induce a low and positive spatial correlation between red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared.</b> Finally, the linear model of coregionalization applied to red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> is shown to be {{more powerful than the}} univariate variogram modeling applied to NDVI because the second order stationarity hypothesis on which variogram modeling relies is more frequently verified for red <b>and</b> near <b>infrared</b> than for NDVI...|$|R

5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical <b>and</b> <b>infrared</b> images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the infrared imaging of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section <b>and</b> <b>infrared</b> signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
