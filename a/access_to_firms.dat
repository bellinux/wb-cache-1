English is the official language. Member firms, which are initially admitted on the basis of quality, reputation, size and volume of international work, as a basic tenet, have no formal association with each of the other member firms, i.e., each is independent, thus giving each firm <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> all over the world to assist with its clients’ legal matters with little likelihood that there will be a conflict of interest.CONSULEGIS maintains its headquarters in Munich, Germany, with a Managing Director and staff responsible for coordination among firms, semi-annual conferences, member development and processing of applicants, marketing and all administrative activities.|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{literature}} on the gender pay gap has taught us that occupations matter and so do firms. However, {{the role of the}} firm has received little scrutiny; occupations have most often been coded in a rather aggregate way, lumping together different jobs; and the use of samples of workers prevents any reliable determination of either the extent of segregation or the relative importance of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> versus occupations. Our contribution is twofold. We provide a clear measure {{of the impact of the}} allocation of workers to firms and to job titles shaping the gender pay gap. We also provide a methodological contribution that combines the estimation of sets of high-dimensional fixed effects and Gelbach's (2009) unambiguous decomposition of the conditional gap. We find that one fifth of the gender pay gap results from segregation of workers across firms and one fifth from job segregation. We also show that the widely documented glass ceiling effect operates mainly through worker allocation to firms rather than occupations...|$|E
40|$|Through an {{analysis}} of corporate testimony before Congressional committees, this paper finds that members of Congress supply greater <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> that engage in private policymaking at higher rates and that members also gain new political- and policy-relevant information through such testimony. Importantly, the former relationship only holds for firms that make identifiable commitments to alter their behavior and disappears when we instead assess the effect of firms ’ reputations for social responsibility. This subtle finding comports with the broader literature on lobbying and demonstrates that those firms that enact socially responsible polices have, as a secondorder or feedback effect of this behavior, novel information to share with public policymakers.

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{influence}} of the culture of the service firm on its interpretation {{of the role of the}} brand and on the development and implementation of its brand values. Design/methodology/approach: A grounded theory approach was used. Interviews were conducted with 20 managers within two leading banking firms in Ireland and two leading grocery retailers in Ireland. Findings: The development of the brand, and its role within the firm, is closely related to the firm's culture. The research shows obstacles and opportunities created by the cultural context of firms wishing to disseminate and embed a set of brand values. The paper presents an "involvement model" of brand values implementation and outlines changes required to implement brand values. Research limitations/implications: The study was bound by <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms,</b> and managers' availability. The authors sought an insight into the relationship between each firm's culture and its brands. They advocate quantitative research to further investigate the findings within these service sectors and to test proposed antecedents (transformational leadership, employee involvement) and outcomes (employee-based brand equity and consumer-based brand equity) of values adoption. Practical implications: The paper identifies aspects of retail and banking cultures which support or detract from brand development. In particular, it presents the learnings from successful brand values implementation in a clan culture, aspects of which are applicable across other cultures. Originality/value: The paper provides valuable insights into the role of the brand within the service firm and the positive and negative influence of context on brand values and their development and implementation...|$|E
40|$|In {{settings}} with incomplete information, {{players can}} {{find it difficult to}} coordinate to find states with good social welfare. For instance, {{one of the main reasons}} behind the recent financial crisis was found to be the lack of market transparency, which made it difficult for financial firms to accurately measure the risks and returns of their investments. Although regulators may have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> 2 ̆ 7 investment decisions, directly reporting all firms 2 ̆ 7 actions raises confiden- tiality concerns for both individuals and institutions. The natural question, therefore, is whether it is possible for the regulatory agencies to publish some information that, on one hand, helps the financial firms understand the risks of their investments better, and, at the same time, preserves the privacy of their investment decisions. More generally, when can the publication of privacy-preserving information about the state of the game improve overall outcomes such as social welfare? In this paper, we explore this question in a sequential resource-sharing game where the value gained by a player on choosing a resource depends on the number of other players who have chosen that resource in the past. Without any knowledge of the actions of the past players, the social welfare attained in this game can be arbitrarily bad. We show, however, that it is possible for the players to achieve good social welfare with the help of privacy-preserving, publicly-announced information. We model the behavior of players in this imperfect information setting in two ways [...] greedy and undominated strategic behaviours, and we prove guarantees about the social welfare that certain kinds of privacy-preserving information can help attain. To achieve the social welfare guarantees, we design a counter with improved privacy guarantees under continual observation. In addition to the resource-sharing game, we study the main question for other games including sequential versions of the cut, machine-scheduling and cost-sharing games, and games where the value attained by a player on a particular action is not only a function of the actions of the past players but also of the actions of the future players...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence suggest that governments might usefully intervene in high-technology competition in two ways: First, they could {{act as a}} neutral agent that creates the necessary credibility, commitment and mutual trust among private companies so as to facilitate cooperation in high-risk, high-volume R&D. Second, if — {{in view of the}} externalities involved — an element of subsidization is to be added, this could be done in a nondiscriminatory fashion. A favourable tax treatment of R&D expenditures may be the most appropriate tool to achieve this task. In practice, governments do engage in targeted industrial and technology policies, whether justified on economic grounds or not. As a consequence, the string of trade conflicts in hightech industries that began in the 1980 s is unlikely to end in the near future, unless substantial reforms are undertaken in some crucial areas of the international trade order. Above all, appropriate reform steps should be made with a view to the regulations on (i) subsidies, (ii) structural impediments, and (iii) dumping and anti-dumping. To mitigate the frictions that arise from a subsidization of domestic firms, a new set of rules should be established. The rules should provide that all plans to grant or to alter existing subsidies are to be notified to and approved by the WTO. Moreover, all subsidies should be ranked according to their potential distortional effects on competition and trade. For each category, quantitative limits that constrain the provision of subsidies to a certain fraction of the subsidy base should be set. To facilitate further liberalization steps, a country should be allowed to exceed these limits, if a national subsidy program offers an open <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> located in third markets. Besides restrictive business practices of private firms, government regulations and technical standards are the most important structural impediments to trade. Existing GATT Articles already offer a multilateral route to conflict resolution in cases of structural impediments. However, this route has not been used by complainants up to now. The so-called "non-violation" clause of Article 23 GATT provides access to a multilateral dispute settlement even if the defending country has not explicitly violated GATT rules. This route should be tested and, if necessary, improved. To reduce the potential for a protectionist abuse of existing anti-dumping regulations, explicit reference to the state of competition in the relevant exporting and importing country markets should be made in anti-dumping investigations. To meet specific anti-trust concerns in hightech competition — notably with respect to network externalities, systems leverage, standardization, and innovation cartels — one might consider adopting the Draft International Antitrust Code (DIAC) that has recently been proposed by an international group of legal experts.

40|$|Most Vietnamese {{enterprises}} {{are small}} and medium enterprises (SMEs). According to the official definition in 2001 these are defined as enterprises with less than 300 employees or registered capital of 10 billion Vietnamese dong. Of the 155, 771 formally registered enterprises in operation in 2007, SMEs accounted for 97. 4 percent of total enterprises according to the employee criterion or 84. 7 percent according to the registered capital criterion. If the informally registered household enterprises are included, Vietnamese SMEs accounted for over 99 percent of total business establishments {{in the country in}} 2007. A majority of SMEs are from the domestic non-state sector, which made up approximately 96 percent of total SMEs in 2007. Manufacturing SMEs accounted for almost 92 percent of total manufacturing enterprises in operation in Vietnam in 2007. They are more export-oriented compared to SMEs in other sectors such as agriculture or services. In addition, manufacturing SMEs are noted for their ability to create stable jobs. This thesis examines the performance of Vietnamese non-state manufacturing SMEs. In particular, it analyses firm level technical efficiency of domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam over the 2002 – 2007 period after the introduction of the important Enterprise Law in 2000. It identifies the sources of inefficiency from the characteristics of the firms and business environment for manufacturing SMEs in aggregate and by sub-sectors. The study provides evidence-based policy recommendations to improve efficiency and competitiveness of domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam. Using stochastic frontier production function, an econometric approach, the study analyses 5, 204 observations of SMEs in three surveys conducted in 2002, 2005 and 2007. Under this approach, a best practice frontier is estimated from the sample and actual performance of individual firms is compared against this frontier to calculate their technical efficiency level. The cross-sectional results from the estimations reveal that manufacturing SMEs in Vietnam have relatively high average technical efficiency, ranging from 84. 25 percent to 92. 55 percent. An analysis is also conducted for nine sub-sectors within the manufacturing sector. It is found that the high-tech Electronics and Electrical Equipment sub-sector has the lowest technical efficiency level of around 80 percent, while the low-tech Wood and Furniture sub-sector achieves full technical efficiency. This sub-sector has simple technology which makes it easier for firms to reach the production frontier. The study further examines the factors influencing efficiency. Findings from this study indicate that innovation through major product improvement, government assistance in credit at start-up, household and collective ownership had a positive relationship with the technical efficiency of the aggregate manufacturing sample. Meanwhile, firm size, firm age, urban location, cooperation with foreign partners, subcontracting, government assistance in premises/land at start-up, and government assistance in credit during operation adversely affected the technical efficiency of manufacturing SMEs. The effects of new product innovation and limited liability and joint-stock ownership on technical efficiency are mixed. Exporting is found to have no significant influence on the technical efficiency of Vietnamese domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs. While many of the results above confirm the findings from earlier studies, some results are against mainstream ideas and similar with the results from other transitional economies. Policy recommendations derived from the empirical evidence are also discussed in this study. It suggests that Vietnamese domestic non-state manufacturing SMEs need to upgrade their technology and move the current production frontier upward. It appears that Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs have almost exhausted the current production frontier. This is reflected in their high level of technical efficiency. The move from static efficiency to dynamic efficiency will also improve the performance of Vietnamese SMEs in their participation in international value chains. There is a clear message to support the development of new firms, small firms, rural firms and informally registered enterprises which achieve better technical efficiency performance. Meanwhile, older firms, larger firms among manufacturing SMEs, urban firms and formally registered enterprises need to improve technology, human capital and management skills necessary to become better suited to the changing conditions of Vietnam’s economy with increasing international economic integration and competition. Government assistance should be better targeted to specific sub-sectors based on their technical efficiency performance. A one-size-fits-all policy for SMEs, or even just manufacturing SMEs, may not have the intended impact. The procedures and requirements for assistance should be transparent and simplified enough to give <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firms</b> that need it most. The findings from this study provide a clear picture about the performance of Vietnamese manufacturing SMEs with policy implications that are relevant to SMEs in other transitional economies and developing countries...|$|E

40|$|The current {{management}} literature recognizes securities analysts as institutional monitors influencing managerial decision-making, {{but this}} research takes a deeper {{look at the}} interdependence between manager and analyst self-interests to reveal exchange behavior at the manager-analyst interface. Integrating agency theoretic arguments of self-interest and bonding with game theoretic principles of reciprocity and assurances, I examine how manager and analyst self interests shape managerial behavior. Drawing on a sample from the insurance industry from 2001 - 2012 I isolate a discrete managerial self-interested behavior by observing risk aversion in claim reserve levels. I find managers increase their self-interested behavior when analysts issue optimistic forecasts, but optimism has diminishing returns as managers perceive overly optimistic forecasts as challenging performance targets. Strong performance minimizes investor scrutiny, which strengthens the relationship between forecast optimism and managerial self-interested behavior. I further advance a model that incorporates analyst interest in obtaining internal <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> operations and managers. When accessible managers coordinate with optimistic analysts managers are assured that overly optimistic forecasts will not constrain their self-interested behavior. However, contrary to expectations, managerial accessibility weakens the relationship between forecast optimism and managerial self-interested behavior, suggesting managers maximize their self-interested behavior when they restrict their accessibility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Dyakov’s {{dissertation}} bundles three {{empirical studies}} on actively managed mutual funds. His studies provide new {{knowledge of the}} costs and benefits of portfolio disclosure and shed more light into the question whether mutual fund investors have an information advantage over other market participants. Chapter 2 develops a simple trading strategy which front-runs the anticipated forced sales by mutual funds experiencing extreme capital outflows. The findings in this chapter suggest that publicly available information on fund holdings exposes mutual funds in distress to predatory trading. Chapter 3 studies investors’ sophistication and shows that mutual fund investors are probably more sophisticated than previously thought. The evidence in this chapter suggests that investors use portfolio holdings information in order to infer managerial skill and benefit from shifting capital towards skilled fund managers. Thus, while chapter 2 provides evidence for the potential costs of portfolio disclosure, chapter 3 quantifies the benefits from the actual use of portfolio holdings information by mutual fund investors. Chapter 4 uses disclosed fund holdings in order to study the information content of mutual funds' trades. The study documents that prior to 2001, stocks purchased by funds outperform stocks they sell. However, the opposite happens after 2001. The findings in this chapter suggest that mutual fund managers might have lost their information advantage over time. An important, although not sole reason for this effect is reduction in selective <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>firm</b> information following the implementation of Regulation Fair Disclosure in 2001...|$|R
