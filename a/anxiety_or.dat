5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{characteristic of the}} rare genetic condition, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, is self-harm and may include biting and head-banging. Genetics {{may contribute to the}} risk of developing other psychological conditions, such as <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> depression, which could in turn lead to self-harming behaviour. However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call between members of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E
5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>or</b> concentration difficulties.|$|E
50|$|Mageirocophobia can {{be caused}} by other {{personality}} traits, social <b>anxieties</b> <b>or</b> disorders. It can be set off by high expectations from other family members, failures with cookbooks, or difficulties in executing successfully in a culinary course. It can also lead to other phobias and social disorders.|$|R

50|$|Jon Edgar is a British {{sculptor}} of the Frink School. Improvisation is {{an important}} part of his reductive working process and developed from the additive working process of Alan Thornhill. Final works are often autobiographical, perhaps referencing <b>anxieties</b> <b>or</b> pre-occupations at the time. His body of work includes many clay portrait sketches of eminent sitters.|$|R
5|$|With {{regard to}} sexual {{orientation}} categories, asexuality may be argued {{as not being}} a meaningful category {{to add to the}} continuum, and instead argued as the lack of a sexual orientation or sexuality. Other arguments propose that asexuality is the denial of one's natural sexuality, and that it is a disorder caused by shame of sexuality, <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> sexual abuse, sometimes basing this belief on asexuals who masturbate or occasionally engage in sexual activity simply to please a romantic partner. Within the context of sexual orientation identity politics, asexuality may pragmatically fulfill the political function of a sexual orientation identity category.|$|E
5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by inhibiting deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> sleep disorders, inhibiting the benefits of psychotherapy by inhibiting memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E

For example, Cow and Chicken always order [...] "pork butts and taters" [...] {{when in the}} cafeteria, and {{characters}} often pepper their speech with malapropisms and sarcasm. The humor and storylines depicted in the series are sometimes based around traditional childhood worries, <b>anxieties,</b> <b>or</b> phobias such as cooties or venturing into the girls' restroom, but enhanced comically.|$|R
25|$|In 2014, a study {{indicated}} that some breed-temperaments, such as <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> fear, {{may be linked to}} gene mutations. Other temperaments {{may be due to the}} legacies of 'ancient' ancestry.|$|E

25|$|In general, some antidepressants, {{especially}} SSRIs, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' {{depression or}} <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> cause suicidal ideation.

25|$|Shyness (also called diffidence) is {{the feeling}} of apprehension, lack of comfort, or awkwardness {{especially}} {{when a person is}} around other people.

Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as social <b>anxiety</b> <b>or</b> social phobia.|$|E
25|$|Numbers of {{benzodiazepine}} prescriptions {{have been}} declining, due primarily to concerns of dependence.

25|$|Clinical {{trials have}} {{generated}} mostly negative {{results for the}} use of SSRIs in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.

25|$|The TMAS {{has been}} proven {{reliable}} using test-retest reliability.

This study showed that persons administered the test could be display different anxiety levels across these areas.

The mentally ill were thus labelled as not only sick, but also weak. Cameron further argued that [...] "the weak" [...] must not influence children. He promoted a philosophy where chaos could be prevented by removing the weak from society.|$|R

[...] Franklin quoted the Old Testament, and had no <b>anxieties</b> <b>or</b> obsessions. Franklin and Charlie Brown also enjoyed sharing stories about their grandfathers.|$|R
