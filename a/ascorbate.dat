5|$|Reports {{show that}} both the nickel-induced {{activation}} of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes are caused by depletion of intracellular <b>ascorbate.</b> The addition of <b>ascorbate</b> to the culture medium increased the intracellular <b>ascorbate</b> level and reversed both the metal-induced stabilization of HIF-1- and HIF-1α-dependent gene expression.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as <b>ascorbate,</b> retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted {{that the loss of}} the ability to {{synthesize}} <b>ascorbate</b> strikingly parallels the inability to break down uric acid, also a characteristic of primates. Uric acid and <b>ascorbate</b> are both strong reducing agents. This has led to the suggestion that, in higher primates, uric acid has taken over some of the functions of <b>ascorbate.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascorbate</b> is {{required}} {{for a range of}} essential metabolic reactions in all animals and plants. It is made internally by almost all organisms; the main exceptions are most bats, all guinea pigs, capybaras, and the Haplorrhini (one of the two major primate suborders, consisting of tarsiers, monkeys, and humans and other apes). <b>Ascorbate</b> is also not made by many species of birds and fish. All species that do not make <b>ascorbate</b> require it in the diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{oxidized}} {{forms of}} <b>ascorbate</b> are relatively unreactive {{and do not}} cause cellular damage.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{is absorbed}} in the body by both active {{transport}} and simple diffusion. Sodium-Dependent Active Transport—Sodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporters (SVCTs) and Hexose transporters (GLUTs)—are the two transporters required for absorption. SVCT1 and SVCT2 import the reduced form of <b>ascorbate</b> across plasma membrane. GLUT1 and GLUT3 are the two glucose transporters, and transfer only the dehydroascorbic acid form of Vitamin C. Although dehydroascorbic acid is absorbed in higher rate than <b>ascorbate,</b> the amount of dehydroascorbic acid found in plasma and tissues under normal conditions is low, as cells rapidly reduce dehydroascorbic acid to <b>ascorbate.</b> Thus, SVCTs {{appear to be the}} predominant system for vitamin C transport in the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} role of <b>ascorbate</b> is {{to act as}} a reducing agent, donating electrons {{to various}} enzymatic and a few non-enzymatic reactions. The one- and two-electron oxidized forms of vitamin C, semidehydroascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, respectively, can be reduced in the body by glutathione and NADPH-dependent enzymatic mechanisms. The presence of glutathione in cells and extracellular fluids helps maintain <b>ascorbate</b> in a reduced state.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of animals and plants are able to synthesize vitamin C, through a sequence of enzyme-driven steps, which convert monosaccharides to vitamin C. In plants, this is accomplished through the conversion of mannose or galactose to ascorbic acid. In some animals, glucose needed to produce <b>ascorbate</b> in the liver (in mammals and perching birds) is extracted from glycogen; <b>ascorbate</b> synthesis is a glycogenolysis-dependent process.|$|E
25|$|The {{activity}} of the PAM enzyme system is dependent upon vitamin C (<b>ascorbate),</b> which is a necessary vitamin cofactor. By chance, sodium <b>ascorbate</b> by itself was found to stimulate the production of oxytocin from ovarian tissue over a range of concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Many of the same tissues (e.g. ovaries, testes, eyes, adrenals, placenta, thymus, pancreas) where PAM (and oxytocin by default) is found are also known to store higher concentrations of vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous {{high-dose}} <b>ascorbate</b> {{is being}} used as a chemotherapeutic and biological response modifying agent. Currently it is still under clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|He {{was able}} to relate the above {{observation}} to abruptio placentae, as women with low <b>ascorbate</b> (Vitamin C) and high histamine levels are prone to develop premature separation of the placenta.|$|E
25|$|However, {{being a good}} {{electron}} donor, excess <b>ascorbate</b> in {{the presence}} of free metal ions can not only promote but also initiate free radical reactions, thus making it a potentially dangerous pro-oxidative compound in certain metabolic contexts.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin C is an {{essential}} nutrient for certain animals including humans. Vitamin C describes several vitamers that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid. <b>Ascorbate</b> and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert according to pH. Vitamin C is a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions, including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. In animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. <b>Ascorbate</b> also acts as an antioxidant, protecting against oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid can be {{oxidized}} (broken down) in {{the human}} body by the enzyme L-ascorbate oxidase. <b>Ascorbate</b> that is not directly excreted in the urine as a result of body saturation or destroyed in other body metabolism is oxidized by this enzyme and removed.|$|E
25|$|Relatively {{large doses}} of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, {{particularly}} when taken {{on an empty}} stomach. However, taking vitamin C {{in the form of}} sodium <b>ascorbate</b> and calcium <b>ascorbate</b> may minimize this effect. When taken in large doses, ascorbic acid causes diarrhea in healthy subjects. In one trial in 1936, doses of up to 6grams of ascorbic acid were given to 29 infants, 93 children of preschool and school age, and 20 adults for more than 1400 days. With the higher doses, toxic manifestations were observed in five adults and four infants. The signs and symptoms in adults were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. The main toxic reactions in the infants were skin rashes.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is classed as a reductone. The <b>ascorbate</b> anion is {{stabilized}} by electron delocalization, {{as shown}} above {{in terms of}} resonance between two canonical forms. For this reason, ascorbic acid is much more acidic than would be expected if the compound contained only isolated hydroxyl groups.|$|E
25|$|The Leydig {{cells in}} some {{species have been}} shown to possess the biosynthetic {{machinery}} to manufacture testicular oxytocin de novo, to be specific, in rats (which can synthesize vitamin C endogenously), and in guinea pigs, which, like humans, require an exogenous source of vitamin C (<b>ascorbate)</b> in their diets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ascorbate</b> {{concentrations}} {{over the}} renal re-absorption threshold pass freely into the urine and are excreted. At high dietary doses (corresponding {{to several hundred}} mg/day in humans) <b>ascorbate</b> is accumulated in the body until the plasma levels reach the renal resorption threshold, which is about 1.5nbsp&mg/dL in men and 1.3nbsp&mg/dL in women. Concentrations in the plasma larger than this value (thought to represent body saturation) are rapidly excreted in the urine with a half-life of about 30 minutes. Concentrations less than this threshold amount are actively retained by the kidneys, and the excretion half-life {{for the remainder of}} the vitamin C store in the body thus increases greatly, with the half-life lengthening as the body stores are depleted. This half-life rises until it is as long as 83 days by the onset of the first symptoms of scurvy.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid (vitaminC) {{and sodium}} <b>ascorbate</b> {{completely}} neutralize both chlorine and chloramine, but degrade {{in a day}} or two, which makes them usable only for short-term applications. SFPUC determined that 1000mg of vitaminC tablets, crushed and mixed in with bath water, completely remove chloramine in a medium-size bathtub without significantly depressing pH.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{performs}} numerous {{physiological functions}} in the human body. These functions include the synthesis of collagen, carnitine, and neurotransmitters; the synthesis and catabolism of tyrosine; and the metabolism of microsome. During biosynthesis <b>ascorbate</b> acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} shown {{efficacy}} of glucosamine supplementation for dogs with osteoarthritis pain, particularly {{in combination with other}} nutraceuticals like chondroitin while others have not. A trial of oral combination capsules (glucosamine/chondroitin/manganese <b>ascorbate)</b> in dogs with osteoarthritis found no benefit on either gait analysis or subjective assessments by the veterinarian or owner.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is {{associated}} with chloroplasts and apparently {{plays a role in}} ameliorating the oxidative stress of photosynthesis. In addition, it has a number of other roles in cell division and protein modification. Plants appear {{to be able to make}} <b>ascorbate</b> by at least one other biochemical route that is different from the major route in animals, although precise details remain unknown.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that while serum or blood plasma levels follow the circadian rhythm or short term dietary changes, those within tissues themselves are more stable and give {{a better view of}} the availability of <b>ascorbate</b> within the organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses, and require samples to be analyzed in specialized laboratories.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Health Canada {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} fortification of foods with <b>ascorbate</b> in the guidance document, Addition of Vitamins and Minerals to Food. Discretionary (not mandatory) fortification is allowed for some classes of foods. Vitamin C was categorized as a 'Risk Category A nutrient', meaning either there is no upper limit, or it is a nutrient for which an upper limit for intake is set but allows a wide margin of safe intake, or {{that there is a}} narrow margin of safety, but non-serious critical adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is {{a common}} enzymatic {{cofactor}} in mammals used in the synthesis of collagen. <b>Ascorbate</b> is a powerful reducing agent capable of rapidly scavenging a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Freshwater teleost fishes also require vitamin C in their diet or they will get scurvy. The most widely recognized symptoms of vitamin C deficiency in fishes are scoliosis, lordosis and dark skin coloration. Freshwater salmonids also show impaired collagen formation, internal/fin hemorrhage, spinal curvature and increased mortality. If these fishes are housed in seawater with algae and phytoplankton, vitamin supplementation seems to be less important.|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid is a weak sugar acid {{structurally}} {{related to}} glucose. In biological systems, ascorbic acid {{can be found}} only at low pH, but in neutral solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the ionized form, <b>ascorbate.</b> All of these molecules have vitamin C activity and thus are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified. Numerous analytical methods {{have been developed for}} ascorbic acid detection. For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin C megadosage {{is a term}} {{describing}} the consumption or injection of vitamin C (<b>ascorbate)</b> in doses comparable to the amounts produced by the livers of most other mammals. Such dosages correspond to amounts well beyond the current Recommended Dietary Allowance of 90 mg/day, and often well beyond the Tolerable upper intake level of 2000 mg/day. Oral dosages are usually divided and consumed in portions over the day. Injections of hundreds of grams per day are advocated by some physicians {{for the treatment of}} certain conditions, poisonings, or recovery from trauma. People who practice vitamin C megadosage may consume many vitamin C pills throughout each day or dissolve pure vitamin C crystals in water or juice and drink it throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine <b>ascorbate</b> and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
500|$|That is, paradoxically, agents {{which are}} {{normally}} considered antioxidants {{can act as}} conditional pro-oxidants and actually increase oxidative stress. Besides <b>ascorbate,</b> medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as homocysteine. [...] Typically, [...] this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. [...] The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. [...] Another example is the postulated role of homocysteine in atherosclerosis.|$|E
500|$|Glutathione is a {{cysteine-containing peptide}} {{found in most}} forms of aerobic life. It is not {{required}} in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent amino acids. Glutathione has antioxidant properties since the thiol group in its cysteine [...] is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. In cells, glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme glutathione reductase and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as <b>ascorbate</b> in the glutathione-ascorbate cycle, glutathione peroxidases and glutaredoxins, as well as reacting directly with oxidants. Due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, glutathione {{is one of the}} most important cellular antioxidants. In some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols, such as by mycothiol in the Actinomycetes, bacillithiol in some Gram-positive bacteria, or by trypanothione in the Kinetoplastids.|$|E
500|$|Ascorbic acid or [...] "vitamin C" [...] is a {{monosaccharide}} oxidation-reduction (redox) catalyst {{found in}} both animals and plants. As {{one of the}} enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by mutation during primate evolution, humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin. Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. Ascorbic acid {{is required for the}} conversion of the procollagen to collagen by oxidizing proline residues to hydroxyproline. In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by protein disulfide isomerase and glutaredoxins. Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a substrate for the redox enzyme <b>ascorbate</b> peroxidase, a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants. Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20millimolar in chloroplasts.|$|E
