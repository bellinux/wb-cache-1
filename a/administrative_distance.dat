50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>distance</b> (AD) is {{a number}} of {{arbitrary}} unit assigned to dynamic routes, static routes and directly-connected routes. The value is used by vendor-specific routers to rank routes from most preferred (low <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> value) to least preferred (high <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> value). When multiple paths to the same destination are available, the router uses the route with the lowest <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> and inserts the preferred route into its routing table. Router vendors typically design their routers to assign a default <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> to each kind of route that is used, however, this value can usually be set manually by a network administrator.|$|E
50|$|On Cisco routers, routes {{issued by}} OSPF {{have a lower}} (default) <b>{{administrative}}</b> <b>distance</b> than routes issued by the Routing Information Protocol. By default, OSPF has a default <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> of 110 and RIP has a default administrative of 120.|$|E
50|$|The router {{will usually}} compare {{administrative}} distances {{to determine which}} protocol has the lowest value. The router prefers protocols that have a lower assigned <b>administrative</b> <b>distance.</b> For example, OSPF has a default distance of 110, so it is preferred by the router process, over RIP, which has a default distance of 120. The administrator can arbitrarily reconfigure the administrative distances, which affects the ranking of the preferred routes by the routing process. On Cisco routers, static routes have an <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> of 1, making them preferred over routes issued by a dynamic routing protocol. The <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> is a value that is always only referenced by the local router itself. The <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> is not advertised on the network.|$|E

We show for 124 manufacturing subsidiaries in Europe that, on average, distance is unrelated to value added by headquarters but that this effect is contingent upon {{the extent to which}} the subsidiary is locally embedded. Only after a certain threshold level of subsidiary embeddedness, distance is negatively related to headquarters value added. This effect is more pronounced for cultural, economic, and <b>administrative</b> <b>distances</b> than for pure geographic distance, highlighting the critical role of contextual variation for MNCs...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{technological}} advances, the spread of free-market ideology and the shifting of the economic {{center of the world}} have resulted in an incredible transformation of the world into a globalized, interdependent place. The term "globalization" has become an essential keyword associated with business in the modern world, creating great opportunities for U. S. firms to seek future growth potential in the global arena, especially in emerging markets that are undergoing rapid economic development. Although the real estate industry has achieved some level of globalization in general, the development sector is one area of a broad real estate industry that has yet to show significant strides in global expansion activities. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the current business landscape of U. S. real estate developers' globalization efforts and to create a qualitative analysis of why globalization works / does not work for real estate developers based in the U. S. The ultimate question the study asks and answers is what are the key strategies that U. S. -based real estate developers should use to develop real estate property in emerging markets (Brazil, in particular) ? Brazil was extensively investigated as the topic of this research. The research discovered some development risks in Brazil associated with the high levels of bureaucracy, tenants' perception of the product and lack of market intermediaries. A number of American real estate development firms have successfully overcome these hurdles by forming strategic alliances with local partners and adequately responding to cultural and <b>administrative</b> <b>distances</b> between Brazil and the U.

After a brief histcrical preface that points out deficits and needed improvements in public school and infant programs, the discussion focuses on several aspects of established programs for 3 - to 5 -year-old children. In particular, research findings indicate that preschool intervention is both cost efficient and beneficial to the child and its family.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how different conceptions of distance impact upon {{one of the}} fundamental decisions made by foreign investors, the choice of foreign direct investment (FDI) location within the selected host country. Most the extant literature treats alternative locations as distinct places, and implicitly assumes that the distances between these alternative locations have no impact upon the likelihood of FDI location. However, the boundaries between these locations are often quite arbitrary and defined by administrative fiat rather than political-economic reality, and proximate locations may well impact significantly upon each other's attractiveness to foreign investors. This results in a situation of spatial dependence which, if ignored, can give raise to various estimation and inference problems. The contribution {{of this paper is to}} investigate different specifications of this spatial dependence linked to various geographical, economic and <b>administrative</b> measures of <b>distance...</b>|$|R

The research is identify the distribution of Javan langur based on village <b>administrative</b> area, <b>distance</b> of group encounter to nearest settlement and roadway, and altitude, as well as habitat types used in Kuningan District, West Java Provinces. We interviewed residents of forest villages to gather information on population occurrence, followed by making line transects in each village based on the result of the interviews, then noted habitat type every 100 m along the transect and encountering point of group of Javan langur as well as the coordinates of encountering. The data obtained were analyzed descriptively and by using both chi-square test and Bonferroni's procedure to determine the preferences of habitat types used. The study found that Javan langur populations are distributed in 34 forest villages. The closest distance Javan langur were recorded at 9. 32 meters from the settlement and 3. 24 meters from the road. Its distribution ranging from 255 - 1254 meters asl. Land cover types used were natural forest, mixed-garden, homogenous timber plantation (pine, teak, mahagoni and rosewood forest), and transition areas (natural forest to mixed garden and pine forest to natural forest or mixed garden), but natural forest was preferred. We conclude that Javan langur population can still be found in several locations in lowland, hills, natural forest and plantation forest that have diverse vegetation, including those adjacent to settlement...|$|R
50|$|The <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> (AD) {{value is}} {{assigned}} by the router on a per-protocol basis. Routers, by design, should not install multiple routes into the routing table as this {{has the potential to}} cause routing loops. While a router may run multiple routing protocols on the same device, it is necessary for the router to implement a process to ensure that multiple routes, pointing to the same destination do not simultaneously exist in the routing table. Each process running on a router advertises its <b>administrative</b> <b>distance</b> value to the local router. The router uses this value to determine which route should be used. Once a route has been selected, the routing information database is updated. If two routes have the same <b>administrative</b> <b>distance,</b> the router uses its vendor-specific algorithm to determine which route should be installed. Cisco routers simply ignore the values and fall back to the default values, which are never the same.|$|E

40|$|Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in Ethiopia {{remains one}} of {{the highest in the world}} due in part to very limited use of {{maternal}} health services. However, the underlying factors for limited use of the services and hence the high MMR are not well known. The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with use of maternal health services and maternal health risks, to analyze inequity patterns between use of maternal health services and maternal health risks, and to measure the magnitude and trends in inequity. Behavioral-cultural and structural theories of health inequalities were used to frame the study. Research questions included whether there were trends of inequity in use of maternal health services, if sociodemographic characteristics were associated with use of the services, and whether inequities in use of the services were associated with maternal health risks. The study design was quantitative and used data collected through Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 2000, 2005, and 2011. DHS had employed stratified 2 -stage cluster design; this analysis used logistic regression method, odds ratio chi-square test, and correlation measures.

Further research is also recommended for regions where sample size was limited. Maternal health policies and programs designed to reach the most disadvantaged women could increase service use and improve maternal health, leading to positive social change...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{manifestations of}} the {{increasing}} diversity in multinational corporation (MNC) operations is the growing importance of regional headquarters (RHQs). RHQs assume an intermediary, bridging role between the corporate headquarters and local affiliates and other actors in their respective regions. They can have a coordination and control (i. e., administrative) mandate {{as well as an}} opportunity seeking (i. e., entrepreneurial) mandate. Since these mandates require RHQs to interact with various internal and external entities and exchange knowledge across distant locations, MNCs tend to locate their RHQs in highly connected “global cities” because these places allow the firm to economize on spatial transaction costs. In this paper, we explore the interplay between geographic distance, RHQ roles, and connectivity by analyzing which global city is selected by an MNC when establishing an RHQ. We argue that there is substantial heterogeneity among MNCs in the importance they attach to city connectivity — which we conceptualize as encompassing the effects of the international flows of people, knowledge, and services—because the connectivity needs of an RHQ varies in relation to its corporate mandate {{as well as to the}} geographic configuration of the MNC’s activities. Our mixed logit analysis of the location choices for 1, 031 newly established RHQs in 48 global cities between 2003 and 2012 provides qualified support for the notion that the relationship between city connectivity and location choice is more pronounced for RHQs with an entrepreneurial role. Although the geographic distance of a city to the MNC’s regional affiliates discourages the establishment of RHQs with <b>administrative</b> roles, <b>distance</b> effects disappear when the city is highly connected. Moreover, well connected cities are able to attract MNCs’ RHQs from distant countries-of-origin. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{experience}} of clinicians at two public hospitals in Sydney, Australia, {{with the introduction}} and use of an oncology information system (OIS) was examined to extract lessons to guide the introduction of clinical information systems in public hospitals. Methods and materials: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 12 of 15 radiation oncologists employed at the two hospitals. The personnel involved in the decision making process for the introduction of the system were contacted and their decision making process revisited. The transcribed data were analyzed using NVIVO software. Themes emerged included implementation strategies and practices, the radiation oncologists 2 ̆ 7 current use and satisfaction with the OIS, project management and the impact of the OIS on clinical practice. Results: The hospitals had contrasting experiences in their introduction and use of the OIS. Hospital A used the OIS in all aspects of clinical documentation. Its implementation was associated with strong advocacy by the Head of Department, input by a designated project manager, and use and development of the system by all staff, with timely training and support. With no vision of developing a paperless information system, Hospital B used the OIS only for booking and patient tracking. A departmental policy that data entry for the OIS was centrally undertaken by <b>administrative</b> staff <b>distanced</b> clinicians from the system. All the clinicians considered that the OIS should continuously evolve to meet changing clinical needs and departmental quality improvement initiatives. Conclusions: This case study indicates that critical factors for the successful introduction of clinical information systems into hospital environment were an initial clear vision to be paperless, strong clinical leadership and management at the departmental level, committed project management, and involvement of all staff, with appropriate training. Clinician engagement is essential for post-adoption evolution of clinical information systems...|$|R
