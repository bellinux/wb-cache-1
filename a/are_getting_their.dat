60|$|Now, it is unnecessary--it {{would be}} almost an impertinence--to enlarge on a spiritual destitution of which you are already well aware. There are, we shall all agree, many {{thousands}} in London who are palpably sick of spiritual disease, and need the physician. But I have special reasons for not pressing this point. If I attempted to draw subscriptions from you by painting tragical and revolting pictures of the vice, heathendom, and misery of this metropolis, I might make you fancy {{that it was an}} altogether vicious, heathen, and miserable spot: than which there can be no greater mistake. These evils are not the rule, but the exceptions. Were they not the exceptions, then not merely the society of London, and the industry of London, and the wealth of London, but the very buildings of London, the brick and the mortar, would crumble to the ground by natural and inevitable decay. The unprecedentedly rapid increase of London is, I firmly believe, a sure sign that things in it are done on the whole not ill, but well; that God's blessing is on the place; that, because it is on the whole obeying the eternal laws of God, therefore it is increasing, and multiplying, and replenishing the earth, and subduing it. And I do not hesitate to say, that I have read of no spot of like size upon this earth, on which there have ever been congregated so many human beings, who <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>their</b> bread so peaceably, happily, loyally, and virtuously; and doing their duty--ill enough, no doubt, as we all do it--but still doing it more or less, by man and God.|$|E
