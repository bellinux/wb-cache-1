The First Law of Thermodynamics was used for control volume around the engine to compute the output power, transferred energy to the cooling fluid, exhaust gases and also unaccounted losses through convection and radiation heat transfer. Thermal balance tests were performed for various operational conditions including full and half loads and different cooling fluid temperatures. Results indicate that by increasing engine load and coolant temperature, the percentage of transferred energy to the exhaust gases increased while the percentage of coolant energy decreased.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{correlate}} emission levels of gas turbine engines. The predictions of NO(x) emissions {{are based on a}} review of the literature of previous low NO(x) combustor programs and analytical chemical kinetic calculations. Concepts included in the literature review consisted of lean-premixed-prevaporized (LPP), rich burn/quick quench/lean burn (RQL), and direct injection. The NO(x) emissions were found to be an exponential function of adiabatic combustion temperature over a wide range of inlet temperatures, pressures and (lean) fuel-air ratios. A simple correlation of NO(x) formation with time was not found. The LPP and direct injection (<b>using</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels)</b> concepts have the lowest NO(x) emissions of the three concepts. The RQL data has higher values of NO(x) than the LPP concept, probably due to the stoichiometric temperatures and NO(x) production that occur during the quench step. Improvements in the quick quench step could reduce the NO(x) emissions to the LPP levels. The low NO(x) potential of LPP is offset by the operational disadvantages of its narrow stability limits and its susceptibility to autoignition/flashback. The Rich-Burn/Quick-Quench/Lean-Burn (RQL) and the direct injection concepts have the advantage of wider stability limits comparable to conventional combustors...|$|R

Using well-controlled experiments to verify numerical simulations, phenomena such as flame extinction and micro-vortex-flame behavior have been studied <b>using</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels.</b> The goal of this investigation is to study two-phase vortex-flame interactions using a number of laser diagnostic approaches, including particle-image velocity (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). Data from CH PLIF diagnostics is effectively used to localize the diffusion flame front and extinction zones. In particular the evolution of flame surface area and rate of CH layer extinction as a function of time after vortex arrival is determined from PLIF images. Peak normal strain rates at extinction are calculated from PIV measurements. The evolution of the perturbed counterflow flame as a function of time after vortex arrival shows that micron-sized droplets strongly affect flame-surface development in the post-quenching stage of vortex-flame interaction. The relationship between peak normal strain rate and the time rate of CH layer extinction is also investigated by varying the vortex size and strength...|$|R

This {{paper is}} focused on the {{numerical}} simulation of a new technology of small size iron ore sintering machine <b>using</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuel</b> and oxygen injections to produce high quality of sinter product for the blast furnace operation. The proposed methodology is to partially replace the solid fuel(coke breeze) by steelworks gases in a compact machine to enhance heat and mass transfer. A multiphase mathematical model based on transport equations of momentum, energy and chemical species coupled with chemical reaction rates and phase transformations is proposed to analyze the inner process parameters. A base case representing a possible actual industrial operation of the sintering machine is used in order to compare different scenarios of possible operations which represents advanced operations techniques. The model was used to predict four cases of fuel gas utilization: a) 3 % of the wind boxes inflow from N 01 -N 10 wind boxes of natural gas(NG) and oxygen, b) same condition with coke oven gas(COG) and c) mixture of 80 % COG and 20 % blast furnace gas(BFG). The model predictions indicated that for all cases, the sintering zone is enlarged and the solid fuel consumption is decreased about 12 kg/t of sinter product for the best combination. In order to maximize the steelworks gas utilization it is recommended the use of mixture of COG and BFG with optimum inner temperature distribution within a compact sintering machine, which enhance the productivity and obviously, decrease the investment cost of the sintering facilities...|$|R

Comparative results are given for various engine speeds and loads for conventional Diesel and dual fuel operation, revealing the effect of dual fuel combustion on engine performance and exhaust emissions.

40|$|AbstractThe Climate {{change has}} seriously {{impacted}} {{on the environment}} of the human beings. Though, most of the climatic warming that has occurred has been caused by human activities, in particular the burning of fossil fuels that generate the greenhouse gas emissions. However, in urban area, the transport sector {{is one of the most}} important causes of the high levels of atmospheric pollution: greenhouse gas and fine particulate matter emitted by the gasoline and diesel engines. The introduction of alternative fuel in the transport sector which is less pollutant, economically more affordable and more available is an alternative quite interesting to reduce air pollution while allowing economic and social development of Algeria. Using Compressed Natural Gas ‘CNG’ for vehicle is an alternative which is environmentally friendly as well as economically and energetically interesting, it is also in accordance with the world energy tendency which sustains the future <b>use</b> of <b>gaseous</b> <b>fuels</b> that are subscribed in the decarbonization process of the energetic systems (reducing the fuels carbon content). In this item, an overview of the Algerian automobile fleet will be exposed. And the economic, energetic and environmental matters of the introduction of the CNG as fuel in the Algerian transport sector will be discussed...|$|R
