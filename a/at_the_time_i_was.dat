25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and I was allowed to go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noted}} a Stooges {{influence}} in [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick", typical of Mudhoney's early material. Turner said: [...] "In retrospect, it's The Yardbirds' 'Happenings Ten Years Time Ago' {{by way of}} The Stooges' 'Sick of You'. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying for the stuttering R guitar of The Nights and Days." [...] The song is also reminiscent of the hardcore punk of Black Flag. In his book Loser: The Real Seattle Music Story, Clark Humphrey accuses the song of being a copy of [...] "The Witch" [...] by The Sonics. The band have dismissed this claim, and questioned the writer's knowledge of music.|$|E

500|$|When Niedermeyer died in March 1861, Camille Saint-Saëns {{took charge}} of piano studies and {{introduced}} contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. Fauré recalled in old age, [...] "After allowing the lessons to run over, {{he would go to}} the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known.... <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [...] had for him, throughout my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together.

2500|$|Rodney Hogg was {{interested}} in touring South Africa. He met with Ali Bacher in London during the 1983 Cricket World Cup. [...] "I was pretty much in from day one," [...] said Hogg. I was in my mid-30s, and {{the idea was that}} the tour wouldn't happen for another year or two.

I {{think one of the}} times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amy Sherman-Palladino, {{who came}} from a {{background}} of writing for half-hour sitcoms, had Gilmore Girls approved by The WB after several of her previous pitches were turned down. On a whim, she suggested a show about a mother and daughter but had put little thought into the idea. Having to create a pilot, she drew inspiration for the show's setting of [...] "Stars Hollow, Connecticut" [...] after making a trip to Washington Depot, Connecticut, where she stayed at the Mayflower Inn. She explained: [...] "If I can make people feel this much of what I felt walking around this fairy town, I {{thought that would be}} wonderful ... <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, it was beautiful, it was magical, and it was feeling of warmth and small-town camaraderie ...

[...] The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of [...] "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about the immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families.

[...] "That was the first time we had ever lived in separate residences. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> actually married, which was a new one for the band to deal with, and everyone’s moving in their different circles, but we kept touring and making records." [...] "Los Angeles was too big. Brookfield was too small. This is just right", he said in 1995. [...] "When we lived in Brookfield and wanted to do a local gig, we'd have to drive two hours to Columbia or six hours to St. Louis. It's a lot easier here, and the kids are real cool.

2500|$|While {{living in}} Queens, New York, Jennifer Lee Quick began drawing up ideas for Off Beat.

When I finished that project, my long time best friend, Becky Cloonan was contacted by Tokyopop to send a pitch proposal. I remembered that I had been asked to send one as well, so we briefly considered sending a joint proposal for Off Beat (at the time she had talked about possibly working on the project with me). Her schedule got booked though, so I wasn't sure about submitting the pitch on my own. She encouraged me to go ahead though, so I went for it." ...|$|E

Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women.

I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit.

I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore had been cast as the voice of Rapunzel, and actor Zachary Levi would provide the voice of Flynn Rider. Mandy Moore approached the project through auditioning, when she heard that a film about the story of Rapunzel was being made. Moore later expressed that she had dreamed to be a Disney princess since she was young and said that with the role of Rapunzel, she had fulfilled her [...] "ultimate childhood dream". She described herself as a [...] "girly fan" [...] of Disney classics like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, and that it was an honor for her {{to be part of this}} [...] "legacy"—the lineage of such Disney icons. Since the film was going to be a musical, it was required that all auditionees had to read several scenes and perform a song of their choice, to ensure that the voice actors could both act and sing. For this singing section, Moore chose [...] "Help Me" [...] by Joni Mitchell, a song that she herself had covered on her fourth studio album, Coverage (2003). Moore revealed that she had to attend several audition sessions and described the experiences as [...] "pretty fun" [...] but didn't put much hope in getting the part because she believed there would be much competition for this role; she just performed her best without any anxiety. When she received a callback from Disney telling that she got the part, Moore described herself as being [...] "over the moon": [...] "I was working in New York <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> with some friends and my husband—and I screamed as soon as I found out the news." ...|$|E
