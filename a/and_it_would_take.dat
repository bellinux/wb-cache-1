5|$|The Board of Supervisors met in {{a special}} session {{at the end of}} June 1939 and Middleton was {{directed}} to take over the business management of the university. The school's finances were in a state of chaos, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> effort and time to dig out of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to work with him, and a New York firm was hired to come in and establish sound business procedures.|$|E
5|$|Desperate, they free Chris, who {{reveals that}} Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car {{they can use}} to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins {{breaking}} down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for Arcadia in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.|$|E
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> three years longer for the DDLs to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|E

5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> at least a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
25|$|The plot, {{known as}} Operation Ajax, {{centered}} on convincing Iran's monarch {{to issue a}} decree to dismiss Mossadegh from office, as he had attempted some months earlier. But the Shah was terrified to attempt such a dangerously unpopular and legally questionable move, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> much persuasion and many U.S. funded meetings, which included bribing his sister Ashraf with a mink coat and money, to successfully change his mind.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} in North America {{did nothing to}} shake the common Whig belief that America was to be won by defeating France in Europe. However, the failure at Quebec was somewhat compensated by Marlborough's final victory in the field. Anne's Captain-General {{no longer had the}} influence he enjoyed under the Godolphin ministry: his wife's relationship with the Queen had ended acrimoniously and he was now under the influence of Harley, now the Earl of Oxford and Lord High Treasurer. Nevertheless, Marlborough still commanded the Anglo-Dutch forces in northern France, and in August he outmanoeuvred Villars and crossed the formidable Ne Plus Ultra lines, before capturing Bouchain on 12 September. The campaign was not decisive, however. Arras, Cambrai, Le Quesnoy, and Landrecies still stood between the Duke and Paris, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> at least one more campaign to secure their capitulation.|$|E

The {{resulting}} Battle of Arnhem {{has since become}} a byword for the fighting spirit of British paratroops and set a standard for the Parachute Regiment. The division's mission was to capture intact the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and hold them until relieved, which was expected to occur {{two or three days}} later. A shortage of transport aircraft hindered operations, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> two days for all three of the division's brigades to arrive. It was decided that the 1st Parachute and the airlanding brigade would land on the first day. The DZs and LZs would be secured by the airlanding brigade, whilst the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Parachute battalions would head into Arnhem and capture the bridges. On the second day, the 4th Parachute Brigade would arrive. These battalions would dig in north and north-west of Arnhem.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his tenure, Gude had private {{pupils in}} {{addition}} to his normal classes. As a professor Gude taught six hours of class, held two hours of office hours, took turns with other professors supervising the nude drawing class and attended staff meetings. In 1857 Gude handed in his resignation, officially citing family considerations and failing health as his reasons for resigning, although in his memoirs he blamed opposition and backbiting from two of his pupils. The landscape painting professorship was the bottom of the pay scale at the Academy, and Gude {{was one of the few}} professors to be refused a raise when others received them in 1855. Others have suggested that Gude wished to leave the Academy for fear for becoming stuck in a rut artistically. Gude received better treatment from the Academy after he turned in his resignation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> him a full five years to finally leave Düsseldorf. Although professors at the Academy complained that their teaching prevented them from undertaking more lucrative endeavors, Gude was able to sell enough works to afford a modest house in Düsseldorf which stood in what is now Hofgarten.|$|E

25|$|The {{new year}} began with no {{work at the}} {{convention}} center construction site. Mayor Celebrezze ordered city Law Director Ralph S. Locher to order Hunkin-Conkey to begin work in three days or be in default of its completion bond. These demands were communication on December 26 and 27, 1961. The construction company replied with a five-page letter outlining why it could not. William S. Hunsel, a consultant to Outcalt, Guenther & Van Buren, advised Hunkin-Conkey to dewater in sections, laying the foundation in sections. But the company refused, as this {{would be much more}} expensive. Implementing a new drainage system was the only solution, company officials said, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> four more months to finish the foundation. Hunkin-Conkey's reply was unacceptable to the city, so on January 11 Cleveland Properties Director Harold Lausche sent the bonding firm, Federal Insurance Co., noticed of failure to perform. Defending itself to the insurer, Hunkin-Conkey said its contract required all pumping to be complete before additional excavation could proceed. The company admitted that it had successfully tested a dragline excavator to remove watery soil at the site, but it would need written city approval to use the excavator for the remaining foundation work.|$|E

500|$|With the {{beginning}} of World War II in Europe, the Navy began to apply lessons learned by the British to U.S. ships. The King Board of 1940–1941 proposed sweeping changes to the secondary armament of the battleships to increase their defense against air attacks. These included the removal of all /25 caliber guns and 5in/51 {{in favor of the}} dual-purpose 5in/38, the addition of six quadruple [...] machine cannons, and the cutting away of superstructure to clear arcs of fire for the new anti-aircraft weapons. An ultimate secondary battery of sixteen 5 in/38 in dual mounts, sixteen Bofors 40mm in quadruple mounts and eight single Oerlikon 20mm was called for by the board in 1941, although they were not certain the ships could handle the added weight <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> a large amount of time in dry dock for these modifications to take place. With these concerns, an interim measure of four 1.1in guns was proposed by the board; however, the gun was not being produced in any great number very quickly, so a second interim solution was implemented. /50 caliber guns were added to all of the U.S.' battleships except for Arizona and Nevada by June 1941; these were replaced on the three battleships in the Atlantic by the 1.1in by November—they received them first because they were closer to a war zone.|$|E

When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account.

One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt.
