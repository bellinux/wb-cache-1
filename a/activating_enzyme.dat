2500|$|SUMO {{attachment}} to its target {{is similar to}} that of ubiquitin (as it is for the other ubiquitin-like proteins such as NEDD 8). The SUMO precursor has some extra amino acids that need to be removed, therefore a C-terminal peptide is cleaved from the SUMO precursor by a protease (in human these are the SENP proteases or Ulp1 in yeast) to reveal a di-glycine motif. The obtained SUMO then becomes bound to an E1 enzyme (SUMO <b>Activating</b> <b>Enzyme</b> (SAE)) which is a heterodimer. It is then passed to an E2 which is a conjugating enzyme (Ubc9). Finally, one of a small number of E3 ligating proteins attaches it to the protein. [...] In yeast, there are four SUMO E3 proteins, Cst9, Mms21, Siz1 and Siz2. While in ubiquitination an E3 is essential to add ubiquitin to its target, evidence suggests that the E2 is sufficient in SUMOylation as long as the consensus sequence is present. It is thought that the E3 ligase promotes the efficiency of SUMOylation and in some cases has been shown to direct SUMO conjugation onto non-consensus motifs. E3 enzymes can be largely classed into PIAS proteins, such as Mms21 (a member of the Smc5/6 complex) and Pias-gamma and HECT proteins. Some E3's such as RanBP2 however are neither. Recent evidence has shown that PIAS-gamma is required for the SUMOylation of the transcription factor yy1 but it is independent of the zinc-RING finger (identified as the functional domain of the E3 ligases). SUMOylation is reversible and is removed from targets by specific SUMO proteases. In budding yeast, the Ulp1 SUMO protease is found bound at the nuclear pore, whereas Ulp2 is nucleoplasmic. The distinct subnuclear localisation of deSUMOylating enzymes is conserved in higher eukaryotes.|$|E

40|$|Incubation of intact {{purified}} rat liver plasma membranes with insulin, cyclic AMP and ATP led to {{the activation}} of the peripheral "low-Km" cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase. When (gamma- 32 P]ATP {{was included in the}} incubation mixture, after purification of this enzyme to homogeneity it was found to contain 1 mol of alkali-labile 32 P/mol of enzyme. Treatment of the homogeneous phosphorylated enzyme with alkaline phosphatase released all of the 32 P from the protein while restoring its activity to the native state. The reversibility of the activation that is achieved by the phosphorylation of this enzyme could also be demonstrated with a high-speed supernatant from rat liver. This restored the activity of the <b>activated</b> membrane-bound <b>enzyme</b> to its native state. The Ka for the cyclic AMP-dependence of this process (1. 6 micrometer) was unaffected by a range of ATP concentrations (1 - 10 mM) and by a range of membrane protein concentrations (0. 2 - 2 mg/ml).

50|$|SUMO <b>activating</b> <b>enzyme</b> (E1, {{heterodimer}} of SAE1 and UBA2) catalyzes {{the reaction}} of activating SUMO-1 and transferring it to Ubc9 (the only known E2 for SUMOylation). The reaction happens in three steps: adenylation, thioester bond formation, and SUMO transfer to E2. First, the carboxyl group of SUMO C-terminal glycine residue attacks ATP, forming SUMO-AMP and pyrophosphate. Next, the thiol group of a catalytic cysteine in the UBA2 active site attacks SUMO-AMP, forming a high energy thioester bond between UBA2 and the C-terminal glycine of SUMO and releasing AMP. Finally, SUMO is transferred to an E2 cysteine, forming another thioester bond.|$|E

Proteins that are neddylated include the DNA replication licensing factor Cdt-1, the NF-κB transcription factor inhibitor pIκBα, and the cell cycle regulators cyclin E and p27.

NEDD8-AMP reacts with the catalytic cysteine in UBA3 during which NEDD8 is transferred to the catalytic cysteine, resulting in a high energy thioester linkage. NAE then binds ATP and NEDD8 to generate a second NEDD8-AMP, forming a fully loaded NAE carrying two activated NEDD8 molecules (i.e., one as a thioester and the other as an adenylate).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncubation of rat liver {{phosphorylase}} kinase in {{the presence}} of MgATP results in a time-dependent increase in activity, i. e., activation. Determination of the magnitude of activation depends, in large part, on the relative concentrations of Mg 2 + and ATP used in the phosphorylase kinase activity assay, such that as the Mg 2 + to ATP ratio increases less activation is detectable. Prior to activation, maximal activity of nonactivated phosphorylase kinase requires a 2 – 3 fold molar excess of Mg 2 + (i. e., free Mg 2 +) over ATP. MgATP-dependent activation of the enzyme results in an alteration in the free Mg 2 + requirement such that the activity of the <b>activated</b> <b>enzyme</b> is sharply inhibited by the free cation. Inhibition by free Mg 2 + of the <b>activated</b> <b>enzyme</b> is rapidly reversed by removal of free Mg 2 + but is not affected by addition of Ca 2 +. Both nonactivated and <b>activated</b> forms of <b>enzyme</b> appear to be inhibited by free ATP 4 –.
