5|$|The {{opening scene}} begins with {{panoramic}} camera shots {{of a helicopter}} flying over Los Angeles, at night. Then during Rick Ross's verse the female {{members of the group}} appear posing in the background while Ross raps for the camera. Swizz Beatz and Rico Love make cameos alongside Ross. In a third scene, Diddy can be seen driving through the city at night in a black Bugatti Veyron. For the song's chorus, Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper take the lead, ordering drinks in a bar and enjoying the night club. A fourth scene for T.I.'s verse sees the camera focus on T.I. serenading two women in an apartment. Throughout the video the images flicker between the various scenes. In the final part of the video, and during the bridge, all three members of the group appear outside <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> thick smoke and bright red fireworks. There is a final flash of fireworks before the camera fades completely, to black.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps with his eyes down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E

50|$|The {{movement}} {{begins with}} a discordant martial flourish. A simple marching tune emerges on piccolo and harp, <b>against</b> <b>a</b> disquieting <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> dissonant strings.

5000|$|On Avalon Sunset, Rob Sheffield wrote, Morrison sang about God {{and love}} in a scat-influenced style, set <b>against</b> <b>a</b> musical <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> mellow folk rock.

5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> skyscrapers {{and was one of}} a number of portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and holding a gun. The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E

25|$|<b>Against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> {{extraordinary}} {{development of}} new technologies, industrialisation and urbanism, Geddes witnessed the substantial social consequences of crime, illness and poverty that developed {{as a result of}} modernisation.

25|$|The {{nature and}} power of {{organized}} labor is the outcome of historical tensions among counter-acting forces involving workplace rights, wages, working hours, political expression, labor laws, and other working conditions.

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to undertake the}} third union station was made <b>against</b> <b>a</b> <b>backdrop</b> <b>of</b> {{significant change in the}} Canadian railway industry.

25|$|The {{success of}} acute care, both {{clinically}} and economically, {{has meant that}} there is now little opportunity for meaningful observation of the symptomatology of the acute psychiatric patient.
