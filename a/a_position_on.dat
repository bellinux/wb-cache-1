5|$|A {{group of}} {{approximately}} 1,000 Muslim men {{set out on}} late Friday from Medina and managed to circle around the Meccan forces. Early the next morning, they took <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (the chief of the Khazraj tribe) and his followers withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.|$|E
5|$|After graduating Chelvanayakam started {{teaching}} at St. Thomas but resigned when the warden William Arthur Stone refused him leave {{to visit his}} dying brother Edward Rajasundaram. He then joined Wesley College, Colombo as chief science master. During this period he studied law at Ceylon Law College and became an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1923. He started practising law in Hulftsdorp, specialising in civil law, and was made a King's Counsel on 31 May 1947. Chelvanayakam was twice offered <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the Supreme Court by Chief Justice John Curtois Howard.|$|E

5|$|Calgary {{ended the}} {{exhibition}} season with several injuries to key players. Centre Daymond Langkow remained sidelined following a neck injury suffered the previous season, while Ryan Stone (knee) was also out. Matt Stajan suffered a shoulder separation, David Moss also suffered {{a shoulder injury}} and Ales Kotalik was lost to a knee injury. As {{a result of the}} injuries, the Flames signed centre Brendan Morrison to a contract; Morrison had been in training camp with the Canucks before being released. Rookie defenceman T. J. Brodie proved the surprise player of training camp. Expected to start the year with the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), Brodie impressed the Flames' coaching staff and earned <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the team to begin the NHL season.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{accepting}} that Soult would not arrive, Ney could {{not hope to}} hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Phleps was {{transferred}} to the 11th Feldjäger (rifle) Battalion in Güns (in modern-day Hungary), and in 1905 was accepted into the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt. He completed his studies in two years, and was endorsed as suitable for service in the General Staff. Following promotion to Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he transferred to the staff of the 13th Infantry Regiment at Esseg in Slavonia, and then the 6th Infantry Division in Graz. This was followed by a promotion to Hauptmann (captain) in 1911 along with <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the staff of the XV Army Corps in Sarajevo, where he specialised in mobilisation and communications in the difficult terrain of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

After agreements {{were put in place}} so that bodyline would not be used, the tour went ahead. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} to Yale University, which was considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, {{he said he}} was not interested in Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported that he decided to leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new job would provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> its faculty.|$|E
5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and to dislodge the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> {{the right of the}} Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E
5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have {{expressed concern about the}} impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|E

The album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. The album also peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Comedy Albums chart, making it the first of Yankovic's records to earn <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> said chart.|$|E

At Bark Trench, <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> {{the north side of}} the centre of La Barque, the company {{encountered}} a German strongpoint and Newland received a gunshot wound to the face. He was admitted to the 1st Australian Field Ambulance, and returned to the 12th Battalion on 25 March after a period of hospitalisation at the 7th Stationary Hospital in Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Some bioethicists deem it {{reasonable}} {{for parents to}} select a child who would have the highest well-being. One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less. Some parents argue that Down syndrome shouldn't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide. The disability rights movement does not have <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> screening, although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory. Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled, while others do not. Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome, half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy.|$|E
