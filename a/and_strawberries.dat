5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, <b>and</b> <b>strawberries</b> were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries <b>and</b> <b>strawberries</b> in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, <b>and</b> <b>strawberries.</b> Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E

25|$|Michigan is {{a leading}} grower of fruit in the U.S., {{including}} blueberries, tart cherries, apples, grapes, and peaches. Plums, pears, <b>and</b> <b>strawberries</b> are also grown. These fruits are mainly grown in West Michigan due to the moderating effect of Lake Michigan on the climate. There is also significant fruit production, especially cherries, but also grapes, apples, and other fruits, in Northwest Michigan along Lake Michigan. Michigan produces wines, beers and a multitude of processed food products. Kellogg's cereal is based in Battle Creek, Michigan and processes many locally grown foods. Thornapple Valley, Ball Park Franks, Koegel Meat Company, and Hebrew National sausage companies are all based in Michigan.|$|E
25|$|After this settlement, George Fisher, who was {{commissioned}} by the Métis in Manitoba, set out to explore the land around the area. He was to report back on {{the conditions of the}} land. Fisher found that this new land was abundant with other animals besides buffalo to hunt, like mule and white tail deer, pronghorn antelope and elk. He also noted that there were more than just animals to hunt. Other food like wild saskatoons, chokecherries <b>and</b> <b>strawberries</b> were in the area. There were also protection from the rolling hills, springs and creeks that other lands did not have. This exploration {{led to the development of}} a new settlement, La Montagne de Bois, or Wood Mountain.|$|E
25|$|The name Brixton {{is thought}} to {{originate}} from Brixistane, meaning the stone of Brixi, a Saxon lord. Brixi {{is thought to}} have erected a boundary stone to mark the meeting place of the ancient hundred court of Surrey. The location is unknown but is thought to {{be at the top of}} Brixton Hill, at a road known at the time as Bristow or Brixton Causeway, long before any settlement in the area. Brixton marks the rise from the marshes of North Lambeth up to the hills of Upper Norwood and Streatham. At the time the River Effra flowed from its source in Upper Norwood through Herne Hill to Brixton. At Brixton the river was crossed by low bridges for Roman roads to the south coast of Britain, now Brixton Road and Clapham Road. The main roads were connected through a network of medieval country lanes, such as Acre Lane, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton Water Lane and Lyham Road, formerly Black Lane. It was only at the end of the 18th century that villages and settlements formed around Brixton, as the original woodland was gradually reduced until the area was covered in farmland and market gardens known for game <b>and</b> <b>strawberries.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1917 Imogen began {{boarding}} at Eothen, a small, {{private school}} for girls in Caterham, where Jane Joseph, Holst's star pupil from SPGS, taught music.

At the school, Imogen studied piano with Eleanor Shuttleworth, violin with André Mangeot (described as [...] "topping") and theory with Jane Joseph ("ripping"). Under Joseph's tuition Imogen produced her first compositions—three instrumental pieces and some Christmas carol tunes—which she numbered as Ops. 1, 2, 3 and 4.
