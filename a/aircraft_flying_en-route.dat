40|$|Studies {{of impact}} noise have {{traditionally}} focused on landing and takeoff {{procedures in the}} airports vicinity. Beside these studies, en-route noise is considered an issue {{when we talk about}} noise in natural reservation or other populated sensitive areas {{and when it comes to}} designing a new aircraft engine. In these cases, the studies are focusing on the impact at ground level of the en route noise produced by aircraft at all the flights stages. This paper presents the results of the measurement performed for an A 320 <b>aircraft</b> when <b>flying</b> <b>en-route</b> and the impact map for a flight from Bucharest – Sofia – Bucharest (OTP-SOF-OTP) ...|$|R
