5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|Fürst Bismarck was {{designed}} before the naval arms race between Germany and the United Kingdom. Admiral Hollmann was the State Secretary of the Naval Office at the time. Given {{the dominance of}} the British Royal Navy and the impossibility, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, of competing with it, Hollmann envisaged a small fleet consisting of torpedo boats and coastal defense ships to be based in German waters. This would be supplemented by a number of cruisers for overseas duties, including trade protection.|$|E

5|$|The United Nations instituted {{mandatory}} {{economic sanctions}} against Rhodesia in December 1966. Over the next year British diplomatic activity regarding Rhodesia was diminished; the UK government's stated policy shifted towards NIBMAR—"no independence before majority rule". Beadle grappled with the Rhodesian problem privately and in correspondence, attempting to reconcile the Smith administration's control over {{the country with the}} unconstitutional nature of UDI. Erwin Griswold, the United States Solicitor General, wrote to him that <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it the Rhodesian judges could not recognise the post-UDI government as de facto while also claiming to act under the Queen's commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{passed with}} 9 supports and no opposition. Supporting nations included the United States, the United Kingdom, Republic of China, France, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Norway and India. Aleš Bebler, delegate from Yugoslavia, abstained from voting.

Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin.

5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of the house before the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it in about 1790.|$|E

5|$|In August 1995, Ranariddh {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} {{the political and economic}} systems of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, these countries, characterised by hybrid regimes, active economic interventionism and limited press freedom, served as good models to propel Cambodia's socio-economic growth. Ranariddh espoused the view that economic development should take precedence over democratic and human rights. In the initial months of the administration, he actively courted political leaders from various regional countries, including Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, with a view to encouraging investment in Cambodia. In early 1994, Ranariddh established the Cambodian Development Council (CDC) to encourage foreign investment, and served as its chairperson. The Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, supported Ranariddh's plans, and encouraged Malaysian businessmen to invest and assist in developing the tourism, infrastructural development and telecommunications industries.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch {{were very}} keen {{to resume the}} lucrative trade with Japan which had been choked off {{in the wake of}} the dispute between Nuyts and Hamada at the behest of the Japanese {{authorities}} in Edo. All their overtures to the Japanese court failed, until they decided to extradite Pieter Nuyts to Japan for the shogun to punish him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit. This was an unprecedented step, and was representative of both the extreme official displeasure with Nuyts in the Dutch hierarchy and the strong desire to recommence Japanese trade. It also demonstrates the relative weakness of the Dutch when confronted by powerful East Asian states such as Japan, and recent historiography has suggested that the Dutch relied on the mercy of these states to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{development}} {{stage of the}} production of Prometheus, director Ridley Scott considered German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender to be his top choice to portray David. In January 2011, Fassbender was confirmed to have joined the cast of Prometheus. Fassbender was provided with {{a significant amount of}} free rein for modeling the character <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit. Rather than taking inspiration from the previous Alien installments, Fassbender studied Sean Young's character Rachael, a replicant in Blade Runner, noting her vacant demeanor. Fassbender drew inspiration from a number of other film performances, including Douglas Rain as HAL 9000 in , David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, and Dirk Bogarde in The Servant. Additionally, Fassbender modeled his walk around American Olympic diver Greg Louganis.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating his head against the bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E
5|$|By {{his next}} time in Trondheim, the Gestapo had gained {{knowledge}} of Gjems-Onstad's activities, and did their outermost to capture him. Gjems-Onstad {{went back to}} Trondheim {{at the end of}} October. He was to establish a new radio station, and investigate if Milorg and Lark could be rebuilt, as the organisation had been severely damaged by multiple arrests and murders. Durham was however largely intact. The mission went into a new phase, as the Norwegian resistance started organising defence against potential destructions during the now largely inevitable German withdrawal. A continuation of the scorched earth policy practiced in Northern Norway was particularly feared. Gjems-Onstad and Lark were not to lead the defence, but rather to organise it and train new recruits. In November he authorised the creation of the illegal newspaper For Friheten by his own initiative, the first in Trondheim in years. He also operated the paper DFP, or Deutsche Freiheitspartei, a form of black propaganda distributed to German soldiers and officers. He became increasingly frustrated with the damages caused by Rinnan and his gang of Nazi collaborators, and he vocally advocated their assassination. He reported back to Stockholm in November, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, little remained of Milorg in Trøndelag after this. He however noted the importance of Durham, which he considered to have grown very powerful.|$|E
5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E

5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{appointed}} Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and {{was present at}} William I's deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his loss of office is unclear. He retained the king's trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with William Warelwast on a diplomatic mission to Pope Urban II regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the Antipope Clement III in return for Anselm's deposition and the delivery of Anselm's pallium into Rufus' custody, to dispose of <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by Whitsun with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm's pallium. The legate secured Rufus' recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm's deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm's position as archbishop, and at the king's court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces should at least destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where {{he happened to be}} at that time. His soul then left his body {{in the form of a}} snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was based}} around {{the concept of}} five different races, and the interaction with a human character. The story premise of a human character becoming {{a member of one}} of the five playable races was born out of a compromise about who and what the player character should be. The concept of a non-human character was introduced by Horii <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> an inherent contradiction in the idea of a human saving the other tribes. This raised some contention among the staff including Fujisawa due to the Dragon Quest series' established convention of a human as the main protagonist, but Fujisawa and Horii decided to have the player character be a human first and later become one of the five tribes. Part of the story's initial drama came from the player character growing accustomed to their new form. Once the basic scenario concept had been finalized, the team commissioned the various character designs from Toriyama. In contrast to the greater majority of MMORPGs, which did not seem to have a solid ending, the team wanted to create a definitive ending with a final boss as featured in normal RPGs.|$|E
