The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation). Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007.

500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon {{could get away}} with [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, but at least the time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the majority of people who work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E

The upper plane carried long ailerons extending over 70% of the span. The wings and the square-section fuselage were wooden frames with fabric covering, although the fuselage decking was aluminium.

Tail surfaces were conventional, apart from the rudder horn balance positioned under the rear end of the fuselage.

40|$|Impedance spectroscopic {{studies and}} I-V Measurements are {{performed}} at Sr-doped LaMnO 3 (LSM) microelectrodes {{in order to}} elucidate the mechanism of the oxygen-reduction reaction on yttria-stabilized zirconia. The geometry dependence of the polarization resistance was investigated by systematic variations of the microelectrode's size and thickness. The relation between the resistance and the electrode geometry {{turns out to be}} bias-dependent: in the cathodic regime and <b>close</b> <b>to</b> equilibrium, the resistance is proportional to the inverse electrode area. Moreover, measurements without bias revealed an almost linear dependence of the resistance on the electrode thickness, This suggests that the relevant oxygen reduction path involves the transport of oxide ions through the bulk of the LSM cathode. In the anodic regime, however, the resistance becomes proportional to the inverse three-phase boundary length and, hence, a mechanism involving the LSM surface is most probable with <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the three-phase boundary being rate limiting. Experiments performed on LSM microelectrodes with thin alumina "discs" beneath the LSM to partly block the oxygen ion transport through the bulk of the electrode support this interpretation.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{involvement of}} gibberellins (GAs) {{in the regulation}} of hypocotyl elongation by phytochrome was examined. Under white light the tall long hypocotyl (lh) cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) mutant, deficient in a type B-like phytochrome, shows an increased "responsiveness" (defined as response capability) to applied GA 4 (the main endogenous active GA) compared to the wild type. Supplementing far-red irradiation results in a similar increase in responsiveness in the wild type. Experiments involving application of the precursor GA 9 and of an inhibitor of GA 4 inactivation suggest that both the GA 4 activation and inactivation steps are phytochrome independent. Endogenous GA levels of whole seedlings were analyzed by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using deuterated internal standards. The levels of GA 4 (and those of GA 34, the inactivated GA 4) were lower in the lh mutant under low-irradiance fluorescent light compared with the wild type, similar to wild type under higher irradiance light during the initial hypocotyl extension phase, and higher during the phase of sustained growth, in which extension involved {{an increase in the}} number of cells in the upper region.
