Receiver noise temperature measured with 80 K/ 300 K <b>antenna</b> <b>loads</b> was ≈ 560 K (DSB). Emissivity {{of the surface}} is detected at LO frequency about 840 GHz via the imbalance of the antenna switch due to extra reflection from sample of panel; absorption 0. 25 ± 0. 10 % is calculated from measured emissivity.

The <b>antenna</b> <b>loads</b> on one eighth-mode substrate integrated waveguide (EMSIW), metallic silver vias have been punched via the EMSIW,and etched {{on the surface}} of metal sheet a complementary split-ring. The size of the antenna only takes up 12. 5 % of the traditional substrate integrated waveguide(SIW). Using computer simulation software HFSS to simulate, I get its return loss, VSWR and three-dimensional gain plot and so on. The simulation results show that at the resonance frequency of 17. 1 GHz, the bandwidth with return loss less than- 10 dB reaches 1. 9 %, the largest gain reaches 4. 4 dB; At the resonant frequency of 27. 6 GHz and 30 GHz, the two useful bandwidths with return loss less than- 10 dB appear to be united perfectly, making the total bandwidth reach 15. 2 %, it biggest gain reaches 7. 68 dB...|$|E

Experimental results demonstrate a strong dependence of a PA’s RF performance on the phase of mismatched <b>antenna</b> <b>loads.</b> For a load mismatch of voltage standing-wave ratio (VSWR) of 10 : 1, the 1 -dB compressed RF output power (1 dB), transducer gain (), output third-order intercept point, and power-added efficiency differ by 7. 5 dBm, 8. 1 dB, 8. 3 dBm, and 15 %, respectively, between the optimal and worst phase conditions, for an SiGe HBT PA biased at CC = 33 V, collector current CE = 400 mA, and frequency of 1. 88 GHz. At the optimal phase condition up to VSWR of 10 : 1, the SiGe HBT PA maintains its linearity, RF output power, gain, and efficiency close to that at a VSWR of 1 : 1. At all the nonoptimal phases, the deterioration in the RF performance increases with the magnitude of load mismatches. The nonlinear characteristic of a PA under load mismatches is due to amplitude and phase-distortion mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} fractal antennas placed onto dielectric object in the UHF RFID band and introduces a tag antenna configuration of simple geometry having impedance tuning capability. Through the paper, {{the dimensions of the}} fractal antenna are optimized to improve the impedance matching with the chip impedance. The tag performance changes are studied when it is placed on different objects (e. g., cardboard boxes with various content), or when other objects are present {{in the vicinity of the}} tagged object. It has been shown that a tag antenna can be designed or tuned for optimum performance on a particular object. Using the finite element method the open circuit voltage and the polarization mismatch factor against the operating frequency are calculated. The input impedance, reflection coefficient, power transmission coefficient and the read range as a function of frequency are illustrated. The performance of the tag antenna in the presence of the dielectric box and different object materials inside the box is illustrated. The effect of the objects that are placed in the center of the dielectric box didn’t have a significant effect on the performance of the tag antenna; there is a small shift in the resonance frequency but still within the operating frequency band. Both the power transmission coefficient and the read range change with the object material. The backscattering properties of the tag antenna have been studied.

30|$|To design {{dedicated}} architectures for backscatter communication, it {{is fundamental}} to understand the basic electromagnetic (e.m.) mechanisms underlying {{the interaction between the}} reader's and tag's antennas. As previously mentioned, backscatter modulation consists of changing the antenna reflection properties according to information data [2]. In fact, when an e.m. wave encounters an antenna, it is partially reflected back depending on antenna configuration. The antenna scattering mechanism is composed of structural and antenna mode scatterings [28, 29]. The structural mode occurs owing to the antenna's given shape and material and is independent from how the <b>antenna</b> is <b>loaded.</b> On the other hand, antenna mode scattering {{is a function of the}} <b>antenna</b> <b>load,</b> and thus, data can be sent back to the reader through a proper variation of the <b>antenna</b> <b>load</b> characteristic without requiring a dedicated power source (backscatter modulation).a This property is currently adopted in traditional passive UHF RFID tags based on CW signals to carry information from the tag to the reader.|$|R
