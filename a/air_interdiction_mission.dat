50|$|With <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> in World War I, {{the goal}} was to isolate the {{battlefield}} by strafing and bombing enemy supply lines. Favorite targets were railroad lines, bridges, and truck convoys. Due to the primitive state of aircraft and weapons technology, as well as the undeveloped nature of air doctrine and tactics, <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions</b> in World War I were of limited utility.|$|R
50|$|In March 1981, the USAF {{announced}} the Enhanced Tactical Fighter program to procure {{a replacement for}} the F-111 Aardvark.

50|$|On 23 October, the {{approach}} of the enemy surface vessels was detected. US naval units moved out to intercept, and the air and naval Battle of Leyte Gulf—the largest naval battle in the Pacific and also one of the largest naval battles in history—was fought from 23-26 October—the Japanese suffered a decisive defeat. Nonetheless by 11 December, the Japanese had succeeded in moving more than 34,000 troops to Leyte and over 10000 ST of materiél, most through the port of Ormoc on the west coast, despite heavy losses to reinforcement convoys, including engagements at Ormoc Bay, because of relentless <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions</b> by US aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The {{squadron}} re-equipped {{with more}} modern B-17F Flying Fortresses {{and moved to}} Ephrata Army Air Field,Washington for transition and combat training in late 1942 and early 1943. It moved to North Africa in April 1943, carrying out bombing missions in Algeria and Tunisia as part of Twelfth Air Force during the North African Campaign. The unit flew many support and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions,</b> bombing such targets as marshalling yards, airfields, troop concentrations, bridges, docks, and shipping. The 20th participated in the defeat of Axis forces in Tunisia during April and May 1943; the reduction of Pantelleria and the preparations for Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, in May through July 1943; and Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy in September.|$|R
50|$|The {{airframe}} is {{manufactured by}} Lockheed Martin, while Boeing {{is responsible for}} the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. Developed during the Vietnam War as 'Project Gunship II', the AC-130 replaced the Douglas AC-47 Spooky, or 'Gunship I'. The sole operator is the United States Air Force, which uses the AC-130U Spooky and AC-130W Stinger II variants for close <b>air</b> support, <b>air</b> <b>interdiction,</b> and force protection, with the AC-130J Ghostrider in development. Close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting convoys, and urban operations. <b>Air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions</b> are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include defending air bases and other facilities. AC-130Us are based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, while AC-130Ws are based at Cannon AFB, New Mexico; gunships can be deployed worldwide. The squadrons are part of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), a component of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM).|$|R
25|$|The 389th resumed {{operations}} from England in October 1943 {{the group}} concentrated primarily on strategic objectives in France, the Low Countries, and Germany. Targets {{struck by the}} group included shipyards at Vegesack, industrial areas of Berlin, oil facilities at Merseburg, factories at Münster, rail yards at Sangerhausen, and V-weapon sites in the Pas de Calais. The group participated in the intensive air campaign against the German aircraft industry during Big Week from 20–25 February 1944. It also flew support and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions</b> on several occasions, bombing gun batteries and airfields in support of Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, in June 1944. It struck enemy positions to aid the breakthrough at St Lo in July 1944, hit storage depots and communications centers during the Battle of the Bulge from December 1944 – January 1945 and dropped food, ammunition, gasoline, and other supplies to troops participating in the Operation Varsity. the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945.|$|R
50|$|Northern Edge '97, {{with more}} than 9,000 personnel, divided its field {{training}} into two parts, held in different locations. Major air and ground maneuvers were held at Fort Greely.

5000|$|A second {{outcome of}} that {{directive}} {{was a decision}} by the Air Force that, instead of upgrading the A-10, it would seek to retrofit 400 Block 30/32 F-16s as with new equipment to perform both CAS and battlefield <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> (BAI) <b>missions.</b> The new systems for this [...] "F/A-16" [...] Block 30 included a digital terrain-mapping system and Global Positioning System (GPS) integration for improved navigational and weapons delivery accuracy, as well as an Automatic Target Handoff System (ATHS) to allow direct digital target/mission data exchange between the pilot and ground units. This approach, however, was dropped in January 1992 in favor of equipping Block 40/42 F-16C/Ds with LANTIRN pods.|$|R
5000|$|Military {{aviation}} {{first began}} as either army or naval aviation units established as force multipliers to allow armies and navies to better {{do what they}} were already doing, this taking mostly the form of reconnaissance and artillery spotting, {{this led to the}} first fighter aircraft whose purpose was to shoot down enemy reconnaissance and artillery spotting aircraft, and to protect one's own aircraft from being shot down. At this point the purpose of aircraft was still to act as an adjunct to traditional armies and fleets operating in the traditional way. However, as aircraft became more technologically sophisticated military theorists of the interwar period began to think of airpower as a means in and of itself where the critical blow could be delivered by strategic bombing, and the experience of World War II seemed to confirm this. Post World War II air forces such as the Royal Air Force and the newly established United States Air Force concentrated on building strategic bomber fleets for attack and fighter fleets to defend against enemy bombers. Where it existed tactical bombing took the form of <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions,</b> these <b>air</b> forces having lost interest in tactical reconnaissance in support of commanders on the ground and in the [...] "taxi rank" [...] type close air support missions, in which aircraft acted directly in concert with and at the call of soldiers fighting on the ground.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimited. 13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 wonls) This study considers {{the implications of}} video datalink (VDL) on the AC- 130. Gunships use infrared and low-light television sensors, and synthetic aperture radar to search for and to identify target for close <b>air</b> support and <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions.</b> The addition of VDL offers gunship crews the ability to employ real-time information to the cockpit/offboard targeting (RTIC/OT) technology to improve situational awareness, survivability, and operational flexibility. Also, VDL offers the joint force air component commander (JFACC) inflight tasking capability, increased reconnaissance capability, operational flexibility and situation awareness. Ultimately, VDL allows command and control elements to exercise direct control of gunship operations. These capabilities are beneficial when they provide information to the crew or to the JFACC. However, VDL used to provide direct control of gunship operations may violate the Air Force doctrinal tenet of centralized control and decentralized execution.

500|$|In July 1952, Loring {{transferred}} to the 36th Fighter-Bomber Squadron full-time, where he served as operations officer. In this role he returned to combat duty, this time as a jet aircraft fighter pilot operating the F-80 Shooting Star. Missions for this unit primarily concerned close air support, <b>air</b> strikes and <b>interdiction</b> <b>missions</b> supporting United Nations Command ground troops in the country. In this role, Loring's unit primarily fought North Korean and Chinese ground targets. By November 22, 1952, Loring had completed 50 combat missions. At that time the ground battle in Korea had developed into a stalemate, with the two sides firmly entrenched along the 38th Parallel. Throughout November, the UN forces had been launching Operation Showdown against two targets: Triangle Hill and Sniper Ridge, northwest of Kunwha, [...] north of the 38th Parallel. During the battle, the Chinese managed to amass 133 large caliber guns, 24 BM-13 rocket launchers and 47 anti-aircraft guns in the largest Chinese artillery operation during the Korean War, and it posed {{a serious threat to}} ground troops of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division operating in the area.
