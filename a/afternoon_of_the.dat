5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. Wraparound snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E

5|$|After the {{skirmish}} was over, {{men from}} the Lampasas landed on the beach to secure the area and to build a landing dock. 3,300 American soldiers {{under the command of}} General Miles landed. The units that landed were the 6th Volunteer Regiments of Illinois and Massachusetts, an Artillery battalion, five battery companies, two engineer companies and a medical unit. The men who had not abandoned the barrio of Guanica swore allegiance to the United States. Garretson named Agustín Barrenechea mayor of Guanica and Simón Mejil the chief of police. On the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25th, Garretson left Guánica with seven companies of the 6th Massachusetts and one company of the 6th Illinois and headed towards Yauco.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, on the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Plataea, a rumour {{of their}} victory at that battle reached the Allies' navy, {{at that time}} {{off the coast of}} Mount Mycale in Ionia. Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, {{destroying}} the remnants of the Persian fleet, crippling Xerxes's sea power, and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet. Whilst many modern historians doubt that Mycale took place on the same day as Plataea, the battle may well only have occurred once the Allies received news of the events unfolding in Greece.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Taihō and Shōkaku left Zuikaku {{to recover}} the Division's few {{remaining}} aircraft after their heavy losses (only 102 aircraft remained aboard the seven surviving carriers by the evening) and the 1st Mobile Fleet continued its withdrawal towards Okinawa. The Americans did not spot the Japanese carriers until the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following day and launched a large airstrike that only succeeded in hitting Zuikaku with a single bomb that started {{a fire in the}} hangar.|$|E

5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench {{at one end of}} South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 18 February North Vietnamese forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South. On the {{following}} day the attacks commenced against Ranger North conducted by the 102nd PAVN Regiment of the 308th Division supported by Soviet-built PT-76 and T-54 tanks. The ARVN held on tenaciously throughout the night. President Thieu, oblivious to the previous nights attacks, and who was visiting I Corps headquarters at the time, advised General Lãm to postpone the advance on Tchepone and to shift {{the focus of the}} operation toward the southwest. By the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th, the 39th ARVN Ranger Battalion had been reduced from 500 to 323 men and its commander ordered a retreat toward Ranger South, six kilometers away. Only 109 survivors reached Ranger South by nightfall. Although more than 600 PAVN troops were estimated as killed during the action, casualties in the three-day fight totaled 75 percent of the ARVN battalion.|$|E
5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the Second Carrier Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E

5|$|Heading {{into the}} eighth and final game, each team had three wins and three losses and one tie, but the Soviets were ahead in goal {{differential}} by two goals. In Canada, {{much of the}} country enjoyed an unofficial 'half a day' holiday, with many students in Toronto being sent home the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game (which began at 1pm Eastern Time), while many others watched the game at work or school. In Montreal's Central Station, 5,000 fans gathered around ten TV sets to watch the game, which was simulcast in English on CBC Television and CTV, and in French by Radio-Canada. Until the men's hockey gold-medal game of the 2010 Winter Olympics, it was the most-watched sporting event in the history of Canadian television.|$|E
5|$|In Monroe County, {{state police}} closed Interstates 80 and 380 during the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th {{because of bad}} road conditions. Interstate 80 was closed between Interstates 81 and 380. The {{combination}} of a heavy snowfall then a mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain made for hazardous road conditions. The mixed precipitation {{made it more difficult}} for some road crews to keep up. At 4 PM EST on the 17th the interstates reopened after ice was removed and the road surfaces was safe for travel. In and around the Greater Philadelphia Metropolitan area, in Bucks County, slippery road conditions contributed to a tractor-trailer accident on the 14th on Route 309 in Richland Township. The highway was closed for more than an hour, which forced motorists to detour on slush-covered side streets.|$|E
5|$|In late 1758 Brilliant {{joined a}} Royal Navy {{squadron}} supporting amphibious raids along the French coastline. In company with other frigates she protected fleet transports and bomb vessels and assisted with shore bombardment in the Battle of Saint Cast on 11 September 1758. The progenitor of the Royal Geographic Society, James Rennell, was a midshipman aboard Brilliant {{during this period}} and produced his first coastal map while the frigate was stationed off Saint Cast. Brilliant played an undistinguished role in this engagement as her draught was too deep for her to approach the shore. By the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle she {{was close enough to}} the beach for her crew to witness the surrounding and defeat of the British Grenadier Guards, but was too distant to range her guns onto their French assailants.|$|E

5|$|On November9, a weak {{circulation}} remained nearly stationary off {{the coast}} of Acapulco, Mexico. It did not have significant convection, although it organized enough to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000UTC on November10, about 230mi (365km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. By the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10th, it was a tropical depression moving northeastward toward the coastline. Tara intensified, reaching hurricane status and its peak intensity of 85mph (140km/h) late on November11. Early on November12, Hurricane Tara made landfall near Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, between Acapulco and Manzanillo, near where Hurricane Iva moved ashore five months earlier. Continuing inland, it was last observed at 1200UTC on November12. At the time, it was known as Cyclone Tara, as the term cyclone was the more common equivalent for hurricane in the region.|$|E
5|$|Reconstructions of the {{eruption}} {{and its effects}} vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning {{of the first day}} was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In {{the middle of the day}} an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second day, {{the eruption}} was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{ordered that}} the troops, but not their equipment, be {{unloaded}} from the cruisers {{on the evening}} of the 8th, and that the cruisers were to search forthwith for the German ships known to be at sea. This was later cancelled and the squadron was ordered to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet. Later that day, German bombers attacked the British ships and Devonshire suffered a near-miss. On the 11th, the squadron was detached on an unsuccessful search for German ships in the area around Trondheim and rejoined the fleet two days later. Cunningham's ships were then detached to Tromsø where he conducted negotiations with local officials to refuel there and to bring Norwegian troops west from Kirkenes. The squadron arrived there on the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15th and escorted Norwegian troopships back to Tromsø. Devonshire covered the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos at the beginning of May and was nearly hit when the evacuation forces were attacked by German aircraft as they were withdrawing on 3 May.|$|E

50|$|A short lived system, this cyclone {{followed}} in <b>the</b> wake <b>of</b> Ken. In fact, Ken's outflow kept the thunderstorm activity significantly {{removed from the}} depression's low level center for its entire existence. Moving northwest, numerous ship reports of 30 kn winds led to <b>the</b> indication <b>of</b> this depression during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> September 21. <b>The</b> cyclone could not develop into a deep system due to the persistent wind shear as it began to round <b>the</b> western periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtropical ridge. By <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> September 22, <b>the</b> cyclone weakened into a low pressure area. This low developed into a small extratropical cyclone when it linked up with a frontal boundary southeast of Japan on September 24.|$|R

5|$|The Germans {{eventually}} captured Hill 311 {{just before}} nightfall, driving {{off the first}} battalion of the 23rd Colonial Infantry Regiment with losses. During the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th, the Villy artillery casemates were evacuated, while German bombardment continued amid French fire from Chesnois. At about this time, General Huntziger ordered that Villy and La Ferté be relieved to prevent their encirclement, emphasizing the importance of French possession of Hill 311, and directing that the town of Inor to the southwest be held at all costs. General Brochard, responsible for the area, decided to counterattack from the south through Hill 311 to La Ferté using the 3rd North African Infantry Division and the newly arrived 6th Infantry Division. Through the ensuing night La Ferté requested and received supporting fire from Chesnois to suppress German movements {{on top of the}} ouvrage.|$|E
5|$|The presidential {{elections}} of May 1989 were marred by fraud and violence. COLINA, a pro-military coalition {{led by the}} PRD, named Carlos Duque, a former business partner of Noriega as its candidate. ADOC, an opposition coalition, nominated Guillermo Endara, a member of Arias' Panameñista Party, and two other prominent oppositionists, Ricardo Arias Calderón and Guillermo Ford, as vice-presidential candidates. Anticipating fraud, the opposition tracked ballot counts at local precincts {{on the day of}} the election (local ballot counts were done in public). As an exit poll made it clear that the opposition slate was winning by a wide margin, reports of missing tally sheets and seizures of ballot boxes by PDF soon emerged. In the <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day after the election, the Catholic Bishops conference announced that a quick count of public tallies at polling centers showed the opposition slate winning 3-to-1. Official tallies the day after that, however, had Duque winning by a 2–1 margin.|$|E
5|$|Von der Tann {{also participated}} in the raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, on 15–16December. The raid was another attempt to lure out {{a portion of the}} Grand Fleet and destroy it, with the whole of the High Seas Fleet {{standing}} by in support. Von der Tann delayed the raid itself by several days, because Admiral Ingenohl was unwilling to send forth the IScouting Group at anything less than full strength, and Von der Tann was undergoing routine repairs in early December. The I Scouting Group, along with the II Scouting Group, composed of the four light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two torpedo boat flotillas, left the Jade at 03:20. Hipper's ships sailed north, through the channels in the minefields, past Heligoland to the Horns Reef light vessel, at which point the ships turned westward, towards the English coast. The main battle squadrons of the High Seas Fleet left in the late <b>afternoon</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15th. During the night of 15 December, {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers, and fearing the prospect of a night-time torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat.|$|E
