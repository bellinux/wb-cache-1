5|$|Members of the Spirit Fruit Society lived {{according}} to the following basic principles: seek happiness through selflessness; follow one's conscience; take responsibility for one's actions—and develop {{an awareness of the}} consequences of one's actions on others; and accept whatever happens. Beilhart believed very strongly in the individual's right to guide his own actions, and not be dictated to by others. While {{there was no mention of}} <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of organization or hierarchy in any documents, as the leader, Beilhart likely made important decisions concerning the group. There is no record of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of internal conflict between members.|$|E

Without <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of competitive bidding or restrictions, he was commissioned to design it with space for approximately 1,000 employees. In 1900, the prosperous city decided the building should feature a tower. Hoffmann's design was accepted in 1901, and demolition of the existing buildings began. The cornerstone was laid in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Because Titus {{effectively}} {{acted as}} co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership {{in the government}} would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor imperium of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the German {{paleontologist}} Otto Schindewolf {{argued that}} variation tends {{to move in}} a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of vitalism, but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.|$|E
5|$|Liechtenstein uses agnatic primogeniture (aka Salic law), which {{completely}} excludes {{women from}} the order of succession unless there are no male heirs of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> present, and was criticised for this by a United Nations committee for this perceived gender equality issue in November 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, {{the term}} Ahimsa is an {{important}} spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.|$|E

5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{city that}} doesn't have enough money for basic {{services}} right now and doesn't {{have enough money to}} protect regular citizens.

5|$|Wanting to {{understand}} the strange light pattern, Tabetha S. Boyajian put several hypotheses to the test. The first general assumption was an exoplanet transiting (eclipsing) its massive star, but the dips in light lasted between 5 to 80 days and were erratically spaced apart, thus ruling out <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of an orbit for one celestial object.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E

5|$|Andretti had a {{long career}} in racing. He {{was the only person}} to be named United States Driver of the Year in three decades (1967, 1978, and 1984). He was also one of only three drivers to have won major races on road courses, paved ovals, and dirt tracks in one season, a feat that he {{accomplished}} four times. With his final IndyCar win in April 1993, Andretti became the first driver to have won IndyCar races in four different decades and the first to win automobile races of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> in five.|$|E
5|$|Bows of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> seldom {{survive in}} the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records of <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> are late and scanty and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
5|$|Courts {{and state}} legislatures also opined on the {{inappropriate}} uses of state seals and arms. Most states barred their use for <b>any</b> <b>kind</b> of advertising.

The 2003 Code of Federal Regulations pertaining to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives prohibits the use of state seals or coats of arms in product branding {{so as not to}} mislead the public into thinking that a commercial product has been endorsed by a government organization.|$|E
