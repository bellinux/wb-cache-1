500|$|Historian Allan Nevins, in his {{foreword}} to Walters' {{biography of}} Foraker, suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency, {{as he had}} hoped, because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians. While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate, had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it, having [...] "stood aside for an older man year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders. [...] First McKinley, with Hanna at his side, was given precedence; then Taft, whom Foraker had given a start in public life, scaled the peak. [...] Foraker, for all his <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity,</b> his wide popular appeal, and his unflinching courage, had the tragic lot of seeing a succession of associates go above him." [...] Even Foraker's final defeat, in 1914, proved {{to be part of}} the political rise of another president from Ohio, Harding. Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker's political style, and commented, [...] "How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune and how much to some of his traits, readers … may judge for themselves." [...] Cincinnati editor Murat Halstead, a contemporary, attributed the fact that Foraker did not get nominated in 1888 to the surplus of ambitious Ohio men at the convention: [...] in addition to Sherman, Foraker, and McKinley, even Harrison had been born in Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{acknowledging}} {{a number}} of practical and moral reasons for peacekeeping operations, James Fearon and David Laitin assert {{that they have a}} tendency under some circumstances to become tangled with state-building efforts. [...] In weak states facing successful guerrilla campaigns, peacekeepers face pressures to build state institutional and <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> in order to achieve lasting peace. [...] These pressures can lead to mission creep beyond the original purview of the peacekeeping operation; without engaging in state-building, the peacekeepers risk allowing the peacekept country to revert to violence following their exit. [...] Thus, Fearon and Laitin advocate for the greater integration of state-building in peacekeeping efforts through a new framework of [...] "neotrusteeship," [...] which would see foreign powers exercising a great deal of control over a weak state's domestic affairs in order to ensure the prevention of future violence.|$|E

2500|$|Merriam {{believed}} {{that part of}} {{the success or failure of}} the National Planning Board's proposals depended on the <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> of the executive branch to adopt and push for the recommended policies. Therefore, Merriam began lobbying President Roosevelt for a commission to study the structure and functions of the executive. Roosevelt was very receptive to the idea. [...] The Supreme Court had struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act (a key legislative accomplishment of the New Deal) in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), and significantly limited the president's power to remove members of independent executive agencies in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935). Merriam assured the president that if he established a committee to review the administration of the executive branch, the committee's report could be written in such a way as to justify the president's reorganization goals while couching them in the neutral language of academic research. On March 22, 1936, Roosevelt established the Committee on Administrative Management (commonly known as the Brownlow Committee) and charged it with developing proposals for reorganizing the executive branch. Besides himself, the three-person committee consisted of Louis Brownlow, and Luther Gulick. On January 10, 1937, the Committee released its report. Famously declaring [...] "The President needs help," [...] the Committee's report advocated a strong chief executive, including among its 37 recommendations significant expansion of the presidential staff, integration of managerial agencies into a single presidential office, expansion of the merit system, integration of all independent agencies into existing Cabinet departments, and modernization of federal accounting and financial practices.|$|E
2500|$|In sharp contrast, {{decolonization}} was {{an entirely}} different process of state formation. Most imperial powers had not foreseen a need to prepare their colonies for independence; for example, Britain had given limited self-rule to India and Sri Lanka, while treating British Somaliland {{as little more than}} a trading post, while all major decisions for French colonies were made in Paris and Belgium prohibited any self-government up until it suddenly granted independence to its colonies in 1960. Like Western states of previous centuries, the new ex-colonies lacked autonomous bureaucracies, which would make decisions based on the benefit to society as a whole, rather than respond to corruption and nepotism to favor a particular interest group. In such a situation, factions manipulate the state to benefit themselves or, alternatively, state leaders use the bureaucracy to further their own self-interest. The lack of credible governance was compounded by the fact that most colonies were economic loss-makers at independence, lacking both a productive economic base and a taxation system to effectively extract resources from economic activity. Among the rare states profitable at decolonization was India, to which scholars credibly argue that Uganda, Malaysia and Angola may be included. Neither did imperial powers make territorial integration a priority, and may have discouraged nascent nationalism as a danger to their rule. Many newly independent states thus found themselves impoverished, with minimal <b>administrative</b> <b>capacity</b> in a fragmented society, while faced with the expectation of immediately meeting the demands of a modern state. Such states are considered [...] "weak" [...] or [...] "fragile". [...] The [...] "strong"-"weak" [...] categorization is not the same as [...] "Western"-"non-Western", as some Latin American states like Argentina and Brazil and Middle Eastern states like Egypt and Israel are considered to have [...] "strong" [...] administrative structures and economic infrastructure.|$|E
