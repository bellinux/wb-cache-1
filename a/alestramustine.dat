50|$|<b>Alestramustine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as {{estradiol}} 3-(bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) 17β-(L-alaninate), is a nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic drug that was never marketed. It is the L-alanine ester of estramustine, which {{is a combination of}} the nitrogen mustard normustine coupled via a carbamate to the estrogen estradiol. <b>Alestramustine</b> acts as a prodrug to estramustine, and also forms estradiol as a byproduct. The drug, via its active metabolites, binds to microtubule-associated proteins and β-tubulin and interferes with microtubule function, thereby inhibiting cell division. Due to its estrogen moiety, <b>alestramustine</b> is selectively concentrated in estrogen receptor-positive cells such as prostate and breast.|$|E
50|$|Estramustine {{phosphate}} is an estrane steroid and an estrogen ester. It is {{a derivative}} and diester of estradiol with a nitrogen mustard-carbamate ester moiety and a phosphate ester attached. Related although never-marketed drugs include <b>alestramustine,</b> atrimustine, cytestrol acetate, estradiol mustard, ICI-85966, and phenestrol.|$|E
50|$|Normustine, {{also known}} as bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamic acid, is a {{nitrogen}} mustard and alkylating antineoplastic agent (i.e., chemotherapy agent). It is an active metabolite {{of a number of}} prodrug alkylating antineoplastic agents that have been developed for the treatment of tumors, including estramustine phosphate, <b>alestramustine,</b> cytestrol acetate, and ICI-85966 (stilbostat), but only the former of which has actually been marketed.|$|E
