50|$|<b>Aerosolization</b> of {{antibiotics}} is necessary because infections of the lung are especially troublesome, {{which is why}} direct targeting of the infection is needed. Broad spectrum antibiotics can have detrimental side effects when their action is also taken against necessary non-pathogenic bacteria residing in the human microbiome. <b>Aerosolization</b> is effective in bypassing the microbiome {{that exists in the}} gastrointestinal tract by directing the antibiotic directly to the lungs. This process is undertaken after the production of the antibiotic itself.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{chemical}} and biological weapons, <b>aerosolization</b> {{is a means of}} dispersing a chemical or biological agent in an attack. See for example [...] "Botulinum Toxin as a Biological Weapon".|$|E
50|$|Dustiness {{is defined}} as the {{tendency}} of a powder material to generate airborne particles under a given external energy input. This property of powdered materials has a close link with powder <b>aerosolization</b> processes. It also has indications on human exposure level and associated health risks at workplaces. Dusty materials tend to produce aerosols with high number concentrations, which poses higher exposure risks to the workers who are in direct contacts with them during industrial production and handling processes. Laboratory simulations have been established to test <b>aerosolization</b> behavior and dustiness level of powders, in order to predict aerosol properties encountered in real-life situations.|$|E
50|$|The agglomeration/deagglomeration (mechanical stability) {{potentials}} {{of airborne}} engineered nanoparticle clusters also have significant influences on their size distribution profiles at the end-point of their environmental transport routes. Different <b>aerosolization</b> and deagglomeration {{systems have been}} established to test stability of nanoparticle agglomerates. For example, laboratory setups based on critical orifices {{have been used to}} apply a wide range of external shear forces onto airborne nanoparticles. After applying shear forces, the particle mean size decreased while the particle generation rate increased. In another pioneering study, four powder <b>aerosolization</b> systems (dustiness testing systems) were compared for the first time for their characteristics linked to aerosol generation.|$|E
5000|$|Some powders may be dustier than others. The {{tendency}} of a powder to generate {{particles in the}} air under a given energy input is called [...] "dustiness". It is an important powder property which is relevant to powder <b>aerosolization</b> process. It also has indications for human exposure to aerosolized particles and associated health risks (via skin contacts or inhalation) at workplaces. Various dustiness testing methods have been established in research laboratories, in order to predict powder behaviors during <b>aerosolization.</b> These methods (laboratory setups) allow application {{of a wide range}} of energy inputs to powdered materials, which simulates different real-life scenarios.|$|E

50|$|Bat-borne viruses are {{transmitted}} via bat bite and transfer via saliva, {{as well as}} <b>aerosolization</b> of saliva, feces, and/or urine. Like rabies virus, newly emerging bat-borne viruses can be transmitted to humans directly by bats. These include Ebola virus, SARS, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.|$|E
50|$|Buboes rarely {{require any}} form of local care, but instead recede with {{systemic}} antibiotic therapy. In fact, for plague patients, incision and drainage poses a risk to others {{in contact with the}} patient due to <b>aerosolization</b> of the bubo contents. Needle aspiration can be performed for diagnostic purposes and may also provide symptomatic relief.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a concern}} {{that some of the}} {{mainstream}} vapor exhaled by e-cigarette users can be inhaled by bystanders, particularly indoors, and have significant adverse effects. Since e-cigarettes involve an <b>aerosolization</b> process, it is suggested that no meaningful amounts of carbon monoxide are emitted. Thus, cardiocirculatory effects caused by carbon monoxide are not likely. However, in an experimental study, e-cigarettes increased levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the surrounding air.|$|E

50|$|Why Saddam Hussein did not to {{use these}} {{biological}} weapons in 1991 is unclear, but the presumption has been that {{he was concerned about}} provoking massive retaliation. Other plausible factors include the perceived ineffectiveness of the untested delivery and dispersal systems, the probable ineffectiveness of liquid slurries resulting from poor <b>aerosolization,</b> and the potential hazards to the Iraqi troops themselves, as they lacked the protective equipment and training available to Coalition forces.|$|E
50|$|The {{virus is}} shed in the saliva and nasal {{secretions}} of swine infected by the respiratory route. <b>Aerosolization</b> {{of the virus}} and transmission by fomites also may occur. The virus may potentially survive for seven hours in humid air, and it may survive on well water for up to seven hours, in green grass, soil, and feces {{for up to two}} days, in contaminated feed for up to three days, and in straw bedding for up to four days.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the materials themselves, procedures used to handle them can be improved. For example, using a nanomaterial slurry or suspension in a liquid solvent instead of a dry powder will reduce dust exposure. Reducing or eliminating steps that involve transfer of powder or opening packages containing nanomaterials also reduces <b>aerosolization</b> and thus the potential hazard to the worker. Reducing agitation procedures such as sonication, and reducing the temperature of reactors to minimize release of nanomaterials in exhaust, also reduce hazards to workers.|$|E

50|$|The <b>aerosolization</b> of {{bacteria}} in dust contributes heavily to the transport {{of bacteria}}l pathogens. A well-known case of disease outbreak by bioaerosol was the meningococcal meningitis outbreak in sub-Saharan Africa, which was linked to dust storms during dry seasons. Other outbreaks have been reportedly linked to dust events including Mycoplasma pneumonia and tuberculosis. Another instance of bioaerosol-spread health issues {{was an increase in}} human respiratory problems for Caribbean-region residents that may have been caused by traces of heavy metals, microorganism bioaerosols, and pesticides transported via dust clouds passing over the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} {{the risk of}} the radioactive material being released, the fuel is typically stored in individual modular units with their own heat shielding. They are surrounded by a layer of iridium metal and encased in high-strength graphite blocks. These two materials are corrosion and heat-resistant. Surrounding the graphite blocks is an aeroshell, designed to protect the entire assembly against the heat of reentering the Earth's atmosphere. The plutonium fuel is also stored in a ceramic form that is heat-resistant, minimising the risk of vaporization and <b>aerosolization.</b> The ceramic is also highly insoluble.|$|E
50|$|Another {{potential}} hazard is the <b>aerosolization</b> of hazardous samples during centrifugation. To prevent {{contamination of the}} laboratory, rotor lids with special aerosol-tight gaskets are available. The rotor can be loaded with the samples within a hood and the rotor lid fixed on the rotor. Afterwards, the aerosol-tight system of rotor and lid is transferred to the centrifuge. The rotor can then be fixed within the centrifuge without opening the lid. After the run, the entire rotor assembly, including the lid, {{is removed from the}} centrifuge to the hood for further steps, maintaining the samples within a closed system.|$|E
50|$|If the {{bleeding}} is too copious, the chemical cautery {{may not be}} effective, as the flowing blood can wash away the chemical before it can react with the tissue. It can also be accidentally spread to undesirable locations where it can cause skin staining and tissue burns. This is especially important, as it is often used in the nose where accidental <b>aerosolization</b> can occur, splattering the clinician or {{other parts of the}} patient and causing unintentional burns. Accidental application to unintended tissue is treated with copious water irrigation, and saline solution will inactivate the chemical reaction.|$|E
50|$|Various {{laboratory}} {{systems have}} been developed to test dustiness of fine powders. A European standard on dustiness testing has been established by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) since April 2006. This standard is especially related to human exposure in workplace (EN 15051). It describes two methods: the rotating drum system and continuous drop system. Recently, an aerosol generation system based on laboratory funnel (resembling a fluidized bed) has been developed, which has the potential to become an alternative or supplementary method to the existing systems in dustiness testing. Its performance was compared to other three <b>aerosolization</b> systems using the same test materials.|$|E
50|$|Route 1: The {{traditional}} <b>aerosolization</b> reaction utilizes curium metal as {{the starting}} material. While curium metal has been discovered to naturally exist as a mixture of 87.4% 244Cm, 8.4% 243Cm, 3.9% other curium isotopes, and ~0.3% of the daughter nuclide, plutonium, in most aerosolized syntheses of curium(III) oxide, curium metal is purified through solvent extraction of curium nitrate and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid in toluene to remove the plutonium. NH3OH is then added to the purified curium nitrate, and the resulting precipitate is collected and rinsed with deionized water. The precipitate (Cm2O3) is resuspended in solvent and aerosolized {{with some sort of}} high output aerosol generator (ex: Lovelace nebulizer).|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} that facilitates transfer is unknown, however, {{it is believed}} that viruses with a rapid mutation rate are able to overcome host-specific immunological defenses. This can occur between species that have high contact rates. It can also occur between species with low contact rates but usually through an intermediary species. Bats, for example, are mammals and can directly transfer rabies to humans through bite and also through <b>aerosolization</b> of bat saliva and urine which are then absorbed by human mucous membranes in the nose, mouth and eyes. A host shifting event is defined as a strain that was previously zoonotic and now circulates exclusively among humans.|$|E
50|$|After the aerosol is inhaled, it is exhaled. Emissions from {{electronic}} cigarettes are not comparable to environmental pollution or cigarette smoke as their nature and chemical composition are completely different The particles are larger, with the mean size being 600 nm in inhaled aerosol and 300 nm in exhaled vapor. Bystanders {{are exposed to}} these particles from exhaled e-cigarette vapor. There is a concern {{that some of the}} mainstream vapor exhaled by e-cigarette users can be inhaled by bystanders, particularly indoors, and have significant adverse effects. Since e-cigarettes involve an <b>aerosolization</b> process, it is suggested that no meaningful amounts of carbon monoxide are emitted. Thus, cardiocirculatory effects caused by carbon monoxide are not likely. E-cigarette use by a parent might lead to inadvertent health risks to offspring. E-cigarettes pose many safety concerns to children. For example, indoor surfaces can accumulate nicotine where e-cigarettes were used, which may be inhaled by children, particularly youngsters, long after they were used.|$|E
