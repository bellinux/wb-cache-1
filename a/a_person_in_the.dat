5|$|On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the {{stern-wheeler}} ferry SS Victoria capsized in the Thames River {{close to}} Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers {{drowned in the}} shallow river, {{making it one of}} the worst disasters in London's history, and is now dubbed 'The Victoria Day Disaster'. At the time, London's population was relativity low, therefore it was hard to find <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.|$|E

5|$|The writers {{had wanted}} an episode where Burns becomes {{bankrupt}} and shows what Burns {{would be like}} as <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world. The idea with the recycling plant was that Burns {{did not have any}} sort of evil plan, he just could not help being himself. Burns really was trying to change and this was reflected in the end when he tried to give Lisa her share of the profits, with Lisa refusing. Burns was drawn without his trademark scowl for this episode. The staff joked about this being a suitable series finale, due to the episode ending with Homer suffering from another heart attack after Lisa tells Homer what 10% of Burns' $120,000,000 check really is.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative is death. For example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} and gusty winds destroyed 204 houses along the southeast Texas coastline, {{most of which}} occurred in Matagorda County. In addition, the winds damaged 1,407 homes, with 144 of them being severely damaged. The wind also affected 147 businesses, of which 64 were either destroyed or severely damaged. Strong winds downed numerous power lines, leaving around 74,000 residents without power in the immediate aftermath. Overall, Claudette caused $180million (2003USD, $ USD) in damage in Texas and one death from a fallen tree during the storm. Also, the storm was indirectly responsible for a death when a tree fell on <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of the storm.|$|E

5|$|According to the Malayalam Bhagavata Purana, Krishna got {{the name}} Keshava as he slew Keshi. Krishna is {{referred}} to as slayer of Keshi twice in the Bhagavata Gita by Arjuna - Keshava (1.30) and Keshi-nisudana (18.1). In the first chapter (1.30), addressing Krishna as slayer of Keshi, Arjuna expresses his doubts about war, at the same time, finds Krishna capable of destroying them. Here, Keshi represents false pride and the reference as slayer of Keshi by Arjuna expresses his humility. Keshi as a mad horse who created havoc in Gokula - also represents the wild horse of doubts who run in the mind of <b>a</b> <b>person.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last chapter (18.1), Arjuna addresses Krishna as Maha-baho ("mighty-armed") paired with the slayer of Keshi epithet, reminding the reader how Krishna killed Keshi with his arms alone. The Vishnu sahasranama ("The Thousand names of Vishnu") calls Krishna as Keshava (Names 23, 648) and Keshitha (649) - the slayer of Keshi. The fourth century play Mudrarakshasa also interprets the epithet Keshava as the slayer of Keshi. Keshighat is a major bathing ghat along the river Yamuna in Vrindavan, where Krishna is believed to have overpowered Keshi.|$|E
5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

25|$|Cohort studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E

25|$|Consider {{the case}} of an {{observer}} and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.|$|E

25|$|Because Latter Day Saints {{believe that}} priesthood {{authority}} and keys may be granted only by one who holds that authority or keys, {{they believe it}} is important that a person trace their priesthood through a line of succession from <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible who was known to hold that authority or keys. Moreover, Latter Day Saints believe that the priesthood authority was absent from the earth during the Great Apostasy, and that priesthood had to be restored through Joseph Smith. Catholic and Orthodox Christians do not believe that such a complete apostasy ever took place when defending the validity of their priesthoods, and these churches do not recognize the priesthood exercised by Latter Day Saints.|$|E
25|$|During {{the siege}} of 1941 – 1944, the only ways to supply the city and suburbs, {{inhabited}} by several millions, were by aircraft or by cars crossing the frozen Lake Ladoga. The German military systematically shelled this route, called the Road of Life, so thousands of cars with people and food supplies had sank in the lake. The situation in the city was especially horrible {{in the winter of}} 1941 – 1942. The German bombing raids destroyed most of the food reserves. Daily food ration was cut in October to 400grams of bread for a worker and 200grams for a woman or child. On 20 November 1941, the rations were reduced to 250 and 125grams respectively. Those grams of bread were the bulk of a daily meal for <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. The water supply was destroyed. The situation further worsened in winter due to lack of heating fuel. In December 1941 alone some 53,000 people in Leningrad died of starvation, many corpses were scattered in the streets all over the city.|$|E
