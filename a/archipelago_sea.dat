25|$|A pojama or pojema (also pojanmaa) was {{a type of}} warship {{built for}} the Swedish {{archipelago}} fleet in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

25|$|In August 1914 Russia {{joined the}} First World War and {{navigating}} in the Baltic Sea became dangerous due to naval mines and German U-boats. The Finnish icebreakers were {{placed under the}} command of the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy and given the task of assisting naval ships and troop transportations in the Gulf of Finland. Murtaja was stationed with Sampo in the southern parts of the <b>Archipelago</b> <b>Sea</b> and between Turku and Mariehamn.

25|$|The Finnish Civil War {{expanded}} to Åland on 10 February, as {{a squad of}} 460 White Guard members, led by the captain Johan Fabritius, from the Vakka-Suomi region landed the islands. The group had fled three days earlier {{from the town of}} Uusikaupunki and crossed the ice of the <b>Archipelago</b> <b>Sea.</b> After reaching Åland, the Whites had some minor clashes with the Russians. On 14 February, they took the Prästö telegraph station in Sund, capturing 20 Russian soldiers. The Russians, however, had not much interest in resistance, they were mostly waiting for returning home.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 1926 Jääkarhu {{was ready}} for first sea trials in the North Sea. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the {{delivery}} of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 {{had turned out to}} be very severe. Despite the best efforts of existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of Utö at the edge of the <b>Archipelago</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the Continuation War {{started in}} June 1941, the {{state-owned}} icebreakers were again armed and {{assigned to the}} icebreaker flotilla. After spending the summer months guarding fairways in the <b>Archipelago</b> <b>Sea,</b> icebreakers Tarmo and Jääkarhu participated in Operation Nordwind together with Finnish and German naval ships on 13 September 1941. The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal – it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet – but when the ships turned back, paravanes dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen, the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.|$|E

25|$|Germany invaded on 22 June, but {{not from}} Finland. German minelayers hiding in the <b>Archipelago</b> <b>Sea</b> laid two large minefields across the Gulf of Finland in the late hours of 21 June.

In {{the early hours of}} 22 June, Finnish forces launched Operation Kilpapurjehdus, which aimed to deploy troops to the demilitarized Åland Islands. An international treaty on the status of the islands called for Finland to defend them in case of the threat of an attack. However, the operation was coordinated with the German invasion, and the personnel of the Soviet consulate there were arrested. According to Finnish historian Mauno Jokipii, Finland knew that it had violated international protocol.|$|E
