5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music <b>about</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> His music {{frequently}} reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1296 {{marked the}} arrival at Angkor of the Chinese diplomat Zhou Daguan. Zhou's one-year sojourn in the Khmer capital {{during the reign}} of King Indravarman III is {{historically}} significant, because he penned a still-surviving account, The Customs of Cambodia, of approximately 40 pages detailing his observations of Khmer society. Some of the topics he addressed in the account were those of religion, justice, kingship, agriculture, slavery, birds, vegetables, bathing, clothing, tools, draft animals, and commerce. In one passage, he described a royal procession consisting of soldiers, numerous servant women and concubines, ministers and princes, and finally, [...] "the sovereign, standing on an elephant, holding his sacred sword in his hand." [...] Together with the inscriptions that have been found on Angkorian stelae, temples and other monuments, and with the bas-reliefs at the Bayon and Angkor Wat, Zhou's journal is the most important source of information <b>about</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> at Angkor. Filled with vivid anecdotes and sometimes incredulous observations of a civilization that struck Zhou as colorful and exotic, it is an entertaining travel memoir as well.|$|E
