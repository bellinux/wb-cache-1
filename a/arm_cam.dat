5000|$|Replacing the 2.7-litre 'biturbo' V6 {{engine of}} the {{previous}} generation B5 S4, the new B6 S4 powertrain gained an all-aluminium alloy 4.2-litre, 40 valve (five valves per cylinder) V8 engine (parts code prefix: 079.C, identification code: BBK), with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, roller-finger rocker <b>arm</b> <b>cam</b> followers, and included variable inlet camshaft timing. It also utilised a strengthened alloy crankshaft bedplate for the five main bearings, and a two-part baffled oil sump, and a light-alloy variable intake manifold (VIM), containing the fractionally sequentially actuated fuel injectors. This petrol engine, based on the unit from the Audi A8, displaces , and it produces a motive power output of [...] at 7,000 revolutions per minute (rpm), and generates torque of 410 Nm at 3,500 rpm, making it more potent than the RS2 Avant, and nearly as powerful as the B5 RS4. Engine management was {{by way of a}} Bosch Motronic ME 7.1.1 electronic engine control unit (ECU), utilising a Bosch 'E-Gas' drive by wire electronic throttle, and powering eight individual spark coils with longlife quad-electrode Bosch spark plugs. Ignition timing is a mapped direct ignition, with cylinder-selective knock control with the aid of four knock sensors. The exhaust system includes vacuum-operated valves in the twin rear silencers (mufflers), finished with chrome plated tail-pipes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} professional designations on apartment rent. The real estate market is characterized by information asymmetries between landlords and tenants. Information may be transferred by actions of landlords such as the holding of professional designations. This {{may serve as a}} signal to potential renters of the true quality of service provided by the property management. The data consist of apartment complexes managed by professional management companies. The degree of professionalization is measured by the extent to which managers hold professional designations such as the CPM, <b>ARM,</b> or <b>CAM.</b> The results of the empirical model show that the holding of designations has a positive effect on monthly rent. ...|$|R
50|$|As {{popularity}} and marketing {{value of the}} VTEC system grew, Honda applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefitted from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center rocker <b>arm</b> and <b>cam</b> lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust rocker arms, leaving no room for the VTEC rocker arm. Additionally, the center lobe on the camshaft cannot be utilized by both the intake and the exhaust, limiting the VTEC feature to one side.|$|R

5000|$|There are two rare {{variants}} {{that use}} the roller cam principle. For locations where centre-pull is inappropriate, the side-pull [...] "toggle cam brake" [...] was developed. [...] Also a first-class cantilever, it uses a single-sided sliding cam (the toggle) against one arm that is attached by {{a link to the}} other <b>arm.</b> As the <b>cam</b> presses against the follower, the force is also transmitted to the other arm via the link. And specifically for suspension forks where the housing must terminate at the brake frame, the side-pull [...] "sabre cam brake" [...] was developed. In the sabre cam design, the cable end is fixed and the housing moves the single-sided cam.|$|R
5000|$|The SRT-4 {{performance}} variant utilized a 2.4L Turbo. The turbocharged EDV/EDT {{is similar}} to the regular EDZ. Output is [...] SAE (172 kW) at 5300 rpm with 260 lb·ft (339 N·m) of torque at 2200-4400 rpm. This engine, code A855, has a cast iron partially open deck block and split crankcase. It uses an 8.1:1 compression ratio with Mahle cast eutectic aluminum alloy pistons, forged connecting rods with cracked caps and threaded-in 9 mm rod bolts, and a cast high-hardness steel crankshaft. The cylinder head is cast aluminum, with the cylinder heads being a 48-degree pent-roof design with a partial cloverleaf between the intake valves. The valves are actuated by hydraulically adjusted rocker <b>arms</b> with roller <b>cam</b> followers.|$|R

The tool is mounted in a spindle within the tool holder for rotation about its centerline and the tool holder is pivotably mounted for angular movement about an axis which intersects that centerline. A follower <b>arm</b> of a <b>cam</b> follower secured to the spindle cooperates with a specially shaped cam to provide rotation of the tool during the angular movement of the tool holder during the grinding cycle, by an amount determined by the cam profile. In this way {{the surface of the}} cutting edge in contact with the grinding wheel is maintained at the same height on the grinding wheel throughout the angular movement of the tool holder during the grinding cycle...|$|R
40|$|Much resarch on {{the dynamic}} {{response}} of driven valve systems of internal combustion engines has been reported. However, the analytical model {{proposed in the}} previous reports constructed {{under the assumption that}} the valve did not separate from the rocker <b>arm</b> during the <b>cam</b> rotation. This model is applicable to the system with small rigidities. Recently, to have stable motion in high speed engines, the rigidity of the valve system increases, so that the previous model cannot be applied to the engines. This paper proposes a method for obtaining the jump and bounce phenomena of the valve system with large rigidities by considering the set force of the valve spring which gives large effects on the valve response. Numerical calculations have been carried out for one of the recest engines, and the experimental tests also have been performed to verify the present analysis...|$|R
50|$|Early {{experiments}} using rockets {{to boost}} gliders {{into the air}} were conducted in Germany in the 1920s (Lippisch Ente), and later both the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe introduced such systems in World War II. The British system used fairly large solid fuel rockets to shoot planes (typically the Hawker Hurricane) off a small ramp fitted to the fronts of merchant ships, known in service as Catapult <b>armed</b> merchantmen (or <b>CAM</b> Ships), {{in order to provide}} some cover against German maritime patrol planes. After firing, the rocket was released {{from the back of the}} plane to fall into the water and sink. The task done, the pilot would fly to friendly territory if possible or parachute from the plane, hopefully to be picked up by one of the escort vessels. Over two years the system was only employed nine times to attack German aircraft with eight kills recorded for the loss of a single pilot.|$|R

Since the cam controls the rate of closure, the clamping force can be made non-linear with the pull. And since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage, maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes. They are known for being strong and controllable. On the downside, they require some skill to set up and can complicate wheel changes. And they require maintenance: like U-brakes, as the pad wears it strikes the rim higher; unless re-adjusted it can eventually contact the tyre's sidewall.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{components of a}} ball thrust bearing, constant-velocity universal joint, locker <b>arm</b> of a <b>cam</b> driving a cylinder valve and a ball-type pressure-regulating valve, involve {{the elements of a}} sphere and an anvil. These are subjected to impact load. In this paper, we suppose a model with the simplest form of only a sphere and an anvil for these complex components. The sphere and anvil are in contact with each other and rest along the straight line joining their centers. When the free-side end of the anvil undergoes the normal collinear impact by travelling around the bar, the impact load transmitted into the sphere adjacent to the anvil is theoretically analyzed by a motion equation and Hertz's contact theory. It is important to find the particle velocity evoked by the arrival of a stress wave {{at the end of the}} anvil which is a point contact with the sphere. This particle speed is an initial velocity as the anvil transmits the load into the sphere. The validity of theoretical analysis is confirmed by comparison with an experiment under the same conditions...|$|R
50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring <b>arm</b> against the <b>cam</b> exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|R
40|$|Vestibular-driven motor {{responses}} have short latency and {{are largely}} controlled through automatic processes. Here we examined if the Compensatory <b>Arm</b> Movements (<b>CAM)</b> that allow subjects {{to keep the}} hand stationary in space during body motion have the same characteristics and therefore, if they {{belong to the same}} class of movements. If so, the CAM must fulfil specific criterions. The CAM must results from muscular activity. Indeed, as the arm’s inertia tends to stabilize the hand in space during body motion, the CAM could result from passive forces. We recorded EMG activity while subjects (Ss) had to keep the hand fixed in space during 35 ° body rotations in darkness. Marked EMG bursts were found in the Pectoralis major during clockwise (CW) rotations and in the posterior Deltoïdeus during counterclockwise (CCW) rotations. The swiftness of the CAM was assessed computing EMG reaction time (RT). This RT was compared with the RT measured when the arm movement responded to a visual stimulation. Here, the Ss tracked with the unseen finger a visual target that moved either CW or CCW. RT was shorter when the arm movement was a response to a body rotation than when it was a response to a visual stimulus (162 vs. 327 ms, P < 0. 05). The automatic character of the CAM was assessed testing the effect of providing Ss with information about the required direction of the impending CAM. Before the trials, the Ss were informed of the direction of the arm movements to keep the hand stationary in space during rotations or to track the visual target with the finger (task that largely depends on cognitive processes). In 14 of the trials, false information about the required arm direction was given. In 83 of the catch trials where Ss tracked the visual target, EMG bursts first appeared in the muscles permitting arm motion in the direction provided by the false precueing, i. e. in the opposite direction to the actual target motion. For the CAM, only 10 of the catch trials affected the EMG response. We conclude that the CAM are essentially based on sensorimotor mechanisms, with negligible cognitive processes...|$|R
40|$|The Z- 2 Prototype Planetary Extravehicular Space Suit Assembly is a {{continuation}} of NASA's Z series of spacesuits. The Z- 2 is another step in NASA's technology development roadmap leading to human exploration of the Martian surface. The suit was designed for maximum mobility at 8. 3 psid, reduced mass, and to have high fidelity life support interfaces. As Z- 2 will be man-tested at full vacuum in NASA JSC's Chamber B, it was manufactured as Class II, making it the most flight-like planetary walking suit produced to date. The Z- 2 suit architecture is an evolution of previous EVA suits, namely the ISS EMU, Mark III, Rear Entry I-Suit and Z- 1 spacesuits. The suit is a hybrid hard and soft multi-bearing, rear entry spacesuit. The hard upper torso (HUT) is an all-composite structure and includes a 2 -bearing rolling convolute shoulder with Vernier sizing mechanism, removable suit port interface plate (SIP), elliptical hemispherical helmet and self-don/doff shoulder harness. The hatch is a hybrid aluminum and composite construction with Apollo style gas connectors, custom water pass-thru, removable hatch cage and interfaces to primary and auxiliary life support feed water bags. The suit includes Z- 1 style lower <b>arms</b> with <b>cam</b> brackets for Vernier sizing and government furnished equipment (GFE) Phase VI gloves. The lower torso includes a telescopic waist sizing system, waist bearing, rolling convolute waist joint, hard brief, 2 bearing soft hip thigh, Z- 1 style legs with ISS EMU style cam brackets for sizing, and conformal walking boots with ankle bearings. The Z- 2 Requirements Verification Plan includes the verification of more than 200 individual requirements. The verification methods include test, analysis, inspection, demonstration or a combination of methods. Examples of unmanned requirements include suit leakage, proof pressure testing, operational life, mass, isometric man-loads, sizing adjustment ranges, internal and external interfaces such as in-suit drink bag, partial pressure relief valve, purge valve, donning stand and ISS Body Restraint Tether (BRT). Examples of manned requirements include verification of anthropometric range, suit self-don/doff, secondary suit exit method, donning stand self-ingress/egress and manned mobility covering eight functional tasks. The eight functional tasks include kneeling with object pick-up, standing toe touch, cross-body reach, walking, reach to the SIP and helmet visor. This paper will provide an overview of the Z- 2 design. Z- 2 requirements verification testing was performed with NASA at the ILC Houston test facility. This paper will also discuss pre-delivery manned and unmanned test results as well as analysis performed in support of requirements verification...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} prototyping of a low-cost portable mechanical ventilator for use in mass casualty cases and resource-poor environments. The ventilator delivers breaths by compressing a conventional bag-valve mask (BVM) with a pivoting <b>cam</b> <b>arm,</b> {{eliminating the need for}} a human operator for the BVM. An initial prototype was built out of acrylic, measuring 11. 25 x 6. 7 x 8 inches (285 x 170 x 200 mm) and weighing 9 lbs (4. 1 kg). It is driven by a stepper motor powered by a 14. 8 VDC battery and features an adjustable tidal volume of up to 900 mL, adjustable breaths per minute (bpm) of 5 - 30, and inhalation to exhalation time ratio (i:e ratio) options of 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and 1 : 4. Tidal volume, breaths per minute and i:e ratio are set via user-friendly knobs, and the settings are displayed on an LCD screen. The prototype also features an assist-control mode and an alarm to indicate over-pressurization of the system. Future iterations of the device will be fully calibrated to medical standards and include all desired ventilator features. Future iterations will be further optimised for low power-consumption and will be designed for manufacture and assembly. With a prototyping cost of only $ 420, the bulk-manufacturing price for the ventilator is estimated to be less than $ 100. Through this prototype, the strategy of cam-actuated BVM compression is proven to be a viable option to achieve low-cost, low-power portable ventilator technology that provides essential ventilator features {{at a fraction of the}} cost of existing technology.
