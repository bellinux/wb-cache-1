40|$|In the {{agriculture}} industry, <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation is a core issue of plants asexual propagation. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation is far beyond understanding. In present study {{we found that}} target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling {{plays a key role}} in <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation in potato and Arabidopsis. The core components of TOR complex including TOR, RAPTOR, and LST 8 are highly conserved in potato, but the seedlings of potato are insensitive to rapamycin, implying FK 506 Binding Protein 12 KD (FKBP 12) lost the function to bridge the interaction of rapamycin and TOR in potato. To dissect TOR signaling in potato, the rapamycin hypersensitive potato plants (BP 12 -OE) were engineered by introducing yeast FKBP 12 (ScFKBP 12) into potato. We found that rapamycin can significantly attenuate the capability of <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation in BP 12 -OE potatoes. KU 63794 (KU, an active-site TOR inhibitor) combined with rapamycin can more significantly suppress <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation of BP 12 -OE potato than the single treatments, such as KU 63794 or rapamycin, indicating its synergistic inhibitory effects on potato <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation. Furthermore, RNA-seq data showed that many genes associated with auxin signaling pathway were altered when BP 12 -OE potato seedlings were treated with rapamycin + KU, suggesting that TOR may play a major role in <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation via auxin signaling. The auxin receptor mutant tir 1 was sensitive to TOR inhibitors and the double and quadruple mutants including tir 1 afb 2, tir 1 afb 3, and tir 1 afb 1 afb 2 afb 3 displayed more sensitive to asTORis than single mutant tir 1. Consistently, overexpression of AtTIR 1 in Arabidopsis and potato can partially overcome the inhibitory effect of asTORis and promote <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation under asTORis treatments. These observations suggest that TOR signaling regulates <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation by mediating auxin signaling in Arabidopsis and potato...|$|E
30|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation {{can be difficult}} because it is regulated by internal factors, including plant growth regulators such as auxins and cytokinins, {{as well as the}} genetic background (Haissig 1974; Kozlowski 1992; Friend et al. 1994; Howard 1994). However, the role of auxin on <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> is still not well understood. Woody plants, such as grapevine, represent a highly complex system in which endogenous hormone levels, transport, dormancy, storage, and inhibitory compounds influence <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> growth, and each of these are dependent on preconditioning treatments (Andersen 1986; Wilson 1994). Spiegel (1955) argued that much of the inconsistency in <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> research encountered for Vitis tissues was, in part, due to the existence of compounds that inhibit <b>adventitious</b> <b>root</b> formation. Singh et al. (2004) reported that when actived charcoal was added with IBA, there was an increase in rooting percentage. The results obtained in our work for rhizogenesis time were comparable to those reported in many articles, suggesting that this phenomenon requires between 12 and 30  days (Reisch 1986; Bernd et al. 2007; Salami et al. 2005; Diab et al. 2011).|$|E
