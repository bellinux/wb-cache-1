40|$|This study aims at {{determining}} how effective are {{the influences of}} detector sizes, types of gas field, and the changes of operation temperature on detector characteristics of Geiger Muller viewed from threshold voltage, plateau, slope, and the resolving time. The determination of detector characteristics {{was obtained from the}} detector enumeration with diameter variation, types of gas field, and temperature operation changes on Cs- 137 radiation. Data obtained from detector characteristics’ determination were the data count. Geiger Muller detector manufacturing process was started from the preparation of materials, the cathode tube and tube cap manufacture, installation of the detector and <b>anode</b> <b>cap,</b> vacuum tubes, gas fill, detector characteristic test, and data acquisition. The detector was made of stainless steel, the anode of tungsten wire with the length of 100 mm and diameters of 11 mm, 16 mm, 24 mm, and the anode diameter of 0. 08 mm. The gas field used alcohol argon and bromine argon, while for the temperature variation was increased from the temperature of 30 ºC to 70 ºC. Data obtained from the detector test were in the form of counts per minute (cpm) as a function of operating voltage (V) of the detector. From data of the test, it was illustrated the counting-per-minute graph on the detector’s operation voltage, so that the plateau, slope and resolving time of the detector could be determined. Research results obtained showed that the volume of the detector tube was influential on the detector characteristic curve. When the detector tube was varied, the initial voltage also changed. The change of gas field types also affected the detector characteristic curve. If the gas field type used argon gas having low ionization potential, the initial voltage of the detector would be smaller. Meanwhile, the increment of the detector’s temperature affected the detector’s count number and only slightly affected the length of the plateau while for the slope was relatively the same.

They were filled with a pure inert gas such as neon because mixtures made the output temperature-dependent. Their burning voltage was under 200 V, but they needed optical priming (pre-ionizing) by a 2-Watt incandescent lamp prior to ignition by an anode voltage spike in the 5-kV range.|$|R

40|$|A compact A 6 {{relativistic}} magnetron with {{a simple}} mode converter for axial TE_ 11 -mode extraction was recently designed at the University of New Mexico. With the standard A 6 magnetron operating in the -mode {{it is possible to}} implement a simple mode converter to radiate a TE_ 11 -mode axially through a cylindrical waveguide whose radius {{is the same as the}} anode cavity radius. The proposed mode converter implements an <b>anode</b> end <b>cap</b> that electrically opens diametrically opposite cavities that produce an electric field polarization corresponding to that of the of the TE_ 11 -mode in a cylindrical waveguide. The TE_ 11 -mode has a Gaussian-like profile with maximum electric field on axis, and is desirable for applications. In this work an extensive parametric sweep was conducted using the three dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) code MAGIC to optimize the mode converter design. The cathode used is the transparent cathode with a radius chosen to favor -mode operation of the magnetron. The trends observed in simulation have been verified experimentally. Simulations showed magnetron operation in π-mode at 2. 33 GHz, and the output waveguide mode for these operating conditions was verified to be the TE_ 11 -mode. In experiments performed at approximately the same operating magnetic field a single frequency RF signal at 2. 33 GHz was detected. A neon grid used for mode detection confirmed a maximum in the center, which is indicative of the TE_ 11 -mode. The radiated power is in the order of ~ 100 ’s of MW.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of the key parameters that determine the optical and electrical characteristics of inverted top-emitting organic light emitting diodes (OLED). A co-deposition of small molecules in vacuum is used to establish electrically doped films that are applied in n-i-p layered devices. The knowledge about the functionality of each layer and parameter is important to develop efficient strategies to reach outstanding device performances. In the first part, the thin film optics of top-emitting OLEDs are investigated, focusing on light extraction via cavity tuning, external outcoupling layers (capping layer), and the application of microlens films. Optical simulations are performed to determine the layer configuration with the maximum light extraction efficiency for monochrome phosphorescent devices. The peak efficiency is found at 35 %, while varying the thickness of the charge transport layers, the semitransparent <b>anode,</b> and the <b>capping</b> layer simultaneously. Measurements of the spatial light distribution validate, that the capping layer influences the spectral width and the resonance wavelength of the extracted cavity mode, especially for TM polarization. Further, laminated microlens films are applied to benefit from strong microcavity effects in stacked OLEDs by spatial mixing of external and to some extend internal light modes. These findings are used to demonstrate white top-emitting OLEDs on opaque substrates showing power conversion efficiencies up to 30 lm/W and a color rendering index of 93, respectively. In the second part, the charge carrier management of n-i-p layered diodes is investigated as it strongly deviates from that of the p-i-n layered counterparts. The influence of the bottom cathode material and the electron transport layer is found to be negligible in terms of driving voltage, which means that the assumption of an ohmic bottom contact is valid. The hole transport and the charge carrier injection at the anode is much more sensitive to the evaporation sequence, especially when using hole transport materials with a glass transition temperature below 100 °C. As a consequence, thermal annealing of fabricated inverted OLEDs is found to drastically improve the device electronics, resulting in lower driving voltages and an increased internal efficiency. The annealing effect on charge transport comes from a reduced charge accumulation due to an altered film morphology of the transport layers, which is proven for electrons and for holes independently. The thermal treatment can further lead to a device degradation. Finally, the thickness and the material of the blocking layers which usually control the charge confinement inside the OLED are found to influence the recombination much more effectively in inverted OLEDs compared to non-inverted ones...|$|R
