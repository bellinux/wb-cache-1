Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; <b>and</b> <b>decreased</b> colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that were fed prophylactically with bovine whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus.|$|E

5|$|Advantages over {{conventional}} diesel equipment included increased availability, higher speed through curves, <b>and</b> <b>decreased</b> weight {{which caused}} less wear on the tracks. Impressed with their reliability, Amtrak purchased the trainsets and ordered another four trainsets, which entered service in 1975 on the Chicago–Milwaukee and Chicago–Detroit corridors. The purchase {{price for the}} six trainsets was $18 million. Amtrak contemplated ordering an additional 14 trainsets for the partially-electrified Northeast Corridor between Boston and New York City. Doing so would have required a significant rise in fares between the two cities, and the United States Department of Transportation blocked the proposal.|$|E
5|$|After the siege, the Ottomans {{went on to}} take Morea in 1460, and Trebizond in 1461.

5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It {{was found that}} a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites.

Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, <b>and</b> <b>decreased</b> vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Dermabrasion is an {{effective}} therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, <b>and</b> <b>decreased</b> pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor {{with the introduction of}} laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, {{there is no evidence that}} microdermabrasion is {{an effective}} treatment for acne.|$|E

The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, <b>and</b> <b>decreased</b> blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E

In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E

Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking.
