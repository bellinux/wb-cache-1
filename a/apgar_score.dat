25|$|For {{uncomplicated}} births, {{care can}} include suctioning of newborns airway, cord cutting, collection of afterbirth, obtaining an <b>APGAR</b> <b>score,</b> keeping the newborn warm, and monitoring of vital signs such as respiratory rate and effort, pulse, blood pressure(rarely taken on newborns in the pre-hospital setting) oxygen saturation, blood sugar, and EKG monitoring.|$|E
25|$|A newborn's {{shoulders}} and hips are wide, the abdomen protrudes slightly, and {{the arms and}} legs are relatively long {{with respect to the}} rest of their body. In first world nations, the average total body length of newborns are , although premature newborns may be much smaller. The <b>Apgar</b> <b>score</b> is a measure of a newborn's transition from the uterus during the first minutes after birth.|$|E
25|$|At birth, {{the baby}} {{receives}} an <b>Apgar</b> <b>score</b> at, at the least, {{one minute and}} five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas—each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The midwife checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The midwife ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The midwife performs these checks {{as close to the}} mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature—and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Aim of {{the study}} is to analyze effect of {{delivery}} mode on outcome of the twins. Materials and Methods: Study consisted of 124 twin gestations, delivered at 25 - 41 weeks of gestation. Operative deliveries were excluded except breech extraction. Patients given a trial of vaginal delivery were included. Twins were delivered by abdominal route if the intertwin delivery time was> 40 minutes, or for the following reasons; cord prolapse, fetal distress, and persistent transverse lie. The main outcome measure was first and fifth minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> of twin A and B. Results: Demographic, obstetrical characteristics and <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> were similar in patients delivered abdominally and vaginally. There was 9. 3 % failed vaginal labor in twin B. Main significant factor influencing <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> of both twin A and twin B was birthweight of < 1500 gr (p< 0. 001). Delivery mode and presentation did not effect <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> significantly in both twin A and twin B. Discussion: Caesarean delivery did not improve fetal outcome in twin gestations, and the only significant factor associated with depressed <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> was found to be birthweight. Delivery mode and presentation were only considered significant in twins with a birthweight of < 1500 gr...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} described {{the impact of}} <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> on later major and minor disabilities.

2500|$|A Cochrane {{review in}} 2013 {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that delayed cord clamping (between one and three minutes after birth) is [...] "likely to be beneficial as long as access to treatment for jaundice requiring phototherapy is available". In this review delayed clamping, as contrasted to early, resulted in no difference in risk of severe maternal postpartum hemorrhage or neonatal mortality, low <b>Apgar</b> <b>score.</b> On the other hand, delayed clamping resulted in an increased birth weight of on average about 100 g, and an increased hemoglobin concentration of on average 1.5 g/dL with half the risk of being iron deficient at three and six months, but an increased risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.|$|E

50|$|All nurses {{working in}} a {{birthing}} centre {{have an important role}} in assessing the newborn immediately after birth. The assessment of the neonate's appearance (colour), pulse (heart rate), grimace (in response to unpleasant stimuli such as bulb suctioning the pharynx), activity (muscle tone and/or movement), and respiratory effort via the <b>APGAR</b> <b>scoring</b> system is essential to guide the baby's care (see Understanding the <b>APGAR</b> <b>scoring</b> system). The nurse is often directly responsible for assigning the <b>APGAR</b> <b>scores</b> at 1 and 5 minutes of life. Each of the five assessment areas is given a score of 0, 1, or 2. The maximum score possible is 10. Scores of 7 or above are considered normal for full-term newborns.

40|$|Abstract: Aim: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether delivery time intervals are related to newborn outcome by evaluating <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> and umbilical cord blood results during elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Materials and Methods: Records of the 203 ASA I or ASA II pregnant women underwent elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia during one-year period were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic properties of the parturients (age, weight, body mass index, gravidity, parity and gestational week) and newborns (birthweight and gender), and duration of surgery were presented. In order to demonstrate any possible relationship, time intervals from completion of spinal anesthesia (SA) to skin incision (SI), uterine incision (UI) and umbilical cord clamping (UCC) and from skin and uterine incisions to UCC, <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores,</b> umbilical artery and vein (UA and UV) blood gas analysis (UA-pH, UA-BE, UA-PO 2, UA-PCO 2, UV-pH, UV-BE, UV-PCO 2 and UV-PO 2) were also documented. Results: There was a significant correlation between delivery time intervals including SA-SI, SA-UI and SA-UCC to UA-pH, UA-BE, UV-pH and UV-BE (p= 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine {{trends in}} preterm births, {{especially}} those less than 33 weeks gestation, occurring in perinatal centres in New South Wales (NSW) from 1992 to 2001. METHODS: Population {{data were obtained}} from the NSW Midwives' Data Collection. Trends in the proportion of births in perinatal centres by gestation and by type of preterm birth (spontaneous or elective), and in <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> and neonatal mortality were determined. RESULTS: The preterm birth rate increased from 6. 1 % in 1992 to 6. 7 % in 2001. Factors contributing to the increase in preterm births were multiple births and elective preterm deliveries. Births less than 33 weeks gestation in perinatal centres increased from 76 % to 83 % and for multiple births from 77 % to 87 %. This coincided with a decrease in 1 -minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> less than 4 but no significant change in 5 -minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> or neonatal mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Progress has been made towards the National Health and Medical Research Council guideline that births less than 33 weeks gestation occur in perinatal centres.

40|$|Introduction. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} complex umbilical cord entanglement primarily around the trunk on pregnancy outcomes. Methods. We studied 6307 pregnant women with singleton pregnancies who underwent vaginal delivery of an infant at ≥ 37 weeks of gestation. Cases were classified into no cord, nuchal cord, and body cord groups and defined as cases without umbilical cord entanglement, one or more loops of the umbilical cord around the neck only, and umbilical cord around the trunk only, respectively. Pregnancy outcomes were compared among these three groups. Results. The no cord, nuchal cord, and body cord group included 4733, 1451, and 123 pregnancies, respectively. Although delivery mode was not significantly different among the three groups, 1 -minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> < 7 and umbilical artery (UA) pH < 7. 10 were significantly {{more common in the}} umbilical cord entanglement groups than in the no cord group. In particular, the frequency of 5 -minute <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> < 7 was significantly higher (P= 0. 004), whereas that of UA pH < 7. 10 tended to be higher (P= 0. 057) in the body cord group than in the nuchal cord group.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} fetal disorders using detailed quantitative {{values from}} the actocardiogram (ACG) involving simultaneous tracing of ultrasonic Doppler fetal movement bursts and fetal heart rate (FHR). Methods: Duration of FHR accelerations and fetal movement bursts were measured manually in 20 common fetal disorders. The {{severity of the}} fetal disorder was estimated using the FHR acceleration duration to movement burst ratio (A/B ratio) and 10 – 0 clinical severity ranks derived from the A/B ratio. The correlation of the A/B ratio and 1 and 5  min <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores,</b> as well as numerically expressed long-term outcomes were studied. Results: A/B ratios were significantly correlated with the 1 and 5  min <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> and the numerically evaluated long-term outcomes. Controversial cases of FHR pattern were more easily understood using the A/B ratio. The 10 – 0 severity derived from the A/B ratio was useful in clinical fetal studies. Conclusion: Common fetal disorders were evaluated quantitatively and in more detail using the A/B ratio from the actocardiogram than when using common binary good or bad evaluation. The A/B ratio was useful in outcome estimation, where the prognostic capability of the A/B ratio was confirmed by significant correlation with 1 and 5  min <b>Apgar</b> <b>scores</b> and long-term outcomes of fetal disorders.
