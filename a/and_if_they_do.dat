25|$|The Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is {{a system}} whereby demerit points {{will be added to}} the driver's record. The system is meant to deter drivers from {{infringing}} the rules-of-the-road <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> suspend their driving licence for a period of time. This system requires offenders to retest and pass the driving test again from the beginning.|$|E

Usually, oral combined contraceptive or progesterone only pills may be taken for a few months, but for longer-term treatment the alternatives of injected Depo Provera or the more recent progesterone releasing IntraUterine System (IUS) may be used. Fibroids may respond to hormonal treatment, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not, then surgical removal may be required.|$|E

25|$|An {{essential}} {{question of}} practical reason for Hume was {{whether or not}} standards or principles exist (<b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> what they are) for practical reason, that are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people’s intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist, denying the possibility for practical reason as a principle to exist, although other philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah Millgram claim that Hume {{is not so much}} of an anti-rationalist as he is just a skeptic of practical reason.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco. This causes confounding factors, where questions arise {{as to whether the}} tobacco, the cannabis, or both that have caused a cancer. Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people who smoke cannabis into studies. Because cannabis is an illegal drug in many countries, people may be reluctant to take part in research, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> agree to take part, they may not say how much cannabis they actually smoke.|$|E
25|$|However, some of {{the species}} of {{mosquitoes}} that are adapted to breeding in phytotelmata are dangerous disease vectors. In nature, they might occupy anything from a hollow tree trunk to a cupped leaf. Such species typically take readily to breeding in artificial water containers. Such casual puddles are important breeding places for {{some of the}} most serious disease vectors, such as species of Aedes that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Some with such breeding habits are disproportionately important vectors because they are well-placed to pick up pathogens from humans and pass them on. In contrast, no matter how voracious, mosquitoes that breed and feed mainly in remote wetlands and salt marshes may well remain uninfected, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> happen to become infected with a relevant pathogen, might seldom encounter humans to infect, in turn.|$|E

25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision {{does not apply to}} religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices across the country that are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

[...] If the amount of frozen precipitation in the accumulation zone exceeds the quantity of glacial ice lost due to melting or in the ablation zone a glacier will advance; if the accumulation is less than the ablation, the glacier will retreat. [...] Glaciers in retreat will have negative mass balances, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not find an equilibrium between accumulation and ablation, will eventually disappear.|$|E

500|$|Practical - Full {{contact system}} where {{the core of}} the combat is {{completely}} dependent on what your character can do, not what your character has the stats to do. These types of LARPs exist with boffer weapons, but they are more commonly seen with real weapons and armor. This system follows variations of the Limb Loss System with the primary difference being realism. In some practical LARPs actions such as kicking another player's shield is authorize, as seen in the LARP Dagohir. Practical systems that involve real weapons and armor put emphasis on realism, specifically historic realism which is what the [...] strives to achieve. The SCA is techinally an educational group and not a LARP, however, they are the most widely known group that utilizes the Practical system of combat. On the RP side of things, Practical LARPs differ from Limb Loss LARPs because of the interaction that takes place between combat. Generally, but not always, Practical LARPs do not role play in between fights <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> they usually take on the role of a historical figure rather than a created character.|$|E

2500|$|Dolomedes spiders {{are covered}} all over in short, velvety hairs which are unwettable (hydrophobic). [...] This {{allows them to}} use surface tension to stand or run on the water, like pond skaters. [...] They can also climb beneath the water, and then air becomes trapped in the body hairs and forms a thin film over the whole {{surface of the body}} and legs, giving them the {{appearance}} of fine polished silver. [...] Like other spiders, Dolomedes breathe with book lungs beneath their abdomens, and these open into the air film, allowing the spiders to breathe while submerged. [...] The trapped air makes them very buoyant <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not hold onto a rock or a plant stem they float to the surface where they pop onto the surface film, completely dry.|$|E
2500|$|Pavel Annenkov {{considered}} Ioann and Fyodor as [...] "loosely based upon" [...] characters, being {{perfectly fine}} {{but only in}} representing their era, not their own historical selves.
