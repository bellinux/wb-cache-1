2500|$|Formerly {{operated}} by British Airways, <b>Airmiles</b> {{was the most}} popular flight-related loyalty program in the UK, with 2.2. million members in 2011. Members could collect <b>Airmiles</b> [...] each time they flew with British Airways or affiliated airlines, both within the International Airlines Group and the Oneworld Alliance; points could then be redeemed for flights, and was popular with both commercial and business customers. Airmiles-based programs frequently allow members to also collect points by spending on affiliated cards, such as British Airways Premium Plus credit card. A re-brand of the program in 2011 from <b>Airmiles</b> to Avios caused controversy as members were now required to pay taxes and fees on flights they used for redemption. The scheme became more flexible and included redemption opportunities such as car hire and days out, broadening the ways in which members can spend their points.|$|R

5000|$|Hypermobile {{travelers}} are [...] "highly mobile individuals" [...] who take [...] "frequent trips, often over great distances." [...] They [...] "account {{for a large}} share of the overall kilometres travelled, especially by air." [...] These people contribute significantly to the overall amount of <b>airmiles</b> flown within a given society. [...] Although concerns over hypermobility apply to several modes of transport, the environmental impact of aviation and especially its greenhouse gas emissions have brought particular focus on flying. Among the reasons for this focus is that these emissions, because they are made at high altitude, have a climate impact that is leveraged by a factor commonly estimated to be 2.7 higher than the same emissions if made at ground-level.|$|R
