50|$|Conner {{arrived in}} Pearl Harbor {{from the east}} coast 19 September 1943, and joined the task force for the raid on Wake Island of 5 and 6 October. She put to sea again from Pearl Harbor 10 November for the {{invasion}} of the Gilberts, during which she screened aircraft carriers, and protected <b>assault</b> <b>shipping</b> as it unloaded. She bombarded Nauru Island on 8 December, and sailed to Efate, New Hebrides, from which she screened the air strikes on Kavieng, New Ireland, arriving at Funafuti 21 January 1944 to join the huge Fast Carrier Task Force (then the 5th Fleet's TF 58).|$|E
50|$|Champion arrived off Iwo Jima on 16 February 1945, as the {{preliminary}} three-day bombardment {{of the island}} began. Except for the period 21 February to 4 March, when she sailed escorting unloaded <b>assault</b> <b>shipping</b> to Saipan, from which she returned with resupply echelons, Champion remained off Iwo Jima until 7 March. After provisioning and fueling at Ulithi, she sailed for Kerama Retto and Okinawa. In these dangerous waters she conducted minesweeping operations, and served in screens, from 24 March to 19 June, aside from a convoy escort voyage to Saipan from 25 April to 19 May.|$|E

Along with all the Navy's other amphibious <b>assault</b> <b>shipping,</b> Sir Percivale went south to {{participate}} in the recapture of the Falkland Islands. At this time, all the RFA were manned by Hong Kong Chinese civilian crew. She pioneered the supply runs to Teal Inlet and was the first British ship to re-enter Stanley Harbour. Unlike the Sir Galahad, Sir Tristram and Sir Lancelot, the ship emerged unscathed from the conflict.|$|E

She sailed from Iwo Jima 1 March for Ulithi {{to prepare for}} the invasion of Okinawa, where she arrived 25 March to sweep mines. On the 27th she was struck a glancing blow by a kamikaze which killed three of her crew and wounded two. Dorsey remained on duty, screening <b>assault</b> <b>shipping</b> during the landings of 1 April and patrolling until the 4th when she departed for Pearl Harbor and battle damage repairs.|$|E

She cleared Hollandia 30 December, and at Biak joined the escort of a convoy bound with reinforcements and supplies for newly invaded Lingayen Gulf. Arriving 12 January 1945, Eugene E.

50|$|The {{destroyer}} {{returned to}} Guadalcanal 17 March 1944, and after escorting troop transports to Cape Torokina, prepared at Milne Bay for the Hollandia operation, {{during which she}} screened carriers giving air support to the landings at Aitape and Hollandia through April. Through much of May, she trained in the New Hebrides and Russell Islands, and on 8 June arrived at Kwajalein to stage for the Marianas operation. From 12 June, when she sortied with the carriers, until 4 August, {{when she returned to}} Eniwetok, she was almost constantly at sea to screen the carriers as they launched preinvasion air strikes, covered the landings, won a most significant victory in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and furnished antisubmarine and air protection to <b>assault</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Charrette cleared New York 20 September 1943 {{to escort}} the {{aircraft}} carrier [...] to Pacific service. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 9 October, Charrette took part in training exercises until 10 November, when she put to sea with Task Force 50 (TF 50), for air raids on Japanese bases in the Marshalls. These strikes neutralized enemy air opposition to the landings at Makin and on Tarawa which followed. On 26 November, Charrette joined the screen of the task group assigned to air-cover operations over Makin and Tarawa themselves, providing protection to the <b>assault</b> <b>shipping</b> {{and support for the}} Marines ashore. Twelve days later, the destroyer screened battleships in a pounding bombardment on Nauru, then rejoined {{the aircraft carrier}}s sailing on to Efate. From this base Charrette sailed on 21 December to screen the carriers as they launched strikes against Kavieng, New Ireland, during the three days preceding the assault on Cape Gloucester 26 December. Continuing north, the group arrived at Funafuti 21 January 1944 to prepare for the operations against the Marshall Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Columbia sortied from Port Purvis on 6 September {{with the}} {{covering}} {{force for the}} landings in the Palaus, and remained off Peleliu to provide gunfire support to forces ashore and protection to <b>assault</b> <b>shipping</b> until her return to Manus on 28 September. She sailed on 6 October, guarding the force which was to seize Dinagat and other islands {{at the entrance of}} Leyte Gulf which must be neutralized before the vast Leyte invasion fleet could enter the Gulf. These islands were taken on 17 October, and Columbia sailed on to give gunfire cover to the main landings three days later. But as the landings proceeded, the Japanese fleet sailed south to give battle, and on the night of 24 October, its southern force entered Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. Attacks by motor torpedo boats and destroyers on the Japanese force opened this phase of the decisive battle for Leyte Gulf. Columbia with other cruisers had joined the old battleships and lay in wait. In a classical maneuver, the American ships [...] "crossed the T" [...] of the Japanese column, and opened heavy gunfire which sank the battleship , and forced the heavily damaged cruiser [...] and other units to retire. Toward dawn, Columbia sped to deliver the final blows which sank destroyer , crippled in earlier attacks.|$|E
