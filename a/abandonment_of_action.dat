Tell me definitely which {{one of these two}} is superior.The Holy One said—Both <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> and application to actions lead to emancipation.

40|$|In Alderwood Associates v. Washington Environmental Council, the Washington Supreme Court {{reversed}} {{a temporary}} restraining order forbidding the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s solicitation or demonstration on plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s privately owned shopping mall. Although there was no majority opinion because the court split four-one-four, the result of the several opinions is that the Washington constitution now bars private as well as state action that interferes with the gathering of initiative signatures on certain private property. However, four justices also concluded that the free speech sections of the Washington constitution restricts private as well as state action. The Alderwood result is desirable, but could have been reached without an <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> the state <b>action</b> requirement. Such an abandonment, although subscribed to by less than a majority, strays from principled constitutional analysis and inhibits further reasoned development of the state constitution...|$|R
40|$|The City of Buffalo faces {{a severe}} {{abandoned}} housing crisis. One component of this immense {{problem is the}} <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> rental housing due to dilapidated conditions. Forcing landlords to keep their properties in good repair will help to reduce <b>abandonment</b> <b>of</b> rental housing. Several mechanisms hold landlords in Buffalo accountable for the poor conditions of their buildings. The warranty of habitability requires landlords to maintain decent, safe, and sanitary housing. However, remedies available to tenants under this legal doctrine, such as rent withholding and repair and deduct, are inadequate and dangerous. The lack of adequate protections for tenants seeking to address the poor conditions in their apartments is a major deterrent to tenant initiation <b>of</b> <b>action...</b>|$|R
