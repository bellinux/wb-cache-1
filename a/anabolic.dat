5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in <b>anabolic</b> reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for <b>anabolic</b> reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are {{insensitive to the}} effects of androgens rarely have acne. An increase in androgen and oily sebum synthesis can be seen during pregnancy. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of <b>anabolic</b> steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements are commonly found to contain illegally added <b>anabolic</b> steroids.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2009, Hardy {{was arrested}} on charges of {{trafficking}} in controlled prescription pills and possession of <b>anabolic</b> steroids, after a search of his house yielded 262 Vicodin prescription pills, 180 Soma prescription pills, 555 milliliters of <b>anabolic</b> steroids, a residual amount of powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Over a year later, the district attorney announced that Hardy would plead guilty to the charges. On September 8, 2011, Hardy was sentenced to ten days in jail, 30 months of probation, and a fine of $100,000. Hardy served his jail sentence from October 3 to 13, 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, before Pakistan {{had started}} playing any {{games in the}} tournament, it was {{revealed}} that two Pakistani players, Mohammad Asif and Shoaib Akhtar had failed a drugs test for the banned <b>anabolic</b> steroid nandrolone. Abdur Rehman and Yasir Arafat were called up to replace them.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, 1995, Adams {{was arrested}} {{at his home in}} Kona, Hawaii, after {{narcotics}} officers searched his home and discovered 500 units of <b>anabolic</b> steroids and several unregistered semi-automatic guns. He was released on $10,275 bail. On October 28, 1995, he was sentenced to five years probation after pleading no-contest to 11 counts of drug and weapons charges.|$|E
5|$|Although often inconspicuous, fungi {{occur in}} every {{environment}} on Earth and play very {{important roles in}} most ecosystems. Along with bacteria, fungi are the major decomposers in most terrestrial (and some aquatic) ecosystems, and therefore {{play a critical role}} in biogeochemical cycles and in many food webs. As decomposers, they play an essential role in nutrient cycling, especially as saprotrophs and symbionts, degrading organic matter to inorganic molecules, which can then re-enter <b>anabolic</b> metabolic pathways in plants or other organisms.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of <b>anabolic</b> steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|Doping {{has played}} a {{significant}} part in the modern history of track and field. State-sponsored doping in East Germany with hormones and <b>anabolic</b> steroids marked the rise of women from the German Democratic Republic {{in track and field}} from the late 1960s to the 1980s. A number of these women, such as Marita Koch, broke world records and were highly successful at international competitions. Some athletes, who were following a doping plan from their teenage years, suffered significant health problems {{as a result of the}} regime. Ben Johnson ran a new world record in the 100metres at the 1988 Seoul Olympics but was later banned for using <b>anabolic</b> steroids. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the BALCO Scandal eventually resulted in the downfall of prominent sprinters such as Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, among others, through their usage of banned substances. Doping problems have also been associated with sprinters such as Tyson Gay, Michael Rogers, and Justin Gatlin, all from the United States. Doping has also affected entire nations, such as Russia, which has been banned from competing at both the Indoor World Championships and the Olympics in 2016. This ban was imposed in 2016 after major allegations of doping and covering up were discovered in 2015.|$|E
5|$|One central {{coenzyme}} is {{adenosine triphosphate}} (ATP), the universal energy currency of cells. This nucleotide {{is used to}} transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions. There {{is only a small}} amount of ATP in cells, but as it is continuously regenerated, the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day. ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism breaks down molecules, and anabolism puts them together. Catabolic reactions generate ATP, and <b>anabolic</b> reactions consume it. It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{suffered}} a setback on offense {{a few days}} prior to the Peach Bowl {{when it was announced}} that offensive tackle Jim Davie was suspended from playing in the game after testing positive for <b>anabolic</b> steroids as part of a nationwide series of random tests conducted by the NCAA. Tech defensive end Morgan Roane was also suspended from playing for reasons not revealed by the university.|$|E
5|$|There are {{intentional}} and unintentional modifications {{concerning the}} clitoris, including female genital mutilation (FGM), sex reassignment surgery, clitoris enlargement and genital piercings. For example, use of <b>anabolic</b> steroids by bodybuilders and other athletes {{can result in}} significant enlargement of the clitoris in concert with other masculinizing effects on their bodies. Abnormal enlargement of the clitoris may also {{be referred to as}} clitoromegaly, but clitoromegaly is more commonly seen as a congenital anomaly of the genitalia.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme {{that acts as a}} hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in <b>anabolic</b> reactions.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian {{weightlifter}} Fabrício Mafra {{lost his}} bronze {{medal in the}} men's 105 kg competition. He tested positive for abnormal levels of testosterone, and Damian Abbiate, the competitor from Argentina, received the medal in his place. Colombian cyclist Libardo Niño Corridor, who won a silver medal in the men's individual road time trial, {{tested positive for the}} banned substance erythropoietin (EPO), and consequently the silver medal went to Matias Medici of Argentina and the bronze medal to Dominique Rollin of Canada. Nicaraguan baseball player Pedro Wilder Rayo Rojas tested positive for the banned <b>anabolic</b> steroid boldenone, and lost his bronze medal from the men's baseball competition, but his teammates kept their medals.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Bonds {{first became}} {{embroiled in a}} scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with {{supplying}} <b>anabolic</b> steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} doping {{case from}} the 2007 Giro involved sprinter Alessandro Petacchi. Petacchi took five stage wins, but after the third of them, he tested non-negative for salbutamol, an asthma medication which Petacchi has a medical exemption to use. Petacchi was obligated as the stage winner to give a urine sample to the doping authorities, {{and it had a}} concentration of 1,352 nanograms per milliliter of salbutamol, above the 1,000 allowed by the medical exemption. Salbutamol has <b>anabolic</b> effects at high concentrations. Team Milram placed Petacchi on immediate provisional suspension following the Giro, which kept him from participating in the Tour de France later that season as he had planned. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) asked the Italian Cycling Federation (FCI) for a one-year ban for Petacchi.|$|E
5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by <b>anabolic</b> reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Track {{and field}} athletes are banned from ingesting or using certain {{substances}} by governing bodies for the sport, {{from the national}} to the international level. The IAAF's constitution incorporates the World Anti-Doping Code among other anti-doping measures. Practices such as blood doping {{and the use of}} <b>anabolic</b> steroids, peptide hormones, stimulants, or diuretics can give athletes a physical competitive advantage in track and field. The use of such substances in track and field is opposed on both ethical and medical grounds. Given that the sport functions by measuring and comparing athletes' performances, performance-enhancing substances create an uneven playing field — athletes who do not use doping substances have a disadvantage over rivals who do. Medically, the use of banned substances may have an adverse effect upon athletes' health. However, some exemptions are made for athletes who take banned substances for therapeutic use, and athletes are not sanctioned for usage in these cases, such as Kim Collins' failed drug test due to asthma medication.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{metabolic}} pathways that are characterized by their ability to either synthesize molecules with the utilization of energy (<b>anabolic</b> pathway) or break down of complex molecules by releasing energy in the process (catabolic pathway). The two pathways complement each other in that the energy released from one is used up by the other. The degradative process of a catabolic pathway provides the energy required to conduct a biosynthesis of an <b>anabolic</b> pathway. In addition to the two distinct metabolic pathways is the amphibolic pathway, which can be either catabolic or <b>anabolic</b> based on the need for or the availability of energy.|$|E

25|$|Fatty acid {{metabolism}} {{consists of}} catabolic processes that generate energy, and <b>anabolic</b> processes that create biologically important molecules (triglycerides, phospholipids, second messengers, local hormones and ketone bodies).|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to catabolic pathways, <b>anabolic</b> pathways require an energy input to construct macromolecules such as polypeptides, nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. The isolated reaction of anabolism is unfavorable {{in a cell}} due to a positive Gibbs Free Energy (+ΔG). Thus, an input of chemical energy through a coupling with an exergonic reaction is necessary. The coupled reaction of the catabolic pathway affects the thermodynamics of the reaction by lowering the overall activation energy of an <b>anabolic</b> pathway and allowing the reaction to take place. Otherwise, an endergonic reaction is non-spontaneous.|$|E
25|$|The {{measurement}} of the dissociation between <b>anabolic</b> and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays. It {{is referred to as}} the myotrophic-androgenic index. In this model, <b>anabolic</b> (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.|$|E
