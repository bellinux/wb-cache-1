5|$|He {{pulled me}} in <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming {{there were two}} Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him {{there was no one}} hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one {{of several}} {{companies}} that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above par value, but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.|$|E

5|$|The Teamsters Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. Teamsters worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by Teamsters, supply warehouses were run by Teamsters, and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by Teamsters. Teamsters Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, {{was by far the}} most dominant labor force on the pipeline project. There were frequent allegations of corruption by Teamsters on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two Teamsters leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. Teamsters workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that 80 percent of the Teamsters in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|E
5|$|Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. {{was eager}} for James Whale, fresh from his great success with Bride of Frankenstein, to direct Dracula's Daughter. Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on Magnificent Obsession {{so she could}} begin work on Whale's Show Boat. Wary of {{directing}} two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that {{the same sort of}} audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Thin Man as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success. Laemmle agreed to buy the rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.|$|E

25|$|While it {{has been}} {{established}} that Equity Theory provides insight into scenarios of under-compensation, the theory has generally failed to demonstrate its usefulness in understanding scenarios of overcompensation. In this way, {{it could be said}} Equity Theory is more useful in describing factors that contribute to a lack of motivation rather than increasing motivation in the workplace. Concepts of organizational justice later expanded upon the fundamentals of Equity Theory <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> importance of fairness perceptions in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|The earth's {{rotation}} {{implies that}} the equator bulges and the poles are flattened. In his Principia, Newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1673 pendulum measurements by Richer as corroboration {{of the change in}} gravity, but initial measurements of meridian lengths by Picard and Cassini {{at the end of the}} 17th century suggested the opposite. However measurements by Maupertuis and the French Geodesic Mission in the 1730s established the flattening, thus confirming both Newton and the Copernican position.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} June, Gray {{had raised}} $1,235 in contributions. By the end of July, Chavous had raised $88,514 (all but $16,259 in May 2004) and had $42,295 on hand. Gray's {{campaign}} theme was that Chavous was {{out of touch with}} the ward, rarely attending neighborhood events and traveling out of town too frequently. Sam Bost, president of the influential Far Northeast/Southeast Council, announced in mid August that he would no longer support Chavous, and Gray won endorsements from several key organizations and individuals. Chavous argued that working on legislation consumed most of his time, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> school voucher program and the extensive charter school network in the city as major accomplishments. By August 22, Gray had raised $38,531 for a total of $52,389, while Chavous had raised $110,199 (and had $42,296 on hand).|$|E
25|$|Passed {{out to the}} {{occasional}} friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual Giangiacomo Feltrinelli in 1967. Feltrinelli {{had just returned from}} Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor Régis Debray. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by Che Guevara. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution {{he did not have to}} pay.|$|E

500|$|More negatively, Melanie McFarland of The Seattle Times {{lamented the}} too {{frequent}} changes in tone from song to song, {{and considered the}} album a step backwards from Last Splash.

500|$|Chelsea {{survived the}} pressure, as Tevez failed {{to connect with}} a low cross from Rooney, and {{equalised}} {{in the final minute}} of the first half. The goal followed from a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected first off Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard looked up <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier.

500|$|Biller {{viewed the}} {{interactions}} between Sulan and the Klingon version of Torres as being inspired by the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast. He considered a Klingon's strength to be the ideal beauty for a Vidiian, and that Sulan would develop an attraction to Torres. Biller said that the Klingon version of Torres was more manipulative than Beauty from the fairy tale because she uses her sexuality to convince Sulan to follow her demands. Biller believed the episode added more elements of horror to the series, <b>and</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moment when Sulan grafted Durst's face over his own as a [...] "sick moment of inspiration" [...] and a [...] "classic horror movie moment". He felt that Sulan's discomfort with his appearance helped round out his [...] character.|$|E

The improvisation by the amplified jazz bass is confined to the scene by the Vaar though the instrument is also used in the epilogue. The flugelhorn replaced the trumpet of the traditional brass section because it is [...] "mellower [...] less assertive". The bass clarinet was included for several reasons. It had doubled the jazz bass parts in the two study works for the opera. It was an instrument that had {{a prominent role in}} Les Huguenots in which Meyerbeer exploited modifications in the instrument's mechanism, developed by Adolphe Sax who, like most of the characters in Dr Ox, was Belgian.|$|E
