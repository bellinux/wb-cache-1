60|$|What renders {{arithmetic}} {{the type}} of a deductive science, is the fortunate applicability to it of a law so comprehensive as “The sums of equals are equals:” or (to express the same principle in less familiar but more characteristic language), Whatever {{is made up of}} parts, is made up of the parts of those parts. This truth, obvious to the senses in all cases which can be fairly referred to their decision, and so general as to be co-extensive with nature itself, being true of all sorts of phenomena (for all admit of being numbered), must be considered an inductive truth, or law of nature, of the highest order. And every <b>arithmetical</b> <b>operation</b> is an application of this law, or of other laws capable of being deduced from it. This is our warrant for all calculations. We believe that five and two are equal to seven, on the evidence of this inductive law, combined with the definitions of those numbers. We arrive at that conclusion (as all know who remember how they first learned it) by adding a single unit at a time: 5 + 1=6, therefore 5+1+1=6+1=7; and again 2=1+1, therefore 5+2=5+1+1=7.|$|E
60|$|I so {{feared and}} abhorred {{mathematics}} that the simplest <b>arithmetical</b> <b>operation</b> had always found and kept me helpless and blank--the dire {{discipline of the}} years bringing no relief whatever to my state; and mathematics unmitigated were at the Institution Rochette the air we breathed, building us up as they most officiously did for those other grim ordeals and pursuits, those of the mining and the civil engineer, those of the architectural aspirant and the technician in still other fields, to which {{we were supposed to}} be addressed. Nothing of the sort was indeed supposed of me--which is in particular my present mystification; so that my assault of the preliminaries disclosed, feeble as it strikingly remained, was mere darkness, waste and anguish. I found myself able to bite, as the phrase was, into no subject there deemed savoury; it was hard and bitter fruit all and turned to ashes in my mouth. More extraordinary however than my good parents' belief--eccentric on their part too, in the light of their usual practice and disposition, their habit, for the most part, of liking for us after a gasp or two whatever we seemed to like--was my own failure to protest with a frankness proportioned to my horror. The stiffer intellectual discipline, the discipline of physics and of algebra, invoked for the benefit of an understanding undisputedly weak and shy, had been accepted on my side as a blessing perhaps in disguise. It had come to me by I know not what perversity that if I couldn't tackle the smallest problem in mechanics or face without dismay at the blackboard the simplest geometric challenge I ought somehow in decency to make myself over, oughtn't really to be so inferior to almost everyone else. That was the pang, as it was also the marvel--that the meanest minds and the vulgarest types approached these matters without a sign of trepidation even when they approached them, at the worst, without positive appetite. My attempt not therefore to remain abnormal wholly broke down, however, and when I at last withdrew from the scene it was not even as a conspicuous, it was only as an obscure, a deeply hushed failure. I joined William, after what had seemed to me an eternity of woe, at the Academy, where I followed, for too short a time but with a comparative recovery of confidence, such literary cours as I might.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ackermann’s {{function}} {{implies the}} existence of an infinite spectrum of new arithmetical operations (hyperoperations) belonging to the Grzegorczyk Hierarchy. Two of these hyperoperations, tetration and zeration, together with their inverses are given special attention. Tetration (power tower, or superpower) has recently been described in the scientific literature and has attracted the attention of both career and amateur mathematicians; zeration is less well known. However, the new <b>arithmetical</b> <b>operation,</b> called zeration, follows naturally from generalizing formulas used in iterative calculations of both known and new inverse operations. Zeration expands our approach to mathematical concepts such as infinity and continuity and its application for describing discontinuities is shown in practical examples. The possibility of using tetration to represent very large numbers is outlined. Questions requiring further research are also raised.
