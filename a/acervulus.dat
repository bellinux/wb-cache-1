50|$|An <b>acervulus</b> (pl. acervuli) {{is a small}} asexual fruiting {{body that}} erupts through the {{epidermis}} of host plants parasitised by mitosporic fungi of the form order Melanconiales (Deuteromycota, Coelomycetes). It has {{the form of a}} small cushion at the bottom of which short crowded conidiophores are formed. The spores escape through an opening at the top.|$|E
5000|$|The diverse conidia and conidiophores {{sometimes}} {{develop in}} asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. aecervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium). Some species of Ascomycetes form their structures within plant tissue, either as parasite or saprophytes. These fungi have evolved more complex asexual sporing structures, probably {{influenced by the}} cultural conditions of plant tissue as a substrate. These structures are called the sporodochium. This is a cushion of conidiophores created from a pseudoparenchymatous stroma in plant tissue. The pycnidium is a globose to flask-shaped parenchymatous structure, lined on its inner wall with conidiophores. The <b>acervulus</b> is a flat saucer shaped bed of conidiophores produced under a plant cuticle, which eventually erupt through the cuticle for dispersal.2) Budding: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of D. earliana starts with the fungus {{overwintering}} in infected leaves. The survival fruiting body structures, acervuli, can continue to develop in foliage beneath snow cover. In the spring, conditions are ideal {{for the production of}} conidia, the asexual reproductive structures, and ascospores, the sexual reproductive structures. Conidia can escape from a small opening {{at the top of the}} <b>acervulus</b> and are dispersed mainly by splashing water or rain. These spores penetrate the plant cuticle directly, germinating and developing into an intracellular mycelium. The fungus produces new acervuli after infection. This allows repeated infections all season long, making the disease polycyclic. The sexual spores, ascospores, are produced in sacs called asci. The asci are produced in a cup-shaped structure called an apothecium. When conditions are ideal, the ascospores produced in the asci are discharged.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims The palm tribe Chamaedoreeae {{displays}} flowers {{arranged in}} a complex partial inflorescence called an <b>acervulus.</b> This type of partial inflorescence has {{so far not been}} reported elsewhere in the largest palm subfamily Arecoideae, which is traditionally characterized by flowers predominantly arranged in triads of one central female and two lateral male flowers. The ontogenetic basis of the <b>acervulus</b> is as yet unknown and its structural diversity throughout the genera of the Chamaedoreeae poorly recorded. This study aims to provide critical information on these aspects. Methods Developmental series and mature inflorescences were sampled from plants cultivated in international botanical gardens and wild populations. The main techniques employed included scanning electronic microscopy and serial anatomical sectioning of resin-embedded fragments of rachillae. Key Results Inflorescence ontogeny in Hyophorbe lagenicaulis demonstrates that the <b>acervulus</b> and the inflorescence rachilla form a condensed and cymose branching system resembling a coenosome. Syndesmy results from a combined process of rapid development and adnation, without or with reduced axis elongation. <b>Acervulus</b> diversity in the ten taxa of the Chamaedoreeae studied is displayed at the level of their positioning within the inflorescence, their arrangement, the number of floral buds and their sexual expression. Conclusions The results show that a more general definition of the type of partial inflorescence observed within the large subfamily Arecoideae would correspond to a cyme rather than to a floral triad. In spite of their common cymose architecture, the floral triad and the <b>acervulus</b> present differences with respect to the number and arrangement of floral buds, the superficial pattern of development and sexual expressio...|$|E
40|$|Sexual dimorphism, at {{both the}} flower and plant level, is {{widespread}} in the palm family (Arecaceae), {{in contrast to the}} situation in angiosperms as a whole. The tribe Chamaedoreeae is of special interest for studies of the evolution of sexual expression since dioecy appears to have evolved independently twice in this group from a monoecious ancestor. In order to understand the underlying evolutionary pathways, it is important to obtain detailed information on flower structure and development in each of the main clades. Dissection and light and scanning electron microscopy were performed on developing flowers of Gaussia attenuata, a neotropical species belonging to one of the three monoecious genera of the tribe. Like species of the other monoecious genera of the Chamaedoreeae (namely Hyophorbe and Synechanthus), G. attenuata produces a bisexual flower cluster known as an <b>acervulus,</b> consisting of a row of male flowers with a basal female flower. Whereas the sterile androecium of female flowers terminated its development at an early stage of floral ontogeny, the pistillode of male flowers was large in size but with no recognizable ovule, developing {{for a longer period of}} time. Conspicuous nectary differentiation in the pistillode suggested a possible role in pollinator attraction. Gaussia attenuata displays a number of floral characters that are likely to be ancestral to the tribe, notably the <b>acervulus</b> flower cluster, which is conserved in the other monoecious genera and also (albeit in a unisexual male form) in the dioecious genera (Wendlandiella and a few species of Chamaedorea). Comparison with earlier data from other genera suggests that large nectariferous pistillodes and early arrest in staminode development might also be regarded as ancestral characters in this tribe...|$|E

40|$|In Brazil, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is {{associated}} with a complex of symptoms in coffee culture. Although this pathogen had its pathogenesis observed and identified, its importance has still been questioned due to its several endophytic forms, raising doubts as to the real importance of the pathosystem. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate, by using an isolate transformed with the gene gfp, the infection and colonization capability of C. gloeosporioides in coffee seedlings. After the fourth day of inoculation, manifestation of symptoms as punctual necrosis could be observed, which progressed during the evaluation period, culminating in the death of seedlings. Epifluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of the pathogen in the seedlings, as well as the visualization of internal colonization of tissues, <b>acervulus</b> formation and conidium production, confirming that it was responsible for the observed symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} disseminule of the fungus, Marssoninarosae, is ahyaline, two-celled, unornamented conidium with {{a sticky}} surface. Be fore infection takes place, mature asexual spores must be immersed in water {{regardless of the}} rela tivehumidity. At relative humidities below 90 %, immersion for longer than 6 hours is necessary. Germination of conidia begins as early as 8 hours after wetting. A germ tube emerges from the largercell (infrequently from both cells of the conidium). The germ tube may penetrate the leaf cuticle. If so, the tube then grows between the cuticle and the epidermal cells. A fine drill hypha branches vertically, penetrates an epider mal cell wall expands into a bulbous structure exterior to the plasmalemma, and produces a haustorium. This sequence of events is simi lar in the associated epidermis and the pali sade, spongy, and xylem parenchymas. A few hyphae penetrate vertically betweenpalisade cells, and numerous subcuticular strands of one to four hyphae radiate from {{the periphery of the}} enlargingcolony. Branches of subcuticular hyphae originate at right angles from a spheri cal cell and form another subcuticular strand. Masses of ovoid hyphal cells form at some junc tures of hyphal strands, acervuli develop, and conidia formsubcuticularly. Theacervulus developsandenlarges. When the relative humid ity drops at the location of theenlarging <b>acervulus,</b> the cuticle breaks exposing a slimy mass of conidia. Some conidia will stick to and move with fragments of ruptured cuticle but most dispersal occurs in water from rain or conden sate. Within a drop of water, conidia are released from the conidial mass and adhere to any contacted solid surface. Consequently dis semination is accomplished by splashingwate...|$|E
40|$|The acervuli of {{the fungus}} are formed under the cuticular layer of leaves or of young stems of Paulozemia tomentosa. They are scatterd in the diseased portion, or joined {{each other to}} become a large <b>acervulus.</b> They are heap shaped, 50 - 2000 μ in diam., later become flat, {{breaking}} the cuticular layer of the host epidermal system. In some materials are found several brownish setae, which are stout, acute, with a few septa, 50 - 60 x 3 ? 4 μ in size. On the stroma-like hyphae in the acervuli, stand the conidiophores in bundle, which are hyaline and cylindrical in shape. Conidia of the fungus are continuous, oblong or cylindrical in shape, straight or sometimes slightly curved, 15 - 21 x 36 - 58 μ in size, hyaline. Similar to other Gloeosporia, the fungus has one nucleus in {{the centre of the}} conidium. Often in germination, the conidium may be devided into two cells by a septum formed at the middle of the conidium. Germ tubes are commonly produced {{near the end of the}} conidium. In the distilled water or in the tap water, slender germ tubes were formed from the conidia, and the anastomose are often observed among two or or three germ tubes. In many nutrient solutions secondary conidia are produced abundantly from the germ tubes. Appressoria are readily prcduced from the tips of the germ tubes when they came in contact with some 2 ̆ 7 solid surfaces. The growth of the fungus on the ordinary nutrient media is good. The mycelia are at first white to grayish, creeping densely over the surface of media, then take on a dark brown to olive colour near the centre of the colony. In old cultures brown coloured small heaps of hyphae, like sporodcchia, are prcduced numerously cn the colony of the fungus. Plenty of conidia are produced on the tips of hyphae, or on the sporodochia-like bodies, and then the mycelial surface is almost covered with the orange red, muddy spore mass. The formation of setae is also observed in the culture of some strains of the fungus.
