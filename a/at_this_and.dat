5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that they could not be trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
5|$|Athens had {{recently}} become a democracy, overthrowing its own tyrant Hippias. In their fight {{to establish the}} democracy, the Athenians had asked the Persians for aid (which {{was not in the}} end needed), in return for submitting to Persian overlordship. Some years later, Hippias had attempted to regain power in Athens, assisted by the Spartans. This attempt failed and Hippias fled to Artaphernes, and tried to persuade him to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians had baulked <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Since they were already an enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities in their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of the Athenian democracy no doubt helped persuade the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|David Kaczynski {{had tried}} to remain {{anonymous}} at first, but he was soon identified, {{and within a few}} days an FBI agent team was dispatched to interview David and his wife with their attorney in Washington, D.C. <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> subsequent meetings, David provided letters written by his brother in their original envelopes, allowing the FBI task force to use the postmark dates to add more detail to their timeline of Ted's activities. David developed a respectful relationship with the primary Task Force behavioral analyst, Special Agent Kathleen M. Puckett, whom he met many times in Washington, D.C., Texas, Chicago, and Schenectady, New York, over the nearly two months before the federal search warrant was served on Kaczynski's cabin.|$|E

However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|Michael takes relish {{in being}} able to freely {{proclaim}} his relationship with Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries to get him to have sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only enjoyed being with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it was a mistake. Michael is hurt and upset <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> Jan takes back her comments to keep him from crying.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras to Athens ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to. However, they were severely censured for this {{when they returned to}} Athens. At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias to the rule of Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians balked <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E

5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E
5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.|$|E

25|$|His first {{concern was}} that of Asia Minor. Nicaea, until 1261 {{the capital of the}} Empire, was under siege by Ottoman Turks. In the summer of 1329, Andronikos III {{launched}} a relief attempt which culminated in a defeat at the Battle of Pelekanon on June 10, and in 1331, the city fell. Not wishing to see Nicomedia or the other few remaining forts in Asia Minor suffer the same fate, Andronikos III sought to pay off the Ottomans with tribute â€” the Ottomans did not stop <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> seized Nicomedia as well in 1337.|$|E
25|$|Later, Nicholas, who {{requires}} {{his family}} signet ring {{as proof of}} his identity, tells Jo that the container of toxic waste is safe, as he has hidden it in the well. Jo is horrified <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> now considers Nicholas {{to be the person}} responsible for the harm which had befallen her friends at the school. Nicholas promises her that everything would be okay. With the help of Tama, and the technology of 1995, a neutralising agent for the toxic waste is discovered, and a sufficient quantity is manufactured to render the waste in the container safe.|$|E
25|$|When it {{had been}} {{determined}} to transfer the Composites to the elevated division of the IRT in 1916, several changes {{were made to the}} equipment. As subway cars, the Composite motor cars were simply too heavy to run on elevated structures. Therefore, they were lightened. The trucks were replaced with the lighter elevated type, and smaller, less powerful motors (120hp instead of 200hp) were installed. As mentioned above, by 1916, 208 of the motorized Composites had already been converted into trailers. When the IRT looked <b>at</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> noted the reduction in power of motor cars associated with using the smaller motors, it decided to convert all Composite trailers to motors in 1916. While this modification added weight to the trailer cars, the load on each wheel was still within the acceptable range to run on elevated structure. Therefore, all Composites became motorized.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{returning}} to London on 16 December, James was welcomed by cheering crowds. He took heart <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> attempted to recommence government, even presiding over {{a meeting of}} the Privy Council. He sent the Earl of Feversham to William to arrange for a personal meeting to continue negotiations. Now for the first time it became evident that William had no longer any desire to keep James in power in England. He was extremely dismayed by the arrival of Lord Feversham. He refused the suggestion that he simply arrest James because this would violate his own declarations and burden his relationship with his wife. In the end it was decided that he should exploit James's fears; the three original commissioners were sent back to James with the message that William felt he could no longer guarantee the king's well-being and that James for his own safety had better leave London for Ham.|$|E
25|$|The media {{attention}} that the Waffle, and its candidate, James Laxer, received, {{before and during}} the vote, partially explains the closest federal NDP leadership election up to that time. Lewis' perceived heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the Waffle <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> previous conventions had made him enough enemies to make the leadership campaign interesting. As well, Lewis was involved in most of the internal conflicts within the CCF/NDP during the previous 36 years, so the many members that felt his wrath as the party disciplinarian during this period, plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated on the floor, and he made no promises to them. He also took on the party's Quebec wing, stating that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but come election time, they must pledge themselves to the party's newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP, instead leaving it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party's Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle, or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a logical conclusion in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does not like to be peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is one thing and public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Tony and Diane {{are left}} shocked to {{discover}} that Diane and Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis) babies, Dee Dee and Rose were swapped at birth, meaning Rose is Diane and Tony's biological daughter and Dee Dee is Tegan's. But in June 2015, panic strikes the village when Rose is taken by a mystery culprit, several of the villagers, including Diane, Tony, Tegan, Simone Loveday (Jacqueline Boatswain) and Louis Loveday (Karl Collins). In the time Rose is missing, both Diane and Tony have been arrested and at one point, Tony ends up kissing Tegan, which Diane witnesses, resulting in her pouring water over him. In October 2015, Tony hosts a Gay Pride event to prove to Diane's nephew, Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams) and Esther Bloom (Jazmine Franks) {{that he is not}} a homophobic. However, {{on the day of the}} event, he discovers that his son, Harry (now played by Parry Glasspool), has been having an affair with his best friend and business partner, Ste, he is outraged <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> tries to keep the two apart. Diane later reveals to Tony that she still loves him and wants them to renew their wedding vows. Before they renew their vows, Diane and Tony emotionally give Rose back to Tegan and then proceed to renew their vows. Tony is later left shocked as Scott tries to frame him for poisoning Diane and they discover this with Tony wanting Scott out of the house but after an emotional chat, Diane allows him to stay. He then finally accepts his son's sexuality and relationship with Ste. Following the poison drama, Diane temporarily leaves the village, leaving Tony to run the Hutch on his own, however she returns in February 2016. In May 2016, Tony and Diane discover that Scott has been helping Marnie Nightingale (Lysette Anthony) and her son, James (Gregory Finnegan), to get The Hutch off them, which they later agree to sell to Marnie due their ongoing money issues. They are later employed by Marnie but find themselves controlled. In June 2016, a man named Mr Sheffield arrives at the flat and offers Diane and Tony jobs in a restaurant in Paris, Diane as a waitress and Tony as a chef. They accept but Tony is later saddened to know that he will be working as a junior chef and decides not to go, however Diane convinces him to go. The day of their departure arrives in July 2016, but as him and Diane are about to leave, Harry breaks the news that Ste is back on drugs so he decides to stay, whilst Diane leaves for France. In August 2016, he unites with Darren, Maxine Minniver (Nikki Sanderson) and Grace Black (Tamara Wall) to try and frame Warren and get him out of the village. Grace conducts the plan that they burn down the garage but Warren catches Darren, Maxine and Tony, they have been set up. In October 2016, Cindy is employed as pot washer at Nightingales and they both find themselves controlled by Marnie. He is later shocked but delighted as Cindy's sister, Jude Cunningham (Davinia Taylor) returns to the village as a property developer, with a plan to build luxurious flats in the village, unaware it is a scam.|$|E
