5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. The aim was to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest {{artificial}} satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members will travel to and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E

50|$|Another {{use of a}} {{collision}} avoidance manoeuvre is to abort an automated docking, and such a procedure {{is built into the}} software that controls the docking of <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicles</b> to the ISS.

25|$|The Jules Verne ATV, or <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicle</b> 001 (ATV-001), was an {{unmanned}} cargo resupply spacecraft {{launched by}} the European Space Agency (ESA). The ATV was named after the 19th-century French science-fiction author Jules Verne. It was launched on 9 March 2008 {{on a mission to}} supply the International Space Station (ISS) with propellant, water, air, and dry cargo. Jules Verne was the first of five ATVs to be launched.|$|E

Thirty Progress vehicles have visited the station, seventeen Soyuz vehicles, twenty-seven shuttles, and one <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (ATV). One hundred sixty-four people had visited the station from fourteen nations prior to STS-126, (167 once STS-126 docked) and on Thursday, the tenth anniversary, Shireman said the station will have orbited the Earth 57,509 times, for a total distance of over 1.3billion miles.|$|E

The heaviest and most used version, the , delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into GTO. It failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made 71 consecutive successful flights (as of March 2016).

50|$|Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station (ISS) {{are made}} {{primarily}} to deliver cargo, however several Russian modules have also docked to the outpost following uncrewed launches. Resupply missions typically use the Russian Progress spacecraft, European <b>Automated</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> Japanese Kounotori vehicles, and the American Dragon and Cygnus spacecraft. The primary docking system for Progress spacecraft is the automated Kurs system, with the manual TORU {{system as a}} backup. ATVs also use Kurs, however they are not equipped with TORU. Progress and ATV can remain docked {{for up to six}} months. The other spacecraft — the Japanese HTV, the SpaceX Dragon and the Orbital Sciences Cygnus — rendezvous with the station before being grappled using Canadarm2 and berthed at the nadir port of the Harmony or Unity module for one to two months. As of July 2017, Progress spacecraft have flown most of the uncrewed missions to the ISS.|$|R

During their extravehicular activity (EVA) on Mar. 28, Expedition 10 commander astronaut Leroy Chiao and Russian flight engineer cosmonaut Salizhan Sharipov also coordinated the hand-launch by Sharipov of a small Russian technology satellite. The crew wore Russian Orlan space suits during the 4 hr. 30 min. EVA, which they completed an hour earlier than expected. The EVA was the sixth for Chiao and the second for Sharipov. Both Expedition 10 crewmen had been outside together on Jan. 25 at the start of their six- month mission.

40|$|Robotic {{systems are}} {{expected}} to play an increasingly important role in future space activities, such as repairing, upgrading, refuelling, and re-orbiting spacecraft. These technologies could potentially {{extend the life of}} satellites, enhance the capability of space systems, reduce the operation costs, and clean up the increasing space debris. Recent proposals for missions involving the use of space manipulators and/or <b>automated</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>vehicles</b> are presented as a solution for a lot of problems which now affect the procedures and the performance of the in-orbit space systems. Other projects involving space manipulators have been developed by DARPA aiming to demonstrate several satellite servicing operations and technologies including rendez-vous, proximity operations and station-keeping, capture, docking, fluid transfer (specifically, “hydrazine”), and ORU (Orbit Replaceable Unit) transfer. Of course the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and its base mounting flexible solar arrays is very difficult to model. Furthermore the motion planning of a space robots is usually much more complicated than the motion planning of fixed-base manipulators. In this paper first of all the authors present a mixed NE/EL formulation suitable for synthesizing optimal control strategies during the deploying manoeuvres of robotic arms mounted on flexible orbiting platform (i. e. the chaser). Then two new control strategies able compensate the flexibility excitations of the chaser satellite solar panels during the capturing of a flexible target spacecraft with the use of two robotic arms are presented and applied to a grasping manoeuver. The mission is here divided into three main phases: the approaching, the docking and the post-grasping phase. Several numerical examples will complete the work...|$|R
