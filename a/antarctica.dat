5|$|<b>Antarctica</b> {{is divided}} in two by the Transantarctic Mountains {{close to the}} neck between the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West <b>Antarctica</b> and the {{remainder}} East <b>Antarctica,</b> because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the Greenwich meridian.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antarctica,</b> on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all the continents. <b>Antarctica</b> is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in <b>Antarctica</b> has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest part of the year) is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to <b>Antarctica</b> include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, West <b>Antarctica</b> {{closely resembles}} the Andes {{mountain}} range of South America. The Antarctic Peninsula {{was formed by}} uplift and metamorphism of sea bed sediments during the late Paleozoic and the early Mesozoic eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by igneous intrusions and volcanism. The most common rocks in West <b>Antarctica</b> are andesite and rhyolite volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in Marie Byrd Land and Alexander Island. The only anomalous area of West <b>Antarctica</b> is the Ellsworth Mountains region, where the stratigraphy is more similar to East <b>Antarctica.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, <b>Antarctica</b> {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} broke apart and <b>Antarctica</b> {{as we know it today}} was formed around 25million years ago. <b>Antarctica</b> was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E
5|$|New {{claims on}} <b>Antarctica</b> have been {{suspended}} since 1959, although in 2015 Norway formally defined Queen Maud Land as including the unclaimed area {{between it and the}} South Pole. Antarctica's status is regulated by the 1959 Antarctic Treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System. <b>Antarctica</b> is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60° S {{for the purposes of the}} Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the Soviet Union (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and the United States. It set aside <b>Antarctica</b> as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on <b>Antarctica.</b> This was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Some of <b>Antarctica</b> {{has been}} warming up; {{particularly}} strong warming {{has been noted}} on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted {{for the first time}} that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of <b>Antarctica</b> is slightly positive at >0.05°C (0.09°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West <b>Antarctica</b> has warmed by more than 0.1°C (0.2°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East <b>Antarctica.</b> There is evidence from one study that <b>Antarctica</b> is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West <b>Antarctica,</b> while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also {{known as}} the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main {{instrument}} concerned with conservation and management of biodiversity in <b>Antarctica.</b> The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in <b>Antarctica</b> by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to <b>Antarctica</b> from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.|$|E

5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on <b>Antarctica</b> {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in <b>Antarctica</b> thousands of years ago and found that it held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled <b>Antarctica</b> for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to <b>Antarctica</b> and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
5|$|Africa {{separated}} from <b>Antarctica</b> around 160million years ago, {{followed by the}} Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago).

5|$|In 2003, it {{was decided}} that Norway was to extend its {{operations}} in <b>Antarctica</b> by establishing an all-year research station.
