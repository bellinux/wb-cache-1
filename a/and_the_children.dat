5|$|Benton, Bauer and {{the boys}} are spotted by Iké's helicopter. While they flee into the forest, Benton steps on a land mine. With little time to disarm it, Benton urges Bauer to leave, so he can buy time. When he is {{surrounded}} by Iké and his men, Benton takes his foot off the trigger and detonates the mine, killing himself and the rebels, though Iké survives. Bauer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> continue to the capital, where he defeats another rebel ambush. At {{the gates of the}} embassy, Trammel denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children's safety. He reluctantly accepts, thus sacrificing his freedom. While Taylor is inaugurated President, Bauer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> evacuate, leaving chaotic Sangala behind.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} chorus, Amuro <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> start marching and playing their {{instruments}} through downtown Los Angeles.

The final chorus has Amuro <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> dancing and singing at Pershing Square, surrounding by several lighting effects and rainbow-coloured clouds. Several scenes of the clouds start to float within the city, above and near skyscrapers, and the video ends with Amuro, the children, and the citizens smiling.|$|E

Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

5|$|As a young woman, Lucy Mercer {{worked in}} a dress shop. In 1914, Mercer was hired by Eleanor Roosevelt to become her social secretary.

According to historians Joseph Persico and Hazel Rowley, the affair between Mercer and Franklin likely began in 1916, when Eleanor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> were vacationing at Campobello Island to avoid the summer heat, while Franklin remained in Washington, D.C. In 1917, Franklin often included Mercer in his summer yachting parties, which Eleanor usually declined to attend.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> of Constantine I. Traumatized {{by the events of}} the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E

The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00.

5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{left behind}} $15,000 in debts, {{and with the}} nation still {{in the throes of}} the Panic of 1819, his assets were not enough to pay off the obligations. His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her.

When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty. They were brought together by their hatred for Homer and begin to insult him. When an offended Homer threatens to vote in favor of a law that prohibits same-sex couples from adopting children, Patty forces Homer into confessing that he is too lazy to actually do it. At the end of the episode, Homer plays a guitar and expresses his undying love for his newly bought plasma television and (to a lesser extent) Marge.|$|E

When Lazare was two years of age, his mother moved to France to earn a better living. After the unexpected deaths of Jean Ponticelli and his eldest son, Pierre, {{the rest of the family}} moved to Paris, leaving Lazare in the care of neighbors.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, in October 1888, Sophie and the five children moved to Berlin and took up residence in a small shabby apartment on the Blumenstraße in Berlin's working-class east. Döblin's parents briefly reconciled in 1889, when Max returned penniless from America; the family moved to Hamburg in April 1889, {{but when it came to}} light that Max had brought his lover back with him and was leading a double life, Sophie <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> returned to Berlin in September 1889.|$|E
