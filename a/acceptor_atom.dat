40|$|AbstractRecent {{data from}} studies of enzyme catalyzed {{hydrogen}} transfer reactions implicate a new theoretical context in which to understand C–H activation. This is {{much closer to the}} Marcus theory of electron transfer, in that environmental factors influence the probability of effective wave function overlap from donor to <b>acceptor</b> <b>atoms.</b> The larger size of hydrogen and the availability of three isotopes (H, D and T) introduce a dimension to the kinetic analysis that is not available for electron transfer. This concerns the role of gating between donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>atoms,</b> in particular whether the system in question is able to tune distance between reactants to achieve maximal tunneling efficiency. Analysis of enzyme systems is providing increasing evidence of a role for active site residues in optimizing the inter-nuclear distance for nuclear tunneling.

5000|$|For example, {{the pure}} {{semiconductor}} silicon has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors.
