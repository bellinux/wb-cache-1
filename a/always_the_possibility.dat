25|$|There are {{advantages}} to using biological polymers over synthetic polymers. They are {{very likely to}} have good biocompatibility and be easily degraded, because they are already present in nature in some form. However, there are also several disadvantages. They have unwieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that cannot be controlled over a wide range. In addition, there is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that naturally-derived materials may cause an immune response or contain microbes. In the production of naturally-derived materials {{there will also be}} batch-to-batch variation in large-scale isolation procedures that cannot be controlled. Some other problems plaguing natural polymers are their inability to support growth across long lesion gaps due to the possibility of collapse, scar formation, and early re-absorption. Despite all these disadvantages, some of which can be overcome, biological polymers still prove to be the optimal choice in many situations.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} of future supply and demand fluctuations, and the price risk imposed on the farmer, said farmer may use different financial transactions to reduce, or hedge, their risk. One such transaction {{is the use of}} forward contracts. Forward contracts are mutual agreements to deliver a certain amount of a commodity at a certain date for a specified price and each contract is unique to the buyer and seller. For this example, the farmer can sell a number of forward contracts equivalent to the amount of wheat he expects to harvest and essentially lock in the current price of wheat. Once the forward contracts expire, the farmer will harvest the wheat and deliver it to the buyer at the price agreed to in the forward contract. Therefore, the farmer has reduced his risks to fluctuations in the market of wheat because he has already guaranteed a certain number of bushels for a certain price. However, there are still many risks associated with this type of hedge. For example, if the farmer has a low yield year and he harvests less than the amount specified in the forward contracts, he must purchase the bushels elsewhere in order to fill the contract. This becomes even more of a problem when the lower yields affect the entire wheat industry and the price of wheat increases due to supply and demand pressures. Also, while the farmer hedged all of the risks of a price decrease away by locking in the price with a forward contract, he also gives up the right to the benefits of a price increase. Another risk associated with the forward contract is the risk of default or renegotiation. The forward contract locks in a certain amount and price at a certain future date. Because of that, there is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> that the buyer will not pay the amount required {{at the end of the}} contract or that the buyer will try to renegotiate the contract before it expires.|$|E

2500|$|In {{mainstream}} economics, {{the concept}} of a market is any structure that allows buyers and sellers to exchange any type of goods, services and information. The exchange of goods or services, with or without money, is a transaction. Market participants consist of all the buyers and sellers of a good who influence its price, which is a major topic of study of economics and has given rise to several theories and models concerning the basic market forces of supply and demand. A major topic of debate is how much a given market can be considered to be a [...] "free market", that is free from government intervention. Microeconomics traditionally focuses on the study of market structure and the efficiency of market equilibrium; when the latter (if it exists) is not efficient, then economists say that a market failure has occurred. However it is not always clear how the allocation of resources can be improved since there is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of government failure.|$|E
2500|$|The coastal {{migration}} models {{provide a}} different perspective on migration to the New World, {{but they are not}} without their own problems. One of the biggest problems is that global sea levels have risen over [...] {{since the end of the}} last glacial period, and this has submerged the ancient coastlines that maritime people would have followed into the Americas. Finding sites associated with early coastal migrations is extremely difficult—and systematic excavation of any sites found in deeper waters is challenging and expensive. On the other hand, there is evidence of marine technologies found in the hills of the Channel Islands of California, circa 10,000 BCE. If there was an early pre-Clovis coastal migration, there is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a [...] "failed colonization". Another problem that arises is the lack of hard evidence found for a [...] "long chronology" [...] theory. No sites have yet produced a consistent chronology older than about 12,500 radiocarbon years (~14,500 calendar years) , but research has been limited in South America related to the possibility of early coastal migrations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a single-blind test is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but {{is not supposed to}} reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing person employed by the company which is producing the challenge, there's <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of a conflict of interest where the marketing person is aware that future income will be {{based on the results of}} the test.|$|E
2500|$|This {{prohibition}} {{also was}} (and in many circles, still is) commonly understood to disallow operating electrical switches. One reason is that, when actuating electromechanical switches that carry a live current, there is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> {{that a small}} electric spark will be generated. [...] This spark may {{be thought of as}} a kind of fire, although since it is incidental and one does not benefit from it, it may not be a Sabbath violation at all. In any case, as science became more advanced, and the properties of fire and electricity became better understood, the former reasoning broke down: fire is a chemical reaction involving the release of energy; the flow of an electric current is a physical reaction. Therefore, some hold that the proper reason it is forbidden to complete electric circuits is because it involves construction or building (i.e., the building and completion of an electric circuit—see above). Rav Aurbach, a leading and widely accepted ultra-orthodox posek declined this argument comparing it to saying that you cannot shut a door, as it will effectively be completing a wall. He wrote, [...] "In my opinion there is no prohibition [...] on Shabbat or Yom Tov... There is no prohibition of ma'keh bepatish or molid... (However, I [...] am afraid that the masses will err and turn on incandescent lights on Shabbat, and thus I do not permit electricity absent great need...) ... This matter requires further analysis. ... However, the key point in my opinion is that there is no prohibition to use electricity on Shabbat unless the electricity causes a prohibited act like cooking or starting a flame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biosecurity, a {{management}} measure {{used to prevent}} the transmission of diseases and disease agents on the facility, {{is important to keep}} in mind when designing a facility. In order to achieve a high level of biosecurity, collection facilities should be placed as far as possible from one another, as well as from farms. According to the FAO's recommendations, facilities should be [...] "at least 3 km from farms or other biological risks and 1 km from main roads and railways". Separation between collection facilities and surrounding farms can improve biosecurity as pests, such as flies and mice, have the potential to travel from farm to facility and vice versa. Other disease agents may be able to travel through the air via wind, furthering the importance of separation of farms and proper air sanitation and ventilation. Additionally, a perimeter fence is used to prevent potential threats that could cause contamination to germplasms, such as unauthorized personnel or unwanted animals, from entering the facilities. Animals may be housed in pens located inside or outside of a barn as long as they are contained within the perimeter fence. When interaction with outside objects, such as feed trucks or veterinary personnel, is necessary, complete sanitation is required to decrease the risk of contamination. There is <b>always</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of disease spreading among the animals whose biological data is being collected or from animal to human. An example of a disease that can easily spread through germplasm is Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, otherwise known as PRRS. A highly contagious disease between swine, PRRS causes millions of dollars to be lost annually by producers. The disease can be spread through boar semen. Therefore, biosecurity is particularly important when genetic material will be inserted into another animal to prevent the spread of such diseases.|$|E
