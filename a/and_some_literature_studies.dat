The research location is in correctional facilities Class II-B of Pasuruan City. Data collecting technique is interview with some apparatus in the correctional facilities <b>and</b> <b>some</b> prisoners, <b>literature</b> <b>study,</b> documentation, <b>and</b> observation in it. Data analysis method is descriptive qualitative, means that data is analyzed by giving a description according to the existing facts that obtained through either field <b>study</b> or <b>literature</b> <b>study.</b> Based in the interview with prisoners, it is obtained a fact that prisoners’ are less or not get their rights according to the Law no. 12 year 1995. The fact triggers the rise of prisoners’ demand. Condition in the correctional facilities and the different treatment given by jailer is also become a demand trigger. The conclusion is, condition in the correctional facilities is not reflecting a prisoner correction site yet. So that it rises prisoners’ demand.

The recruitment and selection process has been choosen in this study as both of them are the most important part or phase in human resource management function. Both process will determine whether the organisation will achieve the objective of the organisation or not. Disqualified candidates will give bad results in achieving objective of the organisation. For Muslim managers, it is important for them to apply the Islamic approach in managing employees and it is important also for a manager to understand human capital development. The process of recruitment and selection has been explain very well in this study. The ideas and suggestion for this study have been compiled in a concise and ordered form. Compilation of ideas has been thematically arranged on the basis of different areas include Islamic and conventional human resource management.

The first objective is reached by concluding that the amendment significantly altered IASB’s credibility, while the second failed in completely convincing us about the economic grounding of the amendment.
