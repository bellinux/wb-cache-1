5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the aspects of nursing care that promote the {{maternal}} role attainment during the postpartum. Nine Japanese low risk expectant mothers took part in the survey during their third trimester up to one month postpartum. Qualitative data were collected from subjects about nursing care that facilitate the establishment of self-image as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> during pregnancy. The correlation between nursing care provided and the advanced stage maternal role attainment was qualitatively analyzed. Expectant <b>mothers</b> advanced <b>to</b> the informal stage from the formal stage of maternal role attainment during the early postpartum period. The following aspects of nursing care effectively promoted the maternal role attainment. 1. Facilitating expression that the expectant mother has experience negative feeling and ambivalence through becoming <b>a</b> <b>mother.</b> 2. Facilitating <b>an</b> expectant <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> develop <b>a</b> self-image as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> free from conventional maternal role models. 3. Facilitating <b>an</b> expectant <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> search for concrete maternal role models. 4. Facilitating <b>an</b> expectant <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> discuss her fantasies about nurturing 2 ̆ 2 her baby 2 ̆ 2. 5. Facilitating <b>an</b> expectant <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> express her feelings about becoming <b>a</b> <b>mother.</b> 本研究の目的は,妊娠期に「その人なりの母親としての自己像を確立すること」を目指した看護援助を実施し,産褥期における母親役割獲得プロセスを円滑に移行させる効果を検討するとともに,産褥期の母親役割獲得プロセス促進に有効な妊娠期の看護援助方法を明らかにすることである。不妊経験のない 9 名の初産婦を対象に,看護援助及びその反応のプロセスを縦断的に調査して得られたデータを質的に分析した結果,妊婦は母親になる過程で経験する感情の表出,具体的な母親役割モデルの育児場面の投影,自分自身の考え方に適合した母親役割モデルを取り込む,という反応のプロセスを経て,妊娠の終了時点では負の側面も含めて,母親役割を引き受ける覚悟を表明し,「自分なりの母親像」が発達していた。その結果,産褥期には入院期間中から,母親役割獲得プロセスの非形式的段階への移行が始まるという効果をもたらした。さらに,看護援助と効果の関係性を分析した結果,明らかとなった産褥期の母親役割獲得プロセスの円滑な移行に有効な妊娠期の看護援助は, 1. 母親になる過程で生ずる否定的及び両価的感情の積極的な表出を促す, 2. ステレオタイプの母親役割モデルにとらわれず,母親としての自己像をありのままに表出することを促す, 3. 自分にとっての現実的な母親役割モデルの探索を促す, 4. おなかにいる「この子」を育てている場面の空想を促す, 5. 私が「この子」の母親になるという気持ちの表出を促す,であった...|$|R
5|$|While Vali's {{acquisition}} of Ruma— elder brother taking his younger sister-in-law as wife—is universally condemned; however as in Tara's case, elder brother's widow marrying her younger brother-in-law {{seems to be}} a social norm. Ramashraya Sharma considers that Rama's silence on marriage of Tara and Sugriva does not signal non-acceptance of the act, but rather that he is not concerned with the issue of the sexual relations of the loose charactered vanaras, in which Tara and Ruma exchange hands between the brothers. Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo's 1927 polemical book Mother India, which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to Hindu mythology are {{abundant}} in the film, and its lead character {{has been seen as}} a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept {{of what it means to}} be <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> society through self-sacrifice. Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh states. The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E

25|$|Gonorrhea {{is spread}} through {{sexual contact with}} an {{infected}} person. This includes oral, anal, and vaginal sex. It can also spread from <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> a child during birth. Diagnosis is by testing the urine, urethra in males, or cervix in females. Testing all women who are sexually active and less than 25 years of age each year {{as well as those}} with new sexual partners is recommended; the same recommendation applies in {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM).|$|E
25|$|Toxoplasmosis {{is usually}} spread by eating poorly cooked food that {{contains}} cysts, exposure to infected cat feces, and from <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> a child during pregnancy {{if the mother}} becomes infected. Rarely the disease may be spread by blood transfusion. It is not otherwise spread between people. The parasite is only known to reproduce sexually in the cat family. However, it can infect most types of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Diagnosis is typically by testing blood for antibodies or by testing amniotic fluid for the parasite's DNA.|$|E

25|$|An HPV {{infection}} {{is caused by}} human papillomavirus, a DNA virus from the papillomavirus family, of which over 170 types are known. More than 40 types are transmitted through sexual contact and infect the anus and genitals. Risk factors for persistent HPV infections include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple partners, smoking, and poor immune function. HPV is typically spread by sustained direct skin-to-skin contact with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. Occasionally, it can spread from <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> her baby during pregnancy. It does not spread via common items like toilet seats. People can become infected {{with more than one}} type of HPV. HPV only affects humans.|$|E
25|$|The Ganges is {{also the}} mother, the Ganga Mata (mata="mother") of Hindu worship and culture, {{accepting}} all and forgiving all. Unlike other goddesses, she has no destructive or fearsome aspect, destructive though she might be as a river in nature. She is also <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>to</b> other gods. She accepts Shiva's incandescent seed from the fire-god Agni, which is too hot for this world, and cools it in her waters. This union produces Skanda, or Kartikeya, the god of war. In the Mahabharata, she is the wife of Shantanu, {{and the mother of}} heroic warrior-patriarch, Bhishma. When Bhishma is mortally wounded in battle, Ganga comes out of the water in human form and weeps uncontrollably over his body.|$|E
