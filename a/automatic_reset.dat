25|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> {{design has}} only {{recently}} been introduced on American plows, but has been used extensively on European and Australian plows. In this construction the beam is hinged at a point nearly above {{the point of the}} share. The bottom is held in the normal position by a set of springs or by a hydraulic cylinder on each bottom.|$|E
50|$|Bowlers must {{initiate}} all free-fall pinsetter cycles. The five-pin free-fall pinsetter {{does not}} automatically react to a ball rolled or pin knocked down. When bowling on free fall pinsetters, the bowler would have to press a button to initiate a pick-up cycle to clear downed pins lying on the pin deck. If automatic scoring is in use, all <b>automatic</b> <b>resets</b> are actually initiated by the scoring computers.|$|R

25|$|Most plough makers {{offer an}} <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> system for tough {{conditions}} or rocky soils. The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage.

50|$|The M4 started {{production}} in November 1966, as the direct successor of the M3 and M2, featuring framelines for 35 mm, 50 mm, 90 mm and 135 mm lenses in a 0.72 magnification viewfinder. It has the frame counter of the M3, with <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> after reloading.|$|E
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature is the}} {{combined}} wind-on and shutter release lever. It swings out forward 65 degrees and is operated by the index finger. In the stowed-away position, the shutter is cocked and the film wound on {{ready for the next}} picture. A small rocking lever in front of the accessory shoe serves as a shutter-release lock at this stage, it is disengaged by sliding it to the left-hand side. Depressing the lever releases the shutter and it relocates to the 65 degrees standoff position. Depressing the lever again cocks the shutter and winds on the film. At the camera base is a special flash sync connector protected by coin-operated O-ring sealed aluminium plug, as well as an <b>automatic</b> <b>resetting</b> frame counter, visible behind a glass window. No tripod socket is provided. A small rewind knob at the left-hand top is extended for easy access and to engage the film transport mechanism. No rewind release facility is required; a function that was later added to the Nikonos and marked R on the shutter-speed dial.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} formal equivalence verification of hardware designs. Traditional methods and tools which perform equivalence verification are commonly based on combinational equivalence verification (CEV) methods. We however present a novel method and tool (Seqver) for performing sequential equivalence verification (SEV). The theory behind Seqver {{is based on the}} alignability theory, however in this paper we present a refinement to that theory: strong alignability, which introduces a concept of automatic model synchronization to the verification process. <b>Automatic</b> synchronization (<b>reset)</b> of sequential synchronous circuits is considered {{as one of the most}} challenging tasks in the domain of sequential equivalence verification. Earlier attempts were based on BDDs or classical reachability analysis, which by nature suffer from capacity limitations. Seqver is empowered with hybrid verification engines which combine state of the art SAT and BDD based engines for performing synchronization and verification. Seqver is widely used today in Intel for formally verifying leading next generation CPU designs. I...|$|R
50|$|When an {{obstruction}} is encountered, {{the plow}} bottom hinges back and up {{in such a}} way as to pass over the obstruction, without stopping the tractor and plow. The bottom automatically returns to normal plowing position as soon as the obstruction is passed, without any interruption of forward motion.The <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> design permits higher field efficiencies since stopping for stones is practically eliminated. It also reduces costs for broken shares, beams and other parts. The fast resetting action also helps produce a better job of plowing since large areas of unplowed land are not left as when lifting a plow over a stone.|$|E
50|$|The spring {{release device}} {{was used in}} the past almost universally on {{trailing}} type plows with one to three or four bottoms. It is not practical on larger plows. When an obstruction is encountered the spring release mechanism in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor. When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the hydraulic hoses will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.Most plough makers offer an <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> system for tough conditions or rocky soils. The re-set mechanism allows each body to move rearward and upward to pass over obstacle (e.g. rocks hidden below soil surface) without damage. A heavy leaf or coil spring mechanism, which holds the body in its working position under normal conditions, resets the plough after the obstruction is passed.|$|E
50|$|Trip beam plows are {{constructed}} with a hinge {{point in the}} beam. This point is usually located some distance above {{the top of the}} plow bottom. The bottom is held in normal plowing position by a spring operated latch. When an obstruction is encountered the entire bottom is released and hinges back and up so as to pass over the obstruction. It is necessary to back up the tractor and plow to reset the bottom This construction is used to protect the individual bottoms. The <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> design has only recently been introduced on American plows, but has been used extensively on European and Australian plows. In this construction the beam is hinged at a point nearly above the point of the share. The bottom is held in the normal position by a set of springs or by a hydraulic cylinder on each bottom.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a focusing mirror adapted {{for use in}} solar heating apparatus, and to mechanism for directing the mirror toward the sun. It is one object of my invention to provide an improved mirror for such purposes so designed that a mirror of large size may be easily and economically constructed and that the curvature and focal length of the mirror may be readily adjusted to suit operating conditions.

5000|$|Starting in 2011, {{the points}} system and Chase {{qualification}} criteria were significantly changed. Through the 2013 season, the top 10 drivers after 26 races automatically {{qualified for the}} Chase, joined by the two drivers with the most race wins among those ranked between 11th and 20th in points after 26 races. Reflecting a major change to the points system, in which the race winner can now earn a maximum of 48 points as opposed to 195 in the former system, driver points were reset to a base of 2,000. After the <b>reset,</b> <b>automatic</b> qualifiers received 3 bonus points for each race win, while the wild card qualifiers did not receive a bonus for wins. In the 2013 season, a 13th driver (Jeff Gordon) {{was added to the}} Chase following a major scandal in the final pre-Chase race in which two teams were found to have extensively manipulated the race results in the final laps.|$|R
50|$|Prominently {{placed at}} the top are the large wind-on and rewind knobs, the {{right-hand}} one is the film advance knob, both to be operated in the clockwise direction. Next to it is a manually <b>reset</b> <b>automatic</b> frame counter dial and the chromed wind-on release button, the latter not to be mistaken for the shutter release. The front element focusing Kodak lens has a rigid lensmount set in a Kodak inter-lens shutter. The shutter is cocked by a gear coupling to the sprocket-wheel drum, which is trailing along with the passing film during the wind-on operation. Hence, there is no shutter cocking without a film in the camera. An automatic mechanism locates the next frame on the film by locking the advance knob. It is released for the next frame by depressing the wind-on release button before turning the wind-on knob. This prevents double exposure, but not blank frames since nothing prevents pressing the button again and advance the film. However, a red indicator is shown to the left in a slot {{on the top of}} the shutter cover that indicates the camera has been wound. The shutter release, in the shape of a rearward-pointing pin attached to the shutter release lever, is situated at about 10-o'clock at the shutter housing. It is protected from being accidentally triggered by a small cover extending over it.|$|R
5000|$|In Popov's {{lightning}} detector the coherer (C) {{was connected}} to an antenna (A), and to a separate circuit with a relay (R) and battery (V) which operated an electric bell (B). The radio noise generated by a lightning strike turned on the coherer, the current from the battery {{was applied to the}} relay, closing its contacts, which applied current to the electromagnet (E) of the bell, pulling the arm over to ring the bell. Popov added an innovative <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> feature of a [...] "self tapping" [...] coherer where the bell arm would spring back and tap the coherer, restoring it to its receptive state. The two chokes (L) in the coherer's leads prevented the radio signal across the coherer from short circuiting by passing through the DC circuit. He connected his receiver to a wire antenna (A) suspended high in the air and to a ground (earth) (G). The antenna idea may have been based on a lightning rod and was an early use of a monopole wire aerial.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the take-up spool in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} design {{and control of the}} &# 147;GreenWeeder&# 148;, a non-herbicidal {{autonomous}} weeding robot, in order to autonomously track crop rows for weeding through electrocution in the inter-row space. The four wheel mobile robot platform was designed and built with a motorised Ackerman steering system allowing the robot to steer up to 30 degree left and right. It was also equipped with an electronically geared rear wheel drive, a pair of stereo cameras, a SICK LMS- 291 laser range finder to localize itself with respect to the crop rows, a GPS system for obtaining the robot position in the field and a long-range communication system for tele-supervision by operators. The first prototype of the robot electrocution system was also designed and constructed to ignite 22 kV electrical arcs to destroy weeds. Its operation was tested in the research field of the University of Sydney and the results of this experiment were analysed to improve the efficiency of this first prototype. An improved prototype of the electrocution system was then constructed and attached to a cradle extending out {{at the back of the}} mobile robot platform. The testing of this improved prototype was conducted at Lansdowne farm, a research field of the University of Sydney. After the construction of the robot platform, the robot control was considered with the demands for robot localization with respect to crop rows, an autonomously tracking control system and a manual control mode in order to take the robot to transportation vehicles. Firstly, the robot localization was accomplished by utilizing SICK LMS- 291 laser range finder sensor for the sensing and perception of the robot. Secondly, the robot control system was developed with a PID controller, a second order model of the robot system and a first order filter. The PID controller is in the standard form with the filtered derivative and the PI part being in <b>automatic</b> <b>reset</b> configuration. The second order model was identified using Matlab System Identification toolbox based on the robot kinematic analysis. The first order filter is utilized for filtering out the lateral deviations of the robot with respect to the crop rows received from the SICK laser sensor. A Simulink simulation model of the robot control system was also built in order to fine-tune PID and filter parameters. Thirdly, the manual control mode of the robot was produced. In this mode, a joystick can be attached to a notebook to wirelessly drive the robot around or it can be plugged into a USB port at the back of the robot to drive it without the notebook. After the robot control was implemented and simulated, some experiments were conducted with the robot autonomously tracking a strip of reflective tape mimicking a crop row stuck into the ground of a laboratory. Depending on distances from the row assigned to the controller, the robot tried to keep those distances away from the row. The results showed the lateral errors of the robot with respect to the row were approximately 4. 5 cm which were sufficient for our current agricultural application...|$|E
