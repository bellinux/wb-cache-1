5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product of protein metabolism. A mutation in the genes regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Station 2 {{generating}} {{units were}} taken out of operation in 1978, but as late as 2009 the building was used for such purposes as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> water treatment facility for the adjacent operational units, office and warehouse space, and transmission and fiber optic lines.|$|E

5|$|The same historians {{would not}} {{consider}} the immense logistical effort fielded by the U.S. to sustain its military in Southeast Asia as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of manpower and resources, even if only one American soldier in four assigned to South Vietnam served in the combat arms.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He {{was the first to}} appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who felt it was <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.|$|E

5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sulfur}} cycle, archaea that grow by {{oxidizing}} sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms. However, the archaea that do this, such as Sulfolobus, produce sulfuric acid as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product, {{and the growth}} of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly did {{not enjoy}} his time at the overcrowded Sydney Teachers College (STC), decrying the lack of {{practical}} training and the predominance of pedagogical theory. Regarding it as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time, he happily accepted an offer of work experience from Major Cook-Russell, the head of physical education at STC, to help at Naremburn College instead of attending lectures. This angered Professor Alexander Mackie, the head of STC, whom both Cook-Russell and O'Reilly regarded as incompetent.|$|E
5|$|One well-understood {{example of}} {{mutualism}} is {{the interaction between}} protozoa and methanogenic archaea in the digestive tracts of animals that digest cellulose, such as ruminants and termites. In these anaerobic environments, protozoa break down plant cellulose to obtain energy. This process releases hydrogen as <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product, but high levels of hydrogen reduce energy production. When methanogens convert hydrogen to methane, protozoa benefit from more energy.|$|E
5|$|Rubber seed oil, pressed {{from the}} seeds of the Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), has {{received}} attention as a potential use of what otherwise would be <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product from making rubber.

5|$|The Royal Marines Division were {{earmarked}} for Hardboiled, trained in mountain warfare, and given cold weather equipment. Realistic invasion plans were drawn up and Norwegian currency was stockpiled. These preparations met with considerable {{resistance from the}} armed forces, who considered the operation to be <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of effort. The need for soldiers in real operations and training meant that, in the end, {{a lot of the}} preparation never occurred.|$|E
5|$|The journal has {{developed}} {{standards for the}} publication of mouse mutant studies. Many mouse mutant studies have serious methodological problems leading to fatally flawed scientific conclusions, causing <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time, effort, and research resources, and leading to ethical problems because of the unnecessary use of live animals for flawed studies. These standards are gradually being accepted more widely in the field.|$|E

5|$|Zelda {{had a deep}} {{desire to}} develop a talent that was entirely her own, perhaps a {{reaction}} to Scott's fame and success as a writer. At age27, she became obsessed with ballet, which she had studied as a girl. She had been praised for her dancing skills as a child, and although the opinions of their friends vary as to her skill, it appears that {{she did have a}} fair degree of talent. But Scott was totally dismissive of his wife's desire to become a professional dancer, considering it <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of time.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Although 85% {{of world}} crude {{production}} was still coming from Pennsylvania wells in the 1880s, drilling in Russia and Asia began {{to reach the}} world market. Robert Nobel had established his own refining enterprise in the abundant and cheaper Russian oil fields, including the region's first pipeline and the world's first oil tanker. The Paris Rothschilds jumped into the fray providing financing. Additional fields were discovered in Burma and Java. Even more critical, {{the invention of the}} light bulb gradually began to erode the dominance of kerosene for illumination. But Standard Oil adapted, developing a European presence, expanding into natural gas production in the U.S. then into gasoline for automobiles, which until then had been considered <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> product.|$|E
