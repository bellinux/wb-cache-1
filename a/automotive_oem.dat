30|$|From the {{perspective}} of <b>automotive</b> <b>OEMs,</b> the implementation of this transaction in a market setting {{would be associated with}} high risks. These risks especially arise from sensitive information that is stored in battery systems and could be exploited by competitors. Moreover, OEMs have to fear potential damages to their brands if battery systems are not adequately repurposed for safe and enduring operation or are utilized in unsuitable second life applications. Consequently, <b>automotive</b> <b>OEMs</b> are strongly interested in retaining control of their data, the repurposing process, and the repurposed battery systems’ targeted applications. Conducting this transaction in a market setting would not allow <b>automotive</b> <b>OEMs</b> to retain this level of control.|$|R

30|$|As {{depicted}} in the real-world cases above, automotive manufacturers (in the following denoted as <b>automotive</b> <b>OEMs)</b> act as component suppliers for used EVBs.

Offering customers a buy-down for their used EVBs and thus lowering an EV’s {{total cost of ownership}} (Cready et al. 2003; Elkind 2014) may create buying incentives for EVs that improve the <b>automotive</b> <b>OEM’s</b> market position (ATI:MD°# 4). 1 Moreover, the currently still costly recycling of the battery components is further postponed and contrasted with potential earnings from repurposed EVBs (ATI:MD°# 3).|$|R

30|$|Besides the buyer–seller {{relationship}} between <b>automotive</b> <b>OEM</b> and second life manufacturer also a reciprocal relationship {{can be observed}} where the <b>automotive</b> <b>OEM</b> as principal delegates obligations to reuse, or repurpose and recycle EV components to a second life manufacturer as an agent (see Fig.  2, right). Considering the present role allocation, the critical information asymmetry between <b>automotive</b> <b>OEM</b> and second life manufacturer occurs after the exchange of the used battery systems. Since the second life manufacturer is interested in maximizing profit but is affected by decreasing prices for new battery components (ATI:MD°# 4), the second life manufacturer has to limit the expenses for repurposing batteries.|$|E

30|$|At {{the end of}} an EVB’s first (automotive) life, battery {{redemption}} {{takes place}} (Gohla-Neudecker et al. 2015; Bräuer 2016).

To prevent non-authorized third parties from performing maintenance work on the battery systems or accessing the battery systems’ usage and status data, <b>automotive</b> <b>OEM’s</b> employ proprietary components that demand for OEM-specific equipment and that use encryption on battery-specific data streams and stored battery data (CBR:PE°# 2; SPR:MD°# 1,°# 3, CEI:M 1 °# 1, BRC:BR 2 °# 1) (Ahmadi et al. 2014; Monhof et al. 2015; Neubauer et al. 2015). Moreover, strong legal and regulatory requirements that result from an EVB’s hazard potential and its labeling as a dangerous good set high knowledge and equipment barriers for handling and transporting used EVBs (CRL:CR 1 °# 1, ATI:MD°# 5, BRC:BR 2 °# 1), which especially prevents most EV owners from performing maintenance work or the battery exchange on their own.|$|R
