40|$|Abstract. Native {{acceptor}} centres in CdGeAs 2 are studied using atomistic simulation {{techniques for}} which {{a new set of}} interatomic potential parameters consisting of two- and three-body terms is developed. Crystal lattice constants, elastic and low- and high-frequency dielectric constants are well reproduced in this atomistic model. The calculated formation energies for vacancies, interstitials and antisites in this material suggest that the intrinsic disorder is dominated by antisites in the cation sublattice followed by the Schottky and Frenkel defects. The <b>acceptor</b> <b>centre</b> identified by Hall-effect measurements and EPR is found {{to be related to the}} delocalized hole shared by the four As neighbours bound to CdGe. For this centre, calculations yield a binding energy of 0. 13 eV in an agreement with the experimental value of 0. 15 eV obtained by the Hall-effect measurements. Furthermore calculations provide the magnitude of the lattice distortion introduced by this <b>acceptor</b> <b>centre</b> in CdGeAs 2 which can be used for the analysis of ENDOR experiments. 1...|$|E

This RL band is characteristic of the luminescence of Fe 3 + ions in the ZnO crystals. It could be observed only after the UV laser treatment. No RL-EPR signal was detected for this RL band.

40|$|THE {{potential}} {{development of}} optoelectronic devices {{based on the}} nonlinear polarization of molecular materials has aroused much recent interest 1, 2. The search for large second-order electric susceptibilities (that is, proportional to the square of an applied electric field) has concentrated on acentric organic or organometallic chromophores with an organic pi-electron system coupling electron donor and acceptor groups 3 - 6. It is conceivable that mixed-valence compounds characterized by an intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) transition 7, in which the donor and <b>acceptor</b> <b>centres</b> are both metal atoms, might also {{have the potential to}} provide a large second-order response 8, but this possibility has not been widely explored. Here we report the first hyperpolarizability, beta, of a bimetallic complex ion, [(CN) 5 Ru-mu-CN-Ru(NH 3) 5]- (I in Fig. 1), and a novel organometallic analogue, [(eta 5 -C 5 H 5) Ru(PPh 3) 2 -mu-CN-Ru(NH 3) 5] 3 + (II). Measurements of beta (which is related to the bulk second-order response) in solution at a wavelength of 1, 064 nm using the newly developed hyper-Rayleigh scattering technique 9, 10 give values greater than 10 (- 27) e. s. u., which are among the largest reported for solution species.

The electrical properties of the end members have been investigated by impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 550 – 800 °C under various gas atmospheres and {{as a function of}} oxygen and water-vapour partial pressure. Proton transport dominates under wet oxidising conditions in the temperature range 550 – 700 °C, as confirmed by the H+/D+ isotope effect. Acceptor doping considerably enhances proton conductivity with a value of 3. 3 × 10 − 6 S cm− 1 for the bulk response of x = 0. 06 at 700 °C in moistened air. The presence of a −¼ slope for both doped and undoped samples in the range 10 − 19 ≤ pO 2 ≤ 10 − 8 atm at 900 °C indicates n-type transport under reducing conditions following the extrinsic model attributable to <b>acceptor</b> <b>centres.</b> The conductivity is essentially independent of pO 2 at 600 °C under dry oxidising conditions, consistent with oxide-ion transport; a positive power-law dependence at higher temperature indicates extrinsic behaviour and a significant electron–hole contribution.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a joint theoretical and experimental characterisation {{of the structural}} and electronic properties of two tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) -based acceptor-donor-acceptor triads (BQ-TTF-BQ and BTCNQ-TTF - BTCNQ; BQ is naphthoquinone and BTCNQ is benzotetracyano-p-quinodimethane) in their neutral and reduced states. The study is performed {{with the use of}} electrochemical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemical techniques guided by quantum-chemical calculations. Emphasis is placed on the mixed-valence properties of both triads in their radical anion states. The electrochemical and EPR results reveal that both BQ-TTF-BQ and BTCNQ-TTF-BTCNQ triads in their radical anion states behave as class-II mixed-valence compounds with significant electronic communication between the acceptor moieties. Density functional theory calculations (BLYP 35 /cc-pVTZ), taking into account the solvent effects, predict charge-localised species (BQ. [...] TTF-BQ and BTCNQ. [...] TTF-BTCNQ) as the most stable structures for the radical anion states of both triads. A stronger localisation is found both experimentally and theoretically for the BTCNQ-TTF-BTCNQ anion, in accordance with the more electron-withdrawing character of the BTCNQ acceptor. CASSCF/CASPT 2 calculations suggest that the low-energy, broad absorption bands observed experimentally for the BQ-TTF-BQ and BTCNQ-TTF-BTCNQ radical anions are associated with the intervalence charge transfer (IV-CT) electronic transition and two nearby donor-to-acceptor CT excitations.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was the {{investigation}} of energy transfer between charge transfer states. For this purpose the multidimensional chromophores HAB-S, HAB-A, B 1 and B 2 were synthesised, each consisting of three electron donor and three electron <b>acceptor</b> redox <b>centres</b> linked symmetrically or asymmetrically by the hexaarylbenzene framework. Triarylamines represent in all these compounds the electron donors, whereas the electron poor centres were triarylboranes in B 1 and B 2 and PCTM centres in HAB-S and HAB-A, respectively. The hexaarylbenzenes were obtained by cobalt catalysed cyclotrimerisation of the respective tolan precursors. In addition, Star was synthesised, which consists of a central PCTM linked to three triarylamin centres by tolan bridging units in a star-like configuration. The hexaarylbenzene S 1 a/b substituted with six squaraine chromophores could not be realised. It is assumed that the cyclotrimerisation catalyst Co 2 (CO) 8 does not tolerate the essential hydroxyl groups in the tolan precursor S 2 a. The alternative reaction pathway to execute the cyclotrimerisation reaction first and introduce the hydroxyl groups thereafter failed as well, because the required hexaarylbenzene substituted by six semisquaric acid moieties could not be synthesised. However, energy transfer interactions could be investigated in the tolan precursor S 2 a with two squaraine units to obtain information about the electronic coupling provided by the tolan bridge. For all multidimensional compounds model molecules were synthesised with only a single donor-acceptor pair (B 3, Star-Model and HAB-Model). This allows a separate consideration of energy and charge transfer processes. It has to be stressed that in all before mentioned multidimensional compounds the “through bond” energy transfer interaction between neighbouring IV-CT states is identical to a transfer of a single electron between two redox centres {{of the same kind}} (e. g. TAA -> TAA+). The latter can be analysed by electron transfer theory. This situation is observed when the two IV-CT states transferring energy share one redox centre. All compounds containing PCTM centres were characterised by paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Thereby, a weak interaction between the three PCTM units in HAB-S and HAB-A was observed. In addition, when oxidising Star-Model, a strongly interacting singlet or triplet state was obtained. In contrast, signals corresponding to a weakly interacting biradical were obtained for HAB-Model+. This indicates a strong electronic coupling between the redox centres provided by the tolan bridge and a weak coupling when linked by the hexaarylbenzene. This trend is supported by UV/Vis/NIR absorption measurements. The analysis of the observed IV-CT absorption bands by electron transfer theory reveals a weak electronic coupling of V = 340 cm- 1 in HAB-Model and a distinctly stronger coupling of V = 1190 - 2900 cm- 1 in Star-Model. In the oxidised HAB-S+, Star+ and Star-Model+ a charge transfer reversed from that of the neutral species, that is, from the PCTM radical to the electron poorer cationic TAA centre, was observed by spectroelectrochemistry. The temporal evolution of the excited states was monitored by ultrafast transient absorption measurements. Within the first picosecond stabilisation of the charge transfer state was observed, induced by solvent rotation. Anisotropic transient absorption measurements revealed that within the lifetime of the excited state (tau = 1 - 4 ps) energy transfer does not occur in the HABs whereas in the star-like system ultrafast and possibly coherent energy redistribution is observed. Taken this information together the identity between energy transfer and electron transfer in the specific systems were made apparent. It has to be remarked that neither energy transfer nor charge transfer theory can account for the very fast energy transfer in Star. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of B 1 and B 2 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, absorption and fluorescence measurements and were compared to B 3 with only one neighbouring donor-acceptor pair. For the asymmetric B 2 CV measurements show three oxidations as well as three reduction peaks whose peak separation is greatly influenced by the conducting salt due to ion-pairing and shielding effects. Consequently, peak separations cannot be interpreted in terms of electronic couplings in the generated mixed valence species. Transient absorption, fluorescence solvatochromism and absorption spectra show that charge transfer states from the amine to the boron centres are generated after optical excitation. The electronic donor-acceptor interaction is weak though as the charge transfer has to occur predominantly through space. The electronic coupling could not be quantified as the CT absorption band is superimposed by pi-pi* transitions localised at the amine and borane centres. However, this trend is in good agreement to the weak coupling measured for HAB-Model. Both transient absorption and fluorescence upconversion measurements indicate an ultrafast stabilisation of the charge transfer state in B 1 - B 3 similar to the corresponding observations in HAB-S and Star. Moreover, the excitation energy of the localised excited charge transfer states can be redistributed between the aryl substituents of these multidimensional chromophores within fluorescence lifetime (ca. 60 ns). This was proved by steady state fluorescence anisotropy measurements, which further indicate a symmetry breaking in the superficially symmetric HAB. Anisotropic fluorescence upconversion measurements confirm this finding and reveal a time constant of tau = 2 - 3 ps for the energy transfer in B 1 and B 2. It has to be stressed that, although the geometric structures of B 1 and HAB-S are both based on the same framework and furthermore the neighbouring CT states show in both cases similar Coulomb couplings and negligible “through bond” couplings, very fast energy transfer is observed in B 1 whereas in HAB-S the energy is not redistributed within the excited state lifetime. To explain this, it has to be kept in mind that the energy transfer and the relaxation of the CT state are competing processes. The latter is influenced moreover by the solvent viscosity. Hence, it is assumed that this discrepancy in energy transfer behaviour is caused by monitoring the excited state in solvents of varying viscosity. Adding fluoride ions causes the boron centres to lose their acceptor ability due to complexation. Consequently, the charge transfer character in the donor-acceptor chromophores vanishes which could be observed in both the absorption and fluorescence spectra. However, the fluoride sensor ability of the boron centre is influenced strongly by the moisture content of the solvent possibly due to hydrogen bonding of water to the fluoride anions. UV/Vis/NIR absorption measurements of S 2 a show a red-shift by 1800 cm- 1 of the characteristic squarain band compared to the model compound S 20. From exciton theory a Coulomb coupling of V = 410 cm- 1 is calculated which cannot account for this strong spectral shift. Consequently, “through-bond” interactions have to contribute to the strong communication between the two squaraine chromophores in S 2 a. This is in accordance with the strong charge transfer coupling calculated for the tolan spacer in Star-Model. Ziel dieser Arbeit war die Untersuchung des Energietransfers zwischen Ladungstransfer-Zuständen in multidimensional Donor-Akzeptor Systemen. Zu diesem Zweck wurden die Chromophore HAB-S, HAB-A, B 1 und B 2 synthetisiert. Diese bestehen jeweils aus drei Elektronen-Donoren und Elektronen-Akzeptoren, die über das Hexaarylbenzol-Gerüst symmetrisch oder asymmetrisch verknüpft sind. Triarylamine stellen dabei die Elektronen-Donoren dar, während Triarylborane in B 1 und B 2 und PCTM-Zentren in HAB-S und HAB-A die Aufgabe der Elektronen-Akzeptoren übernehmen. Die Hexaarylbenzole konnten durch Cobalt-katalysierte Cyclotrimerisierung der entsprechenden Tolan-Vorstufen hergestellt werden. Zusätzlich wurde das multidimensionale Chromophor Star synthetisiert. Dieses besteht aus einem zentralen PCTM, welches über Tolan-Brückeneinheiten sternförmig mit drei Triarylamin Zentren verknüpft ist. Das Hexaarylbenzol S 1 a/b, das mit sechs Squarain Chromophoren substituiert ist, konnte nicht realisiert werden. Möglichweise werden die essentiellen Hydroxygruppen der Tolan-Vorstufe S 2 a nicht von dem Cyclotrimerisierungs-Katalysator Co 2 (CO) 8 toleriert. Der alternative Reaktionsweg, die Cyclotrimerisierung zuerst durchzuführen und anschließend die Hydroxygruppen einzuführen, schlug ebenfalls fehl. Grund dafür war, dass das Hexaarylbenzol, welches mit sechs Quadratsäure-Einheiten substituiert ist, nicht synthetisiert werden konnte. Nichtsdestotrotz konnten Energietransfer Wechselwirkungen in der Tolan-Vorstufe S 2 a untersucht werden. Dabei konnte die elektronische Kopplung zwischen den zwei Squarain-Zentren charakterisiert werden. Zu allen multidimensionalen Verbindungen wurden zusätzlich Modelverbindungen mit nur einem einzelnen Donor-Akzeptor-Paar hergestellt (B 3, Star-Model und HAB-Model). Dadurch konnten die Energie- und Ladungstransferprozesse getrennt betrachten werden. Es soll noch angemerkt werden, dass in allen genannten multidimensionalen Verbindungen der Energietransfer „über Bindungen“ zwischen zwei benachbarten IV-CT Zuständen identisch ist mit dem Transfer eines einzelnen Elektrons zwischen zwei gleichartigen Redoxzentren (z.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} under the ongoing programme on the study of the as yet uninvestigated characteristics of the transition metal-related defects in silicon in the Semiconductor Physics Laboratory. Pd- and Pt-related defects in silicon had a 1 ready been characterised in this Laboratory using deep-level transient spectroscopy. Now the same technique has been employed to study the defects in silver- and gold-doped silicon. The emission rate signatures, activation energies, and the values for capture cross-sections of main silver-and gold-related defect levels are reported in literature. A detailed survey of the available information on these and other characteristics of TM-related defects, is {{presented in}} Chapter 2. From a review of the available data it emerges that investigations of the effects of irradiation and thermal annealing on the silver- and gold-related defects in silicon are either scarce or lacking in the literature. The response of the TM-related defects to irradiation and annealing are expected to provide a deeper insight into the nature of the defects. During this work, the effects of alpha irradiation on silver-related defects in p- and n-type silicon and gold-related defects in n-type silicon have been studied. Isochronal thermal annealing characteristics of the TM-related defects before and after irradiation have formed another focus of our study. In addition to the characterisation of silver- and gold-related defects, some striking new aspects of the Fe-related deep levels in silicon have also been unravelled by our study. The samples used for these measurements were either linearly graded (Ag-doped p-type silicon) or step junctions (Ag- and Au-doped n-type silicon). 5. 48 MeV alpha-particles from 241 Am were used for irradiation of the samples. The linearly graded nature of the n + p junctions used allowed the acceptor(Ec - 0. 54 eV) and donor (Ev + 0. 35 eV) levels associated with silver to be studied simultaneously. The acceptor level was found to be stable against thermal annealing performed upto 400 Â°C, while the donor level showed a decrease beyond 300 Â°c Important effects related with rapid thermal quenching of samples were revealed by a comparison of our data with the corresponding data on identical virgin (unquenched) samples. Irradiation by Î±-particles led to interesting new insights into the interaction of silver-related defects and the radiation-induced defects. New aspects of the kinetics and formation mechanism of the carbon-related defects in Si were brought to light {{as a result of the}} room temperature isothermal annealing and higher temperature isochronal annealing studies on the irradiated samples with and without silver. Irradiation also produces interesting effects on the Ag-related levels - while the acceptor level Ag(A) remained more or less stable, the donor level Ag(D) showed a small but systematic increase in concentration with a. -radiation dose. These observations, together with the different annealing behaviours, suggested that the two levels due to silver are not coupled states of the same defect. New levels, in addition to the well known silver-related deep donor and acceptor levels, have been found during the investigations on silver-doped n-type silicon. Isochronal thermal annealing before and after irradiation provide interesting insights on interactions between the TM-related and radiation-induced defects and on the nature of the silver-related levels. In particular, the two newly observed prominent silver-related levels exhibit a complementary annealing behaviour, suggesting a mutual thermal transformation. The presence of silver is seen to produce a significant change in the annealing characteristics of the prominent radiation induced A-centre defect. Thermal annealing characteristics of the well-known gold acceptor up to temperatures as high as about 600 Â°c were measured during pre-irradiation annealing of the gold-doped samples. This level was found to be very stable, supporting the substitutional-gold model for the <b>acceptor</b> <b>centre.</b> A slight reduction in the gold-acceptor concentration is observed due to irradiation, contrary to an earlier reported study. A noticeable suppression of the thermal stability of this level is also observed after irradiation. The presence of gold leads to a significant enhancement of the anneal-out temperature of the well-known A-centre defect. A deep level at Ec- 0. 34 eV, ascribed to the Fe-Au complex, is found to be enhanced by irradiation. We find no evidence to support the recently proposed gold-divacancy complex model of the gold acceptor - rather, our results strongly support the isolated substitutional impurity model for this centre. In addition to the effects indicated above, irradiation of above mentioned TM-doped silicon samples with alpha-particles produced the usual radiation-induced levels. A number of new annealed-in levels were also observed after thennal annealing. Emission rate signatures. activation energies and annealing characteristics of these annealed-in defects are reported in detail in this thesis. The interstitial iron (Fei) donor in thermally quenched p-type silicon and its interaction with Î±-radiation and 4 d and 5 d transition metals forms the last and a very interesting part of our study. This centre was revealed by minority cattier injection in our samples with no deliberate iron doping. A number of its characteristics including the emission rate signatures, its variation with thermal quenching temperature, its production on dissociation of iron-boron complex with minority carrier injection. its decay on room temperature storage after production and its (room temperature) isothermal and higher temperature isochronal annealing behaviours have been studied. These measurements definitively identify it with the inadvertent iron impurity in our samples. A significant reduction in the concentration of iron interstitial centre was observed after irradiation with alpha particles. A striking new property of the iron interstitial donor revealed by our investigations on p-silicon samples doped with transition metal impurities Ag (4 d), Pd (4 d), Au (5 d) and Pt(5 d) is a complete bleach out of the DLTS signal of the Fei donor in the presence of these impurities, leading to the suggestion that iron has a strong tendency to form complexes with these transition metal impurities...|$|E
