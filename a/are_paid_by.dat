A number of responsibilities are officially assigned to other development teams by the FreeBSD Core Team, for example, responsibility for managing the ports collection is delegated to the Ports Management Team.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} the issuer-pays model creates a {{potential}} conflict of interest because the agencies <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> the organizations whose debt they rate. However, the subscription model is also seen to have disadvantages, as it restricts the ratings' availability to paying investors. Issuer-pays CRAs have argued that subscription-models can also be subject to conflicts of interest due to pressures from investors with strong preferences on product ratings. In 2010 Lace Financials, a subscriber-pays agency later acquired by Kroll Ratings, was fined by the SEC for violating securities rules {{to the benefit of}} its largest subscriber.|$|E
25|$|Markham City Council {{consists}} of Frank Scarpitti as mayor, four regional councillors and eight ward councillors each representing {{one of the}} city's eight wards.

The current members of council were elected by the residents to a four-year term of office, in accordance with standards set by the province.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the central {{ownership}} of the teams, all players <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> the league. This is to ensure that no team receives an unfair advantage over any other with regards to financial success. The payscale has set a number of tiers which group players of similar experience levels, with all players in the same tier receiving the same pay. The ABL has considered the possibility of having one or two marquee players paid above the standard scale, though no final decision has been made with regard to this. One concern about high rates of pay expressed by the ABF was that it was a contributing factor, if not the main factor, in the failure of the previous Australian Baseball League. ABF management has also expressed the concern that if this league were to fail, there may never be another opportunity for professional baseball in Australia.|$|E

25|$|In the {{international}} comparison of modern tort law, common law jurisdictions based upon English tort law have foundational differences from civil law jurisdiction, {{which may be}} based on the Roman concept of delict. Even among common law countries, however, significant differences exist. For example, in England legal fees of the winner <b>are</b> <b>paid</b> <b>by</b> the loser (the English rule versus the American rule of attorney fees). Common law systems include United States tort law, Australian tort law, Canadian tort law, Irish tort law, and Scots Law of Delict. The Jewish law of rabbinic damages is another example although tort in Israeli law is technically similar to English law as it was enacted by British Mandate of Palestine authorities in 1944 and took effect in 1947. There is more apparent split between the Commonwealth countries (principally England, Canada and Australia) and the United States, although Canada may be more influenced by the United States due to its proximity.|$|E
