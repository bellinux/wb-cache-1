40|$|This paper {{examines}} recessions <b>and</b> <b>recoveries</b> {{in advanced}} economies {{and the role}} of countercyclical macroeconomic policies. Are recessions <b>and</b> <b>recoveries</b> associated with financial crises different from others? What are the main features of globally synchronized recessions? Can countercyclical policies help to shorten recessions <b>and</b> strengthen <b>recoveries?</b> The results suggest that recessions associated with financial crises tend to be unusually severe <b>and</b> that <b>recoveries</b> from such recessions are typically slow. Similarly, globally synchronized recessions are often long <b>and</b> deep, <b>and</b> <b>recoveries</b> from these recessions are generally weak. Countercyclical monetary policy can help shorten recessions, but its effectiveness is limited in financial crises. By contrast, expansionary fiscal policy seems particularly effective in shortening recessions associated with financial crises <b>and</b> in boosting <b>recoveries.</b> However, its effectiveness is a decreasing function of the level of public debt. These findings suggest that the current recession is likely to be unusually long and severe <b>and</b> the <b>recovery</b> sluggish...|$|R

40|$|A tubular ceramic {{membrane}} is investigated as the condenser for simultaneous heat <b>and</b> water <b>recovery</b> from flue gas. The {{effects of the}} operational parameters, such as fluid (gas and water) flow rates, temperatures of flue gas and coolant water, and flue gas humidity on the process performance in terms of mass and heat transfer across the membrane are studied. Particularly, the {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} is also evaluated. As the gas flow rate increases, water and heat transfer efficiencies <b>and</b> <b>recoveries</b> decline due to the reduced residence time. Increasing the water flow rate or lowing the coolant temperature can effectively improve mass and heat transfer efficiencies <b>and</b> <b>recoveries.</b> Increasing the temperature of the inlet gas can enhance water and heat fluxes <b>and</b> <b>recoveries,</b> but does not improve the overall heat transfer efficiency. The rise in flue gas humidity can dramatically improve water and heat transfer rates and the overall heat transfer coefficient, but has little effect on water <b>and</b> heat <b>recoveries.</b> These results offer a general guideline in optimising the operational parameters in low-grade heat recovery with membrane heat exchangers, and it may greatly advance the development of membrane condensation technology for practical low-grade heat recovery. 8 page(s...|$|R

The global economy is experiencing the deepest downturn in the post–World War II period, as the financial crisis rapidly spreads around the world (see Chapters 1 and 2). A large number of advanced economies have fallen into recession, and economies {{in the rest of the}} world have slowed abruptly. Global trade and financial flows are shrinking, while output and employment losses mount.
