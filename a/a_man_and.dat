5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E

5|$|After their {{trips to}} the Himalaya, the Workmans gave lectures about their travels. They were invited to learned societies; Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne and the second {{to speak at the}} Royal Geographical Society. She {{received}} many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was {{recognized as one of the}} foremost climbers of her day. She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> helped break down the gender barrier in mountaineering.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, {{although they are}} unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In <b>A</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his Ba, a man recounts for an audience a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E

50|$|With {{regards to}} births and marriages, under the Black Code, {{there was no}} legal {{recognition}} of the father’s situation; a marriage between <b>a</b> free <b>man</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> slave woman was not legally recognized.

5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the universe has more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|De Stem des Bloeds (The Voice of Blood), {{also known}} as Njai Siti, is a 1930 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). It was {{directed}} by Ph. Carli and starred Annie Krohn, Sylvain Boekebinder, Vally Lank, and Jan Kruyt. The film follows <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> his mistress who reunite after their son and step-daughter unwittingly fall in love. The black-and-white film, which may now be lost, was tinted different colours for certain scenes. It was released in early 1930 to commercial success, although critical opinion was mixed.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>and</b> they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Bancroft was {{commissioned}} {{to design a}} large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in Marrickville, New South Wales.

5|$|Maryland holds {{a unique}} {{place in the}} history of {{same-sex}} marriage in the United States. In 1973, it became the first state in the nation to define marriage as a union between <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>and</b> a woman, expressly banning same-sex marriage. The General Assembly passed the law a short time after voters in the state ratified Article 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, commonly referred to as the Equal Rights Amendment, in November 1972. The constitutional provision prohibited discrimination in equality of rights on the basis of sex.|$|E
