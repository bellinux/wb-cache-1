5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>disk,</b> {{the intersection of}} any two tiles is a single connected set or the empty set, and all tiles are uniformly bounded.

5|$|First {{shown as}} a {{technical}} and thematic demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division. Both were the first free-roaming 3D game in their respective series. Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release Ocarina of Time for the 64DD, <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> drive peripheral for the system which was also still in development.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{a sequel}} for the Nintendo 64, Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole. The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars. P2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars. The A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.|$|E
50|$|A virtual {{drive is}} a {{software}} component that emulates <b>an</b> actual <b>disk</b> drive, {{such as an}} optical disc drive, <b>a</b> floppy <b>disk</b> drive, or <b>a</b> hard <b>disk</b> drive. To other programs, a virtual drive looks and behaves like an actual physical device.|$|R

5|$|Launched in 1983, {{the space}} {{telescope}} IRAS detected infrared emissions from stars near to the Sun, including an excess infrared emission from Epsilon Eridani. The observations indicated <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> of fine-grained cosmic dust was orbiting the star; this debris disk has since been extensively studied. Evidence for a planetary system was discovered in 1998 by the observation of asymmetries in this dust ring. The clumping in the dust distribution {{could be explained by}} gravitational interactions with a planet orbiting just inside the dust ring.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> shape, tidal forces from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E

5|$|Vega {{became the}} first solitary main-sequence star beyond the Sun known to be an X-ray emitter when in 1979 it was {{observed}} from an imaging X-ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands Missile Range. In 1983, Vega {{became the first}} star found to have <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> of dust. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star, and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star.|$|E
5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained immersed in <b>a</b> <b>disk</b> {{of gas and}} dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets in their current orbits.|$|E

After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
5|$|Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96.

It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the unaided eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth's.|$|E
