50|$|On May, 2009, {{the game}} {{was removed from the}} App Store {{concerning}} a trademark dispute with Tim Langdell of Edge Games. This is one of several disputes Langdell had made over his <b>apparent</b> <b>ownership</b> of the trademark for the word 'edge'. Mobigame head David Papazian failed to come up with any negotiation with Langdell, who kept insisting on receiving revenue from the game while it was on sale. Mobigame's lawyers disputed that Langdell's trademarks over the word 'edge' were enforceable against them, a comment to which Langdell denied in an open letter. This rebuttal was deemed false by Mobigame's lawyers, who said they are gathering evidence to demonstrate that communications Edge Games claims, in its rebuttal, to have made did not actually occur.|$|E

50|$|Existing {{published}} consumption figures tend {{to underestimate}} the consumption seen in practice by 20 to 30%. The reason is partly that the official fuel consumption tests are not sufficiently representative of real world usage.

50|$|UCL’s Academic Committee Review Panel {{noted in}} its report that, {{according}} to the Institute’s own review findings, senior members of UCL staff had been aware of issues with students results but had not taken action to address them. The Review Panel {{concluded that there was}} an <b>apparent</b> lack of <b>ownership</b> of these matters amongst the Institute’s senior staff. It concluded that assessment data had been corrupted through human error; as a result of inconsistent processes and poor quality assurance; poor record keeping; and poor oversight.|$|R
40|$|We {{employ a}} new, large, and {{confidential}} panel of US income tax returns {{for the period}} 1987 - 2009 to extensively characterize and quantify business income risks and to compare to labor income or earnings risks. Our findings show business income to be much riskier than labor income, even conditional on a household’s continued participation in private business endeavors. Compared to labor income, business income is less persistent, and it is characterized by higher probabilities of extreme upward or downward mobility. Our data also suggest that high-income households {{are more likely to}} face the tail risks on both ends of the business income distribution. Furthermore, we find that, as compared to labor income, the cross-sectional variation in business income is less explained by heterogeneity across households than within household income variation. Finally, we use our models of income dynamics models to calibrate a life-cycle model with endogenous business ownership to explain an <b>apparent</b> business <b>ownership</b> puzzle...|$|R

25|$|In June 2016 it was {{reported}} in the Times Higher Education {{that as a result of}} administrative errors hundreds of students who studied at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute between 2005–6 and 2013–14 had been given the wrong marks, leading to an unknown number of students being attributed with the wrong qualifications and, in some cases, being failed when they should have passed their degrees. A report by UCL’s Academic Committee Review Panel noted that, according to the Institute’s own review findings, senior members of UCL staff had been aware of issues affecting students' results but had not taken action to address them.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{application}} and viability of a participatory development model through {{an examination of}} the barriers to community <b>ownership</b> <b>apparent</b> within the Namwera and Chiponde Afforestation Project (NCAP); a community-initiated forestry project developed in response to wood-fuel scarcity in the Mangochi District of Southern Malawi. Despite its participatory design, project stakeholders continued to express aspirations for increased material sponsorship, which project facilitators considered to be incompatible with the guiding principle of the participant driven development model-ownership. Conflicting views concerning sponsorship illustrate {{the degree to which the}} regional development context, defined by satisfying immediate needs, challenges community ownership of the NCAP. To that end, as a case the NCAP embodies both the possibilities and the constraints faced by these types of initiatives and the development model that underpins them.

40|$|A large, highly ranked public {{university}} implemented {{a requirement for}} all incoming undergraduates to own a laptop computer starting in fall, 2000. To control increased expenditures for information technology, this requirement has shifted some {{of the cost of}} technology to students by decreasing the need for centralized general-purpose computing laboratories. At the same time, a shift towards centralized academic computing support occurred. This shift was away from information technology resources, services and support based in individual departments. This shift, engineered by the newly formed office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), was envisioned to generate cost savings through economies of scale. The educational impact of the laptop requirement is starting to be felt, but adoption is not widespread in daily classroom use. Envisioned cost savings have not yet become <b>apparent.</b> However, laptop <b>ownership</b> has enabled some new classroom activities, and helped to reinforce the leading-edge image of the university.

40|$|When {{ownership}} {{is concentrated in}} a few individuals, and/or family members, differences in management approaches are <b>apparent.</b> Data about <b>ownership</b> concentration in Australian organisations is difficult to secure, {{with the exception of}} publicly listed firms. In an Australian first, this study examines the Top 500 private Australian firms to ascertain the extent to which family firms are present. The findings reveal that family firms contribute significantly to Australia’s economic and social stability. There are 121 family firms (24 %) in the Top 500 private Australian firms. On average, these top family firms contribute around A$ 42 m (12 %) more revenue per firm than their non‐ family counterparts and employee approximately 303 (30 %) more employees. The economic and social significance of these differences position family firms as {{an important part of the}} Australian economy. Research into the unique issues facing family firms must not b...|$|R
40|$|Since EU {{accession}} the Hungarian dairy industry’s {{domestic market}} has generally expanded as turnover and consumption have both grown, {{but this has}} been increasingly due to cheap imports, while the purchase and sale of domestic products has been decreasing or stagnating (both in the domestic and foreign markets). The growth in imports has cut Hungarian corporations domestic market share to 80 %. In Hungary corporate concentration has become even more pronounced with large corporations further strengthening their position and smaller ones further shrinking. Moreover, foreign ownership prevails and has the primary aim of meeting domestic demand. Changes in ownership contribute to the strengthening of vertical integration. Still, in the EU corporate concentration trends also exist. However, in the current fierce competitive market, {{it is not yet}} <b>apparent</b> whether non-producer <b>ownership</b> or co-operative ownership is more viable. Therefore the increase in Hungarian owners and ownership of processing plants by (Hungarian) producers does not necessarily signal the end of the crisis, but may in fact still signal decline. Positive aspects are increasing concentration and, from the consumers’ standpoint, cheaper dairy products. Cheaper milk products have put great pressure on milk producers (lower milk prices), and have had a positive effect on consumption trends. Milk drinks and some new milk products have been replaced by products with lower milk content and milk-imitations.
