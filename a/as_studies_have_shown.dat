5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
25|$|Early {{diagnosis}} {{in children}} is crucial <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> {{that the children}} with VUR who present with a UTI and associated acute pyelonephritis {{are more likely to}} develop permanent renal cortical scarring than those children without VUR, with an odds ratio of 2.8. Thus VUR not only increases the frequency of UTI's, but also the risk of damage to upper urinary structures and end-stage renal disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{logarithmic}} gap {{takes the}} form G(L) = A + ClnL and was proposed <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> <b>shown</b> the distribution of indel sizes obey a power law. Another proposed issue {{with the use of}} affine gaps is the favoritism of aligning sequences with shorter gaps. Logarithmic gap penalty was invented to modify the affine gap so that long gaps are desirable. However, in contrast to this, it has been found that using logarithmatic models had produced poor alignments when compared to affine models.|$|R

25|$|The neurobehavioral {{assessment}} battery {{that was}} used in the Van Dongen et al. study included the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT). The PVT - which determines alertness and the effects of fatigue on cognitive performance (as determined by lapses in response time and accuracy of responses) by measuring the speed with which subjects respond to a visual or auditory stimulus (by pressing a response button) - has become a standard laboratory tool for the assessment of sustained performance in a variety of experimental conditions. The PVT detects changes in basic neurobehavioral performance that involve vigilant attention, response speed, and impulsivity; and it has been extensively validated in ground-based laboratory studies to detect cognitive deficits that are caused by a variety of factors (e.g., restricted sleep, sleep/wake shifts, motion sickness, residual sedation from sleep medications). The PVT is an optimal tool for repeated use, in contrast to some other cognitive measures, <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> no minimal learning effects and aptitude differences when using the PVT.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recent article}} (Barksy, Kaplan, & Beal, 2011) {{provides}} {{a model that}} explains the role of affect and emotions at various stages of the appraisal and reaction stages of justice perception formation and illustrates that injustice is generally an affect-laden and subjective experience. [...] Affect and emotions {{can be part of}} the reactions to perceived injustice, <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that the more injustice that is perceived, the higher degrees of negative emotions are experienced. [...] In addition, affect can act as a mediator between justice perceptions and actions taken to redress the perceived injustice. [...] Affect plays this role in equity theory such that negative affective reactions act as a mediator between perceptions and actions, as emotional reactions to justice motivate individuals to take action to restore equity.|$|E
2500|$|Though vaginal {{birth is}} {{possible}} for the breech baby, certain fetal and maternal factors influence the safety of vaginal breech birth. The majority of breech babies born in the United States and the UK are delivered by caesarean section <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> increased risks {{of morbidity and mortality}} for vaginal breech delivery, and most obstetricians counsel against planned vaginal breech birth for this reason. [...] As a result of reduced numbers of actual vaginal breech deliveries, obstetricians and midwives are at risk of de-skilling in this important skill. All those involved in delivery of obstetric and midwifery care in the UK undergo mandatory training in conducting breech deliveries in the simulation environment (using dummy pelvises and mannequins to allow practice of this important skill) and this training is carried out regularly to keep skills up to date.|$|E

2500|$|Glucocorticoids {{have also}} been shown to have a {{significant}} impact on vigilance (attention deficit disorder) and cognition (memory). This appears to follow the Yerkes-Dodson curve, <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> circulating levels of glucocorticoids vs. memory performance follow an upside-down U pattern, much like the Yerkes-Dodson curve. For example, long-term potentiation (LTP; the process of forming long-term memories) is optimal when glucocorticoid levels are mildly elevated, whereas significant decreases of LTP are observed after adrenalectomy (low-GC state) or after exogenous glucocorticoid administration (high-GC state). Elevated levels of glucocorticoids enhance memory for emotionally arousing events, but lead more often than not to poor memory for material unrelated to the source of stress/emotional arousal. In contrast to the dose-dependent enhancing effects of glucocorticoids on memory consolidation, these stress hormones have been shown to inhibit the retrieval of already stored information. Long-term exposure to glucocorticoid medications, such as asthma and anti-inflammatory medication, has been shown to create deficits in memory and attention both during and, to a lesser extent, after treatment, a condition known as [...] "steroid dementia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness <b>as</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization {{is part of a}} parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. [...] Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.|$|E
