She clarified that the song was not just sexual: [...] "In that record I'm talking about one guy, I'm talking about one night <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want on this one night, and I'm not afraid to say it. Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E

It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. [...] Her daughter, Isabella, described Bergman's surprise at being offered the part and the producer {{trying to explain to}} her, [...] "People believe you and trust you, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people." [...] Isabella adds, [...] "Now that was interesting to Mother." [...] She was also persuaded that Golda was a [...] "grand-scale person," [...] one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role [...] "also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany." ...|$|E
2500|$|When I have {{a mental}} {{image of a}} triangle, for example, I don't just {{understand}} that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also [...] "look at" [...] the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. [...] <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I {{understand that it is}} a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or [...] "look" [...] at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura).
