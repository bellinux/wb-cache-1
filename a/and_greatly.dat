5|$|During the Mesozoic, the prototypical mammal {{was a small}} nocturnal {{insectivore}} {{something like}} a tree shrew. Due to their nocturnal habits, most mammals lost their color vision, <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> improved their sense of hearing. All mammals of today are shaped by this origin. Primates later re-evolved color-vision.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from delusional paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation in Le Soir in December 1943.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself in 282 BC as a major power on the Italian Peninsula, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the Mediterranean at the time: Carthage and the Greek kingdoms. Rome had all but completely defeated the Samnites, mastered its fellow Latin towns, <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced Etruscan power in the region. However, the south of Italy was controlled by the Greek colonies of Magna Grecia who had been allied to the Samnites, and continued Roman expansion brought the two into inevitable conflict.|$|E
5|$|Completion of the -long Wawona Tunnel in 1933 {{significantly}} reduced travel time to Yosemite Valley from Wawona. The famous Tunnel View {{is on the}} valley side of the tunnel and Old Inspiration Point is above it. A flood, reduced lumber and mining extraction, <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> increased automobile and bus use forced the Yosemite Valley Railway {{out of business in}} 1945. The present day Tioga Road, now part of California State Route 120, was dedicated in 1961.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, Allied {{submarine}} attacks effectively cut off {{the supply}} of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By {{this stage of the}} war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S.Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven aircraft carriers, two heavy and seven light cruisers. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all convoy routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by tankers by loading drums of oil on freighters. Several IJN aircraft carriers were also used to transport drums of oil from Singapore to Japan.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of legal education in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 in the newly built John A. Macdonald Hall. Other construction projects at Queen's in the 1950s included the construction of Richardson Hall to house Queen's administrative offices, and Dunning Hall. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000. Among the new facilities were three more residences and separate buildings for the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Psychology, Social Sciences and the Humanities.|$|E
5|$|Frederick's childrenWilhelm in particularheld various {{political}} positions <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> influenced Europe. Unlike his father, Wilhelm had not personally experienced {{the horrors of}} war, and he enthusiastically embraced his family's military heritage, coming under Bismarck's tutelage. The Chancellor, who disapproved of Frederick's and Victoria's liberal ways, felt bound to increase the tensions between Wilhelm and his parents. Wilhelm grew up full of disdain for their opinions on government, and shortly after his father's death, proclaimed that he would follow the path of his grandfather, William I. He made no reference to Frederick III. William II abandoned all of his father's policies and ideas, and eventually led Germany into World War I.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.|$|E

In 2010, in close {{cooperation with the}} Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on biological tissue. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several mutations of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutic drug therapies for the disease <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> assist with experimental nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of Aβ oligomers. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s Benjamin Ferrey was {{replaced}} by Decimus Burton, whose plans for Bournemouth included {{the construction of a}} garden alongside the Bourne stream, an idea first mooted by Granville. The fields south of the road crossing (later Bournemouth Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths, including the Invalids' Walk, remain in the town today. A second suggestion of Granville's, a sanatorium, was completed in 1855 <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> raised Bournemouth's profile as a place for recuperation.|$|E

5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live {{for as little as}} six months. The giant Pacific octopus, one of the two largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|Sappho was a {{prolific}} poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known <b>and</b> <b>greatly</b> admired {{through much of}} antiquity, and she was among the canon of nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Today, most of Sappho's poetry is lost, {{but it is still}} considered extraordinary, and her works have continued to influence other writers up until the modern day. Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women.|$|E

She provided gunfire support against the Germans during the Siege of Leningrad despite being bombed {{three times and}} under repair for a year. Retained on active duty after the war she became a training ship in 1954 before being struck off the Navy List in 1956 and slowly scrapped.|$|E
