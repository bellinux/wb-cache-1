40|$|Background: Socio-economic profile, {{demographic}} {{composition and}} access to care are important predictors of local health and health care use. How such predictors are associated with <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> at local level is unknown, but knowledge is essential to improve efficiency of preventive programs in risk areas. Objectives: We explored spatial patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus (<b>T</b> 2 DM) <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> at local level and determined its association with local demographic, socio-economic {{and access to}} care variables. Methods: Using the University of Groningen pharmacy database IADB. nl, we estimated the five-year prevalence of <b>T</b> 2 DM <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> (2005 - 2009) in persons aged 45 + at four-digit postal code level for two Dutch areas, totaling 141 postal code areas. Statistics Netherlands supplied data on potential predictor variables. We used empirical Bayes smoothing {{to deal with the}} small sample problem. We composed variables for socio-economic profile, ageing and access to care and estimated first an overall multiple linear regression model followed by two models for each separate geographical area. Results: Socioeconomic profile, ageing and access to care were all significant predictors for <b>T</b> 2 DM <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in the model incorporating both areas. In our first area (Groningen-Veendam) the smoothed prevalence of <b>T</b> 2 DM <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> ranged from 5. 0 % to 24. 3 %. Access to care and socio-economic profile were statistically significant predictors in this area. In the second area (Zwolle-Kampen-Noordoostpolder) smoothed prevalence ranged from 6. 2 % to 20. 2 %. Here, socioeconomic profile and ageing were significant predictors. The discriminative value of the model was higher in our first area (adjusted R-squared 0. 41 compared to 0. 25 in the second area). The unstandardized coefficients pertaining to the three composite predictors were similar in all three models, indicating that the relations with T 2 DM are roughly stable across space. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of socio-economic profile, ageing and access to care variables for explaining and projecting local health care use for type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R

Methods: The GEM 1 study was a 12 -week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study that randomized patients with stable, symptomatic COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation to twice-daily glycopyrrolate 15. 6 µg or placebo (1 : 1) via the Neohaler® device. The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of glycopyrrolate versus placebo in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours post morning dose at week 12. Other outcomes included additional spirometric end points, transition dyspnea index, St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment <b>Test,</b> rescue <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> and symptoms reported by patients via electronic diary. Safety was also assessed during the study. Results: Of the 441 patients randomized (glycopyrrolate, n= 222; placebo, n= 219), 96 % of patients completed the planned treatment phase. Glycopyrrolate demonstrated statistically significant (P< 0. 001) improvements in lung function versus placebo. Glycopyrrolate showed statistically significant improvement in the transition dyspnea index focal score, St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire total score, COPD Assessment <b>Test</b> score, rescue <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> and daily total symptom score versus placebo at week 12. Safety was comparable between the treatment groups. Conclusion: Significant improvement in lung function, dyspnea, COPD symptoms, health status, and rescue <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> suggests that glycopyrrolate is a safe and effective treatment option as maintenance bronchodilator in patients with stable, symptomatic COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation.

Understanding the varying methods to assess <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> is necessary to establish comparability and to understand the opportunities for pharmacoepidemiological analysis. The objective of this review was to compare and contrast how medication-related data have been collected in prospective cohorts of community-dwelling older Australians. MEDLINE and EMBASE (1990 - 2014) were systematically searched to identify prospective cohorts of ≥ 1000 older participants that commenced recruitment after 1990. The data collection tools <b>used</b> to assess <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in each cohort were independently examined by two investigators using a structured approach. Thirteen eligible cohorts were included. Baseline <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> was assessed in participant self-completed surveys (n = 3), by an investigator inspecting medications brought to a clinic interview (n = 7), and by interviewing participants in their home (n = 3). Five cohorts sought participant consent to access administrative claims data. Six cohorts used multiple methods to assess <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> across one or more study waves. All cohorts assessed <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> at baseline and 12 cohorts in follow-up waves.

40|$|Although {{pharmaceutical}} {{management is}} an integral part of asthma control, few community-based analyses have focused on this aspect of disease management. The primary goal of this analysis was to assess whether participation in the school-based Kickin’ Asthma program improved appropriate asthma <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> among middle school students. A secondary goal was to determine whether improvements in <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> were associated with subsequent improvements in asthma-related symptoms among participating students. Students completed an in-class case-identification questionnaire to determine asthma status. Eligible students were invited to enroll in a school-based asthma curriculum delivered over four sessions by an asthma health educator. Students completed a pre-survey and a 3 -month follow-up post-survey that compared symptom frequency and <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> From 2004 to 2007, 579 participating students completed pre- and post-surveys. Program participation resulted in improvements in appropriate use across all three <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> categories: 20. 0 % of students initiated appropriate reliever use when “feeling symptoms” (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), 41. 6 % of students reporting inappropriate <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> “before exercise” initiated reliever use (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and 26. 5 % of students reporting inappropriate <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> when “feeling fine” initiated controller use (p[*]<[*] 0. 02).

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this dissertation focuses on the association between sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> poor sleep, and falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older. Sleep complaints and the consumption of medications to aid sleep are common in older adults. Psychotropic medications, such as sedative hypnotics, are associated with risk of falls in older adults. However, very few studies have assessed the impact of poor sleep and sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> on the risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults. In the first project, a cross-sectional analysis of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 2010 data was conducted to determine the prevalence of sleep problems, sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> and falls; and to evaluate the association between sleep problems, sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> and falls in community-dwelling older adults. A multiple logistic model adjusted for covariates was used. In the sample of community-dwelling older adults, 35. 8 % had reported a fall and 40. 8 % had reported sleep problems {{in the past two}} years. Sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> was reported by 20. 9 % of the older adults. Older adults who had sleep problems and took sleep medications had a significantly higher risk of falls compared with older adults who did not have sleep problems and did not take sleep medications. The other two groups, older adults who had sleep problems and did not take sleep medications, {{and those who did not}} have sleep problems and took sleep medications also had a significantly greater risk for falls. The second project was a prospective cohort study of independently-living older adults from senior congregate housing. The effect of combined poor sleep quality and sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> on risk of falls was assessed using logistic regression modeling. In this study of 113 community-dwelling older adults, 46. 9 % had at least one fall, and 62. 8 % had poor sleep quality. Sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> was reported by 44. 2 % of the older adults. Older adults with poor sleep quality and sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> had a significantly increased risk of falls compared with older adults with good sleep quality and no sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> Older adults with good sleep quality and sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> and those with poor sleep quality and no sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> did not have a significantly greater risk for falls. In conclusion, poor sleep added to sleep <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> significantly increased the risk of falls in community-dwelling older adults.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In case-control {{studies that}} assess {{associations}} between <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> and birth defects, {{detailed information on}} type of medication and timing of use is essential to prevent misclassification. However, data on the accuracy of recall of <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy are scarce. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to validate a self-administered questionnaire to assess prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in the 3 months before and during pregnancy. METHODS: This validation study was embedded in Eurocat Northern Netherlands, a population-based birth defects registry that covers 10 % of all births in The Netherlands. The questionnaire was validated among 560 mothers of infants with major birth defects registered from 1 January 2009 through 30 June 2010 by comparing it with a reference standard consisting of pharmacy data which were checked for compliance by maternal interviews. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated to quantify validity for any prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> groups of <b>medications</b> and individual medications. In addition, we determined whether maternal characteristics influenced disagreement between the questionnaire and the reference standard using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The sensitivity for any prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> was 0. 57, ranging between 0. 07 (dermatological corticosteroids) and 0. 83 (antihypertensives) for medication groups, and between 0. 00 (naproxen) and 0. 73 (salbutamol) for individual medications. Overall, specificity was high (0. 93 - 1. 00). Smoking during pregnancy and completing the questionnaire > 2 years after delivery were associated with increased disagreement between the questionnaire for prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> and the reference standard. CONCLUSIONS: The validity of the self-administered questionnaire for prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy was moderate to poor for most medications and disagreement differed by some maternal characteristics. As many epidemiological studies use similar questionnaires to assess <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> these studies may need additional data sources such as pharmacy records or prescription databases for <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> next to self-reported methods.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 In {{the modern}} era, {{cardiovascular}} biomarkers are often {{measured in the}} presence of <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> whereby the observed value is different than the underlying untreated value for participants on medication. However, for certain problems, the natural history of the biomarker that would have occurred in the absence of <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> is of greater interest than the observed value. In observational data, <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> is nonrandom in that participants on medication tend to have higher underlying biomarker values than participants off medication. That is to say that <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> is endogenous. When faced with endogenous <b>medication</b> <b>use,</b> traditional methods such as adjustment for <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in linear regression models are inappropriate. The goal of this dissertation is to develop methods to estimate associations between predictors of interest and biomarker outcomes {{in the presence of}} endogenous <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> First, we focus on methods for use in a cross-sectional setting. Heckman's treatment effects model, as suggested by its name, has historically been used to estimate the effect of <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> on a continuous outcome. In this research, we take a definitive departure from the historical use of the model, in that we utilize the Heckman framework in order to estimate associations between exposures and underlying (off-medication) outcomes, regarding the effect of medication on the biomarker as a nuisance rather than a parameter of interest. We show that the treatment effects model is fairly robust to departures from several of its main assumptions. One assumption to which the treatment effects model is particularly sensitive, however, is the assumption of uniform treatment effects. In particular, the expected effect of <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> on the biomarker is presumed to be constant across participants (an assumption that is often thought to be unrealistic in practice). We extend the treatment effects model to allow effect modification, or "subgroup-specific" treatment effects. The second major aim of this dissertation pertains to developing methodology to address endogenous <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> when repeated measures are available on subjects over time. Very little work has been done to address the challenges of endogenous <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in longitudinal data. For certain types of probit analyses, existing methods invoke standard results on M-estimation theory to construct asymptotically valid estimates of marginal parameters. As cardiovascular biomarkers of interest show strong within-subject correlation over time, there is much efficiency to be gained by modeling that correlation. We seek to understand situations in which accounting for correlation can be advantageous (e. g., in the setting of deterministic covariates), and elucidate efficiency gains with specification of a working covariance. These two objectives primarily target bias reduction for the challenge of addressing endogenous <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in estimating biomarker associations. Improving estimation of these associations can help us better understand underlying biological mechanisms of disease and better motivate future clinical research...|$|R

40|$|The {{risk for}} {{developing}} type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) is greater among obese individuals. Following onset of the disease, patients with T 2 DM become {{more likely to be}} afflicted with diabetic micro- and macrovascular complications. Decreasing body weight has been shown to lower glycosylated hemoglobin and improve other metabolic parameters in patients with <b>T</b> 2 DM. <b>Medications</b> <b>used</b> to lower blood glucose may increase body weight in patients with T 2 DM and this has been repeatedly shown to be the case for conventional, human insulin formulations. Insulin detemir is a neutral, soluble, long-acting insulin analog in which threonine- 30 of the insulin B-chain is deleted, and the C-terminal lysine is acetylated with myristic acid, a C 14 fatty acid chain. Insulin detemir binds to albumin, a property that enhances its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile. Results from clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with insulin detemir is associated with less weight gain than either insulin glargine or neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. There are many potential reasons for the lower weight gain observed among patients treated with insulin detemir, including lower risk for hypoglycemia and therefore decreased defensive eating due to concern about this adverse event, along with other effects that {{may be related to the}} albumin binding of this insulin that may account for lower within-patient variability and consistent action. These might include faster transport across the blood–brain barrier, induction of satiety signaling in the brain, and preferential inhibition of hepatic glucose production versus peripheral glucose uptake.

40|$|Objectives: Intercountry {{comparability}} between {{studies on}} <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in pregnancy is difficult due to dissimilarities in study design and methodology. This study aimed to examine patterns and {{factors associated with}} <b>medications</b> <b>use</b> in pregnancy from a multinational perspective, with emphasis on type of medication utilised and indication for use. Design: Cross-sectional, web-based study performed within the period from 1 October 2011 to 29 February 2012. Uniform collection of drug utilisation data was performed via an anonymous online questionnaire. Setting: Multinational study in Europe (Western, Northern and Eastern), North and South America and Australia. Participants: Pregnant women and new mothers with children less than 1 year of age. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Prevalence of and factors associated with <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> for acute/short-term illnesses, chronic/long-term disorders and over-the-counter (OTC) <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> Results: The study population included 9459 women, of which 81. 2...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesMany {{prescription}} medications {{have limited}} information regarding safety for use during pregnancy. In order to inform research on safer <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> during pregnancy, we examined prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> {{among women in}} the United States. MethodsWe analyzed data from the 199922 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate the prevalence of prescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in the past 30 days among pregnant women and non-pregnant {{women of childbearing age}} (1522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 44 years) and to ascertain the most commonly reported prescription medications by women in these groups. We assessed how the most commonly reported medications differed among groups defined by selected demographic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and markers of socioeconomic status. ResultsPrescription <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in the past 30 days was reported by 22...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evidence on the {{comparative}} validity of self-reported <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> in large-scale studies is limited. This study compared self-reported <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> of prescription-only <b>medications</b> to gold standard pharmaceutical claims (i. e. dispensing) data. Methods: We selected {{a random sample}} of 500 participants from the 45 and Up Study, a large-scale Australian study, with complete ascertainment of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dispensing records. Self-reported <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> was ascertained by questionnaire requesting data on <b>medications</b> <b>used</b> “for most of the last 4 weeks”. In the dispensing data, we determined exposure to specific medications in the same 4 -week window as the survey response if we observed a dispensing record ≤ 90 days {{before the start of the}} window. We calculated sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPVs) at the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 3 ‑ and 7 -digit code levels. Results: PPVs were ≥ 75...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Health Issue Research has {{consistently}} shown that while women generally {{live longer than}} men, they report more illness and use of health care services (including medication). In the literature, the reasons for women's elevated <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> are not clear. This paper investigates the associations between over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> and selected social and demographic variables in men and women. Key findings While {{a larger proportion of}} women than men <b>used</b> <b>medication</b> throughout the study, the proportion of people <b>using</b> <b>medication</b> did not increase. The use of OTC and Rx medication increased by number of physician visits for women and men. <b>Medication</b> <b>use</b> increased with age, chronic disease and number of physician visits, and decreased with the perception of good to excellent health. The relationship with other factors varied for women and men depending on their education level, income and social roles. For women, the social roles of being married or previously married, being employed or being a parent did not increase their likelihood of <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> Reported income adequacy is not associated with the chances of mediation use among highly educated women, but for women with low levels, <b>medication</b> <b>use</b> increases as income adequacy decreases. Data Gaps and Recommendations More complete data are needed about social roles and their relation to mediation use. Data that would allow an assessment of the appropriateness of OTC and Rx drug use or the reasons for such use need to be collected. More research is needed to better understand the distribution and determinants of specific <b>medication</b> <b>use.</b> </p...|$|R
