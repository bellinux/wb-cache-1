50|$|A duct leakage tester is a {{diagnostic}} tool {{designed to measure}} the <b>airtightness</b> of forced air heating, ventilating and air-conditioning (HVAC) ductwork. A duct leakage tester consists of a calibrated fan for measuring an air flow rate and a pressure sensing device to measure the pressure created by the fan flow.

50|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown {{substantial}} energy savings by tightening building envelopes. The ASIEPI project technical report on building and ductwork <b>airtightness</b> estimates the energy impact of envelope <b>airtightness</b> in the order of 10 kWh per m2 of floor area per year, for the heating needs in a moderately cold region (2500 degree-days). Experimental data showing the energy savings of good <b>airtightness</b> were also published by the Building Research Establishment in the UK as well as REHVA journals' special issue on <b>airtightness.</b> They conclude 15% of the space conditioning energy use can be saved in the UK context going from 11.5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (average current value) down to 5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (achievable).|$|E

5000|$|TightVent Europe is a platform, {{formed in}} January 2011, {{with a focus}} on {{building}} and ductwork <b>airtightness</b> issues. [...] The creation of the platform was triggered by the need for a strong and concerted initiative to meet the Directive on the energy performance of buildings recast’s ambitious targets for the year 2020 [...] and overcome the challenges in relation to the envelope and ductwork leakage towards the generalization of nearly zero-energy buildings. The platform’s main activities, among others, include the production and dissemination of policy oriented publications, networking among local or national <b>airtightness</b> associations, as well as the organization of conferences, workshops and webinars.|$|E
50|$|Superinsulation is an {{approach}} to building design, construction, and retrofitting that dramatically reduces heat loss (and gain) by using much higher levels of insulation and <b>airtightness</b> than normal. Superinsulation {{is one of the}} ancestors of the passive house approach.|$|E
50|$|Ductwork <b>airtightness</b> {{levels can}} be {{measured}} by temporarily connecting a device (sometimes called a duct leakage tester to pressurize the ductwork including duct-mounted components. Air flow through the pressurizing device creates an internal, uniform, static pressure within the ductwork. The aim {{of this type of}} measurement is to relate the pressure differential across the ductwork to the air flow rate required to produce it. Generally, the higher the air flow rate required to produce a given pressure difference, the less airtight the ductwork. This pressurization technique is described in standard test methods such as EN 12237 and EN 1507, ASHRAE standard 90.1-2010. It is similar in principle to that used to characterize building <b>airtightness.</b>|$|E
