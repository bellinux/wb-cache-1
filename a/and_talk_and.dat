When they come before us they can't bluff us, because it's black on black." [...] Peena Geia, Chairwoman of the Community Justice Group, 2001 ...|$|E
500|$|Frauenhofer {{referred}} to [...] "Trees" [...] as [...] "a definite highlight" [...] in which [...] "the doctor drops his trademark off-kilter raps on, surprisingly, environmentalism." [...] Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan {{wrote that the}} song [...] "Ants" [...] compares [...] "the humans infesting Earth to ants in a colony, enthused and disgusted at once". Frauenhofer, describing the song [...] "Eat It," [...] wrote that Princess Superstar [...] "constantly references sex" [...] while Dr. Octagon [...] "confusingly interjects with his complaints about how women only {{want to go out}} <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> eat", but Frauenhofer states that the sexual content of the album's lyrics is not as explicit as previous Thornton albums, such as Sex Style. Dallas Observer writer Geoff Johnston described the song as being [...] "as profane as one would hope for." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} was made to not use the Cox/Davies script, which gave Gilliam only ten days to write another. Gilliam has stated in an interview [...] "When we were writing the script, we really tried not to invent anything. We sort of cannibalized the book." [...] The director enlisted the help of Tony Grisoni and they wrote the script at Gilliam's home in May 1997. Grisoni remembers, [...] "I'd sit at the keyboard, and we'd talk <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> I'd keep typing." [...] One of the most important scenes from the book that Gilliam wanted to put in the film was the confrontation between Duke and Dr. Gonzo and the waitress of the North Star Coffee Lounge. The director said, [...] "This is two guys who have gone beyond the pale, this is unforgivable â€“ that scene, it's ugly. My approach, rather than to throw it out, was to make that scene the low point." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{hours and}} hours that dismal actor walked, <b>And</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> Till {{lethargy}} upon the parson crept, And sleepy MICAH SOWLS serenely slept.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Babuji! Pigji! Dogji! What {{do these}} fat slugs from Calcutta know? He draws and draws <b>and</b> draws, <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks,</b> <b>and</b> his maps are all wrong. I, Janki, {{know that this}} is so. When a man has been shut up in the dark for thirty years, God gives him knowledge. The old gallery that Tibu's gang made is not six feet from Number Five.' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so these}} two friends sat <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> {{until it was}} {{positively}} shameful, considering that the Broadstone horses were accustomed to be fed and watered at noon, and that the coachman was very hungry.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. All {{they have}} is ideas. They {{immediately}} proceed to talk about it, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> with all their erudition reach no conclusion whatever. And I am just as bad. I listen and listen, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> talk, as I am talking now, and remain convictionless. There is no test--" ...|$|E

60|$|But Mr. Walby's {{was still}} their sole promise. The grocer {{followed}} the Squire; the bookseller was liberal, and had invited the Ramsbotham candidate to dinner. On this alarming symptom, Fitzjocelyn fell upon Richardson, <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> till the solicitor could either bear it no longer, or feared for the Ormersfield agency, and his vote was carried {{off as a}} captive.|$|R
500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> laughed <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. We talked about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl. She's a smart lady. I really like Mariah.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> {{until at}} last the skipper give way and went down below with the mate, and told the chaps they {{was to take the}} new {{medicine}} for two days, jest to prove the mate was wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{but there}} is a new look on his face, a new light in his eyes, and with the New-Comer he sits by the fire, and they talk <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> the talk is without end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{earth is}} full of men who'd sell their souls for three hundred a year; and women come <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> borrow a five-pound note here and a ten-pound note there; and a woman has no {{conscience}} in a money debt.|$|E
60|$|The mail {{was taken}} charge of, the dogs driven away to {{quarters}} and fed, and Bettles struck up the paean of the sassafras root as they lined {{up against the}} long bar to drink <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> collect their debts.|$|E
60|$|In {{the middle}} {{distance}} Mr. Du Brant still strolled backward and forward, pulverizing his teeth and swearing in French. He seldom removed his eyes from Miss Asher, but still she sat on that bench <b>and</b> crocheted, <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> crocheted, with that everlasting Miss Raleigh! He had seen Locker with her, and he had seen him go; and now he hoped that the woman would soon depart. Then {{it would be his}} chance.|$|R

6000|$|... "I've hear'n say as much {{on board}} o' man-of-war. It's {{a great place for}} the {{officers}} to meet <b>and</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>and</b> smoke, in Uncle Sam's crafts; and what a body hears in such places, is pretty much newspaper stuff, I do suppose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, I feel as {{if either}} would be a profanation. Let us walk {{together}} down to the Embankment, and sit {{on one of the}} benches there, and watch the river flowing in the sunshine, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> think of all that we have seen.' ...|$|E
50|$|MK Haneen Zoabi (Balad) and MK Ahmed Tibi (United Arab List) {{have written}} open letters <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> rallied against Naddaf.|$|R
60|$|Well, they bargained <b>and</b> bargained, <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> {{the end of}} {{the matter}} was that Claus agreed to sell his {{services}} to the old master of black-arts for seven pennies a week.

After they had come a little distance away from the crowd at the marketplace, the master of black-arts asked Claus where he had got that fine staff of hazel.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Why {{are these}} Governments always {{doing what we}} don't want them to do? We should not be {{fighting}} in the Cirenaica if we were all Italians. It is the Government that does it. They talk <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> do things with us: but we don't want them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. The clerk {{just got}} called to Corinth--mother sick. Dave {{will be in}} the store till midnight. Oh, come on over. There's some lovely beer on the ice, and we can sit <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> be all cool and lazy. That wouldn't be wrong of us, WOULD it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. G. It doesn't matter; {{you don't}} care for what I say.

6000|$|... "Take {{the lawyers}} now, for instance, Miles," [...] he said, [...] "and {{what can you}} make out of them, {{in the way of}} religion, I should like to know?

6000|$|Perhaps, though fun for {{the other}} English here, [...] It means new work for him. Ah--notice now [...] The music makes no more pretence to play!

6000|$|... "You're not {{so sweet}} on England then? I've heard people say {{at home that}} you dress <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>and</b> act like an Englishman.

60|$|After luncheon we sat for two {{or three}} hours in one of the parlors, <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked.</b> It was a sort of family congress. Everybody told {{everybody}} else what he or she was going to do, and took information of the same kind in trade. I was to go to college in the fall, but as that had been pretty much settled long ago, it couldn't be considered as news. I looked well enough, my father said, to do all the hard studying that was needed; and the professor was anxiously waiting to put me through a course of training for the happy lot of Freshman.|$|R
