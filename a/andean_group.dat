40|$|The central {{feature of}} rural Andean {{societies}} is their extensive socio-economic network which is connecting different local units to regional clusters. Until recently it was structured by clearly defined rules of real and fictitious kinship and it played a decisive {{role in the}} organization of power on the local and regional level. At first view, the norms seem to define strict limits but contemplated precisely, they reveal inherent flexibilities and potentialities of frontier crossing. Various factors that are forced by the influence of both the world system and the local dynamics, like migration and the import of money based economy, instigated a process of profound alteration. The relationships based on kin and alliance began to shift into sectors controlled by economic parameters which are generated and defined on transnational level. As a consequence, the new configurations began to transform the traditional systems. According to our opinion, the method of Social Network Analysis (SNA) {{is one of the most}} important tools to be applied in Social Anthropology for the description of current socio-economic relationships of a given local or regional group. It also is valid to detect tendencies, attitudes and behavior involved in the dynamics of social processes.

40|$|Excerpt] For most {{countries}} in Latin America and the Caribbean, threats emanating from terrorism are low. Terrorism {{in the region}} is largely perpetrated by groups in Colombia and by the remnants of radical leftist <b>Andean</b> <b>groups.</b> According to the Department of State, most governments in the region have good records of cooperation with the United States on anti-terrorism issues, although progress in the region on improving counterterrorism capabilities is limited by several factors, including corruption, weak governmental institutions, weak or non-existent legislation, and reluctance to allocate sufficient resources. Both Cuba and Venezuela are on the State Department’s list of countries determined to be not cooperating fully with U. S. antiterrorism efforts, and Cuba has remained on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1982. U. S. officials and some Members of Congress have expressed concern {{over the past several years}} about Venezuela’s relations with Iran, with concerns centered on efforts by Iran to circumvent U.

There is disagreement, however, over the extent and significance of Iran’s activities in Latin America.

40|$|The genetic {{variability}} of 46 accessions of the Lima bean (P. lunatus L.) including 16 wild forms and 30 landraces {{belonging to the}} three cultigroups Big lima, Sieva, Potato, and their intermediates, was evaluated using RAPD (Random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers. Twelve oligonucleotide primers produced 172 RAPD markers which allowed the differentiation of two main groups: the mesoamerican and the <b>andean</b> <b>groups.</b> This was confirmed by an AMOVA analysis which indicated that 37. 7 % of the variation was found between these two groups. For each botanical form (wild and cultivated), the molecular markers showed that small-seeded types (i. e. Sieva and Potato types and their related wild forms) had a wide distribution (from Mexico to Argentina) while the large-seeded types (Big lima type and its related wild forms) were circumscribed to the narrow west-coastal region from Ecuador to Bolivia. The results are in favour of an independent domestication process within the two groups, as the differentiation between mesoamerican and andean accessions was found to occur in both wild forms and landraces. Within {{each of the two}} main groups, wild forms and landraces were also found to be genetically differentiated and higher genetic diversity was observed among landraces than among wild forms. Within the mesoamerican landraces, low but significant differentiation between the Sieva and Potato cultigroups was observed. Some suggestions and hypotheses are discussed about evolution of the two small-seeded types. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|Bolivia's {{trade with}} {{neighboring}} countries is growing, {{in part because}} of several regional preferential trade agreements it has negotiated. Bolivia was {{a founding member of the}} <b>Andean</b> <b>Group,</b> a South American organization designed to promote trade among Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, the United States, and Venezuela. Subsequently renamed the Andean Community of Nations, the organization has succeeded in increasing intra-South American trade. Trade among member countries rose from US$3.6 billion in 1991 to US$10.3 billion in 2003. Bolivia also belongs to the Common Market of the South (Mercado Común del Sur—Mercosur). Bolivia became an associate member in March 1997 in order to open investment opportunities with the founding Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay), as well as other Mercosur associate members (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela). The agreement provides for the gradual creation of a free trade area covering at least 80% of the trade between the parties over a 10-year period, though economic crises in the region have derailed progress at integration. The U.S. Andean Trade Preference and Drug Enforcement Act (ATPDEA) allows (allowed?) numerous Bolivian products to enter the United States free of duty on a unilateral basis, including alpaca and llama products and, subject to a quota, cotton textiles. Bolivia conducted more than US$1 billion in trade with Mercosur countries in 2003. As a result of negotiations initiated in 1999 on a possible South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA), Mercosur and the Andean Community of Nations announced in December 2004 that they would merge, creating a Union of South American Nations modeled after the European Union.|$|E
40|$|Highland populations living {{permanently}} under hypobaric hypoxia {{have been}} subject of extensive research because of the relevance of their physiological adaptations for the understanding of human health and disease. In this context, what is considered high altitude {{is a matter of}} interpretation and while the adaptive processes at high altitude (above 3000 m) are well documented, the effects of moderate altitude (below 3000 m) on the phenotype are less well established. In this study, we compare physiological and anthropometric characteristics as well as genetic variations in two Andean populations: the Calchaquíes (2300 m) and neighboring Collas (3500 m). We compare their phenotype and genotype to the sea‐level Wichí population. We measured physiological (heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, and lung function) as well as anthropometric traits (height, sitting height, weight, forearm, and tibia length). We conducted genome‐wide genotyping on a subset of the sample (n = 74) and performed various scans for positive selection. At the phenotypic level (n = 179), increased lung capacity stood out in both <b>Andean</b> <b>groups,</b> whereas a growth reduction in distal limbs was only observed at high altitude. At the genome level, Calchaquíes revealed strong signals around PRKG 1, suggesting that the nitric oxide pathway may be a target of selection. PRKG 1 was highlighted by one of four selection tests among the top five genes using the population branch statistic. Selection tests results of Collas were reported previously. Overall, our study shows that some phenotypic and genetic differentiation occurs at intermediate altitude in response to moderate lifelong selection pressures...|$|R
40|$|Coevolution of {{the angular}} leaf spot pathogen, Phaeoisariopsis griseola, with its common bean host has been demonstrated, and P. griseola {{isolates}} have been divided into <b>Andean</b> and Mesoamerican <b>groups</b> {{that correspond to}} defined bean gene pools. Recent characterization of P. griseola isolates from Africa has identified a group of isolates classified as Andean using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), but which are able to infect some Mesoamerican differential varieties. These isolates, designated Afro-Andean, have been identified only in Africa. Random amplified microsatellites, RAPD, and restriction digestion of amplified ribosomal intergenic spacer region were used to elucidate the relationships among the Afro-Andean, <b>Andean,</b> and Mesoamerican <b>groups</b> of P. griseola. Cluster and multiple correspondence analysis of molecular data separated isolates into <b>Andean</b> and Meso-american <b>groups,</b> and the Afro-Andean isolates clustered with Andean isolates. Analysis of molecular variance ascribed 2. 8 % of the total genetic variation to differences between Afro-Andean and Andean isolates from Africa. Gene diversity analysis revealed no genetic differentiation (GST = 0. 004) between Afro-Andean and Andean isolates from Africa. However, significant levels of genetic differentiation (GST = 0. 39) were observed between Afro-Andean or Andean isolates from Africa and Andean isolates from Latin America, revealing significant geographical differentiation within the Andean lineage. Results from {{this study showed that}} Afro-Andean isolates do not constitute a new P. griseola group and do not represent long-term evolution of the pathogen genome, but rather are likely the consequents of point mutations in genes for virulence.
