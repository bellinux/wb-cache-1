5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he sees himself as Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he regarded as <b>an</b> <b>omen,</b> was when a kite {{dropped from the}} sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{failed to}} breach the Lacedaimonian defences and when night fell, he withdrew {{back to his}} camp. According to Plutarch, Pyrrhus {{received}} <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> during the night. As he slept, he dreamt of Sparta being smitten and set alight by thunderbolts coming from his own hand. While Pyrrhus {{and most of his}} counsellors interpreted the dream as indicating that they would seize Sparta by storm, his friend Lysimachus warned him that places struck by thunderbolts were usually avoided and that Pyrrhus was destined not to enter Sparta. Pyrrhus dismissed this interpretation and buoyed by what he deemed to be a portentous sign, he prepared his men for a further assault.|$|E
50|$|According to some, {{the sight}} of a frog may be <b>a</b> bad <b>omen.</b> <b>As</b> well, a common myth says that {{touching}} frogs and toads may give one warts. (In many other cultures, frogs are considered <b>a</b> good <b>omen.)</b> <b>A</b> survey carried out by researchers from the Johannesburg Zoo have shown that in modern times old superstitions play a less significant role and modern children are more concerned whether frogs are poisonous or harmless.|$|R

5|$|Woo {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
25|$|South Carolina Congressman Preston Smith Brooks {{lay in the}} Public Vault in January 1857, {{within a}} year of brutally beating Senator Charles Sumner with a cane {{on the floor of the}} Senate, an attack that is viewed as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{liberation of}} Paris in August 1944, which {{would lead to}} the {{complete}} liberation of France, gave new hopes to the pro-allies factions in Argentina, who saw it as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of the possible fall of the Argentine government, and calls for new elections. The demonstrations in support of Paris soon turned into demonstrations against the government, leading to incidents with the police.|$|E

25|$|His mother Jijabai died on 18 June 1674, {{within a}} few days of the {{coronation}}. Considering this <b>a</b> bad <b>omen,</b> <b>a</b> second coronation was carried out 24 September 1674, this time according to the Bengali school of Tantricism and presided over by Nischal Puri.|$|R
25|$|The nøkk {{was also}} <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> for {{drowning}} accidents. He would scream {{at a particular}} spot in a lake or river, in a way reminiscent of the loon, and on that spot a fatality would later take place. He was also said to actually cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.|$|E
25|$|Superstitious beliefs {{surrounding}} death entail {{the sudden}} appearance of certain animals, particularly those black in color. Examples are: {{the appearance of}} a lingering black butterfly around an individual is <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> that a person's next of kin has died; a sick person heading toward hospital who sees a black-hued cat will not survive their condition; seeing an owl near the home of a sick individual signifies the infirm's imminent death.|$|E
25|$|Hamiltonians, {{like other}} {{residents}} of the colonies, discovered one of the darker sides of British Imperialism when the South African War broke out in 1899. Men from Wentworth County and other Canadians volunteered {{to serve in the}} Canadian Mounted Rifles or North-West Mounted Police contingents. Although they excelled at the bitter guerrilla war there against the Boers, its conclusion in 1902 served as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> for the future.|$|E

25|$|Two of the {{original}} medieval texts on the sunstone are allegorical. Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar contains a burst of purely allegorical material associated with Hrafn’s slaying. This involves a celestial vision with three highly cosmological knights, recalling the horsemen of the Apocalypse. It {{has been suggested that}} the horsemen of Hrafns saga contain allegorical allusions to the winter solstice and the four elements as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of Hrafn’s death, where the sunstone also appears.|$|E
25|$|Matilda {{was born}} around 1080 in Dunfermline, the {{daughter}} of the Scottish king Malcolm III and the Anglo-Saxon princess Saint Margaret. She was christened Edith, with the Anglo-Norman prince Robert Curthose standing as godfather at the ceremony. The English queen Matilda of Flanders was also present at the baptismal font and served as her godmother. Edith pulled at Queen Matilda's headdress, which was seen as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> that the infant would be queen one day.|$|E
25|$|Byner {{finished}} {{the game with}} 161 rushing {{yards and two touchdowns}} on just 16 carries, while also catching four passes for 25 yards. Nathan rushed for 21 yards and caught 10 passes for 101 yards. Marino was 25/45 for 238 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Cleveland racked up a whopping 251 rushing yards against the Dolphins defense, {{which turned out to be}} <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of what lay in store for them in the AFC Championship Game.|$|E

25|$|Anne Neville died on 16 March 1485, {{probably}} of tuberculosis, at Westminster. The day she died, {{there was}} an eclipse, which some took to be <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of her husband's fall from heavenly grace. She was buried in Westminster Abbey in an unmarked grave {{to the right of}} the High Altar, next to the door to the Confessor's Chapel. Richard III is said to have wept at her funeral. Nevertheless, rumours circulated that Richard III had poisoned her in order to marry his niece Elizabeth of York.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} Belisarius' {{outburst}} {{was at first}} unclear, but as the Goths approached the moat, he drew forth his bow and shot, one after another, three Ostrogoth riders. The soldiers on the walls took this as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of victory and started to shout in celebration. Then Belisarius revealed his thought, as he ordered his archers to concentrate their fire on the exposed oxen, which the Goths had so thoughtlessly brought within bowshot distance from the walls. The oxen were dispatched quickly, and the four towers were left there, useless, before the walls.|$|E
25|$|A corpse candle {{or light}} is a flame or ball of light, often blue, that {{is seen to}} travel just above the ground on the route from the {{cemetery}} to the dying person's house and back again, and is particularly associated with Wales. A corpse fire is very similar as the name comes from lights appearing specifically within graveyards where it was believed the lights were <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> of death or coming tragedy and would mark the route of a future funeral, from the victim's house to the graveyard, where it would vanish into {{the ground at the}} site of the burial. The appearance was often said to be on the night before a death.|$|E

25|$|Taebong (Later Goguryeo) was {{originally}} led by Gung Ye, a Buddhist monk who founded Later Goguryeo. Gung Ye {{was actually a}} son of King Gyeongmun of Silla. When Gung Ye was born, there was <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> {{that he would be}} a cause of Silla's downfall, and thus Gyeongmun ordered his newborn to be killed. Gung Ye's nurse however, ran away with him and raised him. The unpopular Gung Ye was deposed by Wang Geon in 918. Wang Geon was popular with his people, and he decided to unite the entire peninsula under one government. He attacked Later Baekje in 934 and received the surrender of Silla in the following year. In 936, Goryeo conquered Hubaekje.|$|E
25|$|Charlemagne’s son, Louis the Pious, {{is rarely}} shown {{engaging}} in battle by the annalists, but rather directs {{others to do}} so, or negotiates for peace. The contrast between Louis and {{his father and grandfather}} is clear. While the past kings were unshakeable figures, depicted as the better of their foes even in defeat by the revised edition, the annalists’ Louis is a smaller man who invests the power of the military in others, not unlike the annals’ earlier depiction of the Merovingian kings. Miracles aid Charlemagne and his men, and the grace of God leads him to victory; mostly ill portents surround Louis, such as <b>an</b> <b>omen</b> in the stars supposedly foretelling his army’s defeat at the hands of Count Aizo, and the sudden collapse of a wooden arcade atop him in 817.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, the {{triplets}} {{travel to the}} home of their father, Kan Shōjō's aged retainer Shiradayū, in Sata Village, for the festive celebration of his 70th birthday. The three soon begin fighting but, with no swords at hand, attack one another with bales of hay. Though only fighting with hay and other common objects, the fight scene is executed in the same style and manner as the greatest of aragoto fight scenes. In the course of the fight, a branch from Kan Shōjō's favorite cherry tree (sakura) is snapped off. Shiradayū notices this, and points it out as <b>an</b> <b>omen,</b> representing Sakuramaru's responsibility for Kan Shōjō's downfall, as {{he was the one who}} helped bring Tokiyo and Kariya together. Kan Shōjō arrives and, together with Shiradayū, chastise Matsuōmaru and banish him from their service; Sakuramaru then emerges and announces his decision to commit ritual suicide, in order to atone for his wrongdoing. Shiradayū strikes a bell as his son dies.|$|E
