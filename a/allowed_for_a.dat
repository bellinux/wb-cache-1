5|$|A: Rules at {{the time}} of the first three ceremonies <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{performer}} to receive a single nomination which could honor their work in more than one film. Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer were both nominated for two different roles in the same category. Current Academy rules forbid this from happening. No official reason was ever given as to why Shearer won the award for only one of the two films she was listed for.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{development}} of the longer range 747-400 began. The variant had a new glass cockpit, which <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cockpit crew of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated {{at the request of}} airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E

5|$|The Comet was {{powered by}} {{two pairs of}} {{turbojet}} engines buried in the wings close to the fuselage. Chief designer Bishop chose the Comet's embedded-engine configuration because it avoided the drag of podded engines and <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smaller fin and rudder, since the hazards of asymmetric thrust were reduced. The engines were outfitted with baffles to reduce noise emissions, and extensive soundproofing was also implemented to improve passenger conditions.|$|E

50|$|The Main 10 profile <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{bit depth}} of 8-bits to 10-bits per sample with 4:2:0 chroma sampling. HEVC decoders that {{conform to the}} Main 10 profile must be capable of {{decoding}} bitstreams made with the following profiles: Main and Main 10. A higher bit depth <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater number of colors. 8-bits per sample <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> 256 shades per primary color (a total of 16.78 million colors) while 10-bits per sample <b>allows</b> <b>for</b> 1024 shades per primary color (a total of 1.07 billion colors).

Morris determined during the creation of the territory that the affairs of the District of Keewatin should be administered from Fort Garry until November 7, 1876. A total of six members were appointed to the Council. The law that created the territory <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minimum of five members.|$|E

Therefore, the total amount of the credit <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new PEV is $7,500. Several states have established incentives and tax exemptions for BEVs and PHEV, and other non-monetary incentives.|$|E

The first design <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Provost and ten Fellows, called 'scholars', and the College remained a small body of graduate Fellows until the 16th century, when it started to admit undergraduates. During the English Civil War, Oriel played host to high-ranking members of the King's Oxford Parliament.|$|E

An infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) in 2009 <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Neptune-sized object beyond 700 AU. A similar study in 2014 focused on possible higher-mass bodies in the outer Solar System and ruled out Jupiter-mass objects out to 26,000 AU.|$|E
5|$|A {{batch of}} 10 were {{produced}} and five were built from existing H-6s. The machines {{were joined by}} a center wing formed by two sections 6.15m (20ft) in length. The powerplants were five Junkers Jumo 211F engines producing 1,000kW (1,340hp) each. The total fuel capacity was 8,570L (2,260US gal). This was increased by adding of four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks. The He111Z could tow a Gotha Go 242 glider or Me 321 for up to 10 hours at cruising speed. It could also remain airborne if the three central powerplants failed. The He 111Z-2 and Z-3 were also planned as heavy bombers carrying 1,800kg (3,970lb) of bombs and having a range of 4,000km (2,500mi). The ETC installations <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further four 600L (160US gal) drop tanks to be installed.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E

5|$|Ayer {{was devastated}} by {{a fire in}} 1872, but its {{industrial}} connections <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of rebuilding and even prosperity after. Most buildings in the Ayer Main Street Historic District were built during that time. When the Hoosac Tunnel opened in 1875, trains through Ayer could run on the Fitchburg and the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad as far west as Troy, New York. With service to Troy, Boston, Nashua, Worcester, Lowell, and Greenville, Ayer Junction (soon shortened to Ayer) was a major rail interchange {{and the most important}} station on the Fitchburg Railroad between Concord and Fitchburg.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the Beast was {{the second}} film, after The Rescuers Down Under, {{produced}} using CAPS (Computer Animation Production System), a digital scanning, ink, paint, and compositing system of software and hardware developed for Disney by Pixar. The software <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wider range of colors, as well as soft shading and colored line effects for the characters, techniques lost when the Disney studio abandoned hand inking for xerography in the late 1950s. CAPS also allowed the production crew to simulate multiplane effects: placing characters and/or backgrounds on separate layers and moving them towards/away from the camera on the Z-axis to give the illusion of depth, as well as altering the focus of each layer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Labour's 1997 election victory, referendums {{were held in}} Scotland and Wales regarding devolution. There was a clear majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales; Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering {{the creation of a}} regional parliament and government. In 1998, the Good Friday Agreement was made, which <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists.

Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though they were never title contenders vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed.

5|$|Kongsfjord Telemetry Station {{constituted}} one of {{the four}} initial ESTRACK ground stations which provided radio tracking and telemetry communication with ESRO's low Earth orbit satellites. The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> small antenna dish but gave a low bit rate. The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère.

The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms <b>allowed</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E
