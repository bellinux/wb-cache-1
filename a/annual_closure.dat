40|$|Generalized linear {{modeling}} (GLM) is used {{to analyze}} hake catch rates in the Spanish trawl fleet fishing off Castellón (E Iberian Peninsula) between 1991 and 1996 and to provide consistent indices of abundance. Main effects in the models include a factor for vessel tonnage, to adjust for characteristics that determine fishing power, as well as factors for year, month and fishing closure. Vessel tonnage, season and year are shown {{to have a significant}} effect on hake catch rates, with vessel capacity alone explaining about 54 % of the total variation in the data. Significant interactions indicate that monthly fluctuations in catch rates differed by year probably in relation to the timing of hake recruitment and of the bimonthly <b>annual</b> <b>closure</b> of the fishery. Hake abundance indices, as derived from the year coefficients in the model, were intermediate in 1991 and 1992, low in 1994 and 1995 and high in 1993 and 1996. This result is corroborated by abundance indices from survey estimates for the later years. The model explains 63 % of the variation in the CPUE data, which is similar or above of what has been found by other authors in comparable studies for fisheries around the world. Thus, the modeling approach of catch rates from trawl fisheries offers a promising method for obtaining standardized abundance indices of groundfish stocks in the Western Mediterranean.

40|$|Spatially-distributed water {{consumption}} was modeled over {{a segment of}} the Lower Colorado River, which contains irrigated agricultural and Tamarisk-dominated riparian ecosystems. For the irrigation scheme, distributed evapotranspiration data were analyzed in conjunction with point measurements of precipitation and surface flow in order to close daily and annual water balance. The <b>annual</b> <b>closure</b> error was less than 1 % of the total water diversion to the area. In addition, {{it was found that the}} soil water storage component of the water balance cannot be neglected if the analysis is performed over time frames shorter than annual (e. g. growing season). Water consumption was highly uniform within agricultural fields, and all the full-cover fields were transpiring close to their potential rates. Mapping several new and existing drainage performance indicators showed that neither soil salinization nor water-logging would be of concern in this irrigation scheme. However, the quality of high-volume return flow must be studied, especially since the degraded water quality of the western US rivers is believed to act in favor of the invasive riparian species in outcompeting native species. Over the Tamarisk forest, the remotely-sensed evapotranspiration estimates were higher than the results of an independent groundwater-based method during spring and winter months. This was chiefly due to the fixed satellite overpass time, which happened at low sun elevation angles in spring and winter and resulted in a significant presence of shadows in the satellite scene and consequently a lower surface temperature estimate, which resulted in a higher evapotranspiration estimate using the SEBAL model. A modification based on the same satellite imagery was proposed and found to be successful in correcting for this error. Both water use and crop coefficients of Tamarisk estimated by the two independent methods implemented in this study were significantly lower than the current approximations that are used by the US Bureau of Reclamation in managing the Lower Colorado River. Studying the poorlyunderstood stream-aquifer-phreatophyte relationship revealed that diurnal and seasonal groundwater fluctuations were strongly coupled with the changes in river stage at close distances to the river and with the Tamarisk water extraction at further distances from the river. The direction of the groundwater flow was always from the river toward the riparian forest. Thus the improved Tamarisk ET estimates along with a better understanding of the coupling between the river and the riparian aquifer will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to re-asses their reservoir release methodology and improve efficiency and water savings...|$|E
40|$|Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) {{and blue}} shark (Prionace glauca) are two apex predators in the pelagic {{ecosystem}} {{of the eastern}} Mediterranean Sea. Our current knowledge on their spatio-temporal distribution patterns and {{the effect that the}} surrounding environment has on them is limited. During the period of 1998 - 2001 and 2003 - 2005, data gathered from a series of surveys on the Greek surface drifting longline fleet were analyzed in order to estimate the effect of spatial, temporal, environmental and operational factors on the abovementioned species distribution and relative abundance (expressed in number of fish caught per 1000 hooks deployed). Application of generalized additive models allowed the identification of various parameters influencing catches as well as the contribution of each one. The optimum model was derived using a cross validation procedure which was based on the principal of parsimony: this principal tends to select those variables that depict more closely the actual trends than those that fit best the underlying dataset. Three sets were investigated for swordfish: (i) all specimens; (ii) individuals of size less than 100 cm of lower jaw fork length; (iii) individuals of size greater than 100 cm. The latter two partitions were considered with the intention to confirm whether maturation differentiates the animal’s behavior. The low number of blue shark catches, compared to swordfish, led us to a diverse modeling approach. Firstly, as a first step we modeled the probability of making a catch and secondly we modeled the positive catch rates separately, as in swordfish. It was deduced that spatio-temporal variables (Longitude, Latitude, Month, year) along with the fishing gear type were the most influential on the catches. Environmental constituents (Lunar index, thermal fronts, sea surface temperature) were of less importance and had only some partial effect. Distance from coast was proven to be a very significant factor, bearing a dual property as a variable: spatial and environmental. In particular, immature and mature swordfish differentiated significantly: adult specimens were more abundant to the south-east (Levantine), at the open seas preferring cooler water masses. In contrast, juveniles were more frequently observed to the north-west (Ionian), close to warmer coastal waters. Seasonally, juvenile swordfish were more proliferate in catches during the start and end of the fishing period, and during years of high water temperatures. Increased concentrations of swordfish were detected in the vicinity of thermal fronts. The lunar disc illumination affected positively all year classes, with maximum catches observed around full moon. Although no obvious decline of swordfish abundance was noticed, average size of specimens caught did decrease considerably during the study period. An extended migratory pattern was not confirmed. However, there were strong indications suggesting that Ionian and Levantine actually represent spawning grounds. Blue sharks were encountered more frequently to the north-west of our study area, during late summer in open sea cool water masses. However, the probability of locally high concentrations was higher to the south-east, during springtime, in coastal warm waters. Their presence in catches showed a constant plummeting trend through the years. Annual spring movements towards the shore are most probably related to reproductive activity. Both species are considered to be under severe fishing pressure. <b>Annual</b> <b>closure</b> of swordfish fishery during the winter months, enforced the past 20 years, represent a set of beneficial measures. Introduction of a minimum landins size for blue sharks, appears to be absolutely essential, since the declining annual abundance trends presented in this study, come as a confirmation of other analogous research. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{protected}} {{population of}} the spiny lobster, Palinurus elephas, was studied eight years after establishment of the Columbretes Islands Marine Reserve (western Mediterranean). Experimental trap fishing in the reserve and at two unprotected sites revealed that cessation of fishing in the reserve is probably responsible for high catch rates observed there and that the <b>annual</b> fishing <b>closure</b> is effective in rebuilding populations in exploited areas. In the reserve, variations in abundance, sex ratio, and size of lobsters were conspicuous. Catch rates were always higher in deep (50 – 80 m) than in shallow areas (20 – 50 m). Bathymetric differences in abundance were smallest in early summer, possibly because of seasonal onshore movements associated with reproduction. Females were always more abundant than males and less variable in number and size. Ancillary data suggest that reproductive and moulting behaviour, particularly of males, influences population estimates of P. elephas from trap surveys. Presence of subadults in deeper waters of the reserve suggests that 2 - to 3 -year-old juveniles undergo ontogenetic migration from the shallow settlement habitats (50 m). The results highlight the effectiveness of fishing restrictions in rebuilding P. elephas populations and suggest that the lobster population in the reserve is not closedPublicado...|$|R

40|$|Using 12 {{years of}} {{frequent}} high precision profiles collected on a wave-dominated sandy oceanic beach to 8 -m depth, the characteristics {{and interpretation of}} depth of closure — or the seaward limit of significant profile change — is critically examined. This includes evaluation of the predictive capability of d 1 — the seaward boundary of the littoral zone — as originally defined by Hallermeier (1981) [Hallermeier R. J., 1981. A profile zonation for seasonal sand beaches from wave climate. Coastal Eng. 4, 253 – 277. ]. Depth of closure during major erosional events is usually produced by the seaward limit of offshore bar movement. Following the original recommendation of Hallermeier (1981), d 1 based on 12 h exceeded wave height and a reference depth of mean low water provides a robust limit to the observations using a 6 -cm change criterion. Empirically, the observed depth of closure is 69 % of d 1, although the scatter is large. This scatter is partly controlled by pre-event profile shape, most particularly bar configuration. Depth of closure under accretional conditions can also be measured, but it is time-scale-dependent as accretion is a slow, steady process, d 1 underpredicts closure for accretional situations. Time-interval (e. g., <b>annual)</b> depth of <b>closure</b> represents the integral effect of erosional and accretional events. An important observation of the data is that depth of closure increases with time scale. However, the full population of time-interval observations is not resolved at Duck due to the measurement limit (8 -m depth). As time interval increases from 1 year to 8 years, less cases close. Most non-closing time-interval cases coincide with the periods influenced by the most energetic wave events. However, time-interval closures are generally deeper than the biggest event closure in the period, showing that it represents more than the largest event. The frequency distribution of the data suggests that most, if not all, of these missing data simply represent closures deeper than 8 -m depth. Up to a 4 -year time interval, d 1,t appears to provide a reasonable limit to the quantified observations. It is an interesting result that d 1 (an event-based approach) might provide a limit to closure over periods up to 4 years as these time-interval closures are generally larger than those produced by single storms. Therefore, the general applicability of this result for more complete data sets, or on rapidly evolving (i. e., eroding or accreting) coasts is uncertain. The present data also suggest that on swell-dominated coastlines where accretional processes are dominant, d 1 may underpredict closure, suggesting an important limitation to this approach. But as sediment would be moving onshore, {{this may not be}} a practical problem. Therefore, within the limits of the data set, Hallermeier's (1981) approach is found to define robust estimates of depth of closure, particularly for individual erosional events. This useful result is expected to find widespread application in coastal geology and engineering. <br/...|$|R
