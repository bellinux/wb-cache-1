5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed <b>adultery</b> they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed <b>adultery.</b> His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed <b>adultery</b> for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed <b>adultery.</b> This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

5|$|Anne's {{downfall}} came {{shortly after}} she had recovered from her final miscarriage. Whether it was primarily the result of allegations of conspiracy, <b>adultery,</b> or witchcraft remains {{a matter of debate}} among historians. Early signs of a fall from grace included the King's new mistress, the 28-year-old Jane Seymour, being moved into new quarters, and Anne's brother, George Boleyn, being refused the Order of the Garter, which was instead given to Nicholas Carew. Between 30 April and 2 May, five men, including Anne's brother, were arrested on charges of treasonable <b>adultery</b> and accused of having sexual relationships with the queen. Anne was also arrested, accused of treasonous <b>adultery</b> and incest. Although the evidence against them was unconvincing, the accused were found guilty and condemned to death. George Boleyn and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536. At 8am on 19 May 1536, Anne, age 36, was executed on Tower Green.|$|E

5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation.

After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually <b>adultery,</b> and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of <b>adultery</b> or desertion.

5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), <b>adultery</b> is {{explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial <b>adultery,</b> only this time he repents and the marriage is saved. The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E

5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry).

Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such.
