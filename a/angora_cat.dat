40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the changes in selected hematology and serum biochemistry of <b>Angora</b> <b>cats</b> (Felis catus) during growth period. A total of 32 <b>Angora</b> <b>cats</b> (16 adults and 16 kittens) were used in this study. Blood samples were collected from the animals, and were analyzed for white blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes numbers. In the serum, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatinine kinase (CK), total cholesterol, glucose, triglyceride, urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, Ca, Mg, Pi levels were determined. Monocyte level was found higher, and ALP, LDH, CK activities and Pi levels were lower in adult cats as compared to the kittens. MCV was lower and GGT and AST activities, and glucose level were higher in kittens of 1. 5 - 3 months old than in kittens of > 3 months. Concentrations of total cholesterol and Mg were higher in kitten (1. 5 - 3 months old) than in adult cats. In conclusion, age related effects on hematological and biochemical blood parameters have been determined for the first time in <b>Angora</b> <b>cats...</b>|$|R
50|$|The salon also {{provided}} a steady home for a great clowder of <b>Angora</b> <b>cats.</b> The cats were a well-known feature of Madame Helvetius' salon, always bedecked with silk ribbons and doted on by their loving caregiver.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to gather data on the prenatal development of Turkish <b>cats</b> (the <b>Angora</b> and Van <b>cats)</b> and examine the effects of the breed on prenatal development. Three Angora and four Van cats, ranging in age from 3 to 4 years, were used in the present study. Depending on the stage of pregnancy, the gestational sac diameter (GSD), the fetal heart diameter (FHRTD), the fetal abdominal diameter (FAD), the fetal head diameter (FHD), the fetal gastric diameter (FGD), the fetal width of fore (FWFP) and rear footpads (FWRP) were measured by freezing the images of the fetus or fetal structure on the screen. The mean FHRTD value of the <b>Angora</b> <b>cats</b> was significantly (P = 0. 033) greater than the corresponding value of the Van cats during the third week of gestation. The Van cats had significantly (P = 0. 008) greater mean value of FHD than did the <b>Angora</b> <b>cats</b> during the fifth week of the gestation. There were no significant breed differences between the other fetal measurements. As a result, the prenatal development of the <b>Angora</b> and Van <b>cats</b> were found to be similar. The findings of the present study may also be used as an aid to estimate the gestational age of domestic cats...|$|R
60|$|Whether {{domestic}} cats have {{descended from}} several distinct species, or {{have only been}} modified by occasional crosses, their fertility, as far as is known, is unimpaired. The large Angora or Persian cat is the most distinct in structure and habits of all the domestic breeds; and is believed by Pallas, but on no distinct evidence, to be descended from the F. manul of middle Asia; and I am assured by Mr. Blyth that the <b>Angora</b> <b>cat</b> breeds freely with Indian cats, which, as we have already seen, have apparently been much crossed with F. chaus. In England half-bred Angora cats are perfectly fertile with one another.|$|E
60|$|Now Jill {{made one}} great mistake at the outset--she forgot {{that she was}} the one to be {{converted}} to good manners and gentleness, and devoted her efforts to looking after Jack, finding it much easier to cure other people's faults than her own. Jack was a most engaging heathen, and needed very little instruction; therefore Jill thought her task would be an easy one. But three or four weeks of petting and play had rather demoralized both children, so Jill's Speller, though tucked under the sofa pillow every day, was seldom looked at, and Jack shirked his Latin shamefully. Both read all the story-books they could get, held daily levees in the Bird Room, and all their spare minutes were spent in teaching Snowdrop, the great <b>Angora</b> <b>cat,</b> to bring the ball when they dropped it in their game. So Saturday came, and both were rather the worse for so much idleness, since daily duties and studies are the wholesome bread which feeds the mind better than the dyspeptic plum-cake of sensational reading, or the unsubstantial bon-bons of frivolous amusement.|$|E

5000|$|Turkish <b>Angora</b> <b>cats</b> are playful, intelligent, {{athletic}} and involved.

40|$|Both {{resistive}} index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) estimate vascular resistance {{within an}} artery. But, {{there are only}} few studies reporting normal values of the renal RI and PI in healthy cats but no study could be found with regard to Turkish <b>Angora</b> breed of <b>cats.</b> So, we decided to determine the normal values of intra-renal RI and PI in non-sedated, non-hypertensive clinically normal Turkish <b>Angora</b> breed <b>cats.</b> For this purpose 20 each of mixed-breed and Turkish Angora breed, different ages and sex healthy cats constituted the study groups. At {{the result of the}} pulsed wave doppler ultrasonographic examinations mean values for RI and PI were 0. 61 ± 0. 04 and 0. 97 ± 0. 17 for mixed-breed cats; 0. 60 ± 0. 07 and 1. 16 ± 0. 34 for Turkish <b>Angora</b> breed <b>cats</b> were recorded, respectively. No significant differences were noted between the groups.

In addition, Gyeongsang National University has made achievements in humanities and in sociology, two fields which lay the foundation for human ethics. Beside this, Gyeongsang National University is proud to have the college of Education in where great middle school teachers are educated to take responsibility for education of Republic of Korea, the college of Veterinary Medicine in where international veterinarians are trained, and the College of Marine Science to pioneer the studies of the ocean in the twenty-first century.

60|$|Whether {{the taste}} the good lady had of matrimony {{discouraged}} her or not, I cannot say; but though her merits and her riches have attracted many suitors, {{she has never}} been tempted to venture again into the happy state. This is singular, too, for she seems of a most soft and susceptible heart; is always talking of love and connubial felicity, and is a great stickler for old-fashioned gallantry, devoted attentions, and eternal constancy, {{on the part of the}} gentlemen. She lives, however, after her own taste. Her house, I am told, must have been built and furnished about the time of Sir Charles Grandison: every thing about it is somewhat formal and stately; but has been softened down into a degree of voluptuousness, characteristic of an old lady, very tender-hearted and romantic, and that loves her ease. The cushions of the great arm-chairs, and wide sofas, almost bury you when you sit down on them. Flowers of the most rare and delicate kind are placed about the rooms, and on little japanned stands; and sweet bags lie about the tables and mantel-pieces.

Its {{ancestors}} may include black and white shorthair cats brought to Norway from Great Britain some time after 1000 AD by the Vikings, and longhaired cats brought to Norway by Crusaders. These cats could have reproduced with farm and feral stock and may have eventually evolved into the modern-day Norwegian Forest breed. The Siberian and the Turkish <b>Angora,</b> longhaired <b>cats</b> from Russia and Turkey, respectively, are also possible ancestors of the breed. Norse legends refer to the skogkatt as a [...] "mountain-dwelling fairy cat with an ability to climb sheer rock faces that other cats could not manage." [...] Since the Norwegian Forest cat is a very adept climber, author Claire Bessant believes that the skogkatt folktale could be about the ancestor of the modern Norwegian Forest breed.
