5|$|Lemur {{communication}} can {{be transmitted}} through sound, sight, and smell (olfaction). The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, uses complex though highly stereotyped behaviors such as scent-marking and vocalizations. Visual signals <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> the least used by lemurs, since they lack many of the muscles used in common primate facial expressions. Given their poor vision, whole-body postures <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> more noticeable. However, the ring-tailed lemur has demonstrated distinct facial expressions including a threat stare, pulled back lips for submission, and pulled back ears along with flared nostrils during scent-marking. This species has also been observed using yawns as threats. Their ringed tails also communicate distance, warn off neighboring troops, and help locate troop members. Sifakas are known to exhibit an open-mouth play face {{as well as a}} submissive teeth-baring grimace used in agonistic interactions.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} HHT {{have a normal}} lifespan. The skin lesions and nosebleeds tend to develop during childhood. AVMs <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> present from birth, but don't {{necessarily}} cause any symptoms. Frequent nosebleeds {{are the most common}} symptom and can significantly affect quality of life.|$|E
50|$|Putney <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> settled {{during the}} Roman occupation. Lower Richmond Road <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a Roman Road, and the Lower Common <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an open pasture and farmland.|$|R

5|$|The Grade I listed Anglican parish {{church in}} Navenby is {{dedicated}} to Saint Peter. Despite parish registers existing from 1681, and Bishop's transcripts that go back to 1562, {{it is difficult to}} date the building as it has a mishmash of styles, although its origins <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{three other}} early prose Upanisads—Taittiriya, Aitareya, and Kausitaki come next; all <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> pre-Buddhist {{and can be}} {{assigned}} to the 6th to 5th centuries BCE.|$|E
5|$|A large {{percentage}} of people who live in urban areas have access to parks and gardens in their areas, which <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> the only connections they have with nature. A study shows that having contact with nature helps promote our health and well-being. People who had access to gardens or parks were found to be healthier than those who did not.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{locomotive}} is uncertain; it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a George Stephenson locomotive, and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built at Killingworth Colliery workshops around 1815-1820.|$|R
5000|$|... 20000 Varuna {{is a large}} {{classical}} Kuiper belt object. It <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a dwarf planet. It rotates {{rapidly and}} hence its shape <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> very elongated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{election}} return actually bears seven signatures - {{individuals who}} <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> made temporary burgage holders {{to qualify as}} electors for {{the day of the}} election but none of whom probably resided in the borough. The two [...] "voters" [...] who sought to nominate candidates <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> unqualified but <b>were</b> actual residents. Otherwise the report <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> truthful.|$|R
5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth found in a single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister to the remaining earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> no older than late Tertiary.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
50|$|The castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> built {{during the}} Celtic period as a refuge castle. The present burgstall only {{consists}} of two hollows between which the castle <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> located.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> of possessive origin {{derived from}} {{personal}} name Puńc (such a name <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> derived from Middle High German word punze, ponze, later a nickname?).|$|R
50|$|If {{the index}} {{is less than}} 40, then it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> stable in the test tube. If it is greater (for example, enaptin) then it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not stable.|$|R
5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} thick and thin {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it can sometimes be found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E
5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation, but <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> comparable.|$|E
25|$|Z <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> for /ts/. U /u/ and V /w/ are {{distinguished}} in {{only one}} early inscription. Θ <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> for /t/ and X for /g/ (Lejeune 1971, Solinas 1985).|$|R
2500|$|The {{derivation}} of [...] "Ulva" [...] is not certain, but <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{from the}} Old Norse for [...] "wolf isle". Samuel Johnson deduced that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not Gaelic in origin: ...|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{regarding}} neuroprotective and specially regenerative treatments, such as {{stem cell}} therapy, while their research is considered of high importance {{at the moment}} they are only a promise of future therapeutic approaches. Likewise, there are not any effective treatments for the progressive variants of the disease. Many of the newest drugs {{as well as those}} under development <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> going to be evaluated as therapies for PPMS or SPMS, and their improved effectiveness when compared with previously existing drugs may eventually lead to a positive result in these groups of patients.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E
5|$|In Rome, two Epitaph {{inscriptions}} {{have been}} found bearing {{the name of an}} Artavasdes. The Epitaphs <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> of the son and the grandson of a Median Atropatenian King called Ariobarzanes. However it is uncertain, if the Ariobarzanes refers to Ariobarzanes I or his grandson Ariobarzanes II. Artavasdes I is mentioned in paragraphs 27 and 33 of the Res Gestae Divi Augusti.|$|E

50|$|The initial herbivorous mesozooplankton <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> larvae of benthic (seafloor) animals. A {{larval stage}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> an {{evolutionary}} innovation {{driven by the}} increasing level of predation at the seafloor during the Ediacaran period.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to activities run by individual Scout groups, {{a large number}} of rallies, activities, competitions, and training courses are held by the different Regions. The biggest of these <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> the Kon-Tiki raft building competitions held annually in Cape Town and Gauteng. Nationally, the Senior Scout Adventure is held every two years in the Cederberg mountains. In the past, South Africa has also held a national Jamboree, known as SANJAMB.|$|E
5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with the mode of operation of the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Introduction of {{non-native}} {{species has}} occurred in many habitats. One of the best studied examples is the introduction of Nile perch into Lake Victoria in the 1960s. Nile perch gradually exterminated the lake's 500 endemic cichlid species. Some of them survive now in captive breeding programmes, but others <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> extinct. Carp, snakeheads, tilapia, European perch, brown trout, rainbow trout, and sea lampreys are other examples of fish that have caused problems by being introduced into alien environments.|$|E
25|$|In a 2012 interview, David X. Cohen {{said that}} this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{the first time that}} a {{mathematical}} theorem was proved in a television script, and that it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> Futuramas proudest mathematical moment.|$|R
50|$|Rimini <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> evangelized from Ravenna. Among its {{traditional}} martyrs are: St. Innocentia and companions; Saints Juventinus, Facundinus, and companions; Saints Theodorus and Marinus. The see <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> established before {{the peace of}} Constantine.|$|R
50|$|Mesa de Cacahuatenco <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a very {{important}} ceremonial center. It occupies an extension of over 75 hectares with more than 60 covered structures identified, the site <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{twice as large as}} El Tajin.|$|R
