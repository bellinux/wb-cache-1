500|$|Staffing {{schedules}} led to {{the band}} having a surplus of engineers at one point, and as a result, they split recording between Elsinore and the Edge's home studio to increase productivity. Engineer Robbie Adams said the approach raised morale and activity levels: [...] "There was always something different to listen to, always something exciting happening." [...] To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48tracks of audio by using a 24-track <b>analogue</b> <b>recording,</b> a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The focus on capturing the band's material and encouraging the best performances meant that little {{attention was paid to}} combating audio spill. In issue 14 of U2's fan magazine Propaganda, Lanois said that he believed some of the in-progress songs would become worldwide hits, despite lyrics and vocal takes being unfinished.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the time}} limit, U2 were forced to write and record songs at a more rapid pace. They {{continued}} their long-time practice of jamming in the studio. Eno and Flood edited together song sections they liked and then discussed the arrangements with the group. U2 suggested alterations and added lyrics and melodies, before performing to the edited arrangements. Eno used an eraseable whiteboard to give instructions and cues to the band while they jammed; he pointed at chords and various commands, such as [...] "hold", [...] "stop", [...] "change", and [...] "change back", to direct their performances. To record all of the band's material and test different arrangements, the engineers utilised a technique they called [...] "fatting", which allowed them to achieve more than 48tracks of audio by using a 24-track <b>analogue</b> <b>recording,</b> a DAT machine, and a synchroniser. The production crew faced issues with audio spill at The Factory, as all group members recorded {{in the same room}} as the mixing desk and Bono frequently sang in-progress lyrics that would need to be replaced. Gobos and wood booths were built to separate the performers' sounds as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, <b>analogue</b> <b>recording</b> was being {{replaced}} by digital recording and all forms of electronic entertainment began to converge. For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas [...] "success or failure used {{to be determined by}} the first weekend of its run. Today,... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits." [...] Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well. It is also [...] "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups". Globalisation and cultural imperialism are two of the cultural consequences of convergence. Others include fandom and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods. The [...] "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" [...] also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways for example, audiences can [...] "watch highlights, call up statistics", [...] "order tickets and merchandise" [...] and generally [...] "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".|$|E

2500|$|Sound {{recording}} {{and reproduction is}} an electrical or mechanical inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing, instrumental music, or sound effects. The two main classes of sound recording technology are analog {{recording and}} digital recording. Analog (or <b>analogue)</b> <b>recording</b> (Greek, ana = [...] "according to" [...] and logos = [...] "relationship") is a technique used to store signals of audio or video information for later playback. In digital recording, the analog signal of video or sound is converted into a stream of discrete numbers, representing the changes in chroma and luminance values (video) orair-pressure (audio) through time, thus making an abstract template for the original sound or moving image. In 1967, the first digital audio magnetic tape recorder is invented. A 12-bit 30kHz stereo device using a compander to extend the dynamic range.|$|E

However, an updated tighter sound is not uncommon as well. Stylistically, nu funk is somewhat close to jam bands.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{recordkeeping}} that takes place during large police operations in different command post settings, and presents the tentative results from a three-year study. The aim is to increase knowledge of the problems related to recordkeeping {{in this kind of}} environment. Two police operations have been used as data sources, one large EU ministerial meeting in Sweden, and one regional disaster training exercise. An interpretative case study approach has been applied where observation and interviews were the primary data collection techniques. One problem is that too much important information is recorded in less permanent ways, on whiteboards and on flip charts. Capture, storage, and dissemination of those temporal and <b>analogue</b> <b>records</b> are difficult, and reduce the possibility to use records from large operations as knowledge reservoirs...|$|R

50|$|In an <b>analogue</b> sound <b>recording,</b> the {{variation}} in pressure of a sound striking a microphone creates a corresponding variation in the current passing through it or voltage across it.

40|$|A {{time series}} of {{pressure}} variations {{was obtained by}} digitizing <b>analogue</b> <b>records</b> of bottom pressure, recorded at Pt. Sur, California, during the periods November, December, and January, 1947 - 1948, and June, July, and August, 1949. The power spectrum of the pressure variations was found via the amplitude spectra obtained {{by means of the}} fast Fourier transform. This spectrum was then smoothed by averaging over several frequency bands and confidence limits were assigned. Surface wave power spectra were inferred from the pressure power spectra and significant wave heights were estimated from these, after applying a procedure designed to remove noise. Values of significant height on the bottom and at the surface are displayed in tabular form and plotted versus time for the selected periods January, 1948, and August, 1949. The spectral patterns of wave activity show the transient nature of the energy due to storm swell and local winds. [URL]...|$|R
