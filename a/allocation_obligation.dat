40|$|In the {{presented}} {{academic work}} I study the <b>allocation</b> of <b>obligations</b> between the Republic of Slovenia {{and the local}} communities for drinking water supply in the regions of Slovenska Istra, Kras and Brkini with Reka valley. Rižanski vodovod Koper, Kraški vodovod Sežana and Komunala Ilirska Bistrica are public companies that provide the water supply {{in the area of}} study. Their main water sources are Rižana, Brestovica and Bistrica. The regions are dealing with the problem of lack in water quantities, especially in the summer months. Because Rižanski vodovod Koper has to buy the missing quantities of water from the neighboring water sistems, it faces the most critial problems with water supply. A problem of the sudied water sistems is also the provision of spare water sources, that represent one of the basis for quality water supplies. Many different studies were made, with the intent of sloving the water problems, but none of them were realised. This time, I decided to look at the problem from a different point of view, a way that allocates obligations between the local community and the Republic of Slovenia. Based on the results of SWOT and GIS analysis, I can claim that the best option for future water supply would be option C. In this case is the water supply manegement entirely under the responsibility of the Republic of Slovenia...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission Code {{of conduct}} for {{responsible}} {{nanosciences and nanotechnologies}} research (EC CoC) {{is a case of}} soft regulation of an emerging technology field. It can be deemed an instrument of meta-regulation aimed at fostering self-regulatory behaviours, and {{as an example of the}} distribution of responsibilities among stakeholders within the Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) framework. Between 2007 and 2011 three major consultations concerning the Code were launched, and can be regarded as a tool to implement the compliance with the EC CoC and thus to foster the <b>allocation</b> of <b>obligations.</b> They also permit to analyze the genesis of the EC CoC from its initial drafting to its adoption and thus to follow the development of the RRI’s ‘normative anchor points’ within a Community instrument, their influence on the principles and guidelines of the Code, and their perception among stakeholders. In sum, they make it possible to study one possible path for ‘anchor points’ to enter the regulation and to affect the stakeholders’ behaviour. The consultations address concerns with regard to the language and structure of the EC CoC which have negatively affected the perception of stakeholders. This aspect can also have limited the process of compliance with the Code’s principles and guidelines. This case study shows the importance of the communication of principles within a self-regulatory instrument (EC CoC) designed as meta-regulation, as well as of those goals, such as ‘normative anchor points’, that drive its formulation...|$|R
40|$|Asset-backed {{securitisation}} (ABS) is a refinancing {{technique that}} involves the issuance of state contingent claims on the cash flow performance of a designated pool of asset exposures. Efficient risk management and asset <b>allocation</b> of ABS <b>obligations</b> requires both investors and issuers to thoroughly understand the inherent spread dynamics in this growing segment of fixed income markets. We model the heteroskedasticity of secondary market spreads of European CDO, MBS and Pfandbrief transactions in a multi-factor GARCH process for valuation and forecasting purposes. We find that expected spread changes tend to be level stationary with model estimates indicating asymmetric mean reversion with a positive trend depending on the direction of past innovations and spread changes. Also, conditional spread volatility follows an asymmetric stochastic process biased towards negative past residuals associated with spread declines, which inflate time-varying heteroskedasticity. These spread dynamics of ABS imply that negative investor sentiment during persistent spread increases causes spreads to escape stationary approximation in the long run, especially for unexpected downward price corrections...|$|R
40|$|In {{this brief}} {{criticism}} I discuss {{the complexities of}} practical judgements on global justice and spell out important agreements with David Miller: (a) global and special - particularly national - obligations are in serious tension; (b) both simple 'global egalitarianism' and 'domestic justice' are morally counter-intuitive; and (c) moral minimalism is the most promising theoretical and practical strategy. Complex moral theories, however, are confronted with three serious dilemmas: (1) how to compare, measure, and weigh conflicting obligations; (2) how to make global moral responsibilities really bite; and (3) how to best {{address the problem of}} an adequate <b>allocation</b> of global <b>obligations.</b> As a consequence of his fairly traditional way of doing political philosophy, Miller's answers have serious shortcomings. I argue for a departure from the entrenched division of labour between moral or political philosophy and the social sciences. I opt for an institutional turn in political theory and for institutional pluralism. A multi-level and multi-layered institutionalist approach is more appropriate to realize the fulfilment of the global minimum in the real world...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{occupies}} a key {{position in the}} Indian economy providing a source of livelihood {{for a majority of}} the population. Successes in agricultural front with high production levels, especially in food grains have indeed been achieved. But more energy in the form of mineral fertilizers, chemical pesticides and farm machinery are required every year to produce the same quantity of farm products. Historically, women have been the managers of natural resources as they are dependent on them for their livelihood and their family’s needs. The consequences of over exploitation of these resources have rendered them scarce. The rural women collect over 28 % of all energy consumed in India in the form of firewood. Most of the 140 million tonnes of firewood burnt annually come from forests. Poverty and unemployment in rural areas have resulted in large-scale migration to urban areas. Women are being forced to take up more drudgerous jobs as a source of livelihood as most of the migrants are absorbed into the construction sector. Women form the largest work force in agricultural sector. Caring for livestock comes naturally to women. The most drudgerous jobs in livestock production like cleaning of the cattle sheds, feeding the cattle, collection of fodder etc. always fall on the woman. Care for young animals and backyard livestock is also largely done by women. In caring for sick young animals women have evolved several ethno veterinary practices. Despite recent agricultural innovations there is no respite for rural women. While agricultural innovations leads to the reallocation of family labour and the assignment to men of complete control over output and income, without associated changes in the <b>allocation</b> of <b>obligations,</b> welfare and nutritional status of the family may actually decline...|$|R
40|$|Defence date: 30 January 2017 Examining Board: Professor Loïc Azoulai, Sciences Po Paris (Supervisor); Professor Marco Dani, University of Trento/LSE; Professor Gareth Davies, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Professor Hans-Wolfgang Micklitz, European University InstituteThe picture {{presented}} and {{often referred to}} in EU internal market law and legal scholarship is clear. Within the internal market private actors are the recipients of rights and public authorities are constrained in their (regulatory) powers. The notion of this new individualism is bound up with capacities, powers, and resources that empower private actors {{to engage in the}} internal market and cross-border situations;ultimately serving the objectives the internal market seeks to attain. Yet, within thinew individualism a conceptually different class of private actors has emerged that is constrained in economic freedoms, i. e. through obligations, rather than being empowered {{in the context of the}} internal market. This thesis will enquire the reasons that led to the development of this counter-culture. Why did it emerge? To what extent does this phenomenon affect the roles of private actors in the internal market? I will demonstrate that under the counter-culture private actors are responsibilized and transformed into ‘competent authorities’, i. e. alternative forms of regulatory authority, in the internal market. Private actors are placed into systems of shared responsibilities the relationships of which are coordinated by EU internal market law. In this regard, the concept of responsibility will serve as a tool to bridge the gap between the new positions EU internal market law allocates to private actors and the emerging legal consequences, i. e. <b>allocation</b> of <b>obligations</b> or tasks. The legal contexts of EU free movement law, EU discrimination law, EU food safety law and EU data protection law will serve as case studies against which the construed conceptual framework will be tested. Under the counter-culture the new individualism is no longer only about the exercise of self-interests. Rather, this form of the new individualism comes with a requirement to give account to the interests of other actors within the internal market...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{scale of}} the HIV {{pandemic}} – and the stigma, discrimination and violence that surrounded its sudden emergence – catalyzed a public health response that expanded human rights in principle and practice. In the absence of effective treatment, human rights activists initially sought to protect individuals {{at high risk of}} HIV infection. With advances in antiretroviral therapy, activists expanded their efforts under international law, advocating under the human right to health for individual access to treatment. Discussion: As a clinical cure comes within reach, human rights obligations will continue to {{play a key role in}} political and programmatic decision-making. Building upon the evolving development and implementation of the human right to health in the global response to HIV, we outline a human rights research agenda to prepare for HIV cure access, investigating the role of human rights law in framing 1) resource <b>allocation,</b> 2) international <b>obligations,</b> 3) intellectual property and 4) freedom from coercion. Conclusions: The right to health is widely recognized as central to governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental responses to the pandemic and critical both to addressing vulnerability to infection and to ensuring universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. While the advent of an HIV cure will raise new obligations for policymakers in implementing the right to health, the resolution of past debates surrounding HIV prevention and treatment may inform claims for universal access...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LLD (Public Law)) —University of Stellenbosch,In this {{dissertation}} {{a comparative}} study {{is made of}} the constitutional accommodation {{of the distribution of}} financial resources and constitutional obligations to the various spheres of government in Germany and South Africa. Both countries have decentralised or multi-level systems of government and can be classified, in terms of current studies on federalism, as integrated or cooperative federal systems. An overview of the historical developments, the political contexts, the fundamental principles and the constitutional frameworks for government in Germany and South Africa is provided as a basis for the in-depth analysis regarding the financial intergovernmental relations in these countries. This study has shown that economic theory is important in the design of decentralised systems of government and that political and socio-economic considerations, for example, the need for rebuilding Germany after World War II and the need to eliminate severe poverty in South Africa after 1994, often play a dominant role in the design and implementation of decentralised constitutional systems. The economic theory applicable to decentralised systems of government suggests a balanced approach to the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations with a view to obtaining the most efficient and equitable solution. In both countries the particular constitutional <b>allocation</b> of <b>obligations</b> and financial resources created a fiscal gap that required some form of revenue sharing or financial equalisation. The German financial equalisation system has been developed over fifty years and is quite complex. It attempts to balance the constitutional aim of reasonable equalisation of the financial disparity of the Länder with the financial autonomy of the Länder as required by the Basic Law. The huge financial and economic demands from the eastern Länder after unification in 1990 placed an additional burden on the available funds and on the financial equalisation system. Germany currently faces reform of its financial equalisation system and possibly also bigger constitutional reform. The South African constitutional system is only a decade old and the financial equalisation system that is less complex than the German system, is functioning reasonably well but needs time to develop to its full potential. The system may however require some adjustment in order to enhance accountability, efficiency and equity. A lack of sufficient skills and administrative capacity at municipal government level and in some provinces hampers service delivery and good governance and places additional pressure on the financial equalisation system. The Bundesverfassungsgericht and the Constitutional Court play important roles in Germany and South Africa in upholding the principle of constitutional supremacy, and make a valuable contribution to the better understanding of the constitutional systems and the further development thereof. This study has shown that clear principles in constitutional texts, for example, such as those contained in the Basic Law, guide the development of applicable financial legislation and add value to the provisions on financial equalisation and how they are implemented. These principles in the Basic Law are justiciable and give the Bundesverfassungsgericht an important tool to adjudicate the financial equalisation legislation. The study of the constitutional accommodation of the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations in Germany and South Africa is not an abstract academic exercise and should be seen in the particular political and socio-economic contexts within which the respective constitutions function. The need to give effect to the realisation of socio-economic rights, for example, the right of access to health services, places additional demands on the financial equalisation system. The South African society experienced a major transformation from the apartheid system to a democratic constitutional order that in itself has had a significant influence on financial intergovernmental relations. This dissertation focuses on a distinct part of constitutional law that can be described as financial constitutional law. This comparative analysis of the two countries has provided some lessons for the further development of South Africa’s young democracy, in particular the financial intergovernmental relations system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to answer}} whether Dutch law {{contains}} an obligation for the Dutch government to – in principle – provide equal opportunities in land allocation agreements. On {{the basis of}} the principle of equality – including formal and substantive equal treatment by the government and equality between competitors on the market – the starting point in this thesis is that the government should provide such equal opportunities to all potential contractors. Currently, an explicit general obligation to provide equal opportunities in the context of land transfers does not exist. However, if a land allocation agreement is a public works contract or a public works concession within the meaning of the procurement legislation and its value exceeds the threshold of currently € 5 million (excluding VAT), Dutch law explicitly requires the government to provide equal opportunities. In addition, the ECJ has ruled that the government must provide equal opportunities for public contracts with a value below the threshold that have a certain cross-border interest. Both obligations force the government to treat potential contractors from other member states and national potential contractors substantially equally. They also envisage the development of competition within the Union. The elements that must be present in such a contract for it to be regarded as a public works contract or a public works concession are described and analysed in detail. Land allocation agreements that are national public contracts/concessions or are not public contracts/concessions at all (i. e. a pure land transfer), are not covered by these explicit obligations to provide equal opportunities. However, for these contracts such an obligation was found to be implicitly present in Dutch law. For European pure land transfer, this obligation is based in essence on Articles 49 and 56 TFEU that prohibit the government to treat potential contractors from other member states substantially unequally. For national land <b>allocation</b> agreements, the <b>obligation</b> to provide equal opportunities arguably stems from the Dutch general principles of proper administration that must be given substance using the principle of equality described above. Although exceptions are possible, they should be applied restrictively. Finally, recommendations are made for the European and Dutch legislator, the courts and the administration. These include that the European legislator should clarify and simplify the definition of public works contracts and concessions, as well as codify the obligation to provide equal opportunities in the context of European pure land transfer. As long as these recommendations are not implemented by the European legislator, this should be done by the Dutch legislator. The ECJ and Dutch courts should, when the occasion arises, acknowledge the obligation to provide equal opportunities in the context of European pure land transfer and national land allocation agreements. The administration is advised to accept and comply with the obligation to provide equal opportunities when entering into a land allocation agreement. The discussion should therefore be shifted from the question whether there is such an obligation {{to the question of how}} to flesh out that obligation in a meaningful manne...|$|R
