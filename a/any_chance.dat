5|$|Begun in 1939, {{plans were}} far enough along that tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of the B-65's construction.|$|E
5|$|A {{modus vivendi}} had been {{achieved}} between Warwick {{and the king}} for some months, but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu's earldom of Northumberland prevented <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of full reconciliation. A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north, where he could be confronted by Warwick's men. Edward, however, discovered the plot when Robert, Lord Welles, was routed at Losecote Field, and gave away the plan.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority to prevent it from assembling during 1861 and 1862. This prevented <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> the Democrats might have had to interfere with the war effort or to attempt to secede from the Union.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, their {{population}} was feared to have declined {{past the point}} of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.|$|E
5|$|Dortmund {{started off}} their {{campaign}} in the third qualifying of the Champions League round defeating Shakhtar Donetsk 5–1 over two legs. Borussia needed to win their last group game against Liverpool to have <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of {{making it to the}} second group stage, but they lost 2–0 and were eliminated from Group B on goal difference, after finishing on the same points as Boavista.|$|E
5|$|Fresno State {{was able}} to run a 7-play, 72-yard drive to begin the fourth quarter that culminated with a 32-yard field goal by Breshears making the score 29-10. <b>Any</b> <b>chance</b> of a Bulldog {{comeback}} was quashed after Carr threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns to Reed and Hayden Greenbauer, the latter of which came with just 1:14 to play. The final score was 43-10, the Mustangs victorious.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015, Bruce {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} extension. A run of poor form left Hull {{near the bottom of}} the table going into the final game of the 2014–15 season and needing to defeat Bruce's former club Manchester United to stand <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of avoiding relegation. They could only manage a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championship. The poor performances of a number of players signed by Bruce, including club record signing Abel Hernández, were identified as key factors in the club's failure to remain in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|In the June 1977, Wark was {{selected}} for the Scotland squad for the first time, for a friendly match against East Germany; however, a torn hamstring sustained in pre-season training ended <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of an international debut. The injury also {{kept him out of}} first-team football until January 1978, when he returned for a match against Cardiff City in the third round of the 1977–78 FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 1943, the Soviets {{launched}} their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk {{marked the end}} of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front. The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and by the Lower Dnieper Offensives.|$|E

5|$|Seventh-century Muslim armies had no siege equipment, and {{typically}} employed siege tactics {{only when there}} were no other options. Without the necessary siege equipment, armies of the early Muslim expansion would surround a city, denying it supplies until the city's defenders surrendered. Meanwhile <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of breaking into the city would be availed, if possible, using stealth and espionage. Muslim armies would usually isolate the city {{from the rest of the}} region and deploy scouts along vital routes.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh was the costliest {{battle in}} American history {{to that point}} and the {{staggering}} 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others {{with him at the}} time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests {{and said they}} were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided between those who expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having <b>any</b> <b>chance.</b> They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E

5|$|The Burgess Shale {{animals were}} {{probably}} killed {{by changes in}} their environment either immediately preceding or during the mud-slides that buried them. Proposed killing mechanisms include: changes in salinity; poisoning by chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide or methane; changes in the availability of oxygen; and changing consistency of the sea floor. The death event was not necessarily related to the burial, and {{there may have been}} multiple death events between burial events; but only organisms killed immediately before a burial event would stand <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of being fossilised, instead of rotting or being eaten.|$|E
5|$|The Pleiades {{have long}} been {{known to be a}} {{physically}} related group of stars rather than <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> alignment. The Reverend John Michell calculated in 1767 that the probability of a chance alignment of so many bright stars was only 1 in 500,000, and so surmised that the Pleiades and many other clusters of stars must be physically related. When studies were first made of the stars' proper motions, it was found that they are all moving in the same direction across the sky, at the same rate, further demonstrating that they were related.|$|E
5|$|The TsKB-17 design bureau {{proposed}} {{variants of}} the design with both cruise and ballistic missiles. The ballistic missiles would have been launched from vertical tubes replacing the forward turrets, and in one version, the entire main armament. The proposal was dropped because both types would have needed a fully stabilized launching platform to give them <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of hitting their targets and that the ballistic missiles would need three hours of preparation time.|$|E

5|$|The royalists rose in May 1648, igniting the Second Civil War, and {{as agreed}} with Charles, the Scots invaded England. Uprisings in Kent, Essex, and Cumberland, and a {{rebellion}} in South Wales, were put {{down by the}} New Model Army, and with {{the defeat of the}} Scots at the Battle of Preston in August 1648, the royalists lost <b>any</b> <b>chance</b> of winning the war.|$|E
5|$|Their {{opponents in}} the second round were English team Ipswich Town. The first leg, at Ipswich's home ground Portman Road, was won 3–0 by the English team.

In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari's victory allowed them to reduce McLaren's lead to four points. Williams remained in third place with 34 points. Benetton increased the gap over Jordan in fifth place to a seven-point advantage, with three races of the season remaining.|$|E
