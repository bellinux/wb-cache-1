5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. Adam de Colone, perhaps the son of Adrian Vanson and probably trained in the Netherlands, was working in England in the 1620s.

Upon Andrew's demand, Pope Gregory declared on 31 August that Andrew <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> could only be excommunicated by the authorization of the Holy See. Andrew died on 21 September, and was buried in Egres Abbey.|$|E
5|$|For {{services}} unknown, he {{was rewarded}} with a consulship early in Vespasian's reign in 71. This was a remarkable honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, {{but also because it}} was an ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making him one of the few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E

5|$|In 1002 King Æthelred the Unready married Emma of Normandy, {{the sister}} of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the {{establishment}} of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons,</b> Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.|$|E
5|$|In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann {{records that}} Ragnall <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> were {{defeated}} {{in a particularly}} bloody battle against Áengus. The chronicle does not identify {{the location of the}} battle, or elaborate under what circumstances it was fought. However, {{it is possible that the}} conflict took place in the northern part of the meic Somairle domain, where some of Áengus' lands may have lain. Although the hostile contact between Ragnall and Áengus could have been result of Ragnall's rise in power at Dubgall's expense, the clash of 1192 may also mark Ragnall's downfall.|$|E

5|$|Most of Ælfhelm's {{subsequent}} historical appearances record him as {{a witness}} to charters, although one notable exception is the will of his brother, Wulfric Spot.

5|$|Ragnall disappears from record {{after he}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> were {{defeated}} {{by his brother}} Áengus. Ragnall's death-date is unknown, although certain dates between 1191 and 1227 are all possibilities. Surviving contemporary sources reveal that Ragnall was a significant patron of the Church. Although his father appears to have aligned himself with traditional forms of Christianity, Ragnall himself is associated with newer reformed religious orders from the continent. Ragnall's now non-existent seal, which pictured a knight on horseback, also indicates that he attempted to present himself as an up-to-date ruler, not unlike his Anglo-French contemporaries of the bordering Kingdom of Scots.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata narrates that Kalmashapada cultivates {{an intense}} hatred for Vashishtha <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons.</b> He eats Shakti and his 99 {{brothers}} to seek his vengeance.

Texts {{such as the}} Mahabharata, the Linga Purana, and the Kanchipuranam blame Vishwamitra for provoking Kalmashapada to slay Vashishtha's sons. An older scripture, Brihaddevata, also mentions that multiple Saudasas (sons of Sudasa) slay the hundred sons of Vashishtha.|$|E

5|$|The Vana Parva {{book of the}} Mahabharata narrates that an asura (demon) named Dhundhu {{lived under}} the sands of the desert of Ujjalaka, in Marudhanva. Dhundu terrorized the whole world. Upset by Dhundu's action, Uttanka– whose ashram was in Ujjalaka– {{performed}} tapas (austerities) dedicated to Vishnu. Pleased, Vishnu told Uttanka that the Ikshvaku king Kulavalashva would slay the demon. The sage went to the king's palace and recounted Vishnu's prophecy. Kuvalasva <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>sons</b> went to the forest and killed the demon. As a result, Kulavalashva became known as Dhundhumara, the slayer of Dhundhu.|$|E

Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency.
