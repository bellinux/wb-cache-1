5|$|The NHL {{decided not}} to allow all players to {{participate}} in 1988, 1992, 1994 and since 2018 because the Winter Olympics typically occur in February, during the league's regular season.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> {{the weather}} allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions {{throughout the day}} and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe {{over the next two}} days but to little effect.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> Cape Town, Coghlan and {{his wife}} left Kimberley for Bulawayo on 30 July 1900. There, they found the {{conditions}} to be very basic and the buildings, ramshackle. Nevertheless, the settlers enjoyed outdoor pursuits, dances and musical and theatrical performances. Coghlan {{and his wife}} lodged at the Grand Hotel. In 1901, not long after they arrived, the Coghlans' first child was born, but the baby lived only three days. A second child, a girl named Petal, was born in November 1902 and lived to old age.|$|E

5|$|During {{the fifth}} term, 1999 to 2004, there was <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the grand {{coalition}} {{resulting in a}} centre-right coalition between the Liberal and People's parties. This {{was reflected in the}} Presidency of the Parliament with the terms being shared between the EPP and the ELDR, rather than the EPP and Socialists. In the following term the liberal group grew to hold 88 seats, the largest number of seats held by any third party in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> {{tradition}} when the Echo title-piece appeared reversed out in white {{on a red}} background, instead of the more familiar red or black lettering. The new title-piece was designed to give a greater impact to the colourful front page. It {{was the first in}} a series of changes which included dropping Sunderland from the title in 1990, the paper simply becoming The Echo. This change was reversed in 1997, with a return to the name Sunderland Echo.|$|E

5|$|Membership is conferred for life. Formerly, {{the death}} of a monarch ("demise of the Crown") brought an {{immediate}} dissolution of the Council, as all Crown appointments automatically lapsed. By the 18th century, it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up to six months after the demise of the Crown. By convention, however, the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its dissolution. In practice, therefore, membership continued without <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> <b>In</b> 1901 the law was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly unaffected by any succession of monarch.|$|E
5|$|The AFL was {{confined}} to an enclave around the capital during the conflict, and did not play a significant part in the fighting. Elections in July 1997 finally brought Taylor to power. Under the accords, which led to <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> fighting in 1996 and the Liberian general election, 1997, ECOMOG was to retrain a new national army based on fair ethnic and geographical representation. Yet Taylor denied ECOMOG any role in the restructuring of the AFL, and the force eventually left Liberia {{by the end of}} 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{big game}} starts with six players, {{including}} Howard and the Kid, with Shooter playing as he deals and Lady Fingers relieving him whenever Shooter needs <b>a</b> <b>break.</b> <b>In</b> {{the first big}} confrontation between the Kid and Howard, the Kid is short $2,000 and Slade steps in to stake him. Several hours later, Howard busts a player called Pig, perhaps with a bluff, and the remaining players take a break. Following the break, Lady Fingers, who has been delighting in needling Howard all evening, takes over as dealer and continues to needle him.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the power and}} size performance of unit root tests when the data undergo Markov regime switching. All tests, including those robust to <b>a</b> single <b>break</b> <b>in</b> trend growth rate, have low power against a process with a Markov-switching trend. Under the null hypothesis, we find previously documented size distortions in Dickey-Fuller type tests caused by <b>a</b> single <b>break</b> <b>in</b> trend growth rate or variance do not generalize to most parameterizations of Markov switching in trend or variance. However, Markov switching in variance can lead to overrejection in tests allowing for <b>a</b> single <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the level of trend. Time-series analysis; Business cycles...|$|R

5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. <b>A</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E

During a school trip, the youngsters find an alien in distress and have to help it without revealing its presence {{to the rest of}} their friends.

5|$|After the one {{surviving}} roll from Henry I's reign, {{no further}} Pipe rolls survived from his reign, nor are any preserved from {{the reign of}} his successor, King Stephen (reigned 1135–1154). But by {{the second year of}} King Henry II's reign, or 1155, they once more survive. It is unclear if Pipe rolls were actually created during Stephen's reign and they did not survive, or if the conditions during Stephen's reign precluded the creation of Pipe rolls. Continuously from the early years of King Henry II's reign, most Pipe rolls survive, with only <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the last years of King John's reign (reigned 1199–1216).|$|E

5|$|Bonnie {{continued}} to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, {{a very unusual}} occurrence in a small and weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 {{to the east of}} New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble {{was similar}} to that {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise and was immediately followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E
5|$|During December 1796 {{and early}} January 1797, the French army {{repeatedly}} attempted {{to land in}} Ireland. Early in the voyage, the frigate Fraternité carrying de Galles and Hoche, was separated from the fleet and missed the rendezvous at Mizen Head. Admiral Bouvet and General Grouchy decided to attempt the landing at Bantry Bay without their commanders, but severe weather made any landing impossible. For {{more than a week}} the fleet waited for <b>a</b> <b>break</b> <b>in</b> the storm, until Bouvet abandoned the invasion on 29December and, after a brief and unsuccessful effort to land {{at the mouth of the}} River Shannon, ordered his scattered ships to return to Brest. During the operation and subsequent retreat a further 11ships were wrecked or captured, with the loss of thousands of soldiers and sailors.|$|E
