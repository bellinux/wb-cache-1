5|$|Maloney and Smythe's {{most famous}} horse Wonder Where, {{also led to}} {{the breakup of the}} partnership. Wonder Where, named by Maloney, was bred <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> Selke's farm in Quebec and bought by Maloney and Smythe in 1957. In 1959, Wonder Where had an {{outstanding}} season, including winning the Canadian Oaks. The horse was voted Canadian Horse of the Year for the year and later, the filly was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame. The Wonder Where Stakes was established in honour of the horse in 1965, becoming one of the Canadian Triple Tiara races for fillies in Canada in 1995. After the outstanding year in 1959, Maloney wanted to continue racing Wonder Where and Smythe did not, concerned over some tendon trouble. The horse broke down in a race in Fort Erie, and the partnership dissolved after that.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{released}} {{with great}} fanfare and much anticipation, All Star Batman has consistently received negative reviews from critics. Nearly all {{complaints about the}} series are directed <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> Miller's writing, specifically his non-traditional interpretation of the main character. In the series to date, Batman is consistently displayed as violent, cruel and almost childish at times, excited by his own sadism towards criminals, musing over the injuries he inflicts and disarray that follows. Infamous examples of this include his verbal and physical abuse of Dick Grayson {{in an attempt to}} prevent him from grieving over his parents' deaths, and the action of throwing a Molotov cocktail during a fight.|$|E

500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them." [...] Wyatt testified, [...] "Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|Though the GSC {{concluded}} that mining activities {{contributed to the}} slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility. [...] Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of [...] "equilibrium"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide. The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain. Coal production <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> peaked in 1910, but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.|$|E
500|$|Witness C. H. [...] "Ham" [...] Light saw Tom {{running or}} {{stumbling}} westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street, {{away from the}} gunfight, while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting. Light testified that Tom fell {{at the foot of}} a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there, without moving, through the duration of the fight. Fallehy also saw Tom stagger across the street until he fell on his back. After shooting Tom, Holliday tossed the empty shotgun aside, pulled out his nickel-plated revolver, and continued to fire <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> McLaury and Billy Clanton.|$|E

500|$|An unusually warm winter, {{with warm}} days and cold nights, {{was also a}} factor. Water in the mountain's {{fissures}} froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports. Heavy snowfall in the region in March {{was followed by a}} warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures. [...] GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide. [...] The crew of the freight train that arrived <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below [...] Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.|$|E
500|$|Another song {{first issued}} on Capitol's Yesterday and Today, [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] was written {{primarily}} by Lennon, with McCartney {{claiming to have}} helped on the lyric and estimating the song as [...] "80–20" [...] to Lennon. Harrison and McCartney played dual lead-guitar parts on the recording, including an ascending riff that Riley terms [...] "magnetic... everything sticks to it". Riley describes the composition as a [...] "shaded putdown" [...] {{in the style of}} Dylan's [...] "Positively 4th Street", whereby Lennon sings to someone who has seen [...] "seven wonders" [...] yet is unable to empathise with him and his feelings of isolation. According to Gould, the song was directed <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> Sinatra after Lennon had read a hagiographic article on the singer, in Esquire magazine, in which Sinatra was lauded as [...] "the fully emancipated male... the man who can have anything he wants".|$|E
500|$|American {{singer and}} actress Beverly D'Angelo guest {{starred in the}} episode as Lurleen Lumpkin. The actress first met Groening at a party <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> Zappa's house, and {{was called in to}} {{audition}} for Lurleen based on her performance as Patsy Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter. She got the role after completing a singing test. D'Angelo wrote two songs for the episode: [...] "Your Wife Don't Understand You" [...] (which Lurleen sings at the Beer 'N' Brawl where Homer hears her for the first time) and [...] "I Bagged a Homer". D'Angelo wrote both songs in an hour and presented them to Groening at the episode's table read. Unlike most other guest stars on The Simpsons who record their lines and then leave to accommodate their schedule, D'Angelo stayed with the production team all day and pitched several jokes for the episode. Entertainment Weekly named D'Angelo's performance as Lurleen one of the sixteen best guest appearances on The Simpsons. Tom Nawrocki of Rolling Stone rated the songs D'Angelo wrote as two of the best songs {{in the history of the}} show.|$|E
5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1985 in Atlanta.

Kevn also hooked up with Tim Nielsen, {{who was in a}} popular band called the Nightporters with drummer Paul Lenz at the time. Kinney had just moved to Georgia from Milwaukee and was working in a sewage treatment plant by day while playing folk gigs by night. The band’s name, Drivin’ N’ Cryin’, was chosen from one of Kevn’s many songs that reflected the two directions of their music.|$|R

500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left <b>at</b> <b>Frank</b> Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E
500|$|According to The Tombstone Epitaph, [...] "Wyatt Earp {{stood up}} and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit." [...] Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, {{disabling}} his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground. Wyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He {{tried and failed to}} grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. [...] Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, [...] "That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him." [...] Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired <b>at</b> <b>Frank.</b> [...] Frank fell to the sidewalk {{on the east side of}} Fremont Street.|$|E
