40|$|There is a {{perception}} that dental services are a large and growing part of private health insurance. 1 Motives of consumers to take out private health cover may vary from person to person. This edition of the National Dental Update examines the performance of general treatment cover (previously referred to as <b>ancillary</b> <b>cover)</b> in light of rising private health premiums, growing demand for general treatment services {{and a decline in}} benefits paid to patients.

40|$|This {{publication}} presents {{findings on}} dental visiting and receipt of dental services by dental insurance status. It uses {{information from the}} National Dental Telephone Interview Survey, 2010. Key findings: Dental insurance associated with proportion visiting ‘Dental insurance’ means private health insurance extras cover (also known as <b>ancillary</b> <b>cover)</b> that includes any form of dental cover. A higher proportion of Australian adults with insurance made a dental visit in the last 12 months (70. 9 %) than adults without insurance (48. 3 %). Adults who visited in the last 12 months made 2. 3 dental visits on average, and this did not vary between those with and without insurance. This indicates that while insurance may have enabled access to dental care, it {{did not lead to}} a greater demand for visits once access had been obtained. A higher proportion of adults with dental insurance visited for a check-up (66. 1 %) than adults without insurance (50. 2 %). Dental insurance related to more preventive care A higher proportion of adults with insurance had scale and clean services in the previous 12 months (83. 5 %) than adults without insurance (63. 6 %). A lower proportion of adults with insurance had fillings (37. 2 %), than adults without insurance (43. 9 %). A higher proportion of adults without insurance had extractions (19. 0 %) than adults with insurance (10. 4 %). Provision of dentures varied by insurance status, with a lower proportion of adults with insurance receiving dentures (3. 2 %) than adults without insurance (6. 3 %). Insurance was associated with a different reason for dental visits and a different pattern of services that was more oriented to prevention and retention of natural teeth. Similar visit and treatment patterns for cardholders and non-cardholders with dental insurance Proportions of adults who made a dental visit in the previous 12 months were similar for Australian Government concession cardholders (see Box 1) and non-cardholders with insurance (68. 3 % and 73. 0 %) and for adults without insurance (46. 4 % and 52. 1 %). Average numbers of dental visits were similar for cardholders and non-cardholders for adults with insurance (2. 6 and 2. 2 visits) and without (2. 4 and 2. 3). Cardholders with insurance were far more likely than cardholders without insurance to have visited for a check-up at their most recent dental visit (61. 9 % and 40. 4 %). Proportions of adults who had extractions were similar for cardholders and non-cardholders for adults with insurance (15. 2 % and 10. 4 %) and without (23. 8 % and 17. 5 %). Proportions of adults who had scale and clean services were similar for cardholders and non-cardholders for adults with insurance (81. 2 % and 83. 4 %) and without (57. 3 % and 67. 4 %).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{empirical evidence}} on the behaviour of consumers in the Australian private health insurance market. It comprises three essays that cover topics such as consumer demand, selection bias, moral hazard, state dependence, heuristics and choice quality. The first essay explores dynamics in the demand for private health insurance around family formation. Using a panel dataset of young Australian women, {{it is found that}} demand responds positively to the desire for additional children but that women often leave insurance when they finish family building. At the same time, state dependence - the propensity to maintain insurance from one period to the next regardless of circumstances - is also found to be important. These results are robust across a number of specifications. The second essay focuses on the private ancillaries health insurance market. Using data from the National Health Survey, the causal effect of insurance on utilisation for various health services is estimated. The essay also considers the impact of selection bias in this market, that is the propensity for insureds to have a different risk profile than the general population. Using an instrumental variables estimation strategy, insurance is found to increase utilisation of some health services, in particular dental and physical health services. There is also evidence that certain groups are adversely selecting into insurance, such as females and the highly educated, based on major health service categories. However, there is less evidence that selection bias across the joint probability of utilising multiple health services is important. The third essay focuses on choice quality and how this is influenced by an important form of complexity - the bundling of private ancillaries and private hospital health insurance. Using a discrete choice experiment, the quality of health insurance choices for a representative sample of Australians is evaluated. The results indicate that consumers are likely to make choices that violate expected utility theory, use heuristic decision strategies, and over-insure relative to minimising out-of-pocket costs. Decision quality is significantly lower when choosing a bundled hospital/ancillaries health insurance policy (compared to stand-alone <b>ancillaries</b> <b>cover),</b> which is the policy type most consumers purchase in Australia...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{estimating}} monthly burned area globally at 1 &deg;&nbsp;spatial resolution using Terra MODIS data and <b>ancillary</b> vegetation <b>cover</b> information. Using regression trees constructed for 14 different global regions, MODIS active fire observations were calibrated to ''true'' burned area estimates derived from 500 -m MODIS imagery based on the conventional assumption that burned area is proportional to counts of fire pixels. Unlike earlier methods, we allow the constant of proportionality to vary {{as a function of}} tree and herbaceous vegetation cover, and the mean size of monthly cumulative fire-pixel clusters. In areas undergoing active deforestation, we implemented a subsequent correction based on tree cover information and a simple measure of fire persistence. Regions showing good agreement between predicted and observed burned area included Boreal Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and Temperate North America, where the estimates produced by the regression trees were relatively accurate and precise. Poorest agreement was found for southern-hemisphere South America, where predicted values of burned area are both inaccurate and imprecise; this is most likely a consequence of multiple factors that include extremely persistent cloud cover, and degradation {{of the quality of the}} 500 -m burned area maps used for calibration. Application of our approach to the nine remaining regions yielded comparatively accurate, but less precise, estimates of monthly burned area. We applied the regional regression trees to the entire archive of Terra MODIS fire data to produce a monthly global burned area data set spanning late 2000 through mid- 2005. Annual totals derived from this approach showed good agreement with independent annual estimates available for nine Canadian provinces, the United States, and Russia. With our data set we estimate the global annual burned area for the years 2001 &ndash; 2004 to vary between 2. 97 &nbsp;million and 3. 74 &nbsp;million km 2 , with the maximum occurring in 2001.

40|$|MODerate {{resolution}} Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments {{aboard the}} Terra and Aqua satellites {{have provided a}} rich dataset of aerosol information at a 10 km spatial scale. Although originally intended for climate applications, the air quality community quickly became interested in using the MODIS aerosol data. However, 10 km resolution {{is not sufficient to}} resolve local scale aerosol features. With this in mind, MODIS Collection 6 includes a global aerosol product with a 3 km resolution. Here, we evaluate the 3 km product over the Baltimore–Washington D. C., USA, corridor during the summer of 2011 by comparing with spatially dense aerosol data measured by airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) and a network of 44 sun photometers (SP) spaced approximately 10 km apart, collected as part of the DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. The HSRL instrument shows that AOD can vary by over 0. 2 within a single 10 km MODIS pixel, meaning that higher resolution satellite retrievals may help to better characterize aerosol spatial distributions in this region. Different techniques for validating a high-resolution aerosol product against SP measurements are considered. Although the 10 km product is more statistically reliable than the 3 km product, the 3 km product still performs acceptably with nearly two-thirds of MODIS/SP collocations falling within an expected error envelope with high correlation (R > 0. 90), although with a high bias of ~ 0. 06. The 3 km product can better resolve aerosol gradients and retrieve closer to clouds and shorelines than the 10 km product, but tends to show more noise, especially in urban areas. This urban degradation is quantified using <b>ancillary</b> land <b>cover</b> data. Overall, we show that the MODIS 3 km product adds new information to the existing set of satellite derived aerosol products and validates well over the region, but due to noise and problems in urban areas, should be treated with some degree of caution...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of climate policy normally consist exclusively of the reduced impacts of climate change, i. e., the policy’s primary aim. Our analysis of {{benefits of}} climate policy suggests, however, that researchers and policymakers should also {{take account of}} ancillary benefits, e. g., {{in the shape of}} improved air quality induced by climate protection measures. A consideration of both, primary and ancillary benefits, has a positive influence on global climate protection efforts, e. g., because the regional impact of ancillary effects attenuates easy-riding motives of countries with respect to their provision of climate protection. In this article, we analyze the nature of ancillary benefits, present an overview of European assessment studies and explain possible methods to estimate ancillary benefits. Main differences between primary and ancillary benefits are pointed out. Furthermore, we stress the major influences of ancillary benefits on climate policy.
