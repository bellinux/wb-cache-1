Approved for public release; distribution is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} project was to work with Camp S. E. A. Lab Monterey Bay to develop an approval strategy to lease government property from Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) on a services-in-kind payment plan. The goal was to help form a collaborative partnership between Camp S. E. A. Lab and NPS. In support of the potential partnership between Camp S. E. A. Lab and NPS, the students reviewed Camp S. E. A. <b>Lab's</b> current long-range <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> and identified recommendations {{for the creation of}} a revised plan. The terms and conditions that are required for the type of lease Camp S. E. A. Lab will be requesting were identified and delivered to Camp S. E. A. Lab. The students also developed a Strategic Communication Plan, which identified the requirements that are necessary to form a mutually beneficial partnership with NPS.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the ongoing debate about <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> in entrepreneurship literature. In universities {{all over the}} world, entrepreneurship classes teach students {{how to write a}} <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> indicating a widespread assumption that both <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> imply venture success (Brinckmann et al, 2010). Opposing scholars, however, argue that <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and market success are negatively correlated (Chwolka & Raith, 2012). Timmons and Spinelli (2009) argue that a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> is obsolete the moment it emerges from the printer, due to the uncertain and dynamic environment. Additionally, contributing to the questioning of the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> is the trivialization of revenue forecasting. As a feature of the <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> revenue forecasting is argued to be too assumption based and thus, irrelevant (Alänge & Lundqvist, 2013; Goodwin & Wright, 2010). Instead, what should matter is the economics of the business (Timmons & Spinelli, 2009). The aim and ambition of this thesis is to examine whether startups find <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> to be necessary activities to establish. This will be accomplished by addressing six study objects’ attitude and use of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans.</b> It is a thesis of comparative design, where five startups and one venture capitalist constitute the empirical findings, to eventually be compared to existing literature. Conclusively, the author found that all cases’ attitudes and usage of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> are unique. In the broader context, both the planning and non-planning schools are represented, as well as elements of effectuation and causality. It has been challenging to identify similarities in terms of attitudes and usage, which has led to a belief that what determines a company’s attitude and usage towards <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> and <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> is heavily reflected in the entrepreneur’s prior knowledge and experiences...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have found that writing a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> {{increases}} the likelihood of firm survival. For instance, Liao and Gartner (2006) found that firms that completed a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> were nearly {{three times more likely to}} launch their business than those that did not. On the contrary, other studies have found no association between writing a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> and success. For example, Honig and Karlsson (2004) found evidence that entrepreneurs only write <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> because they are required to do so by investors, educators and advisors. While the evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of <b>business</b> <b>planning,</b> previous research has not examined individual elements of <b>business</b> <b>plans.</b> Thus, it is not clear which aspects (e. g., financial projections v. marketing strategy) of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> are positively (or negatively) related to performance and survival. Our study addresses two main issues concerning the impact of <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> in firm survival: 1) Are surviving firms different in the extent of their <b>business</b> <b>planning?</b> 2) Which topical areas within <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> are more (or less) predictive of firm survival? To seek answers, we reconceptualize <b>business</b> <b>planning</b> along four dimensions: service/product description, marketing strategy, financial projections and organizational planning...|$|R

The risk analysis in a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> increases its transparency and credibility and, therefore, it should be considered for its inherent part. The application of the risk analysis across the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> shall follow a systematic approach, which is an adapted version of official risk management standards.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{entrepreneurship}} and especially during start up, much {{emphasis is placed on}} the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> with regard to entrepreneurship education and training, funding from external investors, <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> competitions and government development agencies in the Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise (SMME) sector. In many earlier studies of well-known entrepreneurship educators, the formulation of a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> was identified as being the most important feature of any entrepreneurship programme or course. However, the relevance of a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> has been a topic of intense and unresolved debates in more recent literature. This paper contributes to the literature with regard to the value a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> adds to potential entrepreneurs.  Furthermore it increases the understanding of how a detailed <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> (such as the approved <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> template of the University of Pretoria approved <b>business</b> <b>plan)</b> can enable a potential entrepreneur to assess opportunities. The paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of <b>business</b> <b>plans</b> and the methods of assessing opportunities, in order to reveal similarities between the <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> and opportunity assessment. Based on descriptive statistics and inferential statistics such as ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, the findings support the hypotheses that potential entrepreneurs distinguish between ideas and opportunities and develop opportunities through the formulation of a detailed <b>business</b> <b>plan.</b> The pertinent academic and practical significance of this paper is that it highlights statistically significant differences proving that a detailed <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> is a tool that enables potential entrepreneurs to assess opportunities. From a practical point of view, this should help potential entrepreneurs to establish more viable business ventures; however, this would have to be statistically tested in further research. Finally, the study re-establishes the importance and purpose of a <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> in {{the field of}} entrepreneurship...|$|R
