She is recorded as collecting prisoners from the captured pirate ship Bandara D'Sangare on 24 July of that year.

5|$|Ships may cross {{numerous}} {{time zones}} on <b>a</b> <b>voyage,</b> so nautical time, {{introduced in the}} 1920s, is used in international waters. Each such zone is uniformly 15 degrees of longitude wide, the ship's clock going forward one hour per zone when travelling eastwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} of <b>A</b> <b>Voyage</b> Round the World brought Forster scientific recognition all over Europe.

5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying wet or dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of <b>a</b> <b>voyage</b> and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier {{was commissioned by}} the firm of Negretti and Zambra to travel to China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such <b>a</b> <b>voyage,</b> that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E

5|$|Cargo {{shifting}} poses a {{great danger}} for bulkers. The problem {{is even more}} pronounced with grain cargoes, since grain settles during <b>a</b> <b>voyage</b> and creates extra space between {{the top of the}} cargo and the top of the hold. Cargo is then free to move {{from one side of the}} ship to the other as the ship rolls. This can cause the ship to list, which, in turn, causes more cargo to shift. This kind of chain reaction can capsize a bulker very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Fielding died {{approximately}} two years later, his death {{caused by the}} gout and asthma that had, in part, compelled him to end the Journals run.
