5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, {{he took a}} {{leave of}} <b>absence</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School.
