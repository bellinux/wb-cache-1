25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{requires}} {{non-natural use}} of land by the defendant and escape of the thing from his land, which causes damage. But the rule in MC Mehta v. Union of India is not dependent upon any such condition. The necessary requirements for applicability of the new rule of <b>Absolute</b> <b>Liability</b> are that the defendant is engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and that harm results to anyone on account of an accident {{in the operation of}} such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity.|$|E
25|$|Many Canadian {{municipalities}} use dog squads as a {{means of}} tracking suspects. Most municipalities in Canada employ the bite and hold technique rather than the bark and hold technique meaning once the dog is deployed, it bites the suspect until the dog handler commands it to release. This often results in serious puncture wounds and is traumatic for suspects. A dog has the legal status of property in Canada. As such, developing case law is moving towards <b>absolute</b> <b>liability</b> for the handlers of animals deliberately released to intentionally maim suspects. The dog is effectively a weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Within the United States, {{there are}} many {{situations}} in which strict liability is applied to actions, and Rylands is commonly cited as the origin of that rule (particularly where strict liability {{is based on the}} defendant's [...] "ultrahazardous activity"); it was first applied in Ball v. Nye, by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. The Supreme Court of Minnesota also adopted it in Cahill v. Eastman, while the Supreme Courts of New York, New Hampshire and New Jersey all rejected the principle, in Losee v. Buchanan, Brown v. Collins, and Marshall v. Welwood respectively. The Supreme Court of New Jersey, however, reversed Welwood in 1983 in Department of Environmental Protection v. Ventron Corp. Many courts in the United States have attempted to use Rylands to justify <b>absolute</b> <b>liability,</b> which it was never intended to do; while <b>absolute</b> <b>liability</b> is where no defence is applicable, in Rylands itself Lord Cairns accepted that there were some situations where the case should not be applied.|$|E

2500|$|While in the UK, {{this rule}} is {{strictly}} [...] "a remedy for damage to land or interests in land" [...] and [...] "damages for personal injuries are not recoverable under the rule", in India, {{the courts have}} developed this rule into a separate area of <b>absolute</b> <b>liability</b> rule, where an enterprise is absolutely liable, without exceptions, to compensate everyone affected by any accident resulting from the operation of hazardous activity.

2500|$|Strict {{liability}} can {{be described}} as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack mens rea or intent by the defendant. [...] Not all crimes require specific intent, and the threshold of culpability required may be reduced or demoted. For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted negligently, rather than intentionally or recklessly. In offenses of <b>absolute</b> <b>liability,</b> other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and [...] "intent" [...] is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred. [...] The idea of a [...] "strict liability crime" [...] is an oxymoron. [...] The few exceptions are not truly crimes at all – but are administrative regulations and civil penalties created by statute, such as crimes against the traffic or highway code.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that {{performance}} of a contract always had to take place. No matter what hardship was encountered contracting parties had <b>absolute</b> <b>liability</b> on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners did not have to pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a contract is not frustrated merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of frustration is a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a force majeure clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the force majeure clause did cover it. The effect of a contract being frustrated is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not got anything in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|E
50|$|Strict {{liability}} {{is sometimes}} distinguished from <b>absolute</b> <b>liability.</b> In this context, an actus reus may be excused from strict liability if due diligence is proved. <b>Absolute</b> <b>liability,</b> however, requires only an actus reus.|$|E
50|$|By {{the latter}} test mere {{foreseeability}} or likelihood will not suffice (see Nedrick and Woollin) as this encroaches {{on the notion}} of recklessness.

O'Connor dismissed the Court of Appeals reasoning {{that the threat of}} vexatious lawsuits by disgruntled ex-employees could interfere with the quality of a judge's decisions.

50|$|Gilmore {{begins with}} an {{analysis}} of Raffles v Wichelhaus, otherwise famously known as The Peerless. He continues, noting examples of case objectification by Holmes in his book The Common Law, and that if the “magician” can objectify that case, he could do so to anything. According to Holmes, Raffles, is not decided on {{a failure of the}} meeting of the minds, but rather they objectively said two different things. This action was consistent with Holmes’ desire to remove morality from the understanding of law. The importance in objectifying contract law is that it is far easier to litigate. For Holmes, no longer could one void a contract simply because they had made a mistake, the mistake would have to be objectively reasonable. Gilmore finishes the chapter by discussing the reception of the policy of <b>absolute</b> contractual <b>liability</b> in Paradine v Jane into the law of Massachusetts, and the Holmesian theorists disdain for the condoning of special damages in Hadley v Baxendale.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{proposed}} theories of tort liability are "monolithic" {{in that they}} seek to explain tort liability by focusing on a single element or concern of the tort situation. Four different monolithic theories of tort liability {{will be discussed in}} this work: personal moral culpability liability; strict or <b>absolute</b> liability; <b>liability</b> based on utility and, more specifically, economic liability; and liability based on reciprocity of risk between the parties. The narrow scope of each of these theories renders them susceptible to both internal and external criticism [...] they are, variously, internally inconsistent and incoherent and they lead to unacceptable results in tort decisions. Liability based on a standard of reasonableness which permits and requires a consideration of a variety of individual and community interests in making a tort decision is to be preferred to any of these monolithic theories. A theory of liability based on reasonableness is in accord with and serves to correctly explicate the majority of decisions in reported tort cases. Furthermore, a theory of liability based on reasonableness dispels the supposed antithesis between liability with fault and strict liability...|$|R

50|$|Most jurisdictions use {{criminal}} and civil systems in parallel, making the political judgment on how infrequently to use the criminal law to maximise the publicity of those cases that are prosecuted. While others enact specific legislation covering health and safety, and product safety issues which lay down general protections for the public and for the employees. The difficulty of proving a mens rea is avoided in the less serious offences by imposing <b>absolute,</b> strict <b>liability,</b> or vicarious liability which does not require proof that the accused knew or could reasonably have known that its act was wrong, and which does not recognise any excuse of honest and reasonable mistake. But, most legislatures require some element of fault, either by way of an intention to commit the offence or recklessness resulting in the offence, or some knowledge of the relevant circumstances. Thus, companies are held liable when the acts and omissions, and {{the knowledge of the}} employees {{can be attributed to the}} corporation. This is usually filtered through an identification, directing mind or alter ego test which proves that the employee has sufficient status to be considered the company when acting.|$|R

When there is under production by the monopoly, then increasing liability will aggravate monopoly distortion and reduce welfare. We show that welfare increases with size of liability when cost of accident avoidance is fixed cost. We also consider possibility of regulatory capture by TEPCO and implications...|$|R

40|$|A {{television}} station reports {{that an individual}} is a suspect in a murder case. A newspaper reports that a business or charity is under investigation {{to determine whether it}} has provided funding to terrorists or terrorist organizations. It is true that the individual is a suspect in the police investigation of the murder, and that the government is investigating the business or charity for possible financial links to terrorists. However, the suspicion is wrong, or at least unprovable. As far as can be determined from the available evidence, the individual did not commit a murder, and the business or charity did not provide funds to terrorists. If the party identified as a suspect or investigation target brings a defamation action, the defendant will assert that the report it made to the public was true and truth is a complete defense to a defamation claim. The plaintiff, however, will assert that the report damaged the plaintiff’s reputation by causing the public to suspect the plaintiff of criminal or improper acts and the suspicion was false, so the defense of truth should not succeed. Which version of “truth” will prevail in these circumstances? What must be true for the defendant to avoid liability? This is the question that this article examines and attempts to answer. The answer will determine whether an innocent person can obtain some remedy for harm to reputation or whether the media will enjoy what amounts to an <b>absolute</b> immunity from <b>liability</b> when the published report is literally accurate in identifying a person as a suspect or under investigation. American courts have not developed a satisfactory or authoritative {{answer to the question of}} what is “truth” in this situation.

40|$|Patent law {{is usually}} {{thought to be}} the domain of the federal government, not state governments. Yet over half the states have {{recently}} passed statutes outlawing unfair or deceptive assertions of patent infringement. The statutes are aimed at fighting so-called patent trolls, particularly those who send letters to users of allegedly infringing technology — as opposed to the manufacturers of that technology — demanding that each user purchase a license for a few thousand dollars or else face an infringement suit. The Federal Circuit, however, has held that state law claims challenging acts of patent enforcement are preempted by the federal Patent Act unless the patent holder made infringement allegations with knowledge that the allegations were objectively baseless. No court has yet applied this rule to the new state statutes, but it will likely provide patent holders with nearly <b>absolute</b> immunity from <b>liability</b> under the new laws. Although the Federal Circuit has called this immunity a matter of “preemption,” a close examination of the court’s decisions reveals that the rule is not grounded in the Supremacy Clause but in the First Amendment right to petition the government. Unlike the Supremacy Clause, the First Amendment limits the power of the federal government, not just state governments, so patent holders will also be able to invoke this immunity to thwart impending federal initiatives to fight abusive patent enforcement, such as unfair competition proceedings brought by the Federal Trade Commission and proposals in Congress to outlaw false or misleading statements made in patent demand letters. This article argues that the broad immunity the Federal Circuit has conferred on patent holders is wrong as a matter of doctrine, misguided as a matter of policy, and inconsistent with a long history of courts enjoining unfair and deceptive acts of patent enforcement. Accordingly, the article suggests a reimagined immunity standard that would not shield extortionate schemes of patent enforcement but would still respect a patent holder’s right to make legitimate allegations of infringement...|$|R
