5|$|<b>Adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{confusion}} is {{the tendency of}} units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Austria-Hungary in World War I and the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, Rijeka became an {{independent}} city-state known as the Free State of Fiume. That {{marked the beginning of}} the port's decline, as it lost a large portion of its major market, Hungary. Italy annexed Rijeka in 1924 by the Treaty of Rome, and the port became peripherally located, with no modern railway or road links to the rest of the country, further <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> already obvious economic decline.|$|E
5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion occurs in a slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E
5|$|As {{coenzyme}} Q {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the membrane and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E

5|$|Cirque du Soleil {{expanded}} rapidly {{through the}} 1990s and 2000s, {{going from one}} show to 19 shows in over 271 cities on every continent except Antarctica. The shows employ approximately 4,000 people from over 40 countries and generate an estimated annual revenue exceeding US$810million.

5|$|Detainees {{who were}} not {{suspected}} of involvement with the Croatian armed forces were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of Vukovar and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave the town, <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tens of thousands already expelled from across eastern Slavonia. 2,600 people disappeared {{after the fall of}} the town, of whom around 550 are still missing. There were also incidents of war rape, for which two soldiers were later convicted.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, a new {{radio network}} based at station WBN in Chicago, Illinois, begins its inaugural night. The station's owner, General Walt Whalen, depends on his {{employees}} to impress main sponsor Bernie King. This includes writer Roger Henderson, assistant director Penny Henderson (Roger's wife, seeking divorce), page boy Billy Budget, engineer Max Applewhite, conductor Rick Rochester, announcer Dexter Morris, director Walt Whalen, Jr. and stage manager Herman Katzenback.

5|$|Increased federal {{spending}} {{as a result}} of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington.

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{increase}} in the numbers of skyscrapers during the period was the growth in demand for office workers. In part this demand was fuelled by many U.S firms becoming larger and more complex, and white-collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale. It was also driven by changing technology. The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine, the telephone and filing cabinets, all <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the public}} performance, L'Estrange {{undertook}} the crossing for a select audience including members of the press.

5|$|Sadat {{also played}} his role the {{deception}} plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in Algeria, and {{upon his return}} was rumored to be ill.

5|$|Study of {{the wreck}} {{also showed that}} {{restarting}} the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, <b>adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flooding.

5|$|The revisionist {{tradition}} {{continues to}} the present time, through popular history books, web sites and wargames. New titles appear every year, propagating the myths first put forth by HIAG's propaganda efforts. Some of the books are amateur historical studies that focus solely on the military aspects of the Waffen-SS. Others are reprints of apologetic accounts by former Waffen-SS personnel. <b>Adding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volume of material are groups of international admirers who consider Waffen-SS to have been incorrectly judged by history.|$|E
