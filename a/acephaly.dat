40|$|Understanding of the {{significance}} of congenital malformations advances only slowly. One of the most difficult to explain is acephalia-complete absence of the head-of which an example is described here. True <b>acephaly</b> where the whole head is missing from an otherwise well-developed foetus must be distinguished from anencephaly, of which the features are well known, and the acephalic acardiac variety of reduced twin (Willis, 1962). Here, though no head may be visible, some of the organs and a brain in much reduced form may be buried in the amorphous body. Case Report (Case I in Table) -The mother, aged 24, has give...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOTX 2 is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} {{that is necessary}} for normal head development in mouse and man. Heterozygosity for loss-of-function alleles causes an incompletely penetrant, haploinsufficiency disorder. Affected individuals exhibit a spectrum of features that range from developmental defects in eye and/or pituitary development to <b>acephaly.</b> To investigate the mechanism underlying the pituitary defects, we used different cre lines to inactivate Otx 2 in early head development and in the prospective anterior and posterior lobes. Mice homozygous for Otx 2 deficiency in early head development and pituitary oral ectoderm exhibit craniofacial defects and pituitary gland dysmorphology, but normal pituitary cell specification. The morphological defects mimic those observed in humans and mice with OTX 2 heterozygous mutations. Mice homozygous for Otx 2 deficiency in the pituitary neural ectoderm exhibited altered patterning of gene expression and ablation of FGF signaling. The posterior pituitary lobe and stalk, which normally arise from neural ectoderm, were extremely hypoplastic. Otx 2 expression was intact in Rathke's pouch, the precursor to the anterior lobe, but the anterior lobe was hypoplastic. The lack of FGF signaling from the neural ectoderm was sufficient to impair anterior lobe growth, but not the differentiation of hormone-producing cells. This study demonstrates that Otx 2 expression in the neural ectoderm is important intrinsically {{for the development of}} the posterior lobe and pituitary stalk, and it has significant extrinsic effects on anterior pituitary growth. Otx 2 expression early in head development is important for establishing normal craniofacial features including development of the brain, eyes and pituitary gland...|$|E

Neste trabalho foram estudadas as malformações congênitas em ruminantes diagnosticadas entre 2000 e 2008, em municípios da Paraíba, Pernambuco e Rio Grande do Norte. Durante o período foram recebidos 1. 347 materiais de ruminantes para diagnóstico, desses 47 (3, 48 %) foram dignosticados como malformações congênitas. Com base no tipo de malformação e na procedência do animal as malformações foram divididas em: 1) causadas pelo consumo de M. tenuiflora; e 2) malformações esporádicas, sem causa conhecida. De 418 materiais de ovinos, 21 corresponderam a malformações, sendo 18 (4, 3 % do total de materiais) de malformações causadas por M. tenuiflora e 3 (0, 71 %) de malformações esporádicas. De 434 materiais de bovinos, 14 foram diagnosticados como malformações, sendo 8 (1, 84 %) causadas por M. tenuiflora e 6 (1, 38 %) malformações esporádicas. De 495 materiais de caprinos, 12 apresentaram malformações, sendo 9 (1, 81 %) causadas pela ingestão de M. tenuiflora e 3 (0, 6 %) malformações esporádicas. As principais malformações causadas por M. tenuiflora foram artrogripose, micrognatia, palatosquise, microftalmia e hipoplasia ou aplasia {{unilateral}} ou bilateral dos ossos incisivos. As malformações esporádicas incluiram: acefalia e hermafroditismo, dicefalia e malformações de vasos intestinais em ovinos; atresia anal em três caprinos; e hidranencefalia, atresia anal, malformações de costelas com eventração, hipoplasia cerebelar e hidrocefalia, coristoma pulmonar e meningocele, e gêmeos siameses em bovinos. O caso de hipoplasia cerebelar com hidrocefalia foi negativo pela imuno-histoquímica para o vírus da diarreia viral bovina. Malformações congênitas causadas por M. tenuiflora ocorreram durante todo o ano. A maior frequência em ovinos está aparentemente associada ao consumo da planta, na primeira fase da gestação, após as primeiras chuvas, quando as ovelhas estão sendo suplementadas e a planta é o principal volumoso disponível. As malformações ocorrem principalmente nas áreas mais degradadas, onde existe maior disponibilidade da planta e menor variedade de plantas da caatinga. Congenital malformations {{caused by}} the ingestion of Mimosa tenuiflora {{have been reported in}} ruminants in the semiarid of the Brazilian Northeast. This paper reports malformations diagnosed in ruminants, from 2000 to 2008, by the Veterinary Pathology Laboratory of the Federal University of Campina Grande, Patos, PB, in municipalities of the states of Paraíba, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte. During the period, 47 (3. 48 %) out of 1. 347 ascensions were reported as malformations. Based in the type of malformation and in the origin of the animals, malformations were divided in: 1) {{caused by the}} ingestion of M. tenuiflora, and 2) sporadic malformations of unknown causes. In sheep, 21 out of 418 ascensions were malformations, being 18 (4. 3 %) of malformations caused by M. tenuiflora and 3 (0. 71 %) of sporadic malformations. In cattle, 14 out of 434 ascensions were malformations, from these 8 (1. 84 %) were caused by M. tenuiflora and 6 (1. 38 %) were sporadic malformations. In goats, 12 out of 495 ascensions were malformations, being 9 (1. 81 %) malformations related with the ingestion of M. tenuiflora and 3 (0. 6 %) sporadic malformations. More frequent malformations caused by M. tenuiflora were arthrogryposis, micrognatia, palatoschisis, microphtalmia and unilateral or bilateral hypoplasia or aplasia of the incisive bones. Sporadic malformations were <b>acephaly</b> and hermaphrodite, dicephaly and malformations of mesenteric vessel in sheep; atresia ani in three goats; and hydranencephaly, atresia ani, ribs malformation with eventracion, cerebellar hypoplasia with hydrocephalus, pulmonary choristoma and meningocele, and siamese twins in cattle. A case of cerebellar hypoplasia with hydrocephalus was negative on immunohistochemistry to bovine viral diarrhea virus. Malformations caused by M. tenuiflora occurred during the whole year. The highest frequency in sheep seems {{to be associated with the}} consumption of the plant by ewes after first rains, in the first two months of gestation, when they are supplemented with concentrates, and M. tenuiflora is the main green forage available. Malformations occur mainly in degraded areas of native forest (caatinga) invaded by M. tenuiflora, with lesser variety of other species...|$|E
