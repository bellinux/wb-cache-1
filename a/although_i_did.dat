If it was in my power to do something, I had to do something.... <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know what asylum, deportation, irregular immigration, or the Dublin agreement meant, it was necessary to try to do something, search for help, at least. When I found out that there was no organisation, including the church, which could help, I realised that I had a duty." [...] Thus he hid the youngster to his late grandfather's apartment.|$|E

Kerli was very pleased by Lovato's recording and responded by saying [...] "I really think that artists are story tellers and are here to deliver a message and there's no better person that I can think of right now than her to deliver that very story.

2500|$|While lauded {{for opening}} up the {{independent}} film market and making it financially viable, Weinstein has been criticized by some for the techniques he has allegedly applied in his business dealings. Peter Biskind's book Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film details criticism of Miramax's release history and editing of Asian films, such as Shaolin Soccer, Hero, and Princess Mononoke. There is a rumor that when Harvey Weinstein was charged with handling the U.S. release of Princess Mononoke, director Hayao Miyazaki sent him a samurai sword in the mail. Attached to the blade was a stark message: [...] "No cuts." [...] Miyazaki commented on the incident: [...] "Actually, my producer did that. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> go to New York to meet this man, this Harvey Weinstein, and I was bombarded with this aggressive attack, all these demands for cuts. I defeated him." [...] Weinstein has always insisted that such editing {{was done in the}} interest of creating the most financially viable film. [...] "I'm not cutting for fun," [...] Harvey Weinstein said in an interview. [...] "I'm cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies." ...|$|E
