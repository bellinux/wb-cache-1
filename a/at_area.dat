5|$|Humphrey first ran {{for mayor}} of Minneapolis in 1943, losing by only six {{thousand}} votes. He campaigned again in the 1945 election, {{with the support of}} the city's labor leaders, and found support with the city's African-American community by promising to implement a city civil rights commission. He also appealed to the city's middle class by giving talks on civic virtue <b>at</b> <b>area</b> churches. He was elected in 1945 by the largest margin to date. When elected, he immediately proposed a city ordinance that would make racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine. After a long period of discussion, the Minneapolis City Council finally approved the ordinance by a 21 to 3 margin on January 31, 1947. The ordinance created the nation's first Fair Employment Practices Ordinance and established Minneapolis as the nation's leader in imposing fines for employment discrimination, though pressure from the local Urban League would also limit employment opportunities for African Americans during the ordinance's first few years.|$|E

The fatalities at the Pentagon included 55military personnel and 70civilians. Of those 125 killed, 92 were on the first floor, 31 were on the second floor, and two were on the third. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency civilian employees were killed while the Office of the Secretary of Defense lost one contractor. The U.S. Army suffered 75 fatalities—53 civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers—while the U.S. Navy suffered 42 fatalities—nine civilians (six employees and three contractors) and 33 sailors. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military officer killed at the Pentagon; also killed was retired Rear Admiral Wilson Flagg, a passenger on the plane.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} an approach {{for the quality}} dependent reconstruction of building façades using 3 D point clouds from mobile terrestrial laser scanning. Due to different look angles, such measurements frequently suffer from different point densities at the respective building façades. In order to support the interpretation <b>at</b> <b>areas,</b> where no or only limited LiDAR measurements are available, a quality dependent processing is implemented. First, façades are reconstructed <b>at</b> <b>areas</b> of sufficient LiDAR point availability. Based on this reconstruction, rules are derived automatically, which together with the respective façade elements constitute a so-called façade grammar. It holds all the information which is necessary to reconstruct façades {{in the style of}} the given building. In our quality dependent approach, this grammar is used as knowledge base for the verification of a façade model reconstructed <b>at</b> <b>areas</b> of limited sensor data quality. Additionally, it is applied for the generation of synthetic façades where no LiDAR measurement is available...|$|R
