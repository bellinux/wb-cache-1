2500|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1990s period, which {{correlates}} {{to the history}} of the Madeline series, The Learning Company would retroactively be accused of being a house of cards [...] "burdened with tired brands", cutting research and development to 11% of expenditures, and focusing on repackaging old products through distribution channels like convenience stores and drugstores, rather than investing resources into new software by the development companies they had acquired. The company had continued to grow through acquisitions, achieving revenues of $800 million, despite having an <b>accumulated</b> <b>deficit</b> of $1.1 billion by the end of 1998. Mattel CEO Jill Barad made a takeover bid in an attempt to overcome a downward slide in her company's stock price, [...] "seiz on educational software as a driver of future growth." [...] Mattel had found success with its series featuring Barbie due to the representation of the characters, and sought to replicate this formula by expanding the product line to include series like Madeline, which also included [...] "well-developed characters." [...] A few weeks after the sale, CFRA produced a critical report on Mattel, which claimed: [...] "TLC was already experiencing collapsing revenue, a surge in receivables and a deterioration of operating cash flow." [...] O'Leary, who had been hired as president of Mattel's new TLC digital division, soon sold his stock for $6 million, a few months before $2 billion in shareholder value was lost in a single day. The Learning Company's acquisition by Mattel in May 1999 resulted in a loss of nearly $300 million (once estimated at a loss of a $1 million a day) and represented the end of the [...] "boom-and-bust period" [...] of the [...] "edutainment" [...] era of the mid-1990s. Toby Levenson, former manager of The Learning Company's Educational Design Department, said [...] "edutainment" [...] had become [...] "a toxic word" [...] following the company's merger with Mattel, while Businessweek would describe the acquisition as one of [...] "the Worst Deals of All Time". Lee Banville, editor of Gamesandlearning.org, wrote that the collapse of the market for children's education games was reflective of: [...] "how difficult it is to grow that business and diversify and evolve". While the Madeline video game series was officially cancelled in 1997, Madeline 1st and 2nd Grade Math would be released two years later in 1999 under Mattel, becoming the last entry in the series before Creative Wonders being closed later that year.|$|E

40|$|As people age, they <b>accumulate</b> <b>deficits.</b> The more <b>deficits</b> they <b>accumulate,</b> {{the greater}} their vulnerability, {{which can be}} {{expressed}} as the probability to <b>accumulate</b> even more <b>deficits,</b> or to die.

Using data from elderly (aged 65 + years) participants in the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (n = 9008), we investigated the relationship between the number of deficits and the change in the number of deficits over two successive 5 year intervals. We show that the probabilities of changes in the number of deficits, in relation to baseline, are well fitted (R 2 > 0. 98) by a simple distribution, with two parameters. The model suggests a maximum to deficit accumulation, and illustrates no level of deficit accumulation at which there is a net gain in fitness. Age-related deficit accumulation is highly characteristic, and can be modeled as a stochastic process with readily interpretable parameters...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method for}} appraising health status in elderly people. A frailty index {{was defined as the}} proportion of <b>accumulated</b> <b>deficits</b> (symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities). It serves as an individual state variable, reflecting severity of illness and proximity to death. In a representative database of elderly Canadians we found that <b>deficits</b> <b>accumulated</b> at 3 % per year, and show a gamma distribution, typical for systems with redundant components {{that can be used in}} case of failure of a given subsystem. Of note, the slope of the index is insensitive to the individual nature of the deficits, and serves as an important prognostic factor for life expectancy. The formula for estimating an individual’s life span given the frailty index value is presented. For different patterns of cognitive impairments the average withingroup index value increases with the severity of the cognitive impairment, and the relative variability of the index is significantly reduced. Finally, the statistical distribution of the frailty index sharply differs between well groups (gamma distribution) and morbid groups (normal distribution). This pattern reflects a...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare <b>accumulated</b> oxygen <b>deficit</b> data derived using two {{different}} exercise protocols with the aim of producing a less time-consuming test specifically for use with athletes. Six road and four track male endurance cyclists performed two series of cycle ergometer tests. The first series involved five 10 min sub-maximal cycle exercise bouts, a (V) over dotO(2 peak) test and a 115 % (V) over dotO(2 peak) test. Data from these tests were used to estimate the <b>accumulated</b> oxygen <b>deficit</b> according to the calculations of Medbo et al. (1988). In the second series of tests, participants performed a 15 min incremental cycle ergometer test followed, 2 min later, by a 2 min variable resistance test in which they completed as much work as possible while pedalling at a constant rate. Analysis revealed that the <b>accumulated</b> oxygen <b>deficit</b> calculated from the first series of tests was higher (P< 0. 02) than that calculated from the second series: 52. 3 +/- 11. 7 and 43. 9 +/- 6. 4 ml. kg(- 1), respectively (mean +/- s). Other significant differences between the two protocols were observed for (V) over dot O- 2 peak, total work and maximal heart rate; all were higher during the modified protocol (...|$|R

40|$|This paper extends {{a method}} of apprising health status to {{a broad range of}} ages from {{adolescence}} to old age. The “frailty index ” is based on the accumulation of deficits (symptoms, signs, disease classifications) as analyzed in the National Population Health Survey, a representative Canadian population sample (n = 81, 859). The accumulation of deficits has both an age-independent (background) component and an age-dependent (exponential) component, akin to the wellknown Gompertz-Makeham model for the risk of mortality. While women <b>accumulate</b> more <b>deficits</b> than men of the same age, on average, their rate of accumulation is lower, so the difference in the level of deficits between men and women decreases with age. Two possible invariants of the process of accumulation of deficits were found: (1) the age at which the average proportion of deficits coincides for men and women is 94 years, which closely matches the species-specific lifespan in humans (95 ± 2); (2) the value of the frailty index (proportion of deficits), which corresponds to that age (0. 18). The similarity between mortality kinetics and the accumulation of deficits (frailty kinetics), and the coincidence of the time parameters in the frailty and mortality models make it possible to express mortality risk in terms of <b>accumulated</b> <b>deficits.</b> This provides a simple and accessible tool that might have potential in a number of biomedical applications...|$|R

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{empirical}} {{answer to the}} question of which institutional arrangements can help to keep the accounts of sub-national governments in balance. I take into consideration the autonomy that these governments have in raising their revenues and fiscal rules as formulated in law or constitutions. The former works as an implicit constraint since governments with more autonomy might assume higher responsibility for <b>accumulated</b> <b>deficits.</b> The latter works as a direct explicit constraint on sub-national borrowing, but might be subject to endogeneity through preferences for fiscal responsibility. This potential source of bias is taken into account by using IV techniques for fiscal rules. Results from my original dataset, covering full information for 14 years of all EU 15 countries, show that the effectiveness of tools depends critically on the federal background. Fiscal rules work in unitary countries, while higher tax autonomy yields lower deficits in federations. ...|$|R
