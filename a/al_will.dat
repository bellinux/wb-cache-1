2500|$|The venues {{traditionally}} {{alternate between}} the American League and National League every year. This tradition {{has been broken}} several times: The first time was in 1951, when the A.L. Detroit Tigers were chosen to host the annual game {{as part of the}} city's 250th birthday (corrected by the N.L. hosting the next two seasons). The second was when the two-game format during the 1959–1962 seasons resulted in the A.L. being one game ahead in turn. This was corrected in 2007, when the N.L. San Francisco Giants were the host for the 2007 All-Star Game, which also set up the 2008 game to be held at the A.L.'s original Yankee Stadium in its final season. It was broken when again the N.L. hosted the three straight games from 2015-2017 (in Cincinnati, San Diego, and Miami), and is scheduled to host a fourth straight game in Washington in 2018. [...] The <b>A.L.</b> <b>will</b> host its next game in 2019 in Cleveland.|$|E

She won't give you away. She's a thoroughbred. Why, she was so white last night I thought she'd drop at my feet, but she never blinked an eyelash. I'm a woman, Gene Stewart and if I couldn't feel like Miss Hammond I know how awful an ordeal she must have had. Why, she's one of the most beautiful, the most sought after, the most exclusive women in New York City. There's a crowd of millionaires and lords and dukes after her. How terrible it'd be for a woman like her to be kissed by a drunken cowpuncher! I say it--" ...|$|E
50|$|Common APCP {{formulations}} {{call for}} 30-400 µm AP particles (often spherical), {{as well as}} 2-50 µm Al particles (often spherical). Because of the size discrepancy between the AP and Al, <b>Al</b> <b>will</b> often take an interstitial position in a pseudo-lattice of AP particles.|$|E
5000|$|December 5 - American League {{president}} Joe Cronin {{suggests that}} if the National League starts its new New York City franchise in 1961, the <b>AL</b> <b>will</b> stay out of Los Angeles until 1962.

5000|$|Vs the {{stakeholders}}: are any stakeholders {{currently in}} disequilibrium {{compared to their}} preferred situation, and will this evolve the scenario? Is it possible to create probable scenarios when considering the stakeholders? This is most important when creating macro-scenarios where governments, large organisations et <b>al.</b> <b>will</b> try to influence the outcome.|$|E
50|$|December 10 - The American League votes {{unanimously}} {{to adopt}} the designated hitter rule on a three-year experimental basis.

The National League declines to follow suit.|$|E

50|$|The only {{component}} in mice projecting ipsilaterally are RGCs from the ventral-temporal crescent in the retina, and {{only because they}} express the Zic2 transcription factor. Zic2 will promote {{the expression of the}} tyrosine kinase receptor EphB1, which, through forward signaling (see review by Xu et <b>al.)</b> <b>will</b> bind to Ephrin B2 ligand expressed by midline glia and be repelled to turn away from the chiasm. Interestingly, some VTc RGCs will project contralaterally because they express the transcription factor Islet-2 (Isl-2)'''', which is a negative regulator of Zic2 production.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of transmetalation, redox-transmetalation (RT) and redox-transmetalation/ligand-exchange (RTLE). Below, M1 is usually a 4d or 5d {{transition}} metal and M2 is usually a main group or 3d transition metal. By looking at the electronegativities of the metals and ligands, one can predict whether the RT or RTLE reaction will proceed and what products the reaction will yield. For example, one can predict that the addition of 3 HgPh2 to 2 <b>Al</b> <b>will</b> yield 3 Hg and 2 AlPh3 because Hg is a more electronegative element than Al.|$|E
