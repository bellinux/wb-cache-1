5|$|In 2009 the Westray Wife, a lozenge-shaped figurine that is {{believed}} to be the earliest representation of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at Links of Noltland near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} portable art {{from what is}} now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the Neolithic period, which share patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from Links of Noltland, including the Westray Wife, which is the earliest known depiction of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In August 1968, the Polish People's Army {{took part}} in the Warsaw Pact {{invasion}} of Czechoslovakia. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and Ryszard Siwiec burned himself alive during the official national holiday celebrations. The Polish participation in the crushing of the Czech liberal communism (called socialism with <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face,</b> and, according to David Ost, constituting the crowning achievement of Marxist revisionism) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR in November reconfirmed his rule. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his Brezhnev Doctrine, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the fraternal course.|$|E

5|$|Surgeon and {{historian}} William Wilde recollected {{that as a}} medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest {{that in the early}} 19thcentury a plaster cast of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> with a pig's snout was on display at the hospital. Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal, in the later half of the 19thcentury the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common. In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for being the}} first to use the newly {{developed}} MotionScan technology developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan uses 32 surrounding cameras to capture actors' facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face.</b> The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. The game uses full motion capture actors to record the voices and movements of the characters. Over twenty hours of voice work was recorded for the game.|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face.</b> The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, which would make it one of the most expensive video games ever made.|$|E

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as the length of <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> from the forehead's hairline {{to the tip of}} the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

25|$|Though it has {{now become}} very common to portray <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> on stamps, for the initial 17years {{this was not the}} case. Mr. M. H. Zuberi, a retired CSP officer, tried to get the president's {{approval}} to issue stamps with the Quaid's portrait in 1964. This was however, rejected {{on the grounds that the}} people might not accept them. He however, persevered and it paid off when the first locally designed issue to carry <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face,</b> a set of three stamps, was released to pay homage to the country's armed forces after the War of 1965. The first incumbent head of state or government portrayed was General Ayub Khan on the 1966 stamps for the new capital of Islamabad.|$|E

25|$|Many Arab–Israeli peace {{projects}} actively involve {{children and}} teenagers.

This would occur by bringing together youth from both sides of conflict regions to literally put <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> on those who were previously perceived as an enemy. The organization, which began with Israeli, Palestinian, and Egyptian teenagers, has expanded to reach Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Pakistan, Maine, Cyprus (Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus/Republic of Cyprus), and the Balkans.|$|E
25|$|Maximilian {{had a great}} {{passion for}} armour, not only as {{equipment}} for battle or tournaments, but as an art form.

It emphasized the details in the shaping of the metal itself, rather than the etched or gilded designs popular in the Milanese style. Maximilian also gave a bizarre jousting helmet as a gift to King Henry VIII – the helmet's visor featured <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face,</b> with eyes, nose and a grinning mouth, and was modelled after the appearance of Maximilian himself.

25|$|When New England {{author and}} Indian-rights activist Helen Hunt Jackson toured the Indian villages of Southern California in 1883, she was {{appalled by the}} racism of the Anglos living there. She wrote that they treated Indians worse than animals, hunted them for sport, robbed them of their farmlands, and {{brought them to the}} edge of extermination. While Indians were {{depicted}} by whites as lazy and shiftless, she found most of them to be hard-working craftsmen and farmers. Jackson's tour inspired her to write her 1884 novel, Ramona, which she hoped would give <b>a</b> <b>human</b> <b>face</b> to the atrocities and indignities suffered by the Indians in California. And it did. The novel was enormously successful, inspiring four movies and a yearly pageant in Hemet, California. Many of the Indian villages of Southern California survived because of her efforts, including Morongo, Cahuilla, Soboba, Temecula, Pechanga, and Warner Hot Springs.|$|E
