The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{character}} being confronted at a triumphant feast with a reminder of their downfall {{is not unique to}} Shakespeare and may originate from the Belshazzar's feast episode of the Bible. The term 'ghost at the feast' has entered popular culture, and is often used as a metaphor for a subject <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>would</b> rather avoid considering, or (considering the general plot of Macbeth) a reminder of a person's unpleasant past or likely future.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the common}} law {{requires}} the contact for battery be [...] "harmful or offensive." [...] The offensiveness is measured against <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> standard. Looking at a contact objectively, as <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> see it, would this contact be offensive? Thus, <b>a</b> hypersensitive <b>person</b> <b>would</b> fail on <b>a</b> battery action if jostled by fellow passengers on a subway, as this contact is expected in normal society and <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> not find it offensive. Harmful is defined by any physical damage to the body.|$|R

5|$|To {{test his}} theory, Franklin {{proposed}} a potentially deadly experiment, {{to be performed}} during an electrical storm, where <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>would</b> stand on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long pointed iron rod to attract a lightning bolt. This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe.

5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>would</b> not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>would</b> not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

40|$|Law {{students}} discover {{very early}} in their legal educations that the 2 ̆ 2 reasonable person 2 ̆ 2 is a ubiquitous fixture of the law. Whether or not an injury {{is the product of}} negligence in tort law depends on whether or not <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have taken <b>a</b> precaution which would have averted the injury. Whether or not an offer has been made in contract law depends on whether or not <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have taken the party to be conferring a power to create an agreement through acceptance. Whether or not an act of killing an aggressor was done in self-defense in criminal law depends on whether or not <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have taken deadly force to be required to repel the threat. The list goes on and on. Over and over again the law asks not just what the plaintiff or defendant actually did or thought, but also what <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have done or thought, or what <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have understood another person to have done or thought. Defendant 2 ̆ 7 s actions and thoughts are compared, that is, to those of the reasonable person. In fact, sometimes what the defendant actually did or thought is irrelevant; all that matters is what the reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have done or thought. Such is the case, for instance, in the mens rea of negligence in criminal law. If, for example, <b>a</b> reasonable <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have expected <b>a</b> particular act to kill another human being, then one of the mens rea elements of negligent homicide is present even if the defendant did not expect that result, or even if the defendant expected the opposite. Our law gives tremendous weight to the acts and thoughts of the reasonable person...|$|R

For example, if offered either $50 or a 50% chance each of $100 and $0, <b>a</b> risk neutral <b>person</b> <b>would</b> have no preference.

Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory.
