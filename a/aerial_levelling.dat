40|$|Low soil {{fertility}} {{is one of}} the factors most limiting agricultural production, with phosphorus deficiency being among the main factors, particularly in developing countries. To deal with such environmental constraints, remote sensing measurements can be used to rapidly assess crop performance and to phenotype a large number of plots in a rapid and cost-effective way. We evaluated the performance of a set of remote sensing indices derived from Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images and multispectral (visible and infrared) data as phenotypic traits and crop monitoring tools for early assessment of maize performance under phosphorus fertilization. Thus, a set of 26 maize hybrids grown under field conditions in Zimbabwe was assayed under contrasting phosphorus fertilization conditions. Remote sensing measurements were conducted in seedlings at two different levels: at the ground and from an aerial platform. Within a particular phosphorus level, some of the RGB indices strongly correlated with grain yield. In general, RGB indices assessed at both ground and <b>aerial</b> <b>levels</b> correlated in a comparable way with grain yield except for indices a* and u*, which correlated better when assessed at the <b>aerial</b> <b>level</b> than at ground level and Greener Area (GGA) which had the opposite correlation. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) evaluated at ground level with an active sensor also correlated better with grain yield than the NDVI derived from the multispectral camera mounted in the aerial platform. Other multispectral indices like the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) performed very similarly to NDVI assessed at the <b>aerial</b> <b>level</b> but overall, they correlated in a weaker manner with grain yield than the best RGB indices. This study clearly illustrates the advantage of RGB-derived indices over the more costly and time-consuming multispectral indices. Moreover, the indices best correlated with GY were in general those best correlated with leaf phosphorous content. However, these correlations were clearly weaker than against grain yield and only under low phosphorous conditions. This work reinforces the effectiveness of canopy remote sensing for plant phenotyping and crop management of maize under different phosphorus nutrient conditions and suggests that the RGB indices are the best option...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for pheromone-based mating disruption (MD) of Ephestia kuehniella (Walker) and Plodia interpunctella (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) {{was investigated in}} two flour mills and a pet food distributor. Plastic sachets emitting 2 – 3 mg per d (Z, E) - 9, 12 -tetradecadienyl acetate, the major pheromone component of both moth species, were used as MD dispensers, which were applied in grid systems resulting in one dispenser per 100 m 3 of air volume. Pheromone traps with sticky inserts were used to monitor moth population fluctuations. To monitor pheromone levels in the air before, during, and after the treatment, electroantennographic (EAG) measurements were performed using a portable device. All localities showed decreased trap catches after application of MD. In two localities with low initial population densities, trap catches were reduced immediately after application of MD and remained very low, even several months after the MD treatment was terminated. In contrast, in a locality with a higher initial population density the reduction in trap catches was slower, and trap catches increased again soon after the termination of the MD treatment. Electrophysiological data showed not only increased <b>aerial</b> <b>levels</b> of pheromone during the treatment period but also levels that were higher than during pretreatment, even 12 mo after removal of MD dispensers. The localities had good ventilation, and the memory effect observed indicates that the pheromone adhered to surfaces that subsequently functioned as secondary dispensers.

Therefore, it is likely that Type III ridge senescence is the result of extreme events and deposition of periphyton and other debris in a wrack line along the ridge edge. Findings also indicate that it is possible to use photointerpretation keys to detect ridge senescence at a high degree of confidence, which can then be used to evaluate spatial and temporal occurrence.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{generation}} of three dimensional models of large urban/suburban environments. Previous work on the reconstruction of particular environments is based on multiple overlapping <b>aerial</b> or street <b>level</b> images. Unfortunately these approaches do not extend well to large environments. The main reasons for this are that they require expensive high-resolution aerial images and a labour intensive modelling or data capture procedure. Consequently methods {{have been developed to}} generate large urban environments based on environmental data such as elevation data or building footprints. This permits the model to be based on actual data for the area being modelled and at a cost far less than that of aerial images.

Previous work has mostly focused on rather close range image acquisition techniques, but {{little research has been}} done to implement aerial imagery for larger geophysical processes, and previous research has left a gap for investigation of large landslides using structure from motion from aerial imagery. Firstly in this thesis, a sensitivity study was carried out of Årdal in western Norway (61. 2684 ° N, 8. 0385 ° E) to investigate the structure from motion processing of aerial imagery and possible processing issues. This was done by measuring absolute accuracy and random-access memory usage as well as carrying out a topography assessment. Secondly, an application of the technique was made to Fulånebba in western Norway (62. 7233 ° N, 8. 5801 ° E) to investigate a potential landslide site by making digital surface model difference maps and displacement maps. The main results showed firstly that topography, ground control point accuracy and the degree of well calibrated intrinsic camera parameters were governing factors for the absolute accuracy. Secondly, structure from motion was found to possibly yield digital surface models with similar accuracies without intrinsic camera parameters as with pre-calibrated cameras.

In 2007 - 2009, an inve-stigation was carried out to follow changes in the concentration of sulphur dioxide in atmosphe-ric air, in different time intervals, depending on the air temperature and humidity. This paper draws on results of continuous measurements taken at the Station of Monitoring the Immission of Air Pollutants in Olsztyn-Kortowo. The measured concentrations of SO 2 were presented graphically as means for different time intervals. It has been demonstrated that changes in SO 2 concentrations were mainly induced by drops in temperatures, emissions and other industrial actitivities, as well as the course of the growth and development of plants. The highest concen-trations appeared at noon and the lowest ones were at night. Analysis of similarities verified hourly variations in the SO 2 concentrations in air. Four distinc groups were distinguished: noc-turnal (1 : 00 - 7 : 00 a. m.), mid-day (10 : 00 a. m. - 3 : 00 p. m.), a group with two time intervals (8 : 00 - 9 : 00 a. m.; 4 : 00 - 7 : 00 p. m.) and late evening (8 : 00 p. m. - midnight). Considering the <b>aerial</b> concen-tration <b>levels</b> of this gas in monthly intervals, high similarity was observed between the early spring versus the autumn and winter seasons.
