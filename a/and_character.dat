Additionally, events <b>and</b> <b>characters</b> on Earth-C-Minus paralleled those of the then-mainstream DC Universe of Earth-One.

40|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, <b>and</b> {{transgender}} (LGBT) <b>characters</b> {{do exist}} in children’s and young adult literature, {{yet there is}} a lack of classroom exposure to such literature. Educational organizations have realized the need for dispelling prejudices about LGBT people by including such texts in the classroom as well as discussions regarding LGBT themes <b>and</b> <b>characters</b> in the books. Yet the practice of simply including diverse texts without discussing LGBT issues could cause greater marginalization for students because the silence regarding LGBT issues <b>and</b> <b>characters</b> encourages the practice of heteronormativity. This inquiry examined a range of children’s and adolescent books that could be used in classroom discussions to develop insight about LGBT themes <b>and</b> <b>characters</b> in order to understand if the texts were saturated with LGBT themes <b>and</b> <b>characters</b> to the point that teachers and students could not avoid the LGBT factors while reading...|$|R

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world. Attracted to gray characters, Martin instead endorses William Faulkner's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about. Martin explores the questions of redemption <b>and</b> <b>character</b> change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E

The project's planning was headed by Kai, who returned to Key after he last contributed to the scenario of Clannad released in 2004. Chika Shirokiri returned after his work on Little Busters!, in which he wrote the scenario for Kudryavka. The artists Na-Ga and Itaru Hinoue were the art directors <b>and</b> <b>character</b> designers, both of whom previously worked on Little Busters! for Key.

5|$|Competition {{arose from}} other genres. Players {{turned away from}} RPGs, flight {{simulators}} and adventure games in favor of action-oriented titles, such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. Later RPGs would draw influences from action genres, but would face new challenges {{in the form of}} massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), a late-1990s trend that may have siphoned players away from single-player RPGs. They also faced competition from Japanese console RPGs, which were becoming increasingly dominant around that time, for reasons such as more accessible, faster-paced action-adventure-oriented gameplay, and a stronger emphasis on storytelling <b>and</b> <b>character</b> interactions.|$|E
5|$|Cortana's {{original}} design {{was based on}} the Egyptian queen Nefertiti; the character's holographic representation always {{takes the form of a}} woman. Bungie first introduced Cortana—and Halo—through the Cortana Letters, emails sent during Combat Evolveds production in 1999. Since then, the character has been used extensively to advertise the series. Cortana has been recognized for her believability <b>and</b> <b>character</b> depth, and her holographic representation has been noted for its sex appeal. The character was the inspiration for Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant.|$|E
5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative.

Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story <b>and</b> <b>character</b> arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles.
