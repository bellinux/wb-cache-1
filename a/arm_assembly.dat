25|$|The first ARM {{application}} {{was as a}} second processor for the BBC Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the support chips (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up the CAD software used in ARM2 development. Wilson subsequently rewrote BBC BASIC in <b>ARM</b> <b>assembly</b> language. The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator. The original aim of a principally ARM-based computer was achieved in 1987 {{with the release of}} the Acorn Archimedes. In 1992, Acorn once more won the Queen's Award for Technology for the ARM.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] {{supercharged}} {{version of}} the smaller engine {{was added to the}} line-up in February 1987, using the world's first needle roller rocker <b>arm</b> <b>assembly.</b> This generation was badge engineered and was introduced to the Asian luxury car market as the Hyundai Grandeur, giving Hyundai a luxury sedan to shuttle foreign dignitaries during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. As Mitsubishi and Chrysler had a business relationship where automotive technology was being shared and used in both Chrysler and Mitsubishi products, this generation Debonair does have some superficial similarities with the Chrysler New Yorker of the same time period. The Debonair's platform, however, shares nothing with the Chrysler [...] "E", [...] "Y", or [...] "K" [...] platforms. The suspension was upgraded to MacPherson struts for the front suspension, and the rear suspension used a three-link torsion axle. The only transmission available was a four-speed automatic unit.|$|E

50|$|The {{device is}} usually {{composed}} of a fork or two push <b>arm</b> <b>assemblies</b> fitted {{to the front of}} a tank hull, with two banks of rollers that can be lowered in front of the tank's tracks. Each roller bank has several heavy wheels studded with short projecting steel girders, which apply a higher ground pressure than the tank's tracks. This ensures the explosion of pressure-fused anti-tank mines, which would otherwise explode under the track itself.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 404 - 405) The MK 26 Guided Missile Launching System (GMLS), {{specifically in}} the guide <b>arm</b> <b>assemblies,</b> possess design deficiencies which harbor and promote specific forms of corrosive attack. This study is focused on corrosion which occurs in the hydraulic access cover areas of the guide <b>arm</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The HK 26 GHLS is continuously exposed to a fluctuating marine environment and occasional high temperature rocket exhaust gases. 1008, 1018, ASTM A 514 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steel specimens were sujected to potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, crevice, atmospheric, immersion, inhibitor, atmospheric, and paint tests in Port Huememe, CA sea water to ascertain corrosion mechanisms taking place and effective corrosion control/prevention measures. No passive film was formed {{on any of the}} steels tested when immersed in sea water. Pitting occurred at magnesium sulfide inclusions, grain boundaries, and localized areas where corrosion product films were breached. Under immersed conditions without crevices, pitting was prevalent {{in the early stages of}} corrosion, but pit growth soon became severly retarded, giving way to intergranular attack. Pitting was and remained the dominant form of attack in tight crevices. Under atmospheric condtions, pitting was dominant at all times as well. Intergranular attack was significantly more severe in the plain carbon steels than in the ASTM A 514 steels. Cathodically polarizing to - 780 mv (S. C. E) proved adequate to protect 1008, 1018, ASTM A 5614 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steels under laboratory conditions. Sodium nitrite, calcium benzoate, and sodium silicate were effective inhibitors, provided concentrations are maintained above a critical threshold. The protective nature of various paint systems tested was far more dependent on metal preparation methods than on the properties of the paint themselves...|$|R

The <b>arm</b> <b>assembly</b> rotates, {{the main}} arm is raised from the stationay position to an angle of approximately seventy {{degrees from the}} horizontal. Once this height is reached, the main arm is capable of rotating, with the combined rotations of both sections causing the seat sets to swing and rotate around the point of attachment. The rotating components can move in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions, and the different movements can be activated in isolation of each other.|$|E

50|$|The {{advent of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858, brought a plan for an armed uprising. Direct action began with the Fenian Rising of 1867. Fenians {{attacked}} on the more isolated police barracks and smaller stations. This rebellion was put down with ruthless efficiency. The police had infiltrated the Fenians with informers. The success of the Irish Constabulary during the outbreak was rewarded by Queen Victoria who granted the force the prefix 'Royal' in 1867 {{and the right to}} use the insignia of the Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick in their motif. The RIC presided over a marked decline in general crime around the country. The unstable rural unrest of the early nineteenth century characterised by secret organisations and unlawful <b>armed</b> <b>assembly</b> was effectively controlled. Policing generally became a routine of controlling misdemeanours such as moonshine distilling, public drunkenness, minor theft, and wilful property crimes.A Land War broke out in the 1879-82 Depression period, causing some general unrest.|$|R
