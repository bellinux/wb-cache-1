40|$|When the IgG 1 {{fraction}} of anti-idiotypic antibodies raised in guinea pigs is injected into mice, sensitization of idiotypic T and B lymphocytes occurs (1 - 3). In {{the present study}} we analyze the genetic requirements for T-helper cell sensitization by <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody.</b> This was done by measuring, in a suitable panel of mouse strains, helper cell responsiveness to two anti-idiotypic reagents which recognize distinct, strain-specific idiotypes, namely the A 5 A and the S 117 marker. Whenever helper cell sensitization by <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> was successful, helper function could be specifically inhibited by the same and only the same anti-idiotype. This indicates that helper cells induced by <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> express idiotypic determinants on their receptors for antigen. Helper cell sensitization by <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> was found in all strains expressing the corresponding or a cross-reactive idiotype at the immunoglobulin level. Idiotype-negative strains were always unresponsive to anti-idiotypic stimulation. In addition, responsiveness did {{not depend on the}} H- 2 haplotype.

40|$|Although athymic mice make an {{excellent}} immune {{response to the}} thymus- independent antigen trinitrophenyl-lys-Ficoll (TNP-F), nude mice of AKR/J and BALB/c strains lack the anti-idiotypic response that occurs in euthymic mice of both of these strains within the first 1 [...] 2 wk after injection of more TNP-F. Anti-idiotypic antibody-blocked (hapten- augmentable) anti-TNP splenic plaque-forming cells (PFC) do not occur {{at any time and}} serum <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> is absent in both congenitally athymic mice, and thymectomized, irradiated, bone marrow- reconstituted mice. Nevertheless, nu/nu mice do have PFC which can be inhibited by exposure to <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> produced in +/+ mice. As a consequence of the failure to produce anti-idiotypic antibodies, the anti-TNP PFC response is athymic as compared to euthymic mice is of greater magnitude, declines less precipitously, and shows an increase rather than a decrease in affinity between days 4 and 7 after antigen injection. It is concluded that the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> response is thymus dependent and that athymic mice lack a helper cell required for the induction of anti-idiotypic antibodies...|$|E

40|$|Rabbit {{antibodies}} induced against alprenolol, {{a potent}} beta-adrenergic antagonist, bind to other antagonists, and, with less avidity, to catecholamine agonists. <b>Anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were raised against the anti-alprenolol immunoglobulins. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> specifically bind and agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; {{this is not}} observed for human agglutinate turkey erythrocytes; this is not observed for human or sheep erythrocytes, which are devoid of beta-adrenergic receptors. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> compete with ( [...] ) -[3 H]-dihydroalprenolol for binding on the beta-adrenergic receptors on purified turkey erythrocyte membranes. The binding to the membrane-bound receptors is prevented by preincubation of the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> with their immunogen, the antialprenolol immunoglobulins. The binding to the receptor is not merely passive: the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> stimulate basal adenylate cyclase activity [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] and enhance adenylate cyclase activation by catecholamine.

40|$|In {{order to}} explore idiotypic, anti-idiotypic, and anti-anti-idiotypic {{responses}} to allergens, BALB/c mice were immunized with affinity- purified human idiotypic antibodies directed against a highly purified shrimp allergen. This {{resulted in the}} production of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> which were quantitated by using rabbit idiotypic antibodies raised against the same purified allergen. The mouse <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> recognized shrimp-specific human idiotypic antibodies of the IgE isotype from 18 of 20 individuals, and IgG antibodies from 14 of 20 shrimp-sensitive patients. Immunization of BALB/c mice with affinity- purified, allergen-specific <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> induced anti- allergen IgE and IgG responses {{in the absence of the}} allergen. This paper thus presents evidence that <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> raised against allergen-specific idiotypic antibodies may substitute for the original allergen in the induction of allergen-specific idiotypic antibodies. The demonstration of shared idiotopes on IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of shrimp-sensitive patients supports the use of allergen-specific <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> as surrogate allergens...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} papers (1, 2) in {{this series}} we have presented evidence that an autoanti-idiotypic-antibody response occurs during the normal immune response to a T-independent antigen. The evidence also suggested that this auto-anti-idiotypic response {{is involved in the}} regulation of the immune response. It was established that hapten-augmentable plaque-forming cells (PFC),I defined as antibody-producing cells which could not be detected as PFC in the Jerne assay unless hapten was present during the assay, represented cells whose secretion of antibody was inhibited by bound auto-anti-idiotypic antibody. Furthermore, it was shown that <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> can be assayed by its ability to cause hapten-reversible inhibition of plaque formation. In these earlier studies (1, 2) we noted that the magnitude of the response to trinitrophenyl-lys-Ficoll (TNP-F) falls precipitously between days 4 and 7 after immunization in both AKR/J and BALB/c mice (1, 2) and that serum from AKR/ J mice taken 7 d after injection of TNP-F contained <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> to antitrinitrophenyl (TNP). An important role for <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> in the down regulation of the anti-TNP response was suggested by the presence of haptenaugmentabl...|$|E

Here, we show that short peptides derived from internal image sequences of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> (peptidomimics) can function as both B and T cell epitopes and perpetuate antigen specific immunological memory. We have sequenced the variable regions of heavy and light chains of the <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> specific to rinderpest virus hemagglutinin protein and predicted T cell epitopes in these sequences by an immuno-informatics approach. We have studied the interaction of these epitopes with MHC class I by in vitro assays and in silico analysis by molecular modeling of the idiopeptide–MHC complexes as well as antigen-derived peptide–MHC complexes. The functional capacity of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> derived peptides to stimulate antigen specific T cells in vitro was tested. The ability of peptidomimics to proliferate the immune splenocytes in vitro was 10 times more when {{compared with that of}} a control peptide taken from the constant region of immunoglobulin. Similarly three- to fivefold more amounts of IL- 2 and IFN-gamma were secreted by immune splenocytes in response to in vitro re-stimulation with peptidomimics. Further, we have provided evidence for the generation of antibodies against peptidomimics in memory response generated on antigen or <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> immunizations. In summary, our experiments suggest that peptidomimics are generated in the body after antigen immunization and may have important roles in vivo in regulating antigen specific immunological memory...|$|E
40|$|A polyphenol-rich reagent, {{referred}} to as CSC, was isolated from cigarette smoke condensate and shown to prime purified human neutrophils. A mouse monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> directed against the polyphenol-reactive determinants on a rabbit polyclonal anti-tobacco glycoprotein antibody was generated and shown to also prime neutrophils. After priming by CSC or tobacco <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody,</b> there was a 2. 5 -fold to threefold increase in CD 11 b/ 18 expression and doubling {{of the number of}} formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine receptors on the cells. The primed cells showed a twofold increase, compared with unprimed cells, in production of superoxide and release of neutrophil elastase after stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine.

40|$|Previous {{reports have}} shown the A/J anti-para-azophenylarsonate (anti- Ar) {{antibodies}} that share a major cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) comprise a family of closely related but nonidentical molecules. Serological studies with CRI+ monoclonal anti-Ar antibodies have suggested {{the presence of a}} conserved idiotypic determinant within the family. The present study utilized monoclonal ant-idiotypic determinant within the family. The present study utilized monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> to define further the nature of the conserved idiotypic determinant. It was found that 8 of 10 CRI+ monoclonal antibodies possess an idiotypic determinant reactive with each of three monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies.</b> In addition, approximately 60 % of CRI+ serum anti-Ar antibodies reacted with one of the monoclonal anti-idiotypic preparations. The monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> react with an idiotope in the region of the hapten-binding site, as indicated by the ability of free haptens to inhibit idiotype-anti-idiotype interactions.

40|$|Antibody {{regulation}} of hapten-specific granulomas was studied in mice {{in order to}} assess the relationship between an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> and granuloma formation. An <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> was raised against the idiotype of an azobenzenearsonate (ABA) -specific antibody of A/J mice. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> was subcutaneously (s. c.) administered to syngeneic mice prior to challenge with ABA-coupled polyacrylamide beads injected into the intestinal wall. The results of such a challenge were assessed histologically for granuloma formation at 24 -h intervals. Mice primed with anti-Id antibody and challenged with ABA-linked beads developed epithelioid granulomas at 72 and 96 hr post-challenge. Unprimed mice or mice primed with control antibodies did not develop granulomas when challenged with ABA-linked beads. Moreover, we found that priming with anti-Id antibody intravenously (i. v.) resulted in suppression of intestinal granuloma formation that was similar to that observed previously after priming mice i. v. with ABA-coupled spleen cells (Ginsburg et al., 1982). This study demonstrates the induction and suppression of hapten-specific granuloma formation in the intestine by an anti-Id antibody. The observations indicate a role for the idiotype-anti-idiotype interaction in {{regulation of}} hapten-specific granuloma formation, and may have implications for {{the manner in which the}} host reacts against self in the autoimmune inflammatory process...|$|E
40|$|Taxol, {{originally}} {{extracted from}} the bark of the western yew, Taxus brevifolia, is reportedly {{the first of a}} new class of anti-cancer agents. It acts by promoting and irreversibly stabilizing microtubule assembly, thus interfering with the dynamic processes required for cell viability and multiplication. With the aim of using immunological techniques to study the mechanism of action of taxol, a monoclonal <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> that mimics taxol was prepared, using an auto-anti-idiotypic strategy. It and its Fab fragment inhibited the binding of [3 H]taxol to microtubules. Moreover, like taxol, both promoted the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. These findings provide an example of an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> capable of assembling an organized supramolecular structure from soluble cellular components. In addition, it further establishes the ability of anti-idiotypic antibodies to be functional mimics of ligand molecules bearing no structural similarity to immunoglobulins. The variable regions of the antibody have been sequenced. With the exception of the complementarity-determining region 3, the sequence of the heavy chain variable region is strikingly similar to that of an <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> raised to anti-insulin. The finding that a polypeptide can mimic taxol raises the possibility that taxol acts as a peptidomimetic compound that interferes with the function of an endogenous polypeptide...|$|E
40|$|Spleens of BALB/c mice with plasmacytoma contain macrophages (M phi) {{which were}} found to {{suppress}} the in vitro immune function of normal splenic cells through a diffusible factor.

These findings suggest binding of ligand to a surface receptor of the suppressor M phi that although clearly not PC globulin, may be structurally similar to the PC idiotype. These receptors are retained in 3 day cultures of macrophages and are not removed by intensive washing. Ligand binding appears to modulate the suppressor function of M phi through blocking of the production of diffusible suppressor factor...|$|E

Although the process ultimately responsible for suppression has not been defined, suppression can be initiated by <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibody</b> alone and prevented by complementary Ig; i. e., by anti-PC antibody. Furthermore, a suppressed anti-PC response can be rescued by sublethal irradiation and anti-PC antibody given passively.

A body of evidence supports the concept that the bacteriophage T 4 enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis are associated as a complex within the infected Escherichia coli. This dissertation describes the continued examination of the protein-protein interactions involved in deoxynucleotide biosynthesis of bacteriophage T 4. My studies on the protein-protein interactions involved in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis focused on two unique phage proteins, the dCMP hydroxymethylase enzyme and the translational regulator RegA. An initial study was undertaken to determine if the generation of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> would prove useful in the identification of direct interactions between dCMP hydroxymethylase and other proteins of the deoxyribonucleotide synthetase complex. For the initial generation of <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> polyclonal rabbit antibodies were generated to affinity purified anti-dCMP hydroxymethylase polyclonal rabbit IgG.

40|$|<b>Anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{made against}} the {{antigen-binding}} receptors of T lymphocytes {{for a given}} antigen (Ag-B locus antigens in rats) can be shown to react with IgG antibodies of the same antigen-binding reactivity. Using such <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> normal Lewis T lymphocytes of B and T type can be visualized {{by the use of}} anti-(Lewis- anti-DA) antibodies. Visualization was made possible by the use of direct fluorescent antibody tests or by autoradiography. Using the first technique and naked eye observations 6. 2 % of normal Lewis T lymphocytes expressed idiotypic markers signifying anti-DA reactivity, whereas anti-DA-reactive B lymphocytes as measured by this approach was in the order of 1. 1 %. Autoradiography was purified normal Lewis T lymphocytes gave similar figures. When comparing the intensity of fluorescence at the single cell level using quantitative cytofluorometry <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> reactive with T lymphocytes gave a similar degree of intensity as was obtained using anti-Ig antibodies against B lymphocytes...|$|R
40|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} with reactivity against major histocompatibility antigens {{are known}} to express this immune potential via a display on the outer surface of antigen-specific, idiotypic receptors. Here, we show that <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against such receptors may serve as specific triggering agents of the idiotype-positive lymphocytes in the physical absence of foreign histocompatibility antigens. This was shown in vitro using normal or immune spleen T cells where <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{would lead to the}} selective proliferation and development of antigen-specific cytolytic T cells as determined by short-time 51 Cr release assays. Furthermore, purified <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> in adjuvant administered in vivo to normal syngeneic animals could be shown to lead to production of high titers of specific alloantibodies. The present experiments were in most cases carried out using auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies as triggering agents. The present results thus lend further support to the concept that idiotype-anti-idiotype reactions may be normal parts of conventional immune processes with either stimulatory or inhibitory consequences, depending upon the prevailing conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop and characterize <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> that would recognize and bind the opiate receptors. The <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were developed against antimorphine antibodies which were produced in rabbits by immunization with 3 -O-carboxymethylmorphine-bovine serum albumin. In vitro studies demonstrated that binding of opiate ligands to antimorphine antibodies was saturable, stereospecific, and selective among agonists of different opiate receptor subtypes. In isolated mouse vas deferens, antimorphine antibodies (90 (mu) g/ml) antagonized the inhibitory action of morphine but not that of ketocyclazocine. In the tail flick analgesic test, antimorphine antibodies (3 (mu) g, icv) produced a transient attenuation of the analgesic effect of morphine in mice. Ketocyclazocine analgesia was not antagonized by the same treatment. These results indicated that antimorphine antibodies behaved as 2 ̆ 7 receptor-like 2 ̆ 7 molecules with recognition properties similar to the opiate receptors. ^ <b>Anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> which cross reacted with the opiate receptors were generated by immunizing guinea pigs with purified antimorphine antibodies. Antiserum from immunized guinea pigs reacted positively to antimorphine antibodies in the interfacial (ring) test and decreased the amount of antimorphine antibodies able to react with morphine in binding assay. Antimorphine <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> were also detected in guinea pig antisera by their inhibition of (2 ̆ 73) H-naloxone binding to mouse brain opiate binding sites. The inhibition in ligand binding was concentration dependent and was due to a {{decrease in the number of}} binding sites without altering the affinity of the remaining binding sites. In bioassays for opiates, guinea pig antiserum inhibited the contraction of electrically stimulated guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle and mouse vas deferens. However, the inhibition was not reversed by naloxone. In the tail flick test, guinea pig antiserum (5 (mu) l, icv) alone did not induce an antinociceptive response in mice but attenuated the analgesic effect of morphine (2. 5 mg/kg, sc). ^ It is concluded that antimorphine <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies,</b> which react with the opiate receptors, were developed without isolating the receptors. These <b>anti-idiotypic</b> <b>antibodies</b> would be important tools to study the structure and function of the opiate receptors. ...|$|R
