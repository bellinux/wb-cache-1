5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of <b>administration</b> <b>from</b> where he controlled his lands.

Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E
