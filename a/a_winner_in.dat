5|$|ESPN {{noted the}} {{worldwide}} success of women horse trainers in 2013, particularly owing to wins {{in three of}} the world's major races within a one-month period. In October, Criquette Head-Maarek won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Treve, the only woman trainer to win the Arc. Then, a few days after Ritvo's horse won the Breeders' Cup Classic, the Melbourne Cup was won by Fiorente, a horse trained by Australian trainer Gai Waterhouse, who was only the second woman to train <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> <b>in</b> that race.|$|E

5|$|A {{transfer}} to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He {{broke into the}} first team in 1954, flourishing {{as part of the}} tactical system known as the Revie Plan. During this period he played in two consecutive FA Cup finals, as a loser in 1955 and <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> <b>in</b> 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to promotion in his first season.

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> <b>in</b> multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows a winner to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
5|$|With his Grays {{contract}} expiring in May 2006, Nutter {{opted to}} sign for Conference National side Stevenage Borough {{at the end}} of the month. He joined on a free transfer and on a two-year contract. The move reunited him with Stimson, who made Nutter his first signing following his switch from Grays to Stevenage. Nutter revealed that he had rejected the offer of a contract extension at Grays, as well as an offer from Peterborough United. He made his Stevenage debut against Altrincham on 12 August 2006, playing the whole match in a 2–1 away defeat. Nutter scored his first goal for Stevenage in a 3–2 home win against Woking on 3 October 2006, a late penalty to restore parity in the match, before Stevenage went on to score <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> <b>in</b> injury-time. He went on to score further penalties in home victories against Gravesend & Northfleet and Cambridge United, and also scored against Burton Albion with a long-range drive in a 2–1 win. He added to his most fruitful season in front of goal by scoring twice in April 2007, both from the penalty spot, against Forest Green Rovers and Rushden & Diamonds respectively. He was ever-present during his first season with the club, playing in all 46 leagues matches, as well as making a further ten appearances in cup competitions, scoring six times. Nutter was part of the squad that reached the FA Trophy final in May 2007, the first competitive match at the new Wembley Stadium.
