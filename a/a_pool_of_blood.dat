5|$|Williamson's {{body was}} {{discovered}} by Chambers at approximately 11.15am. Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, {{he opened the door}} and discovered Williamson's corpse lying face down on the floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E
5|$|Spencer begins {{experiencing}} visions, again {{seeing the}} Man in the Planet, {{as well as}} the Lady in the Radiator (Laurel Near), who sings to him as she stomps upon spermatozoon-like creatures. After a sexual encounter with the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, Spencer has a vision where he is decapitated by a creature resembling the child, revealing a stump underneath that resembles the child's face. Soon afterwards, Spencer's head sinks into <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and falls from the sky, landing on a street below. A boy finds it, bringing it to a pencil factory to be turned into erasers.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to create setpiece {{graphics}} for key story moments, similar to simulation titles on PC games. Among the scenes initially planned were Marth kneeling next to the character Jagen in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> and two characters escaping from an ambush. To try and accommodate the advanced graphics, the team opted to use an MMC3 memory chip. The adoption of the MMC3 was influenced by memory space difficulties experienced by the team during the development of Famicom Wars. When {{it was discovered that}} the chip only had one megabite of memory, the team were forced to streamline the graphics and visuals, resulting in the setpiece graphics being cut. The reduced emphasis on graphics meant that the game was not visually impressive, which was later regretted by Kaga and other team members.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It {{is possible that the}} murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with {{at least two of the}} earlier ones, as well as that of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{a student}} was slashed {{in the throat}} in a Chemistry class at UCLA. Damon Thompson of Belize was arrested on {{suspicion}} of attempted murder.

60|$|It was not Alan who lay there, {{but a man}} well up in years, of stern countenance and iron-grey locks; {{and it was no}} drunkard, for {{the body}} lay in <b>a</b> black <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and the open eyes stared upon the ceiling.|$|R
60|$|Somebody {{in there}} moaned with pain, and {{somebody}} else could be seen crouching over what seemed the prone body of a dead man; a lusty voice blasphemed; and the glow under each fire-door was like <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> flaming <b>blood</b> radiating quietly in a velvety blackness.|$|R
25|$|David Henneberry, a Watertown {{resident}} {{outside the}} search area, {{noticed that the}} tarp was loose on his parked boat {{on the evening of}} April 19, two hours after the shelter-in-place order had been lifted.

The person inside the boat started poking at the tarp, and police shot at the boat.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 1962, Ladd {{was found}} lying {{unconscious}} in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> {{with a bullet}} wound near his heart, in {{what might have been}} an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The bullet penetrated Ladd's chest around the third and fourth rib, through the lungs and bounced off the rib cage. At the time, Ladd said he thought he heard a prowler, grabbed a gun, and tripped over, accidentally shooting himself. This was accepted by the police investigating.|$|E
25|$|She {{was not in}} fact dead, {{and when}} Lucas's {{half-sister}} Opal (with whom he was staying) returned later, she discovered their mother alive in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> She called an ambulance, {{but it turned out}} to be too late to save Viola Lucas' life. The official police report stated she died of a heart attack precipitated by the assault. Lucas returned to Virginia, then says he decided to drive back to Michigan, but was arrested in Ohio on the outstanding Michigan warrant.|$|E
60|$|Edie and {{the butler}} hurried back in breathless {{suspense}} {{to the library}} door. It was locked still. Edie took the key from her pocket and turned it quickly.

25|$|For the raid, police wore masks {{to hinder}} identification. Most {{occupants}} of the building were in their sleeping bags, and many raised their arms in surrender when they realised the police were breaking into the building. However, police attacked the crowds with truncheons, beating everyone indiscriminately. A 65-year-old woman's arm was broken. Melanie Jonasch, a 28-year-old archaeology student from Berlin, was attacked by officers set upon her, beating her head so hard that she rapidly lost consciousness. When she fell to the ground, officers circled her, beating and kicking her limp body, banging her head against a nearby cupboard, leaving her in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E
25|$|At daybreak police {{reinforcements}} {{arrived from}} Benalla, Beechworth, and Wangaratta. Superintendent John Sadleir came from Benalla with nine more men. Sergeant Steele, of Wangaratta, brought six, {{for a total}} of about 30 men. Before daylight Senior-Constable Kelly found a revolving rifle and a silk cap lying in the bush, about 100 yards from the hotel. The rifle was covered with blood and <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> lay near it. They believed it to belong to one of the bushrangers, hinting that they had escaped. They proved to be those of Ned Kelly himself. At daybreak the women and children among the hostages were allowed to depart. They were challenged as they approached the police line, to ensure that the outlaws were not attempting to escape in disguise.|$|E
25|$|On December 14, 1999, Corinne Caillaux, 36, {{was stabbed}} {{to death in the}} {{lavatory}} of a Calais to Ventimiglia overnight train while her infant son slept in a carriage. Guards found her slumped in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> in a train toilet. She had been stabbed at least 13 times while her 6-year-old son lay sleeping, and died later from her injuries. The inspectors found a blood-soaked baseball hat close to her body. Rezala was wearing a similar cap when he was found travelling without a ticket about two hours earlier, on the journey from Calais to Ventimiglia on the Italian frontier. DNA tests are being conducted on hairs found in the hat. Police have records of Rezala's DNA taken after earlier crimes.|$|E
60|$|When I came to Renfield's room I {{found him}} {{lying on the}} floor on his left side in <b>a</b> {{glittering}} <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> When I went to move him, it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries. There seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity. As the face was exposed I could see that it was horribly bruised, {{as though it had been}} beaten against the floor. Indeed it was from the face wounds that the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> originated.|$|R
60|$|Joyce {{touched his}} commander's arm, but {{no sign of}} {{consciousness}} came from the latter. He then raised his body upright, placing the back in a reclining attitude against the rocks, and started back himself when he {{caught a glimpse of}} the death-like hue of the face. At first, the notion of the fit was strong with the serjeant; but, in changing his own position, he caught a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood,</b> which at once announced that violence had been used.|$|R
50|$|In the climax, Martha confronts Marcus {{and tries}} to kill him by {{wielding}} a meat cleaver as she chases {{him out of the}} apartment to an elevator. Marcus is then struck in the shoulder by the meat cleaver, but manages to kick Martha toward the elevator shaft. When the long necklace she's wearing gets caught in the bars of the shaft, she's decapitated when he pushes the elevator button. The film ends with Marcus staring <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> Martha's <b>blood.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sarowar didn't {{leave his}} office at Maasranga until about 1:30a.m. {{on the morning of}} 11 February 2012. From {{information}} gathered from a security guard, police believe the couple was killed some time after Sarowar arrived home and before the dawn Fajr prayer, which occurs before sunrise. According to sources, this would place the murder event sometime between 2 and 5 in the morning. Each victim died of multiple stabbing wounds, and sources said Sarowar's limbs were tied and he had the most stab wounds. Their five-year-old son woke up at around 7 a.m. and discovered his parents dead in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and called Runi's mother sometime around 7:30a.m. by a cell phone.

Nick ran to confront Matt at his apartment, only to {{discover}} Matt lying in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> having been shot. Nick's DNA {{was found on the}} gun and he was arrested. Victor hired Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and a range of attorneys to free Nick, who had to go to trial for attempted murder. Nick was found guilty and sent to jail, where he spent Christmas of 1995. However, in February 1996 he was acquitted when Amy came forward as the actual shooter after Matt tried to rape her. Amy was in seclusion after recovering from mental trauma. Matt skipped town after he became in trouble for lying in court, claiming he remembered Nick shooting him. Nick and Sharon then married.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E

25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is not focused on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him.
