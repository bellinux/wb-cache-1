25|$|J. B. Rhine's {{experiments}} with Zener cards were discredited {{due to the}} discovery that sensory leakage or cheating could account for all his results such as the subject being {{able to read the}} symbols {{from the back of the}} cards and being able to see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> experimenter to note subtle clues. Once Rhine took precautions in response to criticisms of his methods, he was unable to find any high-scoring subjects. Due to the methodological problems, parapsychologists no longer utilize card-guessing studies.|$|E

25|$|To my {{knowledge}} {{there is only}} one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it's almost like going back to the dark ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} and conductor André Messager {{was a great}} admirer of Debussy's music and had heard him play extracts from the opera. When Messager became chief conductor of the Opéra-Comique theatre in 1898, his enthusiastic recommendations prompted Albert Carré, {{the head of the}} opera house, to visit Debussy <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> work played on the piano at two sessions, in May 1898 and April 1901. On the strength of this, Carré accepted the work for the Opéra-Comique and on 3 May 1901 gave Debussy a written promise to perform the opera the following season.|$|E

25|$|The first Skull Session held at St. John Arena was in 1957. Prior to this, Skull Session {{was nothing}} more than a final run through of the music on the morning of the game. Originally, these were closed rehearsals that the band {{eventually}} opened up to friends and family members. Each week, more and more people showed up to hear the band rehearse that the director, Jack Evans, decided to move the rehearsal to St. John Arena across the street. Today, upwards of 14,000 people pack St. John Arena every home game to see the band and football team. Many of these people do not even have tickets to the game, but yet travel hours just for a chance to see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} and most {{successful}} of Boughton's works is the opera The Immortal Hour, {{an adaptation of}} the play by Fiona Macleod (the pseudonym of William Sharp) based on Celtic mythology. Having been successful in Glastonbury and well received in Birmingham, {{the director of the}} then new Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Barry Jackson, decided to take the Glastonbury Festival Players' production to London where it achieved the record breaking run of over 600 performances. On its arrival at the Regent Theatre in 1922, it secured an initial run of over 200 consecutive performances and a further 160 in 1923, with a highly successful revival in 1932. People came to see the opera {{on more than one occasion}} (including members of the Royal family) and especially to see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> young Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies whose portrayal as Etain began her professional acting career.|$|E
25|$|On 14 July 1827 Guerrero sailed from Havana for Africa. Her {{departure}} {{was noted}} (along {{with that of}} several other suspected slave ships) by British commissioners in Havana. About 700 Africans, some of whom may have been forcibly taken from other slave ships, were on Guerrero when it sailed from Africa for Cuba. On 19 December 1827 Guerrero was sailing south towards Cuba in the Florida Straits carrying 561 Africans who had survived the voyage when it was spotted by HMS Nimble near Orange Cay (on the Great Bahama Bank). Nimble was smaller and more lightly armed (crew of 56, with, by various reports, eight, five or just three guns) than Guerrero. Nimble fired two shots to order the suspected slave ship to stop for inspection, but Guerrero ran, starting a five-hour chase during which the weather turned bad and night came on. As Nimble closed {{the distance between the}} ships they commenced firing at each other. The crew on the lightship Caesar, stationed on Carysfort Reef near Key Largo, could see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> battle, which appeared to be about ten miles away.|$|E

25|$|By 1905 {{it could}} be stated that the {{national}} Government were supportive {{of the idea of}} setting up a University in Bristol. Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen's Rd at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able to eavesdrop <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> conversation which stated that the Trustees were preparing to sell. Although with a price of £40,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the College could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (£10,000), cousin Francis Fry (£5,000), Sir William Henry Wills (£10,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (£5,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families personal estate was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land.|$|E

On 17 December 1969 New Jerseys colors were hauled down and she entered the inactive fleet, following the words of her last commanding officer: [...] "Rest well, yet sleep lightly; <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> call, if again sounded, to provide fire power for freedom." ...|$|E

500|$|One {{of those}} who {{addressed}} the design problem was Lewis Miller. [...] A wealthy inventor and industrialist, Miller supervised a Sunday school in Canton, Ohio, and later one in Akron. [...] When the First Methodist Episcopal Church in Akron decided to construct a new building, Miller worked with several architects to plan the Sunday-school wing. [...] He devised a plan in which wedge-shaped classrooms were separated by partitions radiating {{from the direction of}} a central superintendent's platform. [...] Doors on the platform-facing side of each classroom could be closed during grade-separated lessons, or opened to allow all pupils to see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> superintendent during school-wide exercises. [...] The new church, following these plans, was constructed in 1866–67.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time in history, the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of National Mall, which extends from the United States Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, as the public viewing area for the {{swearing-in}} ceremony. The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S.Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event. The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event [...] "'the most open and accessible in history,' allowing those who [...] get the [...] tickets to the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall". To enable people in attendance to see <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> swearing-in ceremony, the committee arranged for placement of JumboTrons at points along the entire mall.|$|E
500|$|Conan brought Schwarzenegger {{worldwide}} {{recognition as}} an action star and established {{the model for}} most of his film roles: [...] "icy, brawny, and inexpressiveyet somehow endearing." [...] The image of him as the barbarian was an enduring one; when he campaigned for George H. W. Bush to be president, he was introduced as [...] "Conan the Republican"a moniker that stuck with him throughout his political career and was often repeated by the media during his term as Governor of California. [...] Schwarzenegger was aware of the benefits the film had brought to him, acknowledging the role of Conan as [...] "God's gift to [...] career." [...] He embraced the image: when he was Governor of California, he displayed his copy of the Atlantean sword in his office, occasionally flourishing the weapon at visitors and letting them play with it. [...] More than once, he spiced up his speeches with Conan's [...] "crush your enemies, see them driven before you <b>and</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> lamentations of their women".|$|E
