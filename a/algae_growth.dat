5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote <b>algae</b> <b>growth,</b> causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E

25|$|The snail tolerates siltation, {{thrives in}} {{disturbed}} watersheds, and benefits from high nutrient flows allowing for filamentous green <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> It occurs amongst macrophytes and prefers littoral zones in lakes or slow streams with silt and organic matter substrates, but tolerates high flow environments {{where it can}} burrow into the sediment.|$|E
40|$|Method {{and system}} for {{estimating}} a growth stage of an alga in an ambient fluid. Measured light beam absorption or reflection values through {{or from the}} alga and through an ambient fluid, in each {{of two or more}} wavelength sub-ranges, are compared with reference light beam absorption values for corresponding wavelength sub-ranges for in each <b>alga</b> <b>growth</b> stage to determine (1) which <b>alga</b> <b>growth</b> stage, if any, is more likely and (2) whether estimated lipid content of the alga is increasing or has peaked. <b>Alga</b> <b>growth</b> is preferably terminated when lipid content has approximately reached a maximum value...|$|R
50|$|Stromatolites, {{which are}} marine <b>algae</b> <b>growths,</b> were unknown, {{and it was}} a puzzle whether these fossils were organic or {{inorganic}} products. James Hall (1811-1898), the first State Paleontologist of New York, identified them as being organic and placed stromatolites in a new genus.|$|R
40|$|Low {{salinity}} {{influence on}} chlorophyll a and carotinoid content {{and growth of}} microalgae Plagioselmis prologa (Cryptophyta) was studied. It were shown, that photosynthetic content decreased under salinity 24 ‰, compare with control (32 ‰), but <b>alga</b> <b>growth</b> didn’t affected. Salinity reduction to 16 ‰ provoked more significant lowering of the parameters compared with control. Salinity 8 ‰ lead to the most {{negative effect on the}} alga...|$|R
25|$|With {{concern over}} global warming, new methods for the {{thorough}} and efficient capture of CO2 are being sought out. The carbon dioxide that a carbon-fuel burning plant produces can feed into open or closed algae systems, fixing the CO2 and accelerating <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> Untreated sewage can supply additional nutrients, thus turning two pollutants into valuable commodities.|$|E
25|$|In populations {{found in}} Benthic ecosystems, amphipods play an {{essential}} role in controlling brown <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> The mesograzer behaviour of amphipods greatly contributes to the suppression of brown algal dominance in the absence of amphipod predators. Amphipods display a strong preference for brown algae in Benthic ecosystems, but due to removal of mesograzers by predators such as fish, brown algae is able to dominate these communities over green and red algae species.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with its {{use as an}} insecticide, boric acid also prevents and destroys existing wet and dry rot in timbers. It {{can be used in}} {{combination with}} an ethylene glycol carrier to treat external wood against fungal and insect attack. It is possible to buy borate-impregnated rods for insertion into wood via drill holes where dampness and moisture is known to collect and sit. It is available in a gel form and injectable paste form for treating rot affected wood without the need to replace the timber. Concentrates of borate-based treatments can be used to prevent slime, mycelium, and <b>algae</b> <b>growth,</b> even in marine environments.|$|E
25|$|The reef face is {{the zone}} above the reef floor or the reef drop-off. This zone {{is often the}} most diverse area of the reef. Coral and {{calcareous}} <b>algae</b> <b>growths</b> provide complex habitats and areas which offer protection, such as cracks and crevices. Invertebrates and epiphytic algae provide much of the food for other organisms. A common feature on this forereef zone is spur and groove formations which serve to transport sediment downslope.|$|R
5000|$|This {{species is}} an herbivore, grazing algae on the shallow reef. It {{has also been}} {{commonly}} observed to clean algal growths from the shells of sea turtles. In the Ahihi-Kinau nature preserve area on Maui, Hawaii, aggregations of this fish have established [...] "cleaning stations" [...] where green sea turtles come to be groomed. This is a symbiotic relationship. The fish benefit by having access to an easy meal, while the turtles get groomed of the <b>algae</b> <b>growths</b> on their shells, which can increase drag in the water when growth becomes too dense.|$|R
40|$|The green alga, Selenastrum capricornutum Printz, {{was used}} in an algal {{bioassay}} to determine the toxic properties of copper in various natural lake waters of Oregon. Lake water was collected and {{brought back to the}} laboratory where it was treated with various copper concentrations and inoculated with a cell suspension of the test <b>alga.</b> <b>Growth</b> of the <b>alga</b> was determined by direct cell counts. The copper ion activity, pH, and absorbance of the test cultures were also determined.

25|$|The {{pollution}} {{often comes}} from nonpoint {{sources such as}} agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrates or phosphates, stimulate <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, {{most of which are}} either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic.|$|E
25|$|Origin Oils Inc. {{has been}} researching a revolutionary method called the Helix Bioreactor, {{altering}} the common closed-loop growth system. This system utilizes low energy lights in a helical pattern, enabling each algal cell {{to obtain the}} required amount of light. Sunlight can only penetrate a few inches through algal cells, making light a limiting reagent in open-pond algae farms. Each lighting element in the bioreactor is specially altered to emit specific wavelengths of light, as a full spectrum of light is not beneficial to <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> In fact, ultraviolet irradiation is actually detrimental as it inhibits photosynthesis, photoreduction, and the 520nm light-dark absorbance change of algae.|$|E
25|$|Peat is {{sometimes}} used in freshwater aquaria. It is seen most commonly in soft water or blackwater river {{systems such as}} those mimicking the Amazon River basin. In addition to being soft in texture and therefore suitable for demersal (bottom-dwelling) species such as Corydoras catfish, peat {{is reported to have}} a number of other beneficial functions in freshwater aquaria. It softens water by acting as an ion exchanger; it also contains substances that are beneficial for plants, and for the reproductive health of fishes. Peat can prevent <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> and kill microorganisms. Peat often stains the water yellow or brown due to the leaching of tannins.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are some}} green <b>algae</b> <b>growths</b> on {{rocks in the}} West Branch Lackawanna River {{downstream}} of river mile 7.25. The algae possibly comes from agricultural runoff. The vegetation along the river was described in a 2002 report as [...] "in good condition". It consisted of brush, forests, marshes/wetlands, natural fields, and pastures. An estimated 36 percent of the river had forests along its banks, 32 percent had brush, 13 percent had marshes, 10 percent had pastures, 6 percent had natural fields, and less than 2 percent had bare or compacted ground. A large hemlock forest surrounds the river for 1.5 mi.|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time, the {{expressed}} stimulating {{action of the}} SWF-radiation on photosynthetics - microalgae has been shown. The optimum parameters of the irradiation, giving the maximum stimulating effect and acceleration of the <b>alga</b> <b>growth,</b> have been revealed; the resonance character of action and influence {{on the level of}} the photosynthetic processes in the cell has been shown. The work has been performed on the microalga, to be used in mariculture as the first link of the tophic chain.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to isolate and identify unknown allelochemicals from Ficus microcarpa, and to investigate the inhibitory to bloom-forming of green alga Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Through gradient elution, fraction C 2, whose inhibition of <b>alga</b> <b>growth</b> in diverse extracts was the strongest was shown to cause significant reductions of maximum quantum yield, as well as electron transport rates of C. pyrenoidosa. The study data also showed that the increase of fraction C 2 concentration decreased the activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD), but increased the activities of catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. These results demonstrate that the active fraction C 2 not only induced the photoinhibition or photodamage of PSII reaction centers, but also triggered the synthesis of reactive oxygen species which may change cell membrane penetrability, thereby leading to the eventual death of C. pyrenoidosa. Furthermore, the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses showed that the most potential allelochemical in active fraction C 2 was 2 -Propyl phenol, which may exhibit potent allelopathy...|$|R
25|$|Reefs are chronically {{at risk of}} algal encroachment. Overfishing {{and excess}} {{nutrient}} supply from onshore can enable algae to outcompete and kill the coral. Increased nutrient levels can {{be a result of}} sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff from nearby coastal developments. Runoff can carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef. Decreased oxygen levels can slow down coral's calcification rates weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation. In surveys done around largely uninhabited US Pacific islands, algae inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations. The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae, and macro algae.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Arabian Peninsula is unsuited to agriculture, making {{irrigation}} and land reclamation projects essential. The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting {{to less than}} 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, coffee and tropical fruits. Goat, sheep, and camel husbandry is widespread elsewhere {{throughout the rest of}} the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid tropical monsoon climate, in particular the Dhofar and Al Mahrah areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical monsoon rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid desert climate or arid steppe climate. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally tropical sea with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in symbiosis with the Red Sea coral, the protozoa and zooxanthellae, have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the indopacific coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the Persian Gulf, mostly caused by phosphate water pollution and resultant increase in <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.|$|E

40|$|The {{carbon cycle}} of lower trophic {{level in the}} Bohai Sea is studied with a three-dimension-al {{biological}} and physical coupled model. The influences of the processes (including horizontal advection,river nutrient load, active transport etc.) on the phytoplankton biomass and its evolution are estimated. The Bohai Sea is a weak sink of the CO 2 in the atmosphere. During the cycle, 13. 7 % of the gross pro-duction of the phytoplankton enter the higher trophic level and 76. 8 % of it are consumed by the respira-tion itself. The nutrient reproduction comes mainly from the internal biogeochemical loop and the rem-ineralization is an important mechanism of the nutrient transfer from organic form to inorganic. Horizon-tal advection decreases the total biomass and the eutrophication in some sea areas. Change in the nutrientload of a river can only adjust the local system near its estuary. Controlling the input of the nutrient,which limits the <b>alga</b> <b>growth,</b> can be very useful in lessening the phytoplankton biomass...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} culture media, namely CHU 12 and inorganic fertilizer NPK (20 - 5 - 20) associated with macrophyte (Eichhornia crassipes) extract, {{were used to}} evaluate the development of A. gracilis. Growth rate, development, nutritional value and medium water quality were analyzed. A. gracilis in macrophyte+NPK medium had mean cell density (333 x 10 (5) cells/mL) higher than medium CHU 12 (302 x 10 (5) cells/mL). Protein rate (12. 52 % PS), dry weight (397 x 10 (7) pg/cell) and ashes (4. 08 x 10 (7) pg/cell) in A. gracilis was higher (p 0. 05) in both media. When hydrological variables in the culture medium of A. gracilis are taken into account, dissolved oxygen and free CO 2 alone failed to have any significant difference (p> 0. 05) between the media employed. A. gracilis in the macrophyte+NPK medium had the same nutritional rate as the commercial medium CHU 12, with excellent results for <b>alga</b> <b>growth.</b> Macrophyte medium may be used for large scale alga culture in the feed of fish larvae...|$|R

2500|$|Another way {{to store}} {{rainwater}} without worry of contamination by mosquitos {{is to use}} underground storage tanks. [...] Underground tanks keep the water too cool (@55 degrees F) for mosquito larvae and also are dark, preventing both mosquito, bacterial, and <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> A very good article by Richard Hill goes into depth {{about the benefits of}} underground rainwater storage.|$|E
2500|$|Water, carbon dioxide, {{minerals}} and light are all {{important factors in}} cultivation, and different algae have different requirements. The basic reaction for <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> in water is carbon dioxide + light energy + water = glucose + oxygen + water. [...] This is called autotrophic growth. [...] It is also possible to grow certain types of algae without light, these types of algae consume sugars (such as glucose). This is called heterotrophic growth.|$|E
2500|$|For planted {{freshwater}} aquariums, it is {{also important}} to maintain a balance between the duration and quality of light, the amount of plants, CO2 and nutrients. For a given amount of light, if there is insufficient number of plants or insufficient CO2 to support the growth of those plants, so as to consume all the nutrients in the tank, the result would be <b>algae</b> <b>growth.</b> While there are fishes and invertebrates that could be introduced in the tank to clean up this algae, the ideal solution would be to find the optimal balance between the above-mentioned factors.

2500|$|Every adult human excretes between 200 and 1000 {{grams of}} {{phosphorus}} annually. [...] Studies of United States sewage {{in the late}} 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of 500 grams in urine and feces, 1000 grams in synthetic detergents, and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies. Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. [...] Phosphorus removal is important {{as it is a}} limiting nutrient for <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> in many fresh water systems.

It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as reverse osmosis.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to chemical pollution and <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> caused by runoff containing chemicals and fertilizers, air pollution {{has also been}} a significant factor in the disappearance of brook trout from their native habitats. [...] In the U.S., acid rain caused by air pollution has resulted in pH levels too low to sustain brook trout in all but the highest headwaters of some Appalachian streams and creeks. Brook trout populations across large parts of eastern Canada have been similarly challenged; a subspecies known as the aurora trout was extirpated from the wild by the effects of acid rain. [...] Today, {{in many parts of the}} range, efforts are underway to restore brook trout to those waters that once held native populations, stocking other trout species only in habitats that can no longer be recovered sufficiently to sustain brook trout populations.|$|E
2500|$|Eroding soils or poorly {{maintained}} {{construction sites}} can {{often lead to}} increased sedimentation in runoff. [...] Sedimentation often settles {{to the bottom of}} water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. [...] These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost <b>algae</b> <b>growth</b> while limiting native vegetation growth. [...] Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and suspended solids have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well. [...] Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface. [...] Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs. [...] This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.|$|E

40|$|Accumulation {{and growth}} {{inhibition}} of Cu to fresh water alga (Scenedesmus subspicatus 86. 81 SAG) and {{the influences of}} ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and fulvic acid (FA) were examined. These results demonstrated that both EDTA and FA could reduce toxicity of Cu to alga by the way of preventing Cu from being adsorbed by cell wall of alga. When dissolved Cu (Cu(dissolved)), extracellular Cu (Cu(extracellular)), and intracellular CU (Cu(intracellular)) were differentiated, our {{results showed that the}} concentration level of extracellular CU ([Cu(extracelular) ]) was a good indicator for measuring the toxic effects of Cu on <b>alga</b> <b>growth</b> in complex matrix. Either in the absence or in the presence of EDTA-and FA, the concentration of intracellular Cu increased to 0. 6 - 1. 5 x 10 (- 8) muM per cell when the growth inhibition reached to about 50 %. We found that the acute toxicity of copper on unicellular alga could be interpreted by its accumulation at a discrete site or biotic ligand at alga cell wall and critical accumulation of Cu associated with EC(50) was determined to be 1 x 10 (- 8) muM per cell.
