30|$|Users {{request the}} {{quantity}} of water they need at a particular reliability, the temporal distribution of this “allocation” within the upcoming season or year, their willingness to pay, and compensation in the event <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery.</b> The water manager then assesses feasible allocations using the forecast that tries to meet these criteria across all users.|$|R
50|$|Confirmed {{acceptance}} credit {{is more expensive}} to establish than unconfirmed {{acceptance credit}} because the issuing bank is effectively guaranteeing payment. It also transfers the risk <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> to the recipient, because once the seller places the product {{in the hands of}} the shipping company, the seller has complied and will be paid; if the shipment does not arrive, is delayed, or other problems occur, the buyer cannot stop payment or otherwise prevent redemption of the acceptance credit.|$|R
30|$|The {{prices for}} CERs and ERUs will mirror the EUA price {{developments}} because the prices for these project-based permits are in principle also {{determined by the}} factors explained above. Due to a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> related to CERs and ERUs (compared to EUAs), CER/ERU prices are currently a bit lower than EUA prices. We believe that this spread between the prices for both kinds of permits, which at present amounts to about 4 €, will persist in the future.|$|R
5000|$|The purest form of PbR is Payment by Outcomes, {{which seeks}} to {{maximise}} payments linked to outcomes. This is where the commissioner (central or local Government) is fully able to contract {{in terms of the}} outcomes it wants and to transfer the financial risk <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> to providers. However, commissioners may face a number of challenges that may make a pure Payment by Outcomes approach either impractical or sub-optimal in terms of achieving the aims of PbR models. These challenges largely stem from commissioners’ ability to manage different risks and responsibilities, especially in relation to their understanding of desired outcomes and their measurement.|$|R

Technically any transfer of cards in the game is not considered a [...] "sale" [...] because, for legal reasons, the digital objects are not actually owned by the collector, but rather Wizards of the Coast themselves. This enormously simplifies transactions, as issues such as import/export laws, duties, and underage concerns are sidestepped.

The producer obviously requires such funds upfront to finance the film so the producer takes the signed distribution contract to a bank/financier and will effectively use it as collateral against a production loan.

5|$|The {{ship was}} built by the Castellammare di Stabia shipyard. Her keel was laid down on 30 January 1899, and the {{completed}} hull was launched on 7 November 1901 {{in the presence of}} the King and Queen of Italy, government officials, and the whole Italian Mediterranean squadron. Fitting out work lasted for the next four years, and she was completed on 1 September 1905. It took so long primarily because <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> <b>of</b> material, particularly the heavy armor. After she entered active service, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron. The Squadron was usually only activated for seven months of the year in peacetime, which was occupied with training maneuvers, and the rest of the year the ships were placed in reserve. In 1907, the Mediterranean Squadron consisted of Benedetto Brin, her sister , and three of the s. The ships participated in the annual maneuvers in late September and early October, under the command of Vice Admiral Alfonso di Brocchetti. Benedetto Brin remained in the active duty squadron through 1910, by which time the fourth Regina Elena-class ship was completed, bringing the total number of front-line battleships to six.|$|R
50|$|Advice classes can {{be defined}} for other {{resource}} bounds instead of P.

If we are allowed an <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> length 2n, we {{can use it to}} encode whether each input of length n is contained in the language. Therefore, any boolean function is computable with an <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> length 2n and <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> more than exponential length is not meaningful.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Risks in {{procurement}} {{of material}} resources and production at Ore Mining and Processing Enterprises (OMPE) are considered. It is established that economic risks {{can be reduced}} by re-planning in real-time. Methodological approaches to determining the economic effect of automated information systems (AIS) from re-planning of procurement taking into account probability <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> are proposed. Set losses from risks of accidents and unplanned outages of machinery and equipment, risks of not identifying the performance of machines and equipment, risks of not identifying quality raw material, risks of fluctuations in the volume of production at previous stages, risks of unplanned urgent orders, etc. Management solutions to reduce these risks are developed. It is proved {{that in terms of}} capacity constraints any delay re-planning and determining backup machines and equipment leads to losses from the reduction in production volumes in subsequent stages...|$|R

40|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} {{reported}} in studies both overseas and in Australia, as affecting between 10 % and 50 % of hospitalised patients, with the geriatric population subject to the highest rates. Effective nutrition supplement delivery is critical to supporting adequate protein and energy intakes in older people at nutritional risk. Study aims included: determining distribution and consumption rates of oral nutrition supplements by food service staff. Three-day food and supplement intakes were recorded by nurses and dietetics students weekly over 3 weeks. Average age and gender of participants (n = 12) were 80 ᠸ. 5 years and 67 % male. Failed supplement distribution occurred in 21 % (24 / 114) of deliveries. Length of stay, time of delivery, age and gender of patients were not associated with supplement delivery. When supplements were delivered, consumption was high with 71 % (65 / 92) of patients consuming the entire supplement. In summary, the level <b>of</b> <b>non-delivery</b> <b>of</b> nutrition supplements was higher than anticipated. Barriers to successful supplement delivery need to be identified and combated through education, training, development of delivery and administration guidelines for food service staff and exploration of alternative modes of nutrition support provision.
