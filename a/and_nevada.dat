5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah <b>and</b> <b>Nevada,</b> the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E
5|$|Arizona won {{the game}} 49–48 after scoring two touchdowns {{in the final two}} minutes to come back for the victory.

Despite losing the game, Nevada possessed the ball nearly twice as long and gained twice as many rushing yards as Arizona.

5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona <b>and</b> <b>Nevada</b> {{were two of}} the top offenses in the country, ranking 7th and 10th in yards per game respectively.

The game was widely expected to be a shoot-out, as both teams were in the top-20 scoring offenses in the regular season.|$|E

5|$|For a short stretch, the Colorado {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming.
