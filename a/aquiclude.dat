25|$|A {{confined}} aquifer is an aquifer that is overlain by a relatively impermeable layer of rock or substrate {{such as an}} <b>aquiclude</b> or aquitard.

25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and <b>aquiclude</b> (or aquifuge), which is a solid, impermeable area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the impermeable area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E
500|$|These three {{formations}} {{were laid}} down {{over a period}} of 30million years from early-to-middle Cambrian time. [...] Trilobites followed by brachiopods are the most commonly reported fossils in this group but well-preserved fossils are relatively rare. We know that the shoreline was transgressing (advancing onto land) because finer grade material was deposited on top of coarser-grained sediment. Today, the Tonto Group makes up the Tonto Platform seen above and following the Colorado River; the Tapeats Sandstone and Muav Limestone form the platform's cliffs and the Bright Angel Shale forms its slopes. Unlike the Proterozoic units below it, the Tonto Group's beds basically lie in their original horizontal position. The Bright Angel Shale in the group forms an <b>aquiclude</b> (barrier to groundwater seeping down), and thus collects and directs water through the overlying Muav Limestone to feed springs in the Inner Gorge.|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} focuses equally on two main topics. The first of these {{subjects}} deals with development of criteria for monotonicity of con- trol volume methods. These methods are important and frequently used for solving the pressure equation arising in porous media flow. First we consider homogeneous parallelogram grids, and subsequently general logical Cartesian grids in hetrogeneous media. This subject is concluded {{by the development of}} a new class of Multi Point Flux Approximation methods, motivated by the monotonicity results obtained. The second topic of this thesis is the development of analytical and semi- analytical solutions to the problem of leakage through abandoned wells. More specifically, we look at a set of aquifers, separated by impermeable layers (<b>aquicludes),</b> where injection of water or CO 2 takes place in some or all the aquifers. The aquifers and <b>aquicludes</b> are frequently penetrated by aban- doned wells from oil exploration, and our problem consists of finding solutions to flow and leakage through these wells. The goal is to obtain expressions for leakage rates that may be evaluated quickly enough such that Monte Carlo realizations over statistical distributions of properties for abandoned wells can be performed...|$|R

2500|$|There are two end {{members in}} the {{spectrum}} of types of aquifers; confined and unconfined (with semi-confined being in between). Unconfined aquifers are sometimes also called water table or phreatic aquifers, because their upper boundary is the water table or phreatic surface. (See Biscayne Aquifer.) Typically (but not always) the shallowest aquifer at a given location is unconfined, meaning {{it does not have}} a confining layer (an aquitard or <b>aquiclude)</b> between it and the surface. The term [...] "perched" [...] refers to ground water accumulating above a low-permeability unit or strata, such as a clay layer. This term is generally used to refer to a small local area of ground water that occurs at an elevation higher than a regionally extensive aquifer. The difference between perched and unconfined aquifers is their size (perched is smaller). Confined aquifers are aquifers that are overlain by a confining layer, often made up of clay. The confining layer might offer some protection from surface contamination.|$|E

The <b>aquicludes</b> and local impervious plugs are of a limited variety; in most cases they consist of complex flysch formations of an essentially clayey-marly nature. Within the context of the sample of springs examined, the commonest causes of resurgence are permeability thresholds, followed by the outcropping of the piezometric surface or given permeability limits.

50|$|Langcliffe Pot is a solutional cave formed within {{rocks of}} the Yoredale Series of the Pendlian and Brigantian substages of the Mississippian epoch of the Carboniferous period.

50|$|Because {{the soil}} biomantle {{is the main}} zone of bioturbation, it is {{invariably}} permeable and of low density. It thus plays several essential hydropedological roles in the environment. For example, it promotes the downward percolation of rainwater and snowmelt through often-abundant biochannels and interconnected biopores. The biomantle also promotes downslope soil-water (throughflow, interflow) movements if it is formed above a clay-enriched Bt (argillic) horizon, or above some other dense subsoil horizon (e.g., duripan, fragipan, etc.) or bedrock - all of which generally function as aquitards or <b>aquicludes</b> to vertical soil water flow. In such cases the stonelayer, if present, can actually function as an aquifer for free water flow. Hence {{it is not uncommon}} to see soil water seepage above Bt horizons on slopes where soil stonelayers outcrop. Ground water recharge can occur through any of these biomantle-related processes. Recharge, of course, can also occur when the soil dries appreciably and shrinks, as during droughts, which allows vertical leakage to temporarily occur immediately after drought-breaking rainfalls.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{high-resolution}} conceptual hydrogeological model for complex basaltic volcanic islands based on Mayotte Island in the Comoros. Its geological structure and hydrogeological functioning are deduced {{from a large}} dataset: geological mapping, geophysics, some forty new boreholes, piezometric data, hydraulic conductivity, hydrochemical data, etc. We describe previously unknown deep cut-and-fill palaeovalleys. The resulting conceptual geological and hydrogeological model of the island {{is very different from}} the Hawaiian model, in that it lacks a low-elevation basal aquifer and dyke-impounded high-level aquifers. It is closer to the Canary Islands model, which has, however, not yet been described at a high-resolution scale. It does not have a continuous aquifer, but rather a discontinuous succession of perched aquifers separated by <b>aquicludes</b> and aquitards. This results more from the complex geological structure of the island, which has experienced several phases of volcanism, erosion and weathering, than from its age, but is also a result of the high-resolution scale of the model.

40|$|Glacially formed slopes in the Mondsee {{catchment}} {{close to}} Koppl, Austria, expose high hydrological dynamics after intense rainfall events. We use Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) {{to identify the}} subsurface geological structure relevant for springs causing surface runoff during storm events at times of fully saturated soils. To identify the horizontal and vertical distribution of subsurface structures, we use 26 parallel ERT profile lines with 6 m spacing, and 4 m electrode spacing, over a total length of 88 m. After 3 D inversion, the electrical resistivity values in the generated model comprise 10 to 1132 Ωm. Sections with resistivity values between 10 and 100 Ωm, classified as water-saturated material, dominate the uppermost 3 m of the model. Highest resistivity (> 200 Ωm) materials are classified as moraine material, which forms the steepest part of the slope covered by a coppice belt. Linear features with lowest resistivity values show congruencies with streams from runoff modelling and crop-out of springs.

30|$|In Peninsular India, all {{the hard}} rock true hydrographs show a {{predominant}} annual cycle {{in response to the}} wet and dry season. With the onset of monsoon, throughout the monsoon the curve form rising limb and once the monsoon retrieve the curve starts forming recession limb, which continue until the next monsoon (annual cycle). Successive annual cycles join together to form long-term hydrograph. With the full knowledge of fluctuation of groundwater level, the hydraulic conductivity/filtration conditions can be calculated by analyzing recession curve of well hydrograph (Ferdowsian et al. 2001; Gailuma and Vitola 2009; Posavec et al. 2006; Sujono et al. 2004). The rapid decline in recession curve corresponds to better filtration conditions (Gailuma and Vitola 2009). Therefore, it can be stated comparatively that the U shape curves correspond to better hydraulic conductivity (k) than the V shape, whereas the S shape curves represents the lowest hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. So, based on hydraulic conductivity (k) aquifers can be classified as U > V > S type curve. In the Peninsular hard rock V type is more abundant over U type, while S type is the least abundant type since it largely corresponds to <b>aquicludes.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} laboratory-scale {{two-dimensional}} porous medium tank experiments {{was conducted to}} study stable-layered variable density flow problems using well-defined experimental parameters and boundary conditions. The experiments were carried out both in a rectangular flow tank and in a more complex geometrical setup aimed at studying variable density flow in geometries similar to geological formations of aquifers and <b>aquicludes</b> connected via fault zones. An impermeable layer within the porous medium tank forced the solutes to pass through a vertical channel, representing a geological fault zone, to reach the outlet of the tank. Flow through the porous medium occurred through a single inflow opening and an outflow opening on the opposite edge of the domain. An image analysis technique delivered 2 %, 10 %, 50 %, and 80 % salt concentration isolines at distinct times. Breakthrough curves of the dyed saltwater with an initial density of 1063 g/L were available at any location within the tank.

Interbedding with marly <b>aquicludes</b> hampers speleogenesis locally. Calcareous and evaporite karsts are present, however, and their waters are important albeit generally limited resources. Large quantities of fresh water are lost through submarine springs downslope from Libya’s Gebel al Akhdar range; the caves and karst of that range may be among the world’s greatest.
