5|$|P.semilanceata {{has also}} been {{confused}} with the toxic muscarine-containing species Inocybe geophylla, a whitish mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> yellowish-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|The {{immature}} American goldfinch has <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> brown back, and {{the underside}} is pale yellow. The shoulders and tail are dull black with buff-colored, rather than white, markings on wings and rump. This coloration {{is the same}} in both genders.|$|E
5|$|Clutch size {{depends on}} the {{location}} and the food source, but generally Aerodramus swiftlets lay one or two eggs. The eggs are <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> white, and are laid every other day. Many, if not all, species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War, Yehudi {{lights were}} again tried, this time mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> blue-and-white {{camouflage}} pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, {{this time with}} thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering much of an aircraft's surface.|$|E
5|$|In the far future, {{an office}} worker named Johnson leads <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben {{suggests}} that he go to the Trip Movie Corporationa company that enables its customers to experience a dream {{as though it were}} a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem, and to command a battlestar.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and takes on <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} sexually dimorphic, with the males {{possessing}} a bright, greenish-blue color while the females are <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> brown.|$|R
50|$|Young {{birds have}} <b>a</b> <b>duller,</b> indistinct head pattern, with buff stripes and a brown ground colour, and have {{streaked}} breasts.|$|R
5|$|The fairy-bluebirds are bulbul-like {{birds of}} open forest or thorn scrub. The males are dark-blue and the females <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> green.|$|R
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
5|$|The bird's plumage {{colouration}} is most {{similar to}} the pale-bellied tapaculo. The S. g. morenoi subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo can be differentiated from the Perijá tapaculo by its entirely brown back and nape, and its different calls. Juveniles of this subspecies have <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> ventral plumage, while the Perijá tapaculo has a more yellow plumage. It also resembles the Caracas tapaculo but has a duller ventral colour.|$|E
5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E

50|$|Young {{birds have}} <b>a</b> <b>duller,</b> indistinct head pattern, with brown stripes and a buff ground colour. They lack the rufous collar, and have {{streaked}} underparts.|$|R
5|$|The sea-firefly {{is a small}} {{crustacean}} {{living in}} sediment. At rest it emits <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to confuse the predator. During World War II it was gathered and dried {{for use by the}} Japanese military as a source of light during clandestine operations.|$|E
5|$|These are noisy {{birds with}} a clear {{whistling}} kee-wee-ooo call given {{on the ground or}} in flight. Quarrelling birds also have a harsh repeated kee. In flight, the beating wings produce <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> sound. The calls of males and females show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100% accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Duncan Wood, the BBC's Head of Comedy, {{watched a}} comedy on {{television}} called The Misfit. Impressed by writer Roy Clarke's ability to inject both comedy and drama into the sitcom, Wood offered Clarke {{the opportunity to}} write a sitcom. Clarke nearly turned the job down as {{he felt that the}} BBC's idea for a programme about three old men was <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> concept for a half-hour sitcom. Instead, Clarke proposed that the men should all be unmarried, widowed, or divorced and either unemployed or retired, leaving them free to roam around like adolescents in the prime of their lives, unfettered and uninhibited.|$|E
5000|$|Rhodothemis lieftincki is a {{medium-sized}} dragonfly with a wingspan about 60-85mm. The adult male is red in colour, {{and the female}} is <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> brown or orange.|$|R
50|$|The {{female and}} {{juvenile}} have a paler grey head, upperparts and wings, <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> head pattern, <b>an</b> orange rump, and buff underparts. The call is a loud wheeoo.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} Indian race M. p. junonia {{is identical}} to the nominate race from Sri Lanka but on the upperside is <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> brown; the median ocellus on the forewing encircled with pure white; no discal patch, or merely faint traces of one. Underside: markings similar to those in M. p. patnia, but altogether of <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> and browner shade, without any general ochraceous tint, a large bright ochraceous spot posteriorly on the hindwing in the male. The median ocellus on the forewing broadly encircled with white. Male sex-marks are seen in one morph.|$|R
5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 weeks), or chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult male}} has glossy green upperparts and {{head with a}} yellow belly and narrow purple breast band. The female is <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> green above and entirely yellow below.|$|R

50|$|The sexes are similar, {{although}} the female is usually slightly {{smaller than the}} male and with smaller tarsal spurs. Young birds are mainly grey-brown, with <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> blue breast and short hackles.|$|R
5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and forms <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, {{it is not a}} good conductor of heat or electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228°C).|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} the genus Lactarius are also similar: The {{tropical}} African Lactarius chromospermus has a superficial resemblance to L.volemus, but the former species, {{in addition to its}} African distribution, can be identified by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the Russulaceae. Lactarius subvelutinus is also similar to L.volemus, but lacks the fishy odour, has <b>a</b> <b>dull</b> yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound of}} a crash is changed by its luster. A cleaner cymbal creates a crisper sound, whereas a cymbal showing signs of {{oxidation}} (called a 'raw' cymbal) creates <b>a</b> <b>duller</b> sound.|$|R
