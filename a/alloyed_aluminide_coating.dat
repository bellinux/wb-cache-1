40|$|To take {{advantage}} of the synergistic effects of Pt and Zr, a kind of Zr-doped, Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> has been prepared by a hybrid process, first electroplating a Pt layer and then co-depositing Zr and Al elements by an above-the-pack process. The microstructure and isothermal oxidation behavior of the coating has been studied, using a Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> as a reference. Results showed that the Zr-doped, Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> was primarily composed of β-(Ni,Pt) Al phase, with small amounts of PtAl 2 - and Zr-rich phases dispersed in it. The addition of Zr diminished voids on the coating surface since Zr could hinder the growth of β-NiAl grains. It also helped to increase the spalling resistance of the oxide scale and reduce the oxidation rate, which made the Zr-doped, Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> possess better oxidation resistance than the reference Pt-modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> at the temperature of 1100 °C...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} some {{functional}} properties (hardness and oxidation resistance) of platinum and palladium modified aluminide coatings deposited by the CVD method on a nickel-based superalloy were determined. The platinum and palladium microlayers, 3 µm thick were deposited by electroplating process. The heat treatment of electroplating microlayers was performed for 2 h at the temperature 1050 ◦C in an argon atmosphere as to increase adhesion between the coating and the substrate. The low activity CVD aluminizing process of platinum heat treated coatings 3 µm thick at the 1050 ◦C for 8 h using IonBond equipment was performed. The effects of aluminizing process were verified {{by the use}} of an optical microscope (microstructure and coating thickness); a scanning electron microscope and an energy dispersive spectroscope (chemical composition of the surface and cross-section of the modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating).</b> The hardness measurements on the cross-section of nonmodified and platinum or palladium modified aluminide coatings were performed. Oxidation tests of modified aluminide coatings at the 1100 ◦C for 1000 h in the air atmosphere were carried out. On the grounds of the obtained results {{it was found that the}} main phase of the platinum modified <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> is β-(Ni,Pt) Al. Consequently, the palladium modification of <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> causes the formation of β-(Ni,Pd) Al phase.

40|$|The {{addition}} of active elements in high temperature materials may improve corrosion resistance extensively. In general, the active elements are {{incorporated in the}} form of an alloying element either in the bulk or in overlay coatings, as an oxide dispersion, or by ion implantation. In this experiment, yttrium was incorporated by an ion plating method either before or after pack aluminizing to maximise the corrosion resistance of IN 713 C. Various combinations of pack aluminizing and yttrium ion plating were examined with respect to coating sequence, aluminium activity, and corrosion environment. From all the various coating combinations examined, the best corrosion resistance was obtained from the H/A + Y (high activity aluminizing + Y-ion plating) type multilayer coatings. Uniformity of the Y deposition was greatly dependent upon the surface condition of the <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> layer. The high activity <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> gave better uniformity of Y deposition than did the low activity <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating.</b> Improvement of corrosion resistance by the Y-modified aluminide multilayer coatings of H/A + Y type may occur because Y present between the A 12 O 3 columns improves the A 12 O 3 scale adherence and substantially prohibits depletion of Al in the <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> layer...|$|R

A pack diffusion process was used to produce the coatings in this current study. A standard <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> was modified with a small YCI 3 (0. 5 Wt. %) addition to the pack, producing an aluminising-yttrising pack. In the platinum-modified altuninide coating process, a sample was coated with several microns of platinum using a sputtering technique prior to the aluminising process. The pack used in this platinum modified aluminide process was a standard aluminising pack. The performance of these modified coatings during oxidation and high temperature corrosion was evaluated. Promising results were obtained, which demonstrated that both platinum and yttrium modified aluminide coatings had beneficial effects on the oxidation performance of the coatings compared to the standard <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating.</b> However, they were found to work in different ways, to improve resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion resistance. The platinum modified aluminide extends the later stage of the coating life by reduces the amount of spall, whist yttrium modified aluminide reducing the amount of spall in the early stage of the coating life and increases the critical oxide thickness before the onset of spallation.

It {{was found that}} NaCl deposits markedly accelerated the oxidation of the AISI 1020 steel. The <b>aluminide</b> <b>coating</b> on the bare steel gives the best oxidation protection by forming continuous alumina scale (Al 2 O 3). The degradation of aluminide layer and alumina scale on the steel are associated by chloridation/oxidation cyclic reactions. In addition, the released chlorine will be as catalytic actions and leads {{to the formation of}} loose Al 2 O 3 during corrosion...|$|R
