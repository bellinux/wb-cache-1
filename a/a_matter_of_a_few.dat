40|$|Walter Benjamin’s famous {{statement}} in the eighth of his “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” that “the state of [exception] {{in which we live}} is not the exception but the rule,” 1 has become as normalized as its proposition asserts. Few turns of phrase have become as easily convertible, turning the “special property” (of the definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Greek idioma) through collocation into an implicit signified conventionalized by common usage. In the phrases turning on the elements “the exception” and “the rule,” the antonyms are being assimilated to each other, neutralizing their oppositional relation—not as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mystical “attraction <b>of</b> opposites,” nor even as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> special type <b>of</b> Schmittian complexio oppositorum, but rather, in Michael Marder’s terms, 2 as <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> “metonymic abuse <b>of</b> modernity. ” Without examining the antonymic relation between the terms, their specific figural emergence tends to be relegated to oblivion. This process of conventionalization is transported into the philosophical discourse in which these terms acquire further attributions. The semantic fields of “the exception” and “the rule” have provided fertile ground for such transpositions—prime examples being the phrases “the exception proves the rule” and “the exception has become the rule. ”www. telospress. comam 2016 Philosoph...|$|R

25|$|The {{plot of the}} manga and anime {{series is}} mainly about Hikari and her dream {{to become one of}} the world's best gymnasts. As both the anime and manga {{continued}} to develop, the story revolves around Hikari, Ooishi and Shiina and the incidents, mishaps, and life learning adventures they experience as they work hard for their dreams to reach Olympic stardom. In the anime series Mao, a young musician is introduced quickly and goes from a secondary character to a primary character within <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> episodes (he appears later as a part of the manga cast in volume 4). The television show would occasionally give more attention to the lives of the antagonists (Mao's manager), minor characters (Hikari's family) or average-everyday people as a way of setting up a plot, or clarifying a point (a common method among anime series of the 1980s and today). Flashbacks were also used occasionally in the show for similar reasons. Some other minor characters were a bit underdeveloped or received very little character development because some of them were only used as part of visual quality of the anime and manga series in general or due to the anime being concluded after only nineteen episodes. The producers had to limit the appearances and character development of some characters in order to focus on the main characters in order to give the anime series a decent ending in the little amount of episodes the anime series had left to conclude the story as well as possible.|$|E
