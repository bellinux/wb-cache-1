40|$|INTRODUCTION Aerodynamic shape {{optimization}} involves {{designing the}} most efficient shapes of bodies that move through fluids. An optimization algorithm perturbs {{the shape of an}} airfoil until it finds the shape which best exhibits a given design objective. For an inverse design technique, this objective is a prescribed aerodynamic distribution, usually the surface pressure distribution. Liebeck pressure distributions [1], for example, have been demonstrated to generate airfoils with high lift to drag ratios. When designing fans, consideration must be given not only to the shape of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> but also to the distance separating the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This spacing is defined by the pitch/chord ratio t/l, where the pitch, t, is the distance between <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> and the chord, l, is the length of each <b>fan</b> <b>blade.</b> In this work, an inverse algorithm is developed, then used to design <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> shapes and to find the optimal blade spacing. <F 14. 3...|$|R

40|$|High-performance {{compressors}} {{with increased}} pressure ratios require sophisticated materials and design solutions.

Two different materials and design approaches {{will be discussed in}} the paper, namely local reinforcement of the titanium <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> by using titanium matrix composites (TMCs) and by partly replacing the bulk titanium <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> by fiber reinforced plastics (hybrid concept). While the TMCs significantly im-prove the mechanical properties of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> the hybrid blades can contribute to considerable weight savings.

40|$|A new and {{innovative}} concept is proposed for designing lightweight <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> {{for aircraft engines}} using commercially available 17 - 4 PH precipitation hardened stainless steel. Rotating <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> in aircraft engines experience a complex loading state consisting of combinations of centrifugal, distributed pressure and torsional loads.

These maps show that the 17 - 4 PH sandwiched foam panels can fail by either the yielding of the face sheets, yielding of the foam core or wrinkling of the face sheets depending on foam relative density, the magnitude of t/L and the loading mode. The design envelop of a generic <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> is superimposed on the maps to provide valuable insights on the probable failure modes in a sandwiched foam <b>fan</b> <b>blade...</b>|$|R

In order to increase the blade impact capability beyond this point, several mixed material (hybrid) designs were investigated using S-glass and Kevlar as well as boron and graphite fibers. These hybrid composite blades showed a marked improvement in resistance to bird impact over those blades made of a single composite material.
