In order to find out what kind of errors {{play a crucial role in}} the process of <b>acquiring</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> a study was carried out, in which fifty-eight students took part. A composition task, a multiple choice task sheet and a questionnaire was given to the students for completion so as to observe their different error categories, and to make comparisons between the groups at different levels. After data collection and analysis, the results of the study have shown that the influence of the mother tongue was greater in the case of the multiple choice test, however, in the composition task, developmental errors were dominant. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that students have to work on their language proficiency, and as far as their writings are concerned, they are very poor at grammar, so a new grammar teaching method should be introduced in order to be more successful in foreign language learning.

When there are differences between his (MT) and target language (TL), the learner’s mother tongue and target language are similar, the native language will actively aid foreign language in learning that is in case of similarities between the native language and target language, the transfer functions positively, while in case of differences, it functions negatively. The mother negative language transfer in <b>acquiring</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> is seemingly inevitable. Since the differences between the learners’ MT and TL will interfere with the target language learning.

40|$|Two main {{opposing}} approaches exist {{regarding the}} impact of first-language (L 1) use in {{the teaching and learning}} of English as a foreign language: the monolingual and bilingual approaches. Some linguists assume that students’ L 1 should be banished from their English classes, whereas others assert that it facilitates the process of learning a target language. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate learners’ attitudes towards the use of L 1 in their English classes, both by the students themselves and by their teachers. The current study also determined which factors caused the learners to switch from the TL to their L 1.   This study was conducted at Salahaddin University, Erbil, at the end of the first semester of the 2016 - 2017 academic year. It employed a mixed-method approach of data collection and analysis. Two hundred and fifty-eight EFL learners participated in the quantitative data collection, by completing a questionnaire and the qualitative data were collected via face-to-face semi structured interviews with eight EFL learners.

Therefore, it is necessary to determine language learners ’ readiness for lifelong learning (LLL) in order to support their language development. This paper reports the findings of a study conducted to identify the LLL propensities of some Turkish and Emirati university students learning English as a foreign language in their local contexts. The study included 61 Emirati and 47 Turkish students, {{with a mean age of}} 19.

However, the Turkish students ’ overall LLLTS scores as well as certain sub-skills were found to be higher than those of the Emirati students.

40|$|Jan 2017 Speakers who <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> (L 2) in {{adulthood}} (and even earlier), often experience major difficulties in producing non-native speech sounds, a phenomenon {{commonly known as}} having <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> accent.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of the field of}} study ‘English for Specific Purposes ’ (ESP) was {{as a result of the}} acknowledgment of the importance of the purpose and needs of language learners. There are many peculiarities found within the English language that have led to a growing interest from researchers who strive to make it possible to distinguish English for Tourism, English for Law and Business English among others. Linguists have observed that since languages are constantly subjected to change due to its flaccid state, one cannot exclusively claim that they speak perfect English or any other language as of that (Choroleeva K, 2012). Even a native speaker cannot be considered to perfectly know his/her mother tongue. The foreign language of choice for most Albanian students is English. The students do not solely want to understand how a language functions or merely know how it compares stylistically with other learned languages. The learners are interested in learning the functions of the language because it is an aspect of professional and social acceptance and it also is a self-actualization aspect. However, even after investing ample time and effort in learning a foreign language, it has been noted that students usually have inhibitions when it comes to expressing themselves in the foreign language. They still use their native language when speaking or writing. This can be blamed on the methodology that most students use when <b>acquiring</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language.</b> Instead of learning for oral communication, they learn to gain reading proficiency in a foreign language or for the sake of being scholarly (Dralo A, 2012).

40|$|To {{deal with}} the English {{language}} {{as a matter of}} study for school or technological students is it necessary for people who design the programs or plans of study to understand the characteristics of a language. The person begins listening and understanding what people say around, then he or she begins to produce oral expressions trying to imitate what is already known orally to get an answer from the people. These two skills are generally acquired at non formal education that means, out of school or before this one. To develop all these skills in a parallel way can take years of constant exposition to diverse manifestations of the language and also requires the constant interaction with other language speakers. This process never stops and forms part of the real life of a person and his development. We would say that the intellectual capacity of a person depends on the complexity level of the language that is able to understand and express orally and in written form. To all this we have to add the role of the culture inside the process of language acquisition. All language grows and depends of a cultural context which leads its development as a tool of communication. Culturally, there are manifestations of some social, scientific, technological or other groups that create new communication needs that make imperative the creation, adoption or modification of new words, phrases and terms to show exactly what the other groups need to understand. This means that, cultural manifestations obligate to a constant language change, especially today when the worldwide communication is part of our reality. This argument is enough to realize the language complexity, and also the difficulty of <b>acquiring</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> where the person is far from the place where this language is the mother tongue. Then, the focus of the project is on the poor results got in the English language acquisition in our country and {{the point of view of}} the way how to conceive the English language teaching for getting satisfactory results...|$|E

To overcome the boring situation of learning that the students face everyday, the writer combines the use of songs and TPR method. She wants to know which one is better teaching English vocabulary using word lists or teaching English vocabulary through songs using TPR method. She also mentions some advantages of teaching vocabulary through children’s songs using TPR method to the fourth grade of elementary school. She conducts her experiments at SDK St. Yohannes Gabriel Surabaya. She uses two classes randomly. She uses class IV A as the control group and class IV B as the experimental group. There are three topics of teaching that she uses. The first one is about Daily Activities, second is Part of Body and the last topic is Physical Education. For the measurement she holds a posttest for both classes. There are 20 items of the test. The items are conducted in the multiple choices with four options. She analyzes the results of the posttest and she finds that {{there is a difference between}} teaching English vocabulary using word lists and teaching English vocabulary using songs combined with TPR method. It can happen because of some possibilities like the students from control group can memorize the vocabulary longer than the students from experimental group because they know the meaning first and also have repetition while the students from the experimental group feel over excited because they have a new situation, so that they do not seriously follow the lesson. In chapter five she concludes that there is a significant difference between teaching English vocabulary using wordlists and teaching English vocabulary through children songs using TPR method.

Therefore, teachers have to consider storytelling as an important motivating teaching resource, since it has the power of enriching and making people interactive in the English class with students, especially when working with children because they enjoy learning English through stories, so their learning will be easier. Using storytelling in the EFL classroom will help children to develop the listening skill. In this way, they are going to enhance the development of vocabulary, thinking and interaction between teacher and students.
