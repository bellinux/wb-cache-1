40|$|ABSTRACT. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} and compare the antagonistic effects of <b>atipamezole,</b> yohimbine and prazosin on medetomidine-induced diuresis in healthy cats. Five cats were repeatedly used {{in each of the}} 9 groups. One group was not medicated. Cats in the other groups received 40 µg/kg medetomidine intramuscularly and saline (as the control), 160 µg/kg prazosin, or 40, 160 or 480 µg/kg <b>atipamezole</b> or yohimbine intravenously 0. 5 hr later. Volume, pH and specific gravity of urine; plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) level; and creatinine, osmolality and electrolyte levels in both urine and plasma were measured. Both <b>atipamezole</b> and yohimbine, but not prazosin, antagonized medetomidine-induced diuresis. The antidiuretic effect of <b>atipamezole</b> was more potent than that of yohimbine, but was not dose dependent, in contrast to the effect of yohimbine at the tested doses. Both <b>atipamezole</b> and yohimbine reversed medetomidine-induced decreases in both urine specific gravity and osmolality and increases in plasma osmolality and free-water clearance. Antidiuresis of either <b>atipamezole</b> or yohimbine was not related to the area under the curve for AVP level, although the highest dose of both <b>atipamezole</b> and yohimbine initially and temporarily increased plasma AVP levels, suggesting that this may partly influence the antidiuretic effects of both agents. The diuretic effect of medetomidine in cats may be mediated by α 2 -adrenoceptors, but not α 1 -adrenoceptors. <b>Atipamezole</b> and yohimbine can be used as antagonistic agents against medetomidine-induced diuresis in healthy cats.

METHODS: Cats admitted for ovariohysterectomy (OVH) surgery were randomly allocated to group <b>atipamezole</b> (n =  6) or group saline (n =  6) and were premedicated with buprenorphine 20  μg kg(- 1) intramuscularly (IM) and alfaxalone 3. 0  mg kg(- 1) subcutaneously (SC). Anaesthesia was induced with alfaxalone intravenously (IV) to effect and maintained with isoflurane in oxygen. Ten minutes after extubation, cats from group <b>atipamezole</b> received IM <b>atipamezole</b> (0. 0375  mg kg(- 1)) whereas group saline received an equivalent volume [0. 0075  mL kg(- 1) (0. 003  mL kg(- 1) IM) ] of 0. 9 % saline. A validated multidimensional composite scale {{was used to assess}} pain prior to premedication and postoperatively (20  minutes after extubation). If postoperative pain scores dictated, rescue analgesia consisting of buprenorphine and meloxicam were administered.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{characterize}} the hemodynamic effects of medetomidine (1 mg/m 2 of body surface area; dosage, 39 to 46 micrograms/kg of body weight, IM) and midazolam (1 mg/kg of body weight, i. v.) combined with butorphanol (0. 1 mg/kg, i. v.), buprenorphine (10 micrograms/kg, i. v.) or saline solution. Reversibility of these effects by <b>atipamezole</b> (2. 5 mg/m 2; dosage, 97. 5 to 115 micrograms/kg, IM) was evaluated. DESIGN [...] 2 treated groups and 1 control group, without repetition. ANIMALS [...] 15 clinically normal dogs (3 groups of 5). PROCEDURE [...] Medetomidine was administered at time 0; midazolam and butorphanol, buprenorphine, or saline solution at time 20; and <b>atipamezole</b> at time 60. Heart rate, systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, central venous pressure, body temperature, cardiac output, and arterial and mixed venous blood gas tensions and pH were measured. Cardiac index, stroke index, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and {{left and right}} stroke work indexes were calculated. RESULTS [...] Body temperature, heart rate, cardiac index, and stroke index were significantly decrease below baseline values in some groups. Central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and systemic vascular resistance were significantly increased above baseline in all groups. Arterial and venous PO 2 and pH decreased in all groups and PCO 2 increased, but these changes were more pronounced when buprenorphine was administered. Arterial pressure decreased after <b>atipamezole</b> administration. CONCLUSION [...] The combinations seemed to result in cardiorespiratory depressant effects of similar importance {{and most of these}} effects, which are related to medetomidine, were reversed by <b>atipamezole.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that isoflurane-induced {{cognitive}} deficits could be alleviated by dexmedetomidine in young animal subjects. In the current study, we examine whether dexmedetomidine could also alleviate isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits in senile animals. Senile male C 57 BL/ 6 mice (20 months) received dexmedetomidine (50 μg/kg, i. p.) or vehicle 30 minutes prior to isoflurane exposure (1. 3 % for 4 h). Cognitive function was assessed 19 days later using a 5 -day testing regimen with Morris water maze. Some subjects also received pretreatment with α 2 adrenoreceptor antagonist <b>atipamezole</b> (250 μg/kg, i. p.), JAK 2 inhibitor AG 490 (15 mg/kg i. p.) or STAT 3 inhibitor WP 1066 (40 mg/kg i. p.) 30 minutes prior to dexmedetomidine. Isoflurane exposure increased and reduced the {{time spent in the}} quadrant containing the target platform in training sessions. The number of crossings over the original target quadrant was also decreased. Dexmedotomidine attenuated such effects. Effects of dexmedotomidine were reduced by pretreatment with <b>atipamezole,</b> AG 490 and WP 1066. Increased phosphorylation of JAK 2 and STAT 3 in the hippocampus induced by isoflurane was augmented by dexmedetomidine. Effects of dexmedetomidine on JAK 2 /STAT 3 phosphorylation were attenuated by <b>atipamezole,</b> AG 490 and WP 1066. Isoflurane promoted neuronal apoptosis and increased the expression of cleaved caspase- 3 and BAD, and reduced Bcl- 2 expression. Attenuation of such effects by dexmedotomidine was partially blocked by <b>atipamezole,</b> AG 490 and WP 1066. Dexmedetomidine could protect against isoflurane-induced spatial learning and memory impairment in senile mice by stimulating the JAK 2 /STAT 3 signaling pathway. Such findings encourage the use of dexmedetomidine in geriatric patients receiving isoflurane anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|A black jaguar (Panthera onca) was anesthetized with a {{combination}} of medetomidine, ketamine and isoflurane in oxygen for radiological examination and surgical repair of a fractured mandible. Since a non-domesticated cat is potentially dangerous, induction of anesthesia was performed by intramuscular injection using a mechanical squeeze cage. The cardiopulmonary parameters during anesthesia remained within normal ranges; only a small increase in the respiration rate was recorded 75 minutes after intubation. This hyperventilation was treated with buprenorphine (for additional analgesia) and an increased inspiratory fraction of isoflurane. Recovery was rather slow after 165 minutes of general anesthesia, so <b>atipamezole</b> was administered.

40|$|Earlier {{studies suggest}} that a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonists and {{dopamine}} receptor agonists may enhance sexual activity in human and nonhuman male primates. It is not known whether these compounds influence the sexual behavior of female primates. We determined whether the administration of a selective a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist (<b>atipamezole),</b> a dopamine receptor agonist (apomorphine), or their combination to female Macaca arctoides (stumptail macaque) monkeys produces changes in sexual behavior of the female with a male. Following the administration of drugs to the female, {{the behavior of the}} female with a male stumptail was observed for 30 min. <b>Atipamezole</b> dose dependently (0. 03 – 0. 3 mg/kg im) increased short-time mounting behavior of the male and the total number of copulations. Apomorphine alone (0. 125 – 0. 25 mg/kg) or in combination with <b>atipamezole</b> had no significant effects on sexual behavior. The result indicates that a selective a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist administered in the female stumptail increases sexual behavior of the male with the female. A plausible explanation for this finding is that a selective a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist increases sexual arousal in female stumptails and this, possibly due to a change in psychosocial behavior of the female, triggers increased sexual activity in males...|$|E
40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} connectivity MRI {{has emerged}} as a powerful tool for mapping large-scale neural networks based on synchronous BOLD signal; however, the neurobiological mechanisms are still unknown. To understand its neural substrates, especially the underlying neurotransmission, we applied pharmacological modulation with a receptor specific agonist and antagonist. Resting and evoked electrophysiology and BOLD signals in rat brains were measured under infusion of α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist, medetomidine, the antagonist, <b>atipamezole,</b> and the vehicle individually. Both somatosensory BOLD activation and evoked potential were increased significantly under medetomidine compared to the vehicle while <b>atipamezole</b> slightly decreased both. The interhemispheric correlation at the resting state, in contrast, was suppressed by medetomidine but increased by <b>atipamezole</b> in regions with high receptor densities including the somatosensory cortex and thalamus. No change was seen in the caudate putamen, where receptor occupancy is low. The regional difference in connectivity was not related to cerebral blood flow, indicating that BOLD signal correlation is unlikely due to the vascular effects of the drugs. Resting intracortical recording exhibited agonist/antagonist dependent changes in beta and gamma bands that correlated with the BOLD functional connectivity measure. Our results confirm an important role of the adrenergic system on functional connectivity and suggest a neurotransmission basis of the phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and {{specific}} serotonergic antidepressant, which blocks the alpha(2) -adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, has shown anxiolytic properties {{in clinical trials}} and preclinical animal experiments. The addition of mirtazapine to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is clinically suggested {{to be more effective}} for anxiety disorders. In this study, we examined the combined effects of mirtazapine and citalopram, an SSRI, on the freezing behavior of rats, which was induced by contextual conditioned fear as an index of anxiety or fear. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats individually received footshocks in a shock chamber, and 24 hours later, they were given citalopram and/or mirtazapine injections. One hour after citalopram and 30 minutes after mirtazapine administration, freezing behavior was analyzed in the same shock chamber without shocks. Results: Mirtazapine decreased freezing in a dose-dependent manner, which is consistent with a previous report; it also enhanced an anxiolytic-like effect at a high dose (30 mg/kg) of citalopram. Because mirtazapine blocks alpha(2) -adrenoreceptors, the combined effect of <b>atipamezole,</b> a selective alpha(2) receptor antagonist, with citalopram was also examined. Similar to mirtazapine, <b>atipamezole</b> reduced freezing dose-dependently, but the enhancement of citalopram's effects by <b>atipamezole</b> was not clear when compared with mirtazapine. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that mirtazapine has an anxiolytic-like effect and may enhance the anxiolytic-like effect of SSRIs, but this enhancement may not be explained by its anti-alpha(2) property alone...|$|E

We measured SpO 2, heart rate, respiratory rate and body temperature of each deer at 20 and 40 min after lateral recumbency. Forty-five minutes after lateral recumbency, deer were given appropriate antagonist drugs (half i. v., half i. m.). All drug combinations except the XK dose produced lateral recumbency in the deer. Hyperthermia occurred in the XK, MKB and MK groups. The MKT-A and MKT-B treatments resulted in acceptable physiological parameters, rapid induction and quick recovery.

40|$|Functional {{recovery}} after cerebral ischemia may {{be enhanced}} by activation of the noradrenergic system and by environmental enrichment. The underlying mechanisms have remained elusive, but endogenous neurogenesis and perilesional angiogenesis have been speculated {{to contribute to the}} behavioral improvement. To address this question, neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and perilesional angiogenesis (RECA- 1) were correlated with behavioral performance in forty Wistar rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham-operation. <b>Atipamezole,</b> an ? 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist (1 mg/kg, i. p.), was administered for 10 days together with housing of rats in an enriched environment. MCAO rats and sham-operated rats housed in single non-enriched cages were used as controls. Histological analysis after 28 -day behavioral follow-up showed a massive increase in doublecortin (DCX) -positive cells in the SVZ both in MCAO rats housed in single cages and in the enriched environment together with <b>atipamezole</b> treatment whereas perilesional RECA- 1 staining for new blood vessels was not altered. Time to the first contact and time to remove sticky stimuli from the forelimbs indicated improved sensory processing, which disappeared after cessation of <b>atipamezole</b> administration. Skilled forelimb use as measured by performance in Montoya’s staircase test was not affected by the treatment. There were no correlations between behavioral measures and histology. Thus, sensory facilitation or reversal of hypometabolism by the combined therapy may be the mechanism accounting for the improved behavior after stroke independent from neurogenesis and angiogenesis...|$|E
