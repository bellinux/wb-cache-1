5000|$|The Canadian Newsmaker of the Year is a {{designation}} {{awarded by}} the Canadian edition of Time magazine. It {{comes with a}} written piece reflecting the magazines staffs opinion on which Canadian or Canadians have had {{the most impact on}} the news, either positively or negatively. [...] The honour has also been known by the title Canadas Newsmaker, or by titles such as [...] "Headliners" [...] and simply [...] "Newsmakers" [...] which were shared with non-Canadians. However, the exact phrase [...] "Canadian Newsmaker of the Year" [...] has been used by Time. This selection is {{not to be confused with}} the Canadian Press separate selection of <b>a</b> Canadian <b>Newsmaker</b> of the Year, or with Times overall Person of the Year.|$|R
5000|$|Times {{practice}} of selecting <b>a</b> Canadian <b>Newsmaker</b> of the Year began in 1995. Columnist Robert Fulford has {{speculated that the}} point was to try [...] "gesturing politely to Canadian readers". In early years, the selection received a short article within a list of other international newsmakers. Thus, the 1995 newsmaker was found under the title [...] "Headliners: Canada" [...] and in subsequent years phrases like [...] "Others Who Shaped 1997", [...] "Others Who Shaped 1999", and [...] "Newsmakers 2000" [...] were used. Since 2001 the selection {{has been accompanied by}} a fuller article, and interviews with the subjects have also appeared (for example, in 2001 and 2002, but not 2003). Still, the press has noted that even with the Canadian edition of Time, it is the Person of the Year rather than the Canadian Newsmaker who is pictured {{on the cover of the}} issue.|$|R

40|$|Historical {{data items}} are often semantically inter-related, such as news events that build on past events. Such inter-related data {{have so far}} been visualized {{primarily}} with simple timeline interfaces, which tend to not scale well, and which do not illustrate important semantic relationships among the data. An improved technique would be useful in news analysis, social and historical research, criminal investigation, etc. We propose a new interface design, called Semantic Timelines. Since such historical information involves commentary on previous data (e. g., <b>a</b> <b>newsmaker</b> comments on something that happened last year), we allow for different time periods to be vertically stacked, so that a period of comment or consequences can sit directly {{on top of a}} period of earlier activity. In addition, Semantic Timelines are zoomable, and can include hierarchical nesting structures for drill-down. Together, these techniques allow a vast amount of historical information to be viewed within a rich semantic context, at various scales simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (General Linguistics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. This study {{examined}} how different {{words and phrases}} used within the media may portray a certain image of an individual, ultimately impacting {{the perception that the}} reader forms of such individual. Specifically, the manner in which Fred van der Vyver was portrayed by both an Afrikaans language newspaper and an English language newspaper in the Fred van der Vyver-Inge Lotz murder case was examined. This was a highly publicized case from March 2005, when Inge Lotz was found murdered, to November 2007, when Fred van der Vyver, who was suspected of killing Inge Lotz, was acquitted. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare two South African journalistic cultures, namely the ones represented by Cape Times and Die Burger, respectively, in their construction of Fred van der Vyver as newsmaker. The rationale for the study was that newspaper coverage of a murder as well as of the investigation and trial which follow creates a certain perception among its readers, and that this perception is based on the information that readers accumulate by reading various published articles. The hypothesis was that both newspapers treated Fred van der Vyver as <b>a</b> <b>newsmaker,</b> and as a murdered in particular, by making use of various linguistic devices. The data analyzed were a selection of articles published between March 2005 and November 2007 in the online versions of Cape Times and Die Burger. A focal point of the study was to show how different aspects of newspaper reporting – specifically headlines and the text itself – construct a particular view or image of the case in general and of Fred van der Vyver in particular. It was found that neither the Cape Times nor Die Burger wrote that Fred van der Vyver was the murderer but both suggested it throughout by making use of linguistic devices. Loaded words, for example, were used to describe certain aspects of the case, and these aspects were then associated with Fred van der Vyver. Fred van der Vyver`s identity had been presented as that of a murderer within the press by means of linguistic tools and language use. The hypotheses was therefore borne out by the data, as both newspapers had indeed portrayed the identity of Fred van der Vyver as that of a murderer. What we read in the papers does have an influence on what we perceive to be true, objective or accurate and on how we ultimately form an opinion. In this case, the public automatically accepted Fred van der Vyver’s identity as portrayed in the press, namely as that of a murderer, and assumed that he was guilty once he was arrested...|$|E
