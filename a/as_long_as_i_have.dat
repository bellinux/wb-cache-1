500|$|It is {{believed}} that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises have added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes {{has been compared to}} the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter has noted, [...] "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> I am used to it." [...] He later stated that the helmets in their current iteration are fitted with ventilators to prevent overheating.|$|E

[...] In 1921, his first season as commissioner, New York Giants owner Charles Stoneham and manager John McGraw purchased Oriental Park Racetrack in Havana, Cuba. Landis gave Stoneham and McGraw an ultimatum—they could not be involved in both baseball and horse racing. They quickly put the track back on the market.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, it was {{announced}} that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records America was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. Jackson's tenth studio album, Discipline, which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, [...] "I wanted to name the album Discipline because {{it has a lot of}} different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have...</b> And to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Grimaldi {{and his son}} first became strained during the early 1820s. JS, who had {{made a career of}} emulating his father's act, received favourable notices as Clown, but his success was constantly overshadowed by that of his father. [...] He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. [...] JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. [...] In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS {{went out of his way}} to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money. JS once replied: [...] "At present I am in difficulties; but <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a shilling you shall have half". [...] However, there is no record of him ever sending money to his father. JS finally returned home in 1827, when the Grimaldis were awakened one night to discover their son standing in the street, feverish, emaciated and dishevelled.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in the business, there are very few firsts." ...|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series {{frequently}} {{makes use}} of Gene Hunt's comical rudeness {{in the form of}} jokes and dramatic irony about a future which the audience already knows, but which the characters in 1973 do not.

2500|$|In the 2000–01 season, United {{retained}} the league title {{for a third}} season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so. The achievement was overshadowed by reports of a rift between the club's board and Ferguson. He told the club's television channel MUTV that {{he was prepared to}} sever all ties with the club, once his contract ended the following year: [...] "The decision has been taken. I'm going to leave the club. I'm disappointed with what has happened because I was hoping something would be sorted out. It hasn't happened as I thought it would and that's all there is to it." [...] Both parties eventually reached a compromise which pleased Ferguson: [...] "I am delighted we've settled this. When you have been at the club <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it gets in your blood." [...] Ferguson's decision to retire came about because he perceived his chances of winning a second European Cup as [...] "imponderable." [...] Age was another factor: reaching 60 acted as a [...] "psychological barrier ... It changed my sense of my own fitness, my health." ...|$|E
