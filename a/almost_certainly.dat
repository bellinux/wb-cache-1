5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{a native}} of Angus, {{he appears to be}} a {{descendant}} of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of King William I of Scotland, through an illegitimate son whom Earl David settled in the area around Brechin.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae is {{a unique}} object, with no very close analogues {{currently}} known in any galaxy. Therefore, its future evolution is highly uncertain, but <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> involves further mass loss and an eventual supernova.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{very successful}} in providing a framework for accurate models which describe {{an impressive array of}} physical phenomena. On the other hand, there are many interesting open questions, and in particular, the theory as a whole is <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> incomplete.|$|E
50|$|The two {{batches of}} Hunslet 2-6-0T's were <b>almost</b> identical, <b>certainly</b> to the eye. The main {{difference}} {{was in the}} number of boiler tubes, increasing the heating surface in the later batch giving a slightly higher tractive effort (by around 1,000 lbf).|$|R
5000|$|A. R. Ammons once said, [...] "the {{histories}} of modern poetry in America and of Poetry in America are <b>almost</b> interchangeable, <b>certainly</b> inseparable." [...] However, {{in the early}} years, East Coast newspapers made fun of the magazine, with one calling the idea [...] "Poetry in Porkopolis".|$|R
5|$|Though opened, {{this initial}} road was <b>almost</b> impassable, and <b>certainly</b> dangerous. Despite this, it quickly gained notoriety for its breathtaking scenery and {{seemingly}} limitless {{hunting and fishing}} potential.|$|R
5|$|In 830, Ecgberht led a {{successful}} expedition against the Welsh, <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{with the intent}} of extending West Saxon influence into the Welsh lands previously within the Mercian orbit. This marked the high point of Ecgberht's influence.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> present.|$|E
5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} blue sky. The fine weather <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{increased the}} size of the crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the city's name is uncertain. It would have <b>almost</b> have <b>certainly</b> been Bernisdale, with [...] "Bernis-dale" [...] {{originating}} from [...] "Bjorn’s dale", or glen which indicates the Viking origins of the Skye Village. Legend has it that Macleod {{was impressed by the}} number of Children on the run, the children of his stockmen, that he called it Bairns-dale, or [...] "valley of the children".|$|R
60|$|He admired her, {{she felt}} that as {{distinctly}} {{as if he had}} spoken to her. He wanted to be near her. He had asked her to help him with the chafing-dish that night, and to pour the beer while he stirred the gluey mass of cheese. All the little things by which a young man expresses his admiration he had used <b>almost</b> artlessly, <b>certainly</b> boyishly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle!" [...] it cried, a {{world of}} indignation and {{surprise}} in its pitch, and then: [...] "Andre!" [...] And this time a note <b>almost</b> of gladness, <b>certainly</b> of welcome, was blended with the surprise that still remained.|$|R
5|$|The club's record home {{attendance}} is 23,002, for an FA Cup match against QPR on 10 January 1948, a record which will <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> never be broken unless the club relocates {{to a larger}} ground, given that Priestfield Stadium's current capacity is approximately half that figure.|$|E
5|$|A {{converted}} {{field goal}} {{would have given}} the Vikings a 10-point lead, which would have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> clinched victory, according to Pro Football Prospectus and the NFL Network documentary The Missing Rings. Citing a mathematical algorithm by sports analytics company numberFire, The New York Post reported that the Vikings had a 95.23% chance of winning the game had Anderson converted the field goal.|$|E
5|$|As a corollary, Nyuserre was <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{a son of}} Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This {{relationship}} is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, {{as well as his}} reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's unfinished constructions.|$|E
40|$|Prior to the Arab {{oil embargo}} {{that began in}} October 1973, the general feeling was that U. S. oil {{resources}} were <b>almost</b> limitless. <b>Certainly</b> there were some who were aware {{that the rate of}} crude oil production was falling and costs were increasing, but these perceptions were relegated to the background. Past experience supported the explorer's optimistic outlook concerning potential discoveries. The United States never seemed in danger of being less than the world's foremost producer of crude oil. ...|$|R
50|$|By 1929, each {{of these}} {{companies}} had essentially outgrown its usefulness to the industry. For most of them, the market had some time earlier reached a saturation point. In some instances, their machines were badly dated and rapidly approaching obsolescence. For {{each of these}} companies to have attempted further activity on solo basis would <b>almost</b> have <b>certainly</b> been disastrous. By uniting their various and somewhat diverse product lines into a single company, Oliver Farm Equipment instantly became a virtual full-line manufacturer.|$|R
6000|$|It {{certainly}} was not nerve Wright showed; men of courage were seldom intolerant; and with the matchless nerve that characterized Steele or the great gunmen of the day there went a cool, unobtrusive manner, a speech brief, <b>almost</b> gentle, <b>certainly</b> courteous. Wright was a hot-headed Louisianian of French extraction; a man evidently {{who had never been}} crossed in anything, and who was strong, brutal, passionate, which qualities, {{in the face of a}} situation like this, made him simply a fool! ...|$|R
5|$|His {{subsequent}} {{involvement in}} a conference promoting adolescent sexuality caused the party to announce that {{it would no longer}} publish his material. In March 1933 Freud told him that his contract with the International Psychoanalytic Publishers to publish Character Analysis had been cancelled. Sharaf writes that this was <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> because of Reich's stance on teenage sex.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} Hutchinson {{massacre}} is not known. The first definitive {{record of}} the occurrence was in John Winthrop's journal, where {{it was the first}} entry made for the month of September, though not dated. It took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news, so the event <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> occurred in August 1643, and this is the date found in most sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean that}} you are in the British Secret Service? No?--Well! I don't profess to {{understand}} you English people, and you seem to me more incomprehensible than any I have known. Not that I ever believed that you were a mere tradesman. But what shall I say to M. le Comte de Cambray?" [...] he added, after a slight pause, during which a new and strange train of thought altered the expression of wonderment on his face, to one that was undefinable, <b>almost</b> furtive, <b>certainly</b> undecided.|$|R
6000|$|There can {{be little}} doubt that the rhymes in the first passage cited were intentional, and perhaps they were so in the others; but Milton's ear has tolerated not a few {{perfectly}} rhyming couplets, and others in which the assonance <b>almost</b> becomes rhyme, <b>certainly</b> a fault in blankverse:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{have seen}} one since I came out, {{and then we}} were at sea and were nearly wrecked. I saw its effects on land, however, for we spent some weeks ashore in {{consequence}} of it. The forest was <b>almost</b> levelled. I <b>certainly</b> should not care to see another one.” ...|$|R
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} {{is not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance from the Great Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to have supported Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E
60|$|Slowly Taurus Antinor {{turned to}} him, and Hortensius Martius {{appeared}} just then so like a naughty child, that {{the look of}} harshness died out of the praefect's eyes, and a smile <b>almost</b> of amusement, <b>certainly</b> of indulgence, lit up {{for a moment the}} habitual sternness of his face.|$|R
5000|$|The Treason Act 1541 (33 Hen.8 c.20) was an Act of the Parliament of England {{passed in}} 1542 (acts of Parliament were backdated {{to the year}} in which the session of Parliament had begun, rather than {{the year in which}} the Act was {{actually}} passed). It provided for the trial and punishment of lunatics for high treason. The reason given for passing the Act was given by the Act itself, which stated [...] "it is a thing <b>almost</b> impossible <b>certainly</b> to judge" [...] whether a defendant's madness was real or feigned.|$|R
50|$|DTPA is {{also used}} as a {{complexing}} agent for gadolinium in MRI contrast enhancement. The requirement {{in this case is}} that the complex be very strong, as Gd3+ is very toxic. The large stability constant of the octadentate ligand ensures that the concentration of free Gd3+ is <b>almost</b> negligible, <b>certainly</b> well below toxicity threshold. In addition the ligand occupies only 8 of the 9 coordination sites on the gadolinium ion. The ninth site is occupied by a water molecule which exchanges rapidly with the fluid surrounding it and it is this mechanism that makes the paramagnetic complex into a contrast reagent.|$|R
5|$|Because of {{the ticket}} {{reselling}} {{that occurred during the}} week after the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, Hawaii Senate President Donna Mercado Kim introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the Bruno Mars Act. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping. The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.|$|E
5|$|Caerphilly's water defences were <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{inspired}} by those at Kenilworth, where a similar set of artificial lakes and dams was created. Gilbert de Clare had fought at {{the siege of}} Kenilworth in 1266 and would have seen these at first hand. Caerphilly's water defences provided particular protection against mining, which could otherwise undermine castle walls during the period, and are considered the most advanced of their kind in Britain.|$|E
5|$|During the Bahia campaign, {{high-ranking}} officers mutinied against Labatut, who {{was taken}} prisoner and {{sent back to}} Rio de Janeiro. It is unlikely that Luís Alves was involved, but his uncle, Joaquim de Lima, was <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> part of the conspiracy and was chosen by the officers to replace Labatut. The campaign resumed, and the Portuguese withdrew from Salvador and set sail back to Portugal. On 2 July, the victorious Brazilians entered the city. The Emperor's Battalion returned to Rio de Janeiro, and Luís Alves was later promoted to captain on 22 January 1824.|$|E
60|$|It {{would place}} {{her in the}} same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; {{they would have to}} {{frequent}} the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families. This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, <b>almost</b> as <b>certainly</b> as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.|$|R
50|$|The {{probability}} level is about equally often specified as one minus {{the probability of}} a VaR break, so that the VaR in the example above would be called a one-day 95% VaR instead of one-day 5% VaR. This generally does not lead to confusion because the probability of VaR breaks is <b>almost</b> always small, <b>certainly</b> less than 50%.|$|R
60|$|It seemed {{strange that}} a man who had lived west of the Pecos for ten years could not see in Duane {{something}} which forbade that kind of talk. It certainly was not nerve Lawson showed; men of courage were seldom intolerant. With the matchless nerve that characterized the great gunmen of the day there was a cool, unobtrusive manner, a speech brief, <b>almost</b> gentle, <b>certainly</b> courteous. Lawson was a hot-headed Louisianian of French extraction; a man, evidently, who had never been crossed in anything, and who was strong, brutal, passionate, which qualities {{in the face of a}} situation like this made him simply a fool.|$|R
