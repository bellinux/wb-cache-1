5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts to control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war.

5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then {{the whole of the}} ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E

The earliest forms of English, a set of Anglo-Frisian dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are called Old English.

5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> World War I, {{and the most important}} development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the Siege of Boston, British authorities enlisted the assistance of a loyalist merchant, named Ichabod Jones, to aid in the acquisition of needed supplies. Two of Jones' merchant ships arrived in Machias on June 2, 1775, accompanied by a British armed sloop called the Margaretta (sometimes also spelled Margueritta or Marguerite) that was commanded by Midshipman James Moore. The townspeople of Machias disapproved of Jones' intentions and arrested him. They also tried to arrest Moore, but he escaped through the harbor. The townspeople seized one of Jones' ships, armed it alongside a second local ship, and sailed out to meet Moore. After a short confrontation, Moore was fatally wounded, and his vessel and crew were captured.|$|E

5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting inside one casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>start</b> <b>of</b> his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
