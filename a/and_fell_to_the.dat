5|$|The club's {{first major}} title {{came in the}} 1950–51 season. After {{finishing}} fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won 18 of their 30 league games and clinched the league championship. The team also ended the campaign having scored the most goals and conceded the least. The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the rankings. Success returned in 1953–54 when, after a last place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers secured their second English League title by one point over Streatham.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was commissioned}} in 2003; construction overran {{and the official}} unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005. Six days before the launch, the sculpture suffered {{the first of three}} visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Legal action started a year later, resulting in an out-of-court settlement totalling £1.7 million.|$|E
5|$|During the series, Barnett {{made two}} notable errors. With Australia leading the series 10 {{going into the}} Fifth Test at The Oval, Barnett dropped Len Hutton and Maurice Leyland when both were on 40. Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461runs as they set a world record score of 7/903. Bradman injured himself during the {{marathon}} innings in a rare stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With opener Jack Fingleton also injured, Australia were down to nine men <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heaviest defeat in Test history (an innings and 579 runs) and the series was drawn.|$|E

5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens {{played the}} Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz {{went after the}} puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ice, {{crashing}} into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz's left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where {{it was found that}} his leg was fractured in four places.|$|E
5|$|A {{flock of}} birds {{encountered}} the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds were killed <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40years. The hurricane produced 80mph (130km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state. It {{was one of only}} two storms on record to produce such winds in the state. Three barges and a steamer capsized in the Delaware Bay, while onshore, the winds of the hurricane destroyed the roofs of four houses in Laurel. The winds downed many trees and destroyed several chimneys near Lewes. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, winds reached , which damaged telegraph and phone lines, knocked down several trees, and damaged the roof of Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello and Michael Schumacher {{started to}} {{maintain}} the gap between themselves and Montoya, and started {{to pull away from}} Ralf Schumacher. Bernoldi passed Villeneuve for tenth position on lap two, while Irvine dropped to ninth one lap later after he was overtaken by Verstappen and Räikkönen. He later fell behind Alesi, Bernoldi and Villeneuve on the fourth lap. Button's engine failed which caused him to retire on lap five. Irvine lost a further three positions to Häkkinen, Panis and Frentzen one lap later. Coulthard became the third retirement of the Grand Prix after an engine failure on lap seven, which meant Verstappen inherited fifth and Räikkönen moved into sixth. Montoya had a blister on one of his rear tyres which caused him to slide under braking, and was slow exiting the Variante della Roggia chicane which allowed Barrichello to take the lead on the ninth lap. Three laps later, Alesi passed Räikkönen for sixth while Häkkinen moved into tenth after passing Bernoldi on lap 13. Irvine retired on lap 14 because he lost horsepower in his car when a cylinder in his engine stopped working. Verstappen fell to seventh after he was passed by Alesi and Räikkönen on lap 16. Yoong spun at Curva di Lesmo <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the field.|$|E
5|$|Dyer was {{a popular}} choice with boxing promoters, helped {{by the fact that}} after each bout he would sing Thora, a popular hit of the day to the audience. His careers as a pugilist and {{baritone}} earned him the nickname, 'The Singing Boxer'. His first few bouts were all held in south Wales, but by the autumn of 1910 he was travelling to England to fight, and on 10 October 1910 he was invited to fight at the National Sporting Club in Covent Garden, London. On 15 May 1911 Dyer was scheduled to fight Dick Emden at The Ring in Blackfriars, London. To date, Dyer had recorded over 15 bouts and was unbeaten but the fight with Emden ended in defeat and affected his future boxing career. Dyer was easily ahead in the bout, when in the fifth round he dislocated his knee <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canvas in agony. Emden, who taunted the fallen Dyer, was given the victory and Dyer would not fight for another six months. The injury to his right knee plagued Dyer throughout his entire boxing career, and also stopped him serving in the armed forces during the First World War. After the injury, Dyer always fought with a protector strapped around his knee, and was forced to change his fighting style. He would always stand on the toes of his right foot, as a quick back step could possibly dislocate his knee again. His return bout in November 1911 was a win against Young Lilley at The Ring, but this was again followed by a long absence. Dyer did not fight again until 1 June 1912.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} entered the amateur scene Cochet won every {{possible}} major tournament of the era. In February 1922 he traveled to the World Covered Court Championships in Saint Moritz in Switzerland where he defeated Borotra in a five-set final and formed a team with him to gain the doubles trophy against Jacques Brugnon and Marcel Dupont. He clinched a triple crown feat at the 1922 World Hard Court Championships in Brussels defeating Count Manuel de Gomar in the singles final and triumphing in the doubles events, partnering Jean Borotra and Suzanne Lenglen respectively. After his success abroad Cochet claimed the French Closed Championships by defeating defending champion Jean Samazeuilh in the final. Afterwards Cochet topped the French rankings. In June 1922 he debuted in the French Davis Cup team against Denmark and won both his singles and the doubles match. In the next round the team only composed of him and André Gobert <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Australasian team. Cochet also found moderate success in the minor tournaments; at the South of France Championships he lost to Russian Count Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston. At the Côte d'Azur Championships Cochet warded off the Englishman Morgan for his first Riviera title.|$|E

5|$|The race's first caution was necessitated on {{the same}} lap when Papis spun on the frontstretch, and slid {{backwards}} towards the first corner before getting his car facing in the racing direction. Vasser made contact with Tora Takagi who was sent into the frontstretch barrier. Bruno Junqueira and Memo Gidley spun in avoidance; the latter regained control of his car while Junqueira collided with the outside wall, causing him to become the race's first retirement. Max Wilson spun while gaining optimum tyre temperature <b>and</b> <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear of the field. The race restarted on the ninth lap with de Ferran leading Bräck and Andretti. Bräck was held up by Wilson on the 23rd lap allowing de Ferran to establish a two-second lead over him. Wilson received a warning from the series' race control. Castroneves was passed by Franchitti for the fourth position seven laps later. Christian Fittipaldi attempted to lap Gidley on lap 37, but the latter drove defensively causing Fittipaldi to reduce his speed, and he was overtaken by Vasser, Adrián Fernández, and Carpentier.|$|E
