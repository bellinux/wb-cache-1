40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{develop a}} {{simulation}} model {{to examine the}} effects of clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> on prevalence rates and smoking attributable deaths.  METHODS—Based on empirical and theoretical research, the effects of clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> are modelled by type of law. The model considers clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> at the state levels between 1993  and 2000, and projects the number of smokers and smoking attributable deaths in the USA under different scenarios from 2000  onward.  RESULTS—The model predicts that comprehensive clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> have the potential to reduce substantially the number of smokers and smoking attributable deaths, and these effects are predicted to grow over time. The predicted impact of new worksite laws are reduced when previously implemented private and public worksite restrictions are taken into account.  CONCLUSIONS—Clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> have the ability to reduce smoking rates substantially and save lives, but their impact is likely to depend on their comprehensiveness and prior private worksite restrictions in place.    Keywords: policy; clean indoor air laws; prevalence rates; smoking attributable death...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} effect of clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> on smoking. Public place clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> {{restrict}} cigarette smoking in public places such as restaurants. Private place clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> regulate smoking in private work places {{as well as in}} public places. This study uses a time series of cross sections of the 50 states of the United States and Washington, D. C., from 1975 through 1985, to estimate single equation and simultaneous equation models of cigarette demand. The single equation results indicate that both the public place law and the private work place law {{have a negative effect on}} cigarette demand. However, a test for endogeneity shows that the enactment of clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> is a function of cigarette demand. Results from a simultaneous equations model indicate that the public place law has a significant negative impact on cigarette demand, while the work place law has no effect on cigarette demand. Although these results demonstrate that only states with low levels of smoking have passed work place clean <b>air</b> <b>laws,</b> the results do not imply that the level of smoking would not decrease if such a law were imposed in all states.

40|$|Objective. To {{examine whether}} {{comprehensive}} smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> enacted in Florida, New York, and Oregon {{are associated with}} reductions in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and stroke. Methods. Analyzed trends in county-level, age-adjusted, hospital admission rates for AMI and stroke from 1990 to 2006 (quarterly) for Florida, 1995 to 2006 (monthly) for New York, and 1998 to 2006 (monthly) for Oregon to identify any association between admission rates and passage of comprehensive smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws.</b> Interrupted time series {{analysis was used to}} adjust for the effects of preexisting moderate local-level laws, seasonal variation in hospital admissions, differences across counties, and a secular time trend. Results. More than 3 years after passage of statewide comprehensive smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws,</b> rates of hospitalization for AMI were reduced by 18. 4 % (95 % CI: 8. 8 – 28. 0 %) in Florida and 15. 5 % (95 % CI: 11. 0 – 20. 1 %) in New York. Rates of hospitalization for stroke were reduced by 18. 1 % (95 % CI: 9. 3 – 30. 0 %) in Florida. The few local comprehensive laws in Oregon were not associated with reductions in AMI or stroke statewide. Conclusion. Comprehensive smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> are an effective policy tool for reducing the burden of AMI and stroke...|$|R
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to review the research {{on the effects of}} public clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> on smoking rates, compare these effects to those found in studies on the impact of private worksite restrictions and derive estimates of the poten-tial reductions in smoking rates that might be expected from the implementation of the two types of policies. Data sources were computer-ized databases, references identi®ed from per-tinent peer-reviewed journal articles and books, and suggestions by experts on tobacco control policy. Comprehensive public clean <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> have the potential to reduce prevalence and consumption rates of the entire population (including non-working and non-indoor work-ing smokers) by about 10 %. Studies on private worksite regulations also suggest that strong worksite restrictions have the potential to reduce the prevalence rate of the entire popula-tion by about 6 % over the long-term and the quantity smoked by continuing smokers by 2 ± 8 %, depending on the length of time after the ban. Further research is needed on the effects of the different types of public clean air policies on the entire smoking population and on differ-ent sociodemographic groups, how the effects of public clean indoor <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> depend on pri-vate restrictions already in place, and how the effect of private restrictions depend on {{whether or not they are}} supported by public clean <b>air</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of cigarette prices and smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> on adult smoking. Probit methods and a generalized linear model with log-link and Gaussian distribution are employed to model adult smoking propensity and intensity, respectively. After controlling for unobserved state-level heterogeneity, which can influence both tobacco policy and smoking behavior, the estimates from this study imply that an inverse relationship exists between cigarette prices and both smoking prevalence and average cigarette consumption by adult smokers. The estimates also imply that more restrictive smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> decrease average smoking by adult smokers but have little impact on prevalence.

40|$|Background: While {{previous}} studies have demonstrated the efficacy of tobacco control interventions in reducing tobacco use among youth overall, there have been very few studies that examine the potential differential impact of tobacco control policies on various youth subgroups, defined by socio-economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, and gender. Objective: We {{examined the relationship between}} state-level cigarette prices and smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> and youth smoking prevalence and intensity for various youth sub-populations in the United States. Methods: We estimated a 2 -part model of cigarette demand using data from the 1991 through 2010 nationally representative surveys of 8 th-, 10 th-, and 12 th-grade students as part of the Monitoring the Future project. Findings: We found that real cigarette prices are strong determinants of youth smoking. Blacks, females, Hispanics, and low-SES subpopulations are found to have a larger price response with respect to smoking prevalence than the full sample. Smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> are found to {{have a negative effect on}} smoking prevalence for the full sample and for the male, white, and high-SES sub-populations. Conclusions: This research concludes that higher cigarette prices will reduce smoking prevalence rates of Blacks, Hispanics, females, and low-SES subpopulations faster than the overall youth population and other youth sub-populations. Moreover, this research concludes that smoke-free <b>air</b> <b>laws</b> will reduce smoking prevalence for the overall youth population with the largest reductions in high SES and male subpopulations...|$|R
