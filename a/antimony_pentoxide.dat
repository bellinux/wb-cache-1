50|$|<b>Antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Sb2O5) is a {{chemical}} compound of antimony and oxygen. It always occurs in hydrated form, Sb2O5·nH2O. It contains antimony in the +5 oxidation state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> has {{the same}} {{structure}} as the B form of niobium pentoxide and {{can be derived from}} the rutile structure, with antimony coordinated by six oxygens in a distorted octahedral arrangement. The SbO6 octahedra are corner- and edge-sharing.|$|E
5000|$|Antimony {{trioxide}} {{is formed}} when antimony is burnt in air. In the gas phase, the molecule {{of the compound}} is , but it polymerizes upon condensing. <b>Antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (...) can be formed only by oxidation with concentrated nitric acid. Antimony also forms a mixed-valence oxide, antimony tetroxide (...) , which features both Sb(III) and Sb(V). Unlike oxides of phosphorus and arsenic, these oxides are amphoteric, do not form well-defined oxoacids, and react with acids to form antimony salts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} {{consists of}} tetrahedral {AsO4} and octahedral {AsO6} centers linked by sharing corners. [...] The structure {{differs from that}} of the corresponding phosphorus(V) oxide; as a result, although there is still a solid solution with that oxide, it only progresses to the equimolar point, at which point phosphorus has substituted for arsenic in all of its tetrahedral sites. Likewise, arsenic pentoxide can also dissolve up to an equimolar amount of <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> as antimony substitutes for arsenic only in its octahedral sites.|$|E
5000|$|In {{chemistry}} an antimonate is {{a compound}} which contains a metallic element, oxygen and antimony in an oxidation state of +5. These compounds {{can be considered}} to be salts of the hypothetical antimonic acid H3SbO4, or combinations of metal oxides and <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide,</b> Sb2O5. Historically these compounds were assumed to be analogous to the phosphates and formulas such as LiSbO3·3H2O and Na2H2Sb2O7·5H2O were used and the compounds described as hydrated meta-antimonates and pyro-antimonates. LiSbO3·3H2O is now known to be LiSb(OH)6 and contain the [...] anion and that Na2H2Sb2O7·5H2O is actually NaSb(OH)6.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} find an {{efficient}} way to recover Sb from the SbCl 5 acid solution obtained by the chloride leaching process of the tin-depleted residue. Sb was recovered in the form of hydrated <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> through the hydrolysis process. The effects of hydrolysis ratio and aging time on the Sb recovery process were studied, and the corresponding trends were established. The experimental results show that the amount of the antimony free ions increases with the hydrolysis ratio and aging time. This decreases the concentration quotient of the hydrolysis reaction and thus facilitates the reaction. Product crys-tallinity is affected by the solution supersaturation, which varies at different stages with aging time. As a result, the optimal conditions of recovering Sb correspond to the hydrolysis ratio of 1. 5 and aging time of 7 days with the recovery rate of 97 %...|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{has been}} removed from each of the three Hanford waste simulants with Hydrated <b>Antimony</b> <b>Pentoxide</b> (HAP) to {{facilitate}} technetium measurement by ICP-MS. Technetium was successfully measured in simulants A and B with small dilutions of the simulants (10 x). Matrix interference, probably due to organic components, prevented the accurate measurement of Tc in simulant C. HAP has been used for the selective removal of sodium from samples prior to radiochemical analysis. 1 - 4 The analytical development section of SRTC has successfully used HAP to remove sodium from a simulated sample matrix of a SRS waste tank. 5 This sample pretreatment method eliminated signal suppression caused by the 5 molar sodium matrix without affecting the concentration of Pt, Ru, and Re as measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). With this initial success, we decided to investigate the use of HAP to remove sodium from the three Hanford waste matrices prior to ICP-MS analysis of technetium. The results of this investigation are summarized in this report...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Chlorendic acid-based and tetrabromophthalate polyesters {{are major}} {{flame-retardant}} polyester resins, often used with antimony trioxide. For translucency, colloidal <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> is preferred. Brominated diols are occasionally used. In the vinyl ester group, the adducts of acrylic or methacrylic acid with the diglycidyl ether of tetrabromobisphenol A are prodominant, and the styrene-cured resins often have advantageous physical properties and hydrolytic stability. Low styrene versions have air pollution advantages. Hydrated mineral fillers, notably ATH, {{are widely used}} at high loadings. ATH tend to reduce smoke, as does use of MMA instead of styrene. Oligourethane unsaturated resins, cured with MMA, also favor low smoke. Triethyl phosphate and dimethyl methylphosphonate enable viscosity reduc-tion and enhance flame retardancy. Red phosphorus, ammonium polyphosphate and a char-forming organophosphate have also found niches. Phosphorus-containing reactives have been largely unsuccessful. In situ melamine phosphate shows promise. Protective veils offer an alternative to flame retarding the resin itself.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of a panel of seven nanomaterials (NMs), namely: a-alumina, g-alumina, precipitated silica; silica fume, calcined silica fume, colloidal <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Sb 2 O 5), and superfine amorphous ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3), on sediment dwelling invertebrates Chironomus tentans under controlled laboratory conditions. Percentage survival, enzyme activities, growth development, and DNA fragmentation parameters were studied as acute, biochemical, and physiological toxicities of NMs, respectively. Quantitation of catalase and peroxidase enzyme activity demonstrated that toxicant stress of the NMs increased enzyme activity in a concentration dependent fashion across all treatments. The percentage growth length of the test specimens exposed to different NMs was significantly reduced compared to the negative control while only five concentrations were not in the toxic range, namely; Fe 2 O 3 (5 mg/kg); silica fume (5 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg); Sb 2 O 5 (5 mg/kg) and calcined silica fume (5 mg/kg). Genotoxic stress assessed by use of DNA laddering showed complementary findings to the other ecotoxicological endpoints tested in this study—the percentage survival and growth length inhibition.

40|$|D. Sc. The ion {{exchange}} properties {{of a number}} of synthetic inorganic {{ion exchange}}rs and the natural zeolite, clinoptilolite, were evaluated with respect to the elements Na, Cs, Sr, Ba, Ce(III), Eu, Zr, U(VI), Np(V), PU(IV) and Am(III). The role of the structure of crystalline exchangers in determining the selectivity thereof, {{especially in the case of}} clinoptilolite, was also investigated. Hydrated <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> and antimonic acid showed high sorption {{of a number of}} ions over a wide pH range (2 - 10). The selectivity order of hydrous oxides for the actinides was as follows: PU(IV) > Am(III) > U(VI) > Np(V). Titanium phosphate, zirconium phosphosilicate and sodium titanate, however, preferred U to Am. To predict the selectivity order of crystalline inorganic ion exchangers, the Eisenman theory could be used, but other factors such as ion sieve effects had to be taken into account. In such cases the parameters contributing to the change in free energy during ion exchange plays a major role. Samples containing clinootilolite from two deposits in South Africa were evaluated with respect to chemical composition, conversion to the sodium, calcium and cesium forms, as well as the sorption of Cs and Sr from various media. Similar trends to those:reported for clinoptilolite from other parts of the world were found. Rietveld refinement of the structure of Cs-exchanged clinoptilolite was carried out using powder diffraction data and the computer program WYRIET. The zeolite was not isolated from the natural matrix, which meant that a number of phases had to be included in the refinement process. The refinement confirmed the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{considered}} bismuth (III) oxide (Bi 2 O 3) and antimony hexitatridecoxide (Sb 6 O 13) {{as potential}} substitutes {{for the red}} lead (Pb 3 O 4) and barium sulphate (BaSO 4) oxidants currently used in time delay compositions for detonator assemblies. Fine silicon powders with a specific surface area of 2 - 10 m 2 /g were used as fuels. Some experiments were also done with a coarse manganese powder as fuel. Bi 2 O 3 was synthesised by the thermal decomposition of (BiO) 2 CO 3 by heating at 460 °C for 15 hours. The yield was near quantitative, ie. close to the 91, 4 % expected based on the complete conversion of the carbonate to the oxide. Sb 6 O 13 was obtained by heating colloidal <b>antimony</b> <b>pentoxide</b> (Sb 2 O 5) for 8 hours at 315 °C. This resulted in a ca. 20 % mass loss and yielded a reactive black powder. In the Si-Bi 2 O 3 system, compositions in the range 5 - 40 % by mass Si were ignitable with shock tubing. Burn rates measured in lead tubes varied between 15 and 155 mm/s. This highest burn rate was obtained with 20 % silicon. Addition of additives such as KMnO 4 and boric oxide {{had little effect on}} the burn rate. The fast burning Si-Bi 2 O 3 system is a potential replacement for the commercial Si - red lead system. The burning rate decreased with increasing compaction of the samples. Burn rate also decreased when the aluminium instead of lead tubes were used. This is attributed to a greater heat loss with the former. The combustion products were characterised using DTA, FT-IR, XRD and SEM. The results show that the combustion reactions led to reduction of the oxidant to the corresponding metal form. The Sb 6 O 13 -Si system requires an initiating composition such as Bi 2 O 3 - 50 %Si (Type 4). It is slow burning and thus a possible replacement for the commercial BaS 04 -Si system. The lowest sustainable and reproducible burn rate, in the absence of additives, was 4, 8 mm/s. It was achieved using 10 % silicon Type 4. Adding small amounts of fumed silica < 2 %) increased the burn rate. This is attributed to better mixing and compaction. However, lower burn rates (~ 2 mm/s) are possible if more fumed silica is added as inert diluent. Replacing the silicon fuel with manganese powder gave more exothermic and even slower burning compositions. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.
