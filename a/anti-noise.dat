A 2000 consultation by the government re-iterated its policy that generally, local issues arising from airport operations are best addressed locally. To support this the Civil Aviation Act was extended in 2006 to give all airports the authority to mandate measures to address noise and air quality issues beyond their boundaries, and to impose financial penalties on aircraft which fail or are unable to adhere to such measures.

[...] The largest airports also implement voluntary schemes to assist local communities in coping with the local impacts of airport operations. Birmingham International Airport, for example, has been operating a sound insulation scheme since 1978, in which 7,600 properties are eligible for sound proof glazing paid for by the airport. Schemes are also available to residents most affected by noise around Heathrow, designed to protect property prices ahead of any development of a third runway, assist with relocation costs for people who wish to move, and provide sound insulation for private and communal property currently affected by noise. In both cases local residents have also set up campaign groups; Birmingham Airport <b>anti-Noise</b> Group, and HACAN Clearskies at Heathrow, to represent themselves over local environmental issues arising from airport operations. Even the smallest of airports engaged in air transport operations; Gloucestershire Airport, has attracted organised opposition to its plans to extend the main runway there, and the umbrella group AirportWatch lists over 20 local airport campaign groups.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} a new {{approach}} to active noise cancellation. Theoretically, we use a 180 degree phase shift of the noise, i. e. generate an <b>anti-noise,</b> to cancel the original signal. Here, we have designed FIR filter which is driven by the input signal and has the noise signal as the feedback, and output of which is the required result. The active noise control system contains an electro-acoustic device that cancels the unwanted audio signal by generating an <b>anti-noise</b> of equal amplitude and opposite phase. The original, unwanted sound and the <b>anti-noise</b> combine acoustically, resulting in the cancellation of both sounds. The effectiveness of cancellation of the unwanted signal depends on the accuracy of the amplitude and phase of the generated <b>anti-noise.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In active {{noise control}} systems sound waves with phase {{opposite}} to the unwanted noise are used to interfere destructively with the noise, generating quite zones, where the noise level is lower. Since most systems use point sensors like microphones to sense the noise field the quiet zone generated by system can be small. Outside the quite zones amplification of the noise may happen. In narrow band {{active noise control}} systems the dimension of the quite zone around each error sensor will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise being cancelled. In broadband active noise control systems several error sensors per <b>anti-noise</b> source are used (two {{as a rule of}} thumb) in order to achieve wider cancellations regions, but the fact still remains that the size of the quiet zone will be proportional to the wavelength of the noise. Actually using two microphones per <b>anti-noise</b> source makes the controller adapt in to a band limiting filter in order to prevent the generation of <b>anti-noise</b> with frequencies that are amplified inside the quite zone. In this paper, techniques to band limit the <b>anti-noise</b> are studied that do not need the extra number of error sensors. This extends previous work for the single channel case to the multi-channel case with several reference, error sensors and <b>anti-noise</b> sources. This can’t be done by simpling placing a filter in the cancellation path, or using the anti-aliasing or reconstruction filters, unless you use a very sharp filter with long delay and a leakage factor. Instead several structures based on the MFx-LMS algorithm are presented that accomplish this task. The proposed structures also give some insight into the limitations of broadband active noise control systems due to the delay required to the band limiting actio...|$|E
