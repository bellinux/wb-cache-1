40|$|Mass Customization (MC) is not {{a mature}} {{business}} strategy and hence {{it is not clear}} that a single or small group of operational models are dominating. Companies tend to approach MC from either a mass production or a customization origin and this in itself gives reason to believe that several operational models will be observable. This paper reviews actual and theoretical fulfilment systems that enterprises could apply when offering <b>a</b> <b>pre-engineered</b> catalogue of customizable products and options. Issues considered are: How product flows are structured in relation to processes, inventories and decoupling point(s); - Characteristics of the OF process that inhibit or facilitate fulfilment; - The logic of how products are allocated to customers; - Customer factors that influence OF process design and operation. Diversity in the order fulfilment structures is expected and is found in the literature. The review has identified four structural forms that have been used in a Catalogue MC context: - fulfilment from stock; - fulfilment from a single fixed decoupling point; - fulfilment from one of several fixed decoupling points; - fulfilment from several locations, with floating decoupling points. From the review it is apparent that producers are being imaginative in coping with the demands of high variety, high volume, customization and short lead times. These demands have encouraged the relationship between product, process and customer to be re-examined. Not only has this strengthened interest in commonality and postponement, but, as is reported in the paper, has led to the re-engineering of the order fulfilment process to create models with multiple fixed decoupling points and the floating decoupling point syste...|$|R
40|$|This plan {{describes}} the performance standards met and closure activities conducted to achieve clean {{closure of the}} 2401 -W Waste Storage Building (2401 -W) (Figure I). In August 1998, after the last waste container was removed from 2401 -W, the U. S. Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) notified Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) in writing that the 2401 -W would no longer receive waste and would be closed as a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976 treatment, storage, and/or disposal (TSD) unit (98 -EAP- 475). Pursuant to this notification, closure activities were conducted, as described in this plan, in accordance with Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303 - 610 and completed on February 9, 1999. Ecology witnessed the closure activities. Consistent with clean closure, no postclosure activities will be necessary.

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). We {{introduce}} an efficient scheme for quantum state transfer that uses a parity-based mirror inversion technique. We design efficient circuits for implementing mirror inversion in Ising sigma(X) sigma(X) and sigma(Y) sigma(Y) coupled systems and show how to analytically solve for system parameters to implement the operation in these systems. The key feature of our scheme is a three-qubit parity gate, which we design as a two-control one-target qubit gate. The parity gate operation is implemented by only varying a single control parameter of the system Hamiltonian {{and the difficulty of}} implementing this gate is equivalent to that of a controlled-NOT gate in a two-qubit system. By applying a sequence of N + 1 parity-based controlled-unitary operations between nearest-neighbor qubits, where all qubits in an N-qubit chain function either as controls or targets, we are able to reverse the order of all qubits along the array. These operations are accomplished by varying only a single control parameter per data qubit. The control parameter depends on the physical system under consideration and on the choice of the designer. Since every qubit participates in the mirror-inversion process functioning either as a control or target, all nearest-neighbor couplings are used. Therefore, we do not need additional measures to cancel the effect of any unwanted interactions and the quantum cost of our scheme does not increase in systems that do not have the ability shut off couplings. Moreover, our scheme does not require additional ancillas, nor does it use <b>a</b> <b>pre-engineered</b> mirror-periodic Hamiltonian to govern the evolution of the system. Using our mirror inversion scheme, we also show how to implement a SWAP gate between two arbitrary remote qubits, move a block of qubits, and implement efficient computing between two remote qubits in nearest-neighbor layouts.

40|$|In North America, the {{operation}} of buildings accounts for approximately {{one third of the}} total energy use and greenhouse gas emissions annually. Office buildings are responsible for roughly 35 % of the total commercial/institutional secondary energy use in Canada, followed by retail buildings at 17 % (NRCan, OEE, 2010). In recent years, a number of researchers from around the world have conducted life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies to investigate the impacts of buildings on the environment. Most studies have focused on three types of buildings: office buildings, single residential dwellings, and multi-unit residential apartments. There have been almost no comprehensive LCA studies of retail buildings, specifically single-storey retail buildings. This is a problem, since compared to office buildings, single residential dwellings, and multi-unit residential apartments, retail buildings consume approximately 1. 2, 2. 0, and 2. 3 times more energy per floor area respectively (NRCan, OEE, 2010). In addition, retail buildings usually undergo major resource intensive renovations far sooner than other building types. Therefore, the primary goal {{of this study was to}} conduct a comprehensive LCA for the components of a single-storey retail building located in Toronto, Canada, to determine which building components contribute the most towards the total life-cycle energy use and global warming potential (GWP) after 50 years. Using the latest LCA techniques, the total life-cycle energy use and GWP was calculated for 220 different building components including: exterior infill walls, roofs, structural systems, floors, windows, doors, foundations, and interior partition walls. Also, a comprehensive LCA study was conducted for five single-storey retail buildings (including <b>a</b> <b>pre-engineered</b> steel building system which is lacking in the literature), in order to determine which components of a single-storey retail building are responsible for the most environmental damage. For a typical single-storey retail building located in Toronto, Canada, the operating energy (and GWP) accounts for about 91 % (88 %) and the total embodied energy (and GWP) accounts for about 9 % (12 %) of the total energy (and GWP) after 50 years. The roof alone is responsible for nearly half of the total embodied energy and GWP of the entire building. The LCA study also found that after 50 years, the total energy (and GWP) of the five case study buildings only differed at most by 6 % (7 %), regardless of the choice of structural system, or whether the building was made predominately of steel or wood building components. This thesis concludes with a prioritized list of recommendations for reducing the total life-cycle energy use and GWP of a single-storey retail building in Canada...|$|R

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) Complexes perform {{numerous}} {{hazardous material}} handling operations {{within the confines}} of a glovebox. The DOE is continuing to seek more efficient and safer means of handling these materials inside gloveboxes rather than the conventional, labor-intensive method through lead lined gloves. The use of glovebox automation technology will also be critical to the DOE in its efforts to comply with its mandated ALARA principles in handling the hazardous materials associated with the cleanup process. Operations associated with materials processing in a glovebox are similar to many industrial tasks, but the unique glovebox environment and Plutonium material properties create a unique set of challenges for conventional automation machinery. Such properties include: Low to moderate levels of ionizing radiation, high abrasiveness, corrosiveness, pyrophoric tendencies, rapid dispersal and permeation of environment, diffuses quickly, and possible incompatible material interaction. The glovebox presents the following challenges: existing gloveboxes may not be readily altered or even modified at all, complex mechanical operations for maintenance and repair are difficult or impossible through gloves, failed equipment may not be removed easily or at all. If a broken piece of equipment cannot be bagged-out through a glove port (approximately 216 mm (8 1 / 2 inch) diameter) it must remain in place. Broken equipment obstructs further operations. If it renders the entire glovebox unusable, a significant volume of waste is generated and an expensive system must be disposed of and replaced. A moderate sized glovebox alone costs between $ 250, 000 and $ 500, 000 and an equipment malfunction, which penetrates the glovebox and exposes the room to Plutonium or other toxic materials, is catastrophic. In addition to the human exposure issues, cleanup can easily run into the millions of dollars. A solution to the issues described above is ARM Automation Inc. 's (ARM) modular robotic manipulator technology developed for DOE EM operations, which addresses many of the issues discussed in the previous section. This manipulator system has the capability of custom configurations, which accommodate common glovebox tasks such as materials repackaging. The modular nature and quick connects of this system simplify installations into ''hot'' boxes and any potential modifications or repair therein. In the field of automation and robotics, a very common element is one used to generate motion for precise positioning of loads. One example of such an automation component would be an individual joint within an industrial robotic manipulator. This component consists of a tightly integrated package containing an electric motor, gear train, output support bearings, position sensors, brake, servo-amplifier and communications controller. Within the context of this paper, this key building block is referred to as an actuator module. With regard {{to the needs of the}} EM, [8] and [9] have shown that while each focus area has unique requirements for robotic automation at a system or manipulator level, their requirements at the actuator level are very similar. Thereby, a modular approach to automation which utilizes a small set of versatile actuator modules can be used to construct a broad range of robotic systems and automation cells suited to EM applications. By providing <b>a</b> <b>pre-engineered,</b> pre-integrated motion system to different robotics users within the DOE, new automation systems can be more quickly created without extensive expertise in motion control or the expense of building custom equipment...|$|R
40|$|Cooling equipment, whether used to meet {{air-conditioning}} {{or process}} cooling loads, represents a large consumer of energy. Even {{more to the}} point, cooling loads and the associated cooling equipment energy consumption tend to be at maximum levels during periods of high ambient air temperatures. It is precisely at those times that the general demand for energy is at its peak and therefore the price or value of energy is also at its highest level. Cooling loads often drive the peak electric power demand of energy users and thus affect not only the level of consumption of high cost energy, but also affect the peak power demand. Together, the energy and demand costs equate to very high unit costs for operating cooling equipment. Accordingly, it is of interest to minimize cooling energy use and costs by maximizing the energy efficiency of cooling equipment installations. A relatively new approach has been developed and is being increasingly used to maximize chiller plant efficiency. The approach {{involves the use of}} <b>a</b> standardized, <b>pre-engineered,</b> shop-fabricated approach to entire chiller plant installations. Compared to the traditional, piece-meal approach to chiller plants that utilize individual component specification, procurement and installation, the "packaged" or modular chiller plant approach often delivers substantially improved energy efficiencies. Also, the packaged plant approach achieves further benefits for large cooling system owners and operators. These additional benefits include: 1) dramatic reductions in unit capital costs of installed chiller plant capacity on a dollar per ton basis, 2) marked improvements in total procurement and installation schedules, 3) significantly smaller space requirements, and 4) enhanced control over total system quality and performance. The capacities and performance characteristics of available chiller plant modules are described, including both electric and non-electric chiller technologies. Examples are presented to illustrate the typical sizes and locations of actual installations as well as the growth and extent of the use of this technology to-date. Case studies document the energy efficiency improvements, cost reductions in both operating and capital costs, and improvements in schedule and space utilization, of the packaged chiller plant approach relative to the traditional chiller plant approach...|$|R
40|$|The fashion {{market is}} characterised by short life cycles, low predictability, and high impulse purchasing. In order {{to respond to}} these characteristics, {{companies}} are constantly introducing new collections and models. There are now so many new models introduced that the seasons have been erased {{and the leader of}} fast fashion, Zara, introduces 211 new models each week. Not all of these garments are sold at full price—the sell-through factor in fashion, which indicates how many of the total SKUs are sold at full price, is approximately 65 percent. One of the reasons why so much must be sold at a reduced price is that the fashion companies might have created a new buying behaviour among their customers by offering everything quickly. This new buying behaviour cannot be answered with traditional supply-chain management. Knit-on-Demand is a research project in the Swedish School of Textiles. The objective of the project is to demonstrate a production method for knitwear that may strongly influence the ability of the fashion industry to meet new demands for agility in customer relations. It will also provide insight and transparency in the total cost picture related to logistics and supply chain management, which leads to improved decision support in outsourcing and off-shoring strategies and may contribute to increased local fashion production. Knit-on-Demand differs from traditional garment manufacturing since nothing is produced to forecast and everything is produced to order from the end customer. Together with Ivanhoe AB, a producer of knitwear, and SOMconcept, a tailored fashion retailer, the idea of on-demand knitting has developed into a business concept where the customer is allowed to design their own garments. The customer chooses his or her fit, colour and model, places an order, and one week later the garment is delivered. The customer is not completely free in his or her design because the quality and lead-times of the production processes have to be guaranteed. Therefore, the process is really more <b>a</b> configuration of <b>pre-engineered</b> modules. The methods used are case studies with some action research as the researchers have taken {{an active role in the}} development of the project. Mass customisation as a concept and on-demand business have great potential to decrease wasteful overproduction of garments and benefit the customer, company, and society: The customer receives a garment that better fits his or her needs, the company is able to meet customer demand more accurately, and society does not have to pay for overproduction...|$|R
