40|$|QuestionDuring {{isometric}} shoulder adduction {{in normal}} subjects, do the rotator cuff muscles activate {{more than other}} shoulder muscles? Are the activation patterns influenced by shoulder abduction angle or load?DesignA within-participant, repeated measures experimental study. Participants 15 healthy adults. InterventionParticipants performed an isometric adduction exercise at 30 °, 60 °, and 90 ° abduction in the scapular plane and at 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % load. Outcome measuresDuring the exercises, a combination of indwelling and surface electromyographic recordings were taken from 11 shoulder muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, pectoralis major, teres major, latissimus dorsi, rhomboid major, serratus anterior, lower trapezius, upper trapezius, and deltoid. ResultsAt 100 % load, mean rotator cuff <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were low (supraspinatus at 3 % of its maximum voluntary contraction, infraspinatus 27 %, and subscapularis 27 %) and significantly less than the <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> of rhomboid major (81 %), latissimus dorsi (103 %), and teres major (76 %) (F 10, 140 = 15. 5, p 0. 89). Among the muscles activated above minimum levels (> 10 % of maximum voluntary contraction), mean <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> increased as load increased (F 3, 42 = 72. 0, p < 0. 01) ConclusionSince isometric adduction in normal subjects does not produce moderate to high <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> {{in any of the}} rotator cuff muscles tested, these results do not support the use of shoulder adduction to identify rotator cuff muscle dysfunction or strengthen the rotator cuff muscles...|$|R

Better understanding of workplace muscle activity levels would aid in indicating which muscles {{may be at}} risk for over-exertion and injury. However, electromyography collection in the workplace is often not practical. Therefore, a set of equations was developed and validated using data from two separate days to predict forearm muscle activity (involving six wrist and finger muscles) from grip force and posture of the wrist (flexed, neutral and extended) and forearm (pronated, neutral, supinated). The error in predicting <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> of each forearm muscle across the range of grip forces, using the first day data (root mean square error; RMSEmodel), ranged from 8. 9 % maximal voluntary electrical activation (MVE) (flexor carpi radialis) to 11 % MVE (extensor digitorum communis).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of activator Ca 2 + on loaded shortening and power output in skinned rat cardiac myocyte preparations, and fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres at 12 °C. Shortening velocities were slowed at nearly all relative loads when Ca 2 + <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were reduced to ≈ 70 % maximal isometric force (P 4. 5) in cardiac myocyte preparations, as well as in fast-twitch and slow-twitch skeletal muscle fibres. Peak absolute power outputs declined significantly as Ca 2 + <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were progressively reduced from maximal to 30 %P 4. 5 in all three striated muscle types, with the greatest change in fast-twitch fibres. In cardiac myocyte preparations, even peak relative power output progressively fell when Ca 2 + <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were lowered to ≈ 70, 50 and 30 %P 4. 5. Peak relative power output also progressively fell in fast-twitch fibres as Ca 2 + <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were lowered from maximal down to 50 %P 4. 5. However, in slow-twitch fibres, peak relative power output decreased only at 70 %P 4. 5 and then remained unchanged with further reductions in Ca 2 + <b>activation</b> <b>levels.</b> The greater Ca 2 + dependence of peak relative power output in cardiac myocytes and fast-twitch fibres may arise from a shared mechanism such as cooperative inactivation of the thin filament, which is likely to be slowest in less cooperative slow-twitch fibres. During submaximal Ca 2 + activations, the time course of shortening became markedly curvilinear during isotonic shortening in all three muscle types. The progressive slowdown in shortening velocity during isotonic contractions was greatest in fast-twitch fibres, consistent with the higher degree of cooperativity of Ca 2 + activation in fast-twitch fibres. Additionally, fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibre stiffness decreased in concert with the curvature of length traces during loaded shortening. These results are consistent with the idea that cooperative inactivation of the thin filament occurs during loaded shortening and such a mechanism may contribute to the progressive slowing and overall Ca 2 + dependence of loaded shortening velocity...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the contribution of the leg tissue masses (bone mineral content (BMC), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and wobbling mass (WM)), and muscle <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> to the response of the tibia following heel impacts similar to those experienced during running. A human pendulum was used to deliver controlled impacts to the dominant foot of 20 males and 20 females (mean age 23. 8 +/- 2. 6 years, body mass 71. 8 +/- 16. 9 kg, and height 1. 7 +/- 0. 1 m). Individual tissue masses were determined through use of anthropometric prediction equations. External impact forces, tibial accelerations, and tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> were measured simultaneously with a vertically erected force plate, uniaxial skin mounted accelerometer, and surface EMG electrodes, respectively. Simple linear regression was used to quantify the contribution to the tibial response parameters made by the magnitude of the individual leg tissue masses and muscle <b>activation</b> <b>levels.</b> The magnitudes of the leg tissue masses did not account for much variation in the tibial response to impact, and only partial support was found for the role of leg muscular <b>activation</b> <b>levels.</b> As a result, mechanical coupling between the rigid and soft tissue masses, and thickness of the heel fat pad are likely very important in explaining tibial response following heel impact, and future work addressing this seems warranted.

This study explored functional abnormalities in the neural network underlying the processing of facial affect in three different mood states (euthymic, depressed, and manic) associated with BD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 18 healthy controls and 18 euthymic, 12 depressed, and 12 manic BD patients while viewing affective or neutral faces. Compared with controls, BD patients in all mood states showed reduced activation in the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), indicating that activation in this region is independent of mood state. Activation in the amygdala, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and right temporal pole depended on mood state. Whereas <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> of depressed patients {{were not significantly different}} from those of controls, <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> in both euthymic and manic patients were significantly reduced compared with <b>activation</b> <b>levels</b> of both controls and depressed patients. However in the right DLPFC euthymic patients showed an increased <b>level</b> of <b>activation</b> compared with manic patients. These results add to the evidence for functional deficits in the affective network in BD patients, of which reduced bilateral OFC activation was found to be the most pronounced deficit across all mood states.
