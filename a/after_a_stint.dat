5|$|Ahn's co-founding of the Association for Teachers of English in Korea (ATEK), and {{subsequent}} {{development of a}} controversial public information campaign protesting government discrimination against foreign teachers resulted in dozens of foreign teachers filing formal complaints against the Korean government with the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Parties opposing Ahn's work countered with a smear campaign against him, spreading completely fabricated allegations of sex crimes in order to discredit him. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> in China he moved to Metro Manila, Philippines, establishing the country's first reputation management consultancy {{and two years later}} establishing the country's first digital public relations agency. Ahn taught a graduate-level course on digital public relations at De La Salle University, speaks on the subject of digital public relations at a wide variety of industry conferences, and writes on the subject.

5|$|In the 2003–04 season, he was {{originally}} Detroit's backup goalie when Dominik Hašek {{came out of}} retirement, and Detroit management tried to trade Joseph, since the team also had a capable backup in Manny Legace. However, Joseph's $8 million USD per year contract made him hard to move. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> in the minors, {{he returned to the}} Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings plan was to attract him to other teams until Hašek returned to the lineup. But in February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph's position as the Red Wings starting goaltender. The Wings finished first overall in the league. After defeating the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games, the Red Wings were defeated {{in the second round of}} the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames.|$|E

5|$|With {{nearly a}} decade of {{full-time}} band activity come to a rest, the Daddies parted ways to pursue other musical endeavors, remaining active in various local bands. Perry and Moss formed the theatrical glam punk group White Hot Odyssey, releasing an album on Jive Records in 2004 and later becoming a regular opening act for the Daddies' local concerts until their disbandment in 2005.

5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>stint</b> as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E
