25|$|Chipko {{movement}} in India {{started in the}} 1970s around a dispute on how <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> {{have a right to}} harvest forest resources. Although the Chipko movement is now practically non-existent in Uttarakhand, the Indian state of its origin, it {{remains one of the most}} frequently deployed examples of an environmental and a people's {{movement in}} developing countries such as India. What caused Chipko is now a subject of debate; some neopopulists theorise Chipko as an environmental movement and an attempt to save forests, while others suggest that Chipko movement had nothing to do with eco-conservation, but was driven primarily to demand equal rights to harvest forests by local communities.|$|E

Where objective measurement is desired, light levels can be quantified by field measurement or mathematical modeling, with results typically displayed as an isophote map or light contour map. Authorities have also taken a variety of measures for dealing with light pollution, depending on the interests, beliefs and understandings of the society involved. Measures range from doing nothing at all, to implementing strict laws and regulations about how lights may be installed and used.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999 Cibernético formed another rudo faction, a {{group called}} Lucha Libre Latina (LLL), a group intent on taking over AAA that was {{inspired}} by World Championship Wrestling's New World Order. Los Vipers became a subgroup within LLL, and Abismo Negro assumed leadership of Los Vipers after Cibernético. Cibernético looked like he could repeat as Rey de Reyes winner at the 2000 Event, but was defeated by Abismo Negro in the final. A few months later Cibernético teamed up with LLL members Abismo Negro, Electroshock and Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler Shiima Nobunaga in the main event of Triplemanía VIII, only to lose to Octagón, Jushin Thunder Liger, Latin Lover and El Alebrije. While Cibernético was leading LLL Abismo Negro was rising {{through the ranks of}} AAA, bolstered by his leadership of Los Vipers. Negro's status as a main eventer caused storyline problems between LLL's leader Cibernético and Abismo Negro, leading to a series of matches between the two to see who should lead <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> follow. On September 29, 2000, Negro defeated Cibernético in a one on one match at Verano de Escandalo 2000. When the two faced off in a steel cage match at Guerrera de Titanes 2000, the match ended without a winner, after which the rivalry between the leader and the deputy leader was put on the back burner. On June 30, 2001 Cibernético's almost three-year-long reign as Campeon de Campeones was ended when Heavy Metal won the title from him. Cibernético regained the title less than two months later, becoming the only three time Campeon de Campeones {{in the history of the}} title. Cibernético would retain the title until AAA quietly stopped promoting the belt some time in 2005. Cibernético's LLL was seen as a direct challenge to the authority of AAA founder and owner Antonio Peña and led to a match between Cibernético and Peña, who had been a wrestler before retiring in the 1980s. The two wrestled at the 2001 Guerrera de Titanes which Cibernético easily won in under three minutes. On January 20, 2002 Cibernético finally managed to defeat his longtime rival El Canek to win the UWA World Heavyweight Championship, a title he would retain for almost 10 months before El Canek regained the title on November 15, 2002.|$|E
500|$|After {{reforms of}} the {{university}} {{during the second half}} of the 19th century, a university statute of 1881 set out the professor's duties and entitlements, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> form the board appointing a new professor. It stated that [...] "The Laudian Professor of Arabic shall lecture and give instruction on the Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee Languages." [...] The professor was to be appointed by a board consisting of the Secretary of State for India, the President of St John's College, Oxford, the Regius Professor of Hebrew, the Boden Professor of Sanskrit and Bodley's Librarian. [...] The chair was attached to a fellowship at St John's College, which would contribute £450 towards the professor's income. Sir Hamilton Gibb was the first Laudian Professor to be a fellow of St John's; although David Margoliouth, his predecessor, was appointed after the statute came into force, he stayed at New College where he was already a fellow. [...] Before the 1881 statute, the professor remained at the college (if any) with which he had links before his appointment.|$|E

Fuller felt that Cole did [...] "a decent enough job," [...] claiming that the Siren was the [...] "best-realised thing" [...] about the episode, [...] "only slightly ahead of Karen Gillan looking very fetching in a pirate outfit." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek started by comparing the episode to Lost [...] "massive, intriguing" [...] cliffhangers, [...] "and then sauntered off to other less interesting stuff," [...] mainly criticising that the little girl's regeneration in [...] "Day of the Moon" [...] was left unresolved. However, Brew [...] "still enjoyed" [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot", reacting positively to the episode's production values and the reveal of the black spots. Nick Setchfield of the science-fiction based magazine SFX opined that the high points of the episode were that it was [...] "high on shivery maritime atmosphere," [...] and the Doctor for not being [...] "in instant possession of all the facts, but who reloads his thinking as events unfold." [...] However, Setchfield was critical of the story, claiming [...] "pirates <b>and</b> <b>Who</b> <b>should</b> be as combustive a mix as gunpowder and a trusty flintlock, but ultimately this grog-time yarn falls short of its promise." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{management}} and handling of Britain's historic castles has at times been contentious. Castles {{in the late}} 20th and early 21st century are usually {{considered part of the}} heritage industry, in which historic sites and events are commercially presented as visitor attractions. Some academics, such as David Lowenthal, have critiqued the way in which these histories are constantly culturally and socially reconstructed and condemned the [...] "commercial debasement" [...] of sites such as the Tower of London. The challenge of how to manage these historic properties has often required very practical decisions. At one end of the spectrum owners and architects have {{had to deal with the}} practical challenges of repairing smaller decaying castles used as private houses, such as that at Picton Castle where damp proved a considerable problem. At the other end of the scale the fire at Windsor Castle in 1992 opened up a national debate about how the burnt out castle wing should be replaced, the degree to which modern designs should be introduced <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> pay the £37 million costs (£50.2 million in 2009 terms). At Kenilworth the speculative and commercial reconstruction of the castle gardens in an Elizabethan style led to a vigorous academic debate over the interpretation of archaeological and historical evidence. Trends in conservation have altered and, in contrast to the prevailing post-war approach to conservation, recent work at castles such as Wigmore, acquired by English Heritage in 1995, have attempted to minimise the degree of intervention to the site.|$|E

2500|$|Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) {{are also}} {{sometimes}} treated as carbon offsets, although the concepts are distinct. Whereas a carbon offset represents {{a reduction in}} greenhouse gas emissions, a REC represents a quantity of energy produced from renewable sources. To convert RECs into offsets, the clean energy must be translated into carbon reductions, typically by assuming that the clean energy is displacing an equivalent amount of conventionally produced electricity from the local grid. This is known as an indirect offset (because the reduction doesn't {{take place at the}} project site itself, but rather at an external site), and some controversy surrounds the question of whether they truly lead to [...] "additional" [...] emission reductions <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> get credit for any reductions that may occur.

2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} with voter {{registration}} was a lack of agreement between Polisario and Morocco over who could claim Saharawi ethnicity <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>should</b> be allowed to vote on the referendum.

[...] In addition, Morocco may have [...] "improperly influenced Sahrawi tribal leaders who live in the Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara." [...] The UN moved 373 peacekeepers into the area to help validate Western Saharan voters. Polisario believed that Morocco was identifying tribal groups as voters who did not have a close connection to Western Sahara. During this time, King Hassan also moved 37,000 people from Morocco into Western Sahara to act as potential voters, which [...] "infuriated Polisario and shocked the peacekeepers." [...] Polisario believed that limiting voters to those were listed as [...] "Western Saharan" [...] on the 1974 Spanish census would lead to a vote for independence and did not want additional voters identified.|$|E
