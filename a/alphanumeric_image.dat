We present the image stack stream model or view of data as a convenient basis for both querying and visualizing the situation and changes through time of phenomena buried in the multitude of such variety of data. We outline briefly the requirements with motivating queries, and the recommended extensions to the latest object database management developments, particularly the ODMG standard to support this...|$|E

So far, {{the type of}} data {{that is used by}} an expert system for its reasoning process remains primarily <b>alphanumeric.</b> <b>Image,</b> graphics, and other dynamic data such as voice and video are part of an emerging technology generally termed multimedia technology. This article highlights the critical issues in building a successful application combining the two technologies. Based on these critical issues, it also provides a framework for the integration of multimedia technology with expert systems technology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Enhancement of {{degraded}} {{images of}} binary shapes {{is an important}} task in many image processing applications, e. g. to provide appropriate image quality for optical character recognition. Although many image restoration meth-ods {{can be found in}} the literature, most of them are developed for grayscale im-ages. In this paper we propose a novel binary image restoration algorithm. As a first step, it restores the projections of the shape using 1 -dimensional decon-volution, then reconstructs the image from these projections using a discrete to-mography technique. The method does not require any parameter setting or prior knowledge like an estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio. Numerical experiments on a synthetic dataset show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the level of the noise. The efficiency of the method has also been demonstrated on real out-of-focus <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>images.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The Braille {{system is}} a tactile {{language}} where each element is represented by a cell with six dot positions, arranged in three rows and two columns. Each dot position can be raised or otherwise allowing different configurations which can be felt by trained fingers. For caregivers with normal sights, training their fingers is not naturally easy. This paper presents an image processing approach to Braille dots recognition with alphanumeric conversion, whereby a person with normal eyesight is able to translate a raw Braille image captured by a mobile camera into the corresponding <b>alphanumeric</b> texts. <b>Image</b> pre-processing relies heavily on various segmentation algorithms in the MATLAB image processing Toolbox. This application is hoped to help the blind and the visually impaired {{community as well as}} their caregivers to translate Braille texts digitally, hence enhancing the communication and collaboration possibilities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Professor Steve Andrade is {{continuously}} experimenting in a {{wide range}} of visual arts and technology. He is an avid researcher in the areas of interactive technology, gaming, modern visual metaphor, archeology, fine arts, Western geology and the sociology of technology space. When he is not teaching or conducting projects at the University, Professor Andrade can be found traveling or working in his studio (pictured here). His artwork includes digital imaging, graphic art posters, virtual space planning, information graphics, 2 d and 3 d sculpture, representational sketching, realism, video and his current passion - abstract modern painting with a hint of allegory. He is an active writer and researcher on professional and creative topics. Andrade’s current work is influenced by recent visual research into a number of well and lesser known 20 th century artists including Marcel Duchamp (French), Wassily Kandinsky (Russian), Antoni Tapies (Spanish), Willem deKooning (Dutch American), Paul Klee (Swiss), Ron Ehrlich (American), prehistoric cave painters, Southwestern American Indian glyph artists, skateboarders, steampunk, the LA art scene, the iPad, and Afghani Taliban graffiti. His paintings are elaborate compositions of layers, surface, shape and material. The use of color both coordinates and disrupts space. Border and color are used to create frames that sometimes hold <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>images</b> that loosely weave a tale. Iconic images are embedded to deepen mystery and meaning, resulting interpretations unique to each viewer. Andrade’s sculpture is out of the “assemblage” tradition. Created out of “found” objects, each piece redefines the relationship objects have to each other to create a whole. Roland Penrose, a prominent modern art critic writes, “Frequently it is the presence of a familiar object in unexpected surroundings that awakens us. ” Andrade’s sculptures evoke the authenticity of elements such as wood, rope, wire, metal and bone. Professor Andrade teaches a number of courses in the Computer Graphics department at the School of Technology. He has recently been active in gaming research, architecture and prototyping collaborations with GTECH experts and JWU students...|$|R

40|$|In an {{open network}} environment, privacy of group {{communication}} {{and integrity of}} the communication data are the two major issues related to secured information exchange. The required level of security may be achieved by authenticating a group key in the communication channel, where contribution from each group member becomes {{a part of the}} overall group key. In the current work, we have developed an authentication system through Central Administrative Server (CAS) for automatic integration and validation of the group key. For secured group communication, the CAS generates a secret <b>alphanumeric</b> group key <b>image.</b> Using secret image sharing scheme, this group key image shares are distributed among all the participating group members in the open network. Some or all the secret shares may be merged to reconstruct the group key image at CAS. A k-nearest neighbor classifier with 48 features to represent the images, is used to validate the reconstructed image with the one stored in the CAS. 48 topological features are used to represent the reconstructed group key image. We have achieved 99. 1 % classification accuracy for 26 printed English uppercase characters and 10 numeric digits...|$|R
40|$|The {{extension}} {{of the concept of}} cultural heritage of various natures, the relationship between their conservation and the relative fruition issues new challenges such as the combined utilisation of various databases online, the creation of super national and multilingual dictionaries. The rapid obsolescence of technologies furthermore imposes the attention to data storage. However, the aspects, which most involve the online user, are both the interface and easy access to different subjects and contents. The networking era following more than thirty years of stand alone data management has outlined the “must” of information interchange and interoperability of systems. This issue is more relevant in IT sector in which interoperability amongst huge data banks may unleash unpredictable benefits. Let us consider, for instance, Cultural Heritage Data Banks. Such data sets hold various information types ranging between <b>alphanumeric</b> data to <b>images</b> or computer generated movies. Experts in cultural heritage started many years ago defining data structure and formats in order to promote standards enabling information storage and exchange. This paper will draw {{the state of the art}} in the field advanced user interfaces ensuring interoperability of heterogeneous distributed data sets and their querying interfaces describing recent solutions and implementations outlining future trends and approaches. The opportunity to enjoy a common access interface to the whole set of Cultural Heritage data will enable us to get great results becoming, in addition, the basic elements for virtual exhibitions and cultural on line services with specific reference to European Culture...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{digital imaging}} {{practice}} has largely adopted the visual characteristics of its closest mediatic relative, the analogue photograph, In this regard, new media theorist Lev Manovich observes that "Computer software {{does not produce}} such images by default. The paradox of digital visual culture is that although all imaging is becoming computer-based, the dominance of photographic and cinematic imagery is becoming even stronger. But rather than being a direct, "natural" result of photo and film technology, these images are constructed on computers" (Manovich 2001 : 179), Manovich articulates the disjuncture between the technical processes involved in the digital image creation process and the visual characteristics of the final digital image with its replication of the visual qualities of the analogue photograph. This research addresses this notion further by exploring the following. What are the defining technical features of these computer-based imaging processes? Could these technical features {{be used as a}} basis in developing an alternative aesthetic for the digital image? Why is there a reticence to visually acknowledge these technical features in contemporary digital imaging practice? Are there historic mediated precedents where the inherent technical features of the medium are visually acknowledged in the production of imagery? If these defining technical features of the digital imaging process were visually acknowledged in this image creation process, what would be the outcome? The studio practice component of the research served as a foundation for the author's artistic and aesthetic development where the intent was to investigate and highlight four technical qualities of the digital image identified through the case studies of three digital artists, and other secondary sources, These technical qualities include: the composite RGB colour system of the digital image as it appears on screen; the pixellated microstructure of the digital image; the luminosity of the digital image as it appears on a computer monitor, and the underlying numeric and (ASCII based) alphanumeric codes of the image file which enables that most defining feature of the image file, that of programmability, Based on research in the visualization of these numeric and <b>alphanumeric</b> codes, digital <b>images</b> of bacteria produced through the use of the scanning electron microscope, were chosen as image content for an experimental body of work to draw the conceptual link between these numeric and alphanumeric codes of the image file and the coded genetic sequence of an individual bacterial entity...|$|R
