500|$|Reviewing {{the first}} Steve Jackson Games editions of Ogre (after the {{designer}} had {{moved away from}} Metagaming), Tony Watson called Ogre [...] "a legend {{in the ranks of}} SF gamedom, and deservedly so... as well as being <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play, it's an interesting extrapolation on high-tech armoured warfare". It was noted that the rules had remained essentially the same in the new edition, and the most significant changes being to the physical design—with larger (still black and white) counters, and full colour maps by Denis Loubet. [...] Watson also welcomed the retention of the original artwork alongside new pieces—"no one draws a GEV or Ogre like Mr. Chung".|$|E

One of Electronic Gaming Monthly's reviewers called the game's race tracks [...] "short, unimaginative and devoid of good shortcuts". Imperio called the track design [...] "simplistic and often not very difficult", but [...] "still well designed and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> race through". Park called the game's music cheery and upbeat, while Stahl called it [...] "barely acceptable", stating that it [...] "gets irritating rather quickly", {{as well as}} calling the game's sound effects [...] "decidedly poor".

It was the first show that the Gunmen carried and I had a real good time shepherding Tommy, Dean, and Bruce, 'cause [...] they were nervous, they had the whole hour to carry." [...] One scene with which Manners was extremely pleased was the shot wherein Susanne Modeski breaks into the Lone Gunmen's hotel room and the Gunmen cower in fear in a corner.

Mike Minotti of VentureBeat opined that: [...] "Tracer [...] <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. Her whole teleporting/rewinding mechanics [...] so unique and fast-paced. I feel like [...] {{done a great job}} making a varied, relatively balanced cast."

500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate."

Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's [...] "advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree", but [...] "without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play" [...] and those who played the original [...] "will probably find the new edition {{a waste of time}} and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures."

500|$|Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a score 7.5 out of 10. He was {{critical}} of the episode's [...] "wonky pacing and story progression" [...] and given its [...] "legitimate two-part storyline" [...] was disappointed it was not more cohesive than the previous year's crossover. He felt the [...] crossover [...] "had a fairly rocky start" [...] and wondered whether Arrows characters were actually necessary to the storyline. Even so, Scheden said, [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains" [...] and {{was looking forward to}} a focused conclusion. The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode an [...] "A", saying: [...] ""Legends Of Today” is a sterling example of how to do this crossover thing right." [...] He noted that the episode wove ongoing storylines [...] "into an expansive DC Universe adventure" [...] calling it [...] "the most purely enjoyable outing of the season so far".|$|E
500|$|Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush {{felt the}} line [...] "had {{to see that}} coming" [...] applied to many {{elements}} of the episode, but said [...] "there’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be had" [...] and praised {{the use of the}} character James, dealing with the character's [...] "self-loathing" [...] well while acknowledging his status as the series' pre-Ghost Rider Ghost Rider. Fitzpatrick added that he was [...] "still not crazy about whatever’s going on with “Lucy” and her terrible ghost effects", and felt the Aida story was being pushed aside in favor of a seemingly corporate-mandated Ghost Rider focus. Terri Schwartz at IGN gave the episode a [...] "great" [...] 8.5 out of 10, praising the executive producers for their timing in bringing the season's different groups of characters together in this episode. Schwartz praised the car chase, the handling of the relationship between Simmons and Fitz in regards to his keeping Aida a secret from her, and the use of James, taking advantage of the audience's familiarity of him from the previous season.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen rated the episode an A−, describing it as [...] "sort {{of kind of}} pretty much batshit insane". Handlen felt that the episode [...] "was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> watch, though, even if it didn't entirely come together. The script is Carter and company's usual hodepodge of crackpot theory and weird extemporization, but it's a huge relief to shift away, even for a week, from the grind of heavy-handed murder parties that define {{so much of the}} series". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "very atmospheric". Gibron praised Dourif's guest role, and noted that the episode helped {{to lay the groundwork for}} the direction the series would take in its second season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Force Majeure" [...] five stars out of five, describing it as [...] "rich and dark". Shearman felt that the episode's plot was [...] "borrowed from The X-Files", and came across as [...] "just a collection of ideas". However, he praised Dourif's [...] "barnstorming performance", comparing it to his role in The X-Files episode [...] "Beyond the Sea", and noted that [...] "Force Majeure" [...] was [...] "an episode which bravely redefines what [...] is capable of".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play. There {{are a lot of different}} dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 1, 2008, Bako {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with an invitation to spring training with the Cincinnati Reds.

On January 30, 2009, the Chicago Cubs signed Bako to a one-year contract. However, he was unconditionally released near the end of spring training. On May 18, Bako signed {{a minor league}} deal with the Philadelphia Phillies, and was called up from the Reading Phillies to the Major League roster on June 9. He became the Phillies only backup catcher when the Phillies waived [...] "folk hero" [...] Chris Coste on July 10; Coste had broken into the big leagues {{for the first time with}} Philadelphia at age 33. The next day, Bako came to the plate in the bottom of the ninth inning against Pittsburgh Pirates closer Matt Capps with the score tied, 7–7; the Phillies had been behind by four runs before home runs by Matt Stairs and Ryan Howard tied the game. With the bases loaded, Bako hit a single through the left side of the infield, driving in the winning run (Raúl Ibañez) and sealing the Phillies fourth consecutive victory in a season-high ten-game winning streak. After the acquisition of starting pitcher Cliff Lee, Bako caught all of his first five starts with the Phillies, when Lee posted a 5–0 record and an 0.68 earned run average. Bako said, [...] "With as many strikes as he throws and as many weapons as he has, it's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> catch him."
