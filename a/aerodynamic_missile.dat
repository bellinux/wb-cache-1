Two tactical prototype BOMARCs were launched against a QB-17 Flying Fortress target drone in October and November 1956, but the 6555th's people only played a supporting role in those tests and later contractor-led operations. Twenty-five Bomarc interceptor missiles were launched from the Cape before ARDC announced plans in September 1958 to transfer the Bomarc program from Cape Canaveral to the Air Proving Ground Center's Eglin AFB test site at Santa Rosa Island near Fort Walton Beach, Florida.

The results indicated significant variations in all the aerodynamic components with changes in chordwise location of the missile. Increasing the angle of attack caused increases in the induced effects on the missile model because of the wing-fuselage-pylon combination. Increasing the Mach number {{had little effect on}} the variations of the <b>missile</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> characteristics with angle of attack except that nonlinearities were incurred at smaller angles of attack for the higher Mach numbers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimization {{of the performance}} of a recently proposed virtual sliding target (VST) guidance scheme in terms of maximization of its launch envelope for three- dimensional (3 -D) engagements. The objective is to obtain the launch envelope of the missile using the VST guidance scheme for different lateral launch angles with respect to the line of sight (LOS) and demonstrate its superiority over kinematics-based guidance laws like proportional navigation (PN). The VST scheme uses PN as its basic guidance scheme and exploits the relation between the atmospheric properties, <b>missile</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> characteristics, and the optimal trajectory of the missile. The missile trajectory is shaped by controlling the instantaneous position and the speed of a virtual target which the missile pursues during the midcourse phase.

40|$|Presented at Aircraft Technology, Integration, and Operations (ATIO) 2002 Technical Forum, 1 - 3 October 2002, Los Angeles, California. This report {{summarizes}} {{the feasibility of}} implementing a metamodel, consisting of Response Surface Equations (RSE), in a High Speed Standoff Missile (HSSM) multi-disciplinary mission analysis. The metamodel, which is a representation of a physics based engineering tool, is used to optimize the <b>missile</b> <b>aerodynamic</b> performance for any given mission. Each mission {{is defined as a}} function of the mission parameters. The optimization schemes use flight condition information and missile requirements from the upstream mission analysis, and find the optimum missile geometry parameters for that mission. The geometry parameters are then returned to the system analysis to complete the mission evaluation under optimal aerodynamic performance. The optimization scheme allows the variation of the missile geometry without increasing the number of runs in a parametric design study, such as a Design of Experiments (DOE). Results are achieved for two modules, namely the fuselage aerodynamics and the tail fin aerodynamics. Metamodel optimization schemes were created and implemented into the modules. The transformed modules were tested to observe the behavior and accuracy of the schemes. Comparison is made between the optimal geometries found with and without the use of the metamodel. The comparison shows that the metamodel optimization returns similar results, and does so in a significantly shorter amount of time. In addition, the aerodynamic design spaces are analyzed in conjunction with the optimization behavior to predict possible problems in the optimization process. The use of the metamodel is shown to alleviate optimization problems such as multi-modal design spaces. The results indicate the usefulness and promise for the proposed metamodel optimization scheme for use in a large scale preliminary design analysis...|$|R
40|$|In the {{traditional}} aerospace vehicle design process, each successive design phase {{is accompanied by}} an increment in the modeling fidelity of the disciplinary analyses being performed. This trend follows a corresponding shrinking of the design space {{as more and more}} design decisions are locked in. The correlated increase in knowledge about the design and decrease in design freedom occurs partly because increases in modeling fidelity are usually accompanied by significant increases in the computational expense of performing the analyses. When running high fidelity analyses, it is not usually feasible to explore a large number of variations, and so design space exploration is reserved for conceptual design, and higher fidelity analyses are run only once a specific point design has been selected to carry forward. The designs produced by this traditional process have been recognized as being limited by the uncertainty that is present early on due to the use of lower fidelity analyses. For example, uncertainty in aerodynamics predictions produces uncertainty in trajectory optimization, which can impact overall vehicle sizing. This effect can become more significant when trajectories are being shaped by active constraints. For example, if an optimal trajectory is running up against a normal load factor constraint, inaccuracies in the aerodynamic coefficient predictions can cause a feasible trajectory to be considered infeasible, or vice versa. For this reason, a trade must always be performed between the desired fidelity and the resources available. Apart from this trade between fidelity and computational expense, it is very desirable to use higher fidelity analyses earlier in the design process. A large body of work has been performed to this end, led by efforts in the area of surrogate modeling. In surrogate modeling, an up-front investment is made by running a high fidelity code over a Design of Experiments (DOE); once completed, the DOE data is used to create a surrogate model, which captures the relationships between input variables and responses into regression equations. Depending on the dimensionality of the problem and the fidelity of the code for which a surrogate model is being created, the initial DOE can itself be computationally prohibitive to run. Cokriging, a modeling approach from the field of geostatistics, provides a desirable compromise between computational expense and fidelity. To do this, cokriging leverages a large body of data generated by a low fidelity analysis, combines it with a smaller set of data from a higher fidelity analysis, and creates a kriging surrogate model with prediction fidelity approaching that of the higher fidelity analysis. When integrated into a multidisciplinary environment, a disciplinary analysis module employing cokriging can raise the analysis fidelity without drastically impacting the expense of design iterations. This is demonstrated through the creation of an aerodynamics analysis module in NASA s OpenMDAO framework. <b>Aerodynamic</b> analyses including <b>Missile</b> DATCOM, APAS, and USM 3 D are leveraged to create high fidelity aerodynamics decks for parametric vehicle geometries, which are created in NASA s Vehicle Sketch Pad (VSP). Several trade studies are performed to examine the achieved level of model fidelity, and the overall impact to vehicle design is quantified...|$|R
