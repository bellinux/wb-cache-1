5|$|Surveying of Thorold Township {{began the}} same day, August 24, 1788 and {{continued}} until October 25, 1788. In Thorold, Jones was receiving a pay of four shillings a day, {{and his two}} primary assistants, Joseph Jones and Benjamin Stanton, received the same. <b>All</b> <b>worked</b> the full 54 days of the survey. Local men were hired as woodcutters and chainbearers for shorter periods, and typically earnt two shillings a day.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{police were}} unclear {{how the two}} groups from Sydney and Brisbane were linked, but did {{establish}} the movements {{of members of the}} group before their departure for Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed by Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company with more than 9000 employees. Norman, Lawrence, Martin, Stephens and Chan, a supervisor with the company, <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> for Eurest, which provided hospitality services to the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the group was employed. Rush and Czugaj alleged they were recruited by Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, their co-defendant and the alleged financier of the smuggling plan, while socialising at a karaoke bar in Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As they had <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E

5|$|The {{team that}} worked on Labyrinth was largely {{assembled}} from talent {{who had been}} involved in various other projects with the Jim Henson Company. Veteran performers Frank Oz and Dave Goelz operated various puppets in the film, as did Karen Prell, Ron Mueck and Rob Mills who had <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> with Henson on Fraggle Rock. Kevin Clash, a crew member on Sesame Street best known for voicing the character Elmo, worked on the film. Members of Henson's family also worked on the production, including son Brian and daughter Cheryl. Newcomers working on the production included puppeteer Anthony Asbury, who had previously worked on the satirical puppet show Spitting Image.|$|E
5|$|Many historians {{attribute}} the Confederacy's weaknesses {{to the poor}} leadership of Davis. His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors and generals, favoritism toward old friends, inability {{to get along with}} people who disagreed with him, neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones, and resistance to public opinion <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> against him. Historians agree he was a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln. After Davis was captured in 1865, he was accused of treason and imprisoned at Fort Monroe. He was never tried and was released after two years. While not disgraced, Davis had been displaced in ex-Confederate affection after the war by his leading general, Robert E. Lee. Davis wrote a memoir entitled The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, which he completed in 1881. By the late 1880s, he began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. Ex-Confederates came to appreciate his role in the war, seeing him as a Southern patriot, and he became a hero of the Lost Cause in the post-Reconstruction South.|$|E

25|$|Although Shockley {{was never}} {{diagnosed}} by psychiatrists, historians characterized Shockley's {{state of mind}} in 1956–1957 as paranoia or autism. All phone calls were recorded, and the staff {{was not allowed to}} share their results with each other, which was not feasible since they <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> in a small building. Shockley, not trusting his employees, was sending their reports to Bell Labs for double-checking. At some point he sent the entire lab for a lie detector test, though everyone refused.|$|E
25|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} images {{collected by}} Gosling and Franklin provided {{the best evidence}} for the helical nature of DNA.

Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson, 2) discussions with Wilkins, {{who worked in the}} same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.

25|$|Throughout 1965 and 1966, {{researchers}} from the Kumamoto University Research Group (that {{had been set up}} to investigate the original outbreak) and Dr. Hajime Hosokawa (the former Chisso hospital director) brought their significant experience from Minamata and applied it to the Niigata outbreak. Many lessons were learned from Minamata and the investigation into the cause of the outbreak proceeded much more smoothly than it had in Minamata. The prefectural government, Niigata University, citizen's organisations, and local people <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> together to uncover the cause. In March 1966, factory plant wastewater was reported to be suspected as the source of pollution, and in September, the Ministry of Health and Welfare announced it had discovered methylmercury in moss at the outlet of the Showa Denko factory in Kanose village.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make {{a down payment on}} a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees for the purpose of making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades, the colony {{cultivated}} cotton on plantations {{of the sea}} islands and Low Country, along with rice, indigo and some tobacco as commodity crops, <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> by African slaves, most from West Africa. In the 19th century, invention of the cotton gin enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which grew better in the Piedmont than did long-staple cotton. The hilly upland areas, where landowners were generally subsistence farmers with few slaves, were much poorer; a regional conflict between the coastal and inland areas developed in the political system, long dominated by the Low Country planters. With outspoken leaders such as John C. Calhoun, the state vied with Virginia as the dominant political and social force in the South. It fought federal tariffs in the 1830s and demanded that its rights to practice slavery be recognized in newly established territories. With the 1860 election of Republicans under Abraham Lincoln, who vowed to prevent slavery's expansion, the voters demanded secession. In December 1860, the state seceded from the Union; in February 1861, it joined the new Confederate States of America.|$|E
