The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state.

5|$|By 1965, the Americans {{were looking}} for someone to {{overthrow}} Khánh, and these efforts were spearheaded by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor, who had begun encouraging other senior officers to move against Khánh {{since the start of the}} year, even though there was still significant hesitation and opposition to any regime change back in Washington. At the time, the US was planning to start a large-scale bombing campaign against the communist north and regarded Khánh's reliance on Buddhist support as an obstacle to their aims. Furthermore, Taylor and Khánh developed an intense personal antipathy for one another, which culminated in a breakdown in their relationship; in December 1964, Khánh's junta deposed the High National Council, a civilian advisory body that was designed to give a semblance of civilian rule. This resulted in Taylor angrily condemning Khánh and his generals in private to the point of suggesting Khánh resign the leadership. Khánh responded by threatening to expel Taylor, <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> a media offensive against the ambassador. Taylor threatened to withhold military aid, but the Americans could not do so because of their overriding desire to see the military defeat of the communists, and without foreign funding, South Vietnam could not survive.|$|E

The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest was a test of their character to see if they are worthy of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for what they believe in, like their friends, are worthy of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving.
