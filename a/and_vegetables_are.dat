5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>are</b> good dietary sources of potassium.

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{color of}} the edible portion of fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> {{reflects}} the presence of pigmented bioactive compounds, (eg, carotenoids, anthocyanidins, and flavonoids). Which fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> color groups contribute most to the beneficial association of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> with stroke incidence is unknown. Therefore, we examined associations between consumption of fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> color groups with 10 -year stroke incidence. Methods—This was a prospective, population-based cohort study, including 20 069 men and women age 20 to 65 years and free of cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Participants completed a validated, 178 -item food frequency questionnaire. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for stroke incidence using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age, sex, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Results—During 10 years of follow-up, 233 incident cases of stroke <b>were</b> documented. Fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>were</b> classified into 4 color groups. Medians of green, orange/yellow, red/purple, and white fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption <b>were</b> 62, 87, 57, and 118 g/d, respectively. Green, orange/yellow, and red/purple fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>were</b> not related to incident stroke. Higher intake of white fruits <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>was</b> inversely associated with incident stroke (Q 4, > 171 g/d, versus Q 1, = 78 g/d; HR, 0. 48; 95 % CI, 0. 29 – 0. 77). Each 25 -g/d increase in white fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption <b>was</b> associated with a 9 % lower risk of stroke (HR, 0. 91; 95 % CI, 0. 85 – 0. 97).

40|$|Low fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake <b>is</b> an {{important}} {{risk factor for}} micronutrient deficiencies and non-communicable diseases, but many people worldwide, including most Fijians, eat less than the World Health Organization recommended amount. The present qualitative study explores factors that influence fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake among 57 urban Fijians (50 women, 7 men) of indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) and South Asian (Indian) descent. Eight focus group discussions were held in and around Suva, Fiji 2 ̆ 7 s capital and largest urban area, which explored motivation for eating fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> understandings of links to health and disease, availability and sources, determinants of product choice, and preferred ways of preparing and eating fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Data <b>were</b> analysed using thematic content analysis. Regardless of ethnicity, participants indicated that they enjoyed and valued eating fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables,</b> <b>were</b> aware of the health benefits, and had confidence in their cooking skills. In both cultures, fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>were</b> essential components of traditional diets. However, increasing preferences for processed and imported foods, and inconsistent availability and affordability of high-quality, low-priced, fresh produce, were identified as important barriers. The findings indicate that efforts to improve fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake in urban Fijians should target {{the stability of the}} domestic fruit <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> supply <b>and</b> access...|$|R
