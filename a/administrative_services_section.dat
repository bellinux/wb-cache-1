To illustrate the main features of electronic commerce of services, we have selected legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>services.</b> We describe in the paper the actors who take part in these services, the system architecture and the workflow that defines the interactions and interchange of information among actors. With these elements we have implemented an electronic commerce application inside the TRADE project 2 that demonstrates how these services can be offered in an electronic manner. 1 Electronic commerce of legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>services</b> This <b>section</b> attempts to describe in a general way the characteristics of electronic commerce of services.

Whilst electronic commerce of products consists on selecting the items we want to buy from a catalog and pay for them, electronic commerce of services consists on searching for a professional or company that offers the service and contract him. During service development, there can be information request, payment or contacts with another users. 1. 2 Characteristics of legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>services</b> We have studied in detail the legal and <b>administrative</b> <b>services</b> in order to describe them. These are their main features: • There is a purchase of services.
