40|$|The current {{thesis is}} divided into two projects. The first part deals with studies on active galaxies hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Specifically, an optical spectroscopic study of a nearby (z < 0. 06) volume - limited sample of Low - Luminosity Quasi - Stellar Objects (LLQSOs) has been carried out. The sample has been drawn from the Hamburg/ESO QSO survey (HES), which has a {{well-defined}} flux limit of B_j < 17. 3. The aim of the present project is to characterize the excitation degree of the sample, distinguish between possible star forming and Seyfert activity and to investigate the spectral characteristics of the sample. The spectroscopic data were analyzed and emission lines were fitted using a routine, which employs Levenberg - Marquardt least square minimization. The same analysis was also applied for some additional archival data from the 6 Degree Field Galaxy Survey (6 dFGS). The objects of the LLQSOs sample are classified according to the classical optical diagnostic diagrams, based on optical emission lines close in wavelength, avoiding almost any impact of reddening. The diagrams provide a diagnosis of the ionizing source within a galaxy, hence activity between Hii, LINERs (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region), and Seyfert galaxies can be clearly distinguished. The classification of all members of the LLQSOs sample is shown in chapter 3. The broadness of the emission lines, cases with double components and the electron density are also analyzed. The comparison of the diagnostic diagrams between the two data sets (HES and 6 DFGS) results in different classifications of most of the sources. This is due to the different spectroscopic techniques applied in the two data sets during the observations, and is sketched in chapter 4. Several galaxies at a variety of cosmological distances, with elliptical and circular morphologies, were simulated. In these simulations, different instruments (different spectroscopic techniques, i. e. slit, fiber) were applied to the galaxies, in order to study the instrumental effect (aperture effect). The impact of the aperture effect in local and high redshift universe is discussed in detail. The second project of the thesis focuses on the construction of an image beam combiner for the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LINC - NIRVANA instrument will be operating in the near - infrared (1 - 2. 4 μm) and will provide a high angular resolution (9 mas at 1. 25 μm) over a wide field of view (100 arcsec at 1. 25 μm). A fundamental component of the instrument, the Fringe and Flexure Tracking System (FFTS) is responsible to ensure a complete and time-stable wavefront correction at the position of the science detector. This will allow for long integration times at interferometric angular resolutions. A historical overview and our current achievements are also discussed in chapter 5. Laboratory tests of specific parts of the FFTS are presented in chapter 6. Especially, the subparts of the Detector Positioning Unit (DPU), which has to be moved with respect to an altitude - <b>azimuth</b> <b>mounting</b> under vacuum conditions, are characterized. The tilting of the instrument as a function of elevation results in a flexure of the system that has to be corrected by an algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] A {{telescope}} {{to be installed}} on the lunar surface in the near futere mast work in a cold and dusty vacuum environment fur long periods without on site human maintenance [...] To track stars, the drive mechanism must be capable of exceedingly fine steps and repeatability. Further, the use of lightweight telescopes for obvious economic benefits burdens the requirement for stable support and rotation. Conventional contact bearings and gear drives have numerous failure modes under such a restrictive and harsh environment. However, hybrid superconducting magnetic bearings (HSMB) fit in naturally. These bearings are stable, light, passive, and essentially frictionlesa, allowing high precision electronic positioning control. By passive levitation, the HSMB does not wear out and requires neither maintenance nor power. A prototype illustrating the fea_bility of this application is presented. payload weight limitations [3]; and HTS bearings to meet the strict maintenance and resolution requirements which conventional bearings cannot maintain. We report on the first prototype I-ITS bearing module built at the University of Houston in collaboration with Chert to be assembled as an <b>azimuth</b> <b>mount</b> for a levitated lunar telescope, see Fig. 1. II. LUNAR BEARING REQUIREMENTS To track {{the position of a}} celestial object, the telescope must be able to change orientation as the moon rotates about Earth and its own axis. In general, the bearing module would have rotation capability in three directions. 1...|$|R

40|$|New {{pointing}} {{models have}} been developed for large reflector antennas whose construction is founded on elevation over <b>azimuth</b> <b>mount.</b> At JPL, the new models were applied to the Deep Space Network (DSN) 34 -meter antenna s subnet for corrections of their systematic pointing errors; it achieved significant improvement in performance at Ka-band (32 -GHz) and X-band (8. 4 -GHz). The new models provide pointing improvements relative to the traditional models by a factor of two to three, which translate to approximately 3 -dB performance improvement at Ka-band. For radio science experiments where blind pointing performance is critical, the new innovation provides a new enabling technology. The model extends the traditional physical models with higher-order mathematical terms, thereby increasing the resolution of the model for a better fit to the underlying systematic imperfections that are the cause of antenna pointing errors. The philosophy of the traditional model was that all mathematical terms in the model must be traced to a physical phenomenon causing antenna pointing errors. The traditional physical terms are: antenna axis tilts, gravitational flexure, azimuth collimation, azimuth encoder fixed offset, azimuth and elevation skew, elevation encoder fixed offset, residual refraction, azimuth encoder scale error, and antenna pointing de-rotation terms for beam waveguide (BWG) antennas. Besides the addition of spherical harmonics terms, the new models differ from the traditional ones in that the coefficients for the cross-elevation and elevation corrections are completely independent and may be different, while in the traditional model, some of the terms are identical. In addition, the new software allows for all-sky or mission-specific model development, and can utilize the previously used model as an a priori estimate {{for the development of the}} updated models...|$|R

50|$|There {{are ways}} to improve the {{accuracy}} of this method. For example, instead of reading the latitude scale directly, a calibrated precision inclinometer can be used to measure the altitude of the polar axis of the mount. If the setting circles of the mount is then used to find a bright object of known coordinates, the object should only mismatch in azimuth, so centering the object by adjusting the <b>azimuth</b> of the <b>mount</b> should complete the polar alignment process. Typically, this provides enough accuracy to allow tracked (i.e. motorized) telephoto images of the sky.|$|R
50|$|The {{cameras are}} mounted 1.5 meters {{high on the}} Pancam Mast Assembly. The PMA is {{deployed}} via the Mast Deployment Drive (MDD). The <b>Azimuth</b> Drive, <b>mounted</b> directly above the MDD, turns the assembly horizontally a whole revolution with signals transmitted through a rolling tape configuration. The camera drive points the cameras in elevation, almost straight up or down. A third motor points the Mini-TES fold mirrors and protective shroud, up to 30° above the horizon and 50° below. The PMA's conceptual design was done by Jason Suchman at JPL, the Cognizant Engineer who later served as Contract Technical Manager (CTM) once the assembly was built by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp., Boulder, Colorado. Raul Romero served as CTM once subsystem-level testing began. Satish Krishnan did the conceptual design of the High-Gain Antenna Gimbal (HGAG), whose detailed design, assembly, and test was also performed by Ball Aerospace at which point Satish acted as the CTM.|$|R
40|$|Wireless network {{adapters}} are now standard in most notebook computers. These {{network adapters}} are typically compliant {{with at least}} IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g and often include IEEE 802. 11 n. This requires that the antenna subsystem of the notebook computer operate at both 2. 4 GHz and 5. 25 GHz. The antennas used in the wireless system of a notebook computer are themselves small, but they are incorporated into a much larger device. It is unclear exactly what range length is {{required in order to}} make accurate pattern and radiated power measurements. This paper reports on a series of measurements made at different range lengths with the goal of determining the minimum range length required for acceptable measurements of radiation patterns and total radiated power (TRP). 2.

The theta axis consists of a boom on which the measurement antenna is mounted. The phi axis is an <b>azimuth</b> rotator <b>mounted</b> {{on the floor of the}} chamber.

50|$|Setting-up {{the radar}} {{involved}} orientating it in a known <b>azimuth</b> (the basic <b>mounting</b> could cover an arc of 4800 mils) {{and setting the}} datum beam elevation between -90 and 360 mils {{so that it was}} above the radar horizon. Other beam positions, 25, 40, 45, 65 and 90 mils were relative to this datum. The lowest beam position was used to alert the operator that a bomb was in flight and where to expect it on his screen; once alerted he tilted the beam into the first position and then into the next. The angles were pre-selected according to the local circumstances. Data memory was also available, although in British service this was normally only fitted to Cymbeline Mk 2; in essence it recorded the detected mortar bomb signal and allowed it to be replayed.|$|R
