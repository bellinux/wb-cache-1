Additional downtown developments include the renovation of the historic Hollister Building {{and the expansion of}} the former Abrams Aerial Building. As of August 2008, an 18-story condominium high-rise called Capitol Club Tower was in the design phase with the adjacent parking structure having been approved by city council and purchased by the developer. The city market, in existence since 1909, was approved to be sold for a multi-building mixed-use development called MarketPlace, right next to the current market on the adjacent riverfront. The MarketPlace project was redeveloped along with BallPark North, another mixed-use development that will be immediately north of Oldsmobile Stadium. The new city market is just north of the Lansing Center, across the river from where the <b>Accident</b> <b>Fund</b> Insurance Company renovated the former (art deco) Ottawa Street Powerplant into their new headquarters.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} cost savings {{potential}} {{with regard to}} administration and management costs by merging Public Employment <b>Accident</b> Insurance <b>Funds</b> (Öffentliche Unfallkassen) in Germany. Our data base consists of the annual reports of the public statutory <b>accident</b> insurance <b>funds</b> from 1999 to 2005. Results of a multivariate regression analysis help to identify cost drivers and the potential existence of economies of scale. The numbers of employee accidents and pupil accidents as well as expenditures to prevent accidents serve as explanatory variables for administration and management costs. The main results are as follows. First, public <b>accident</b> insurance <b>funds</b> are very heterogeneous with regard to administration and management costs. Second, these cost differences are unrelated {{to the size of}} insurance funds (the number of insured employees and pupils). There is no evidence for cost savings of larger insurance funds, i. e., economies of scale. Third, accidents of pupils entail substantially lower management and administration costs than accidents of employees. Furthermore, there is evidence that higher expenditures to prevent accidents such as accident prevention programs also involve higher administration and management costs.
