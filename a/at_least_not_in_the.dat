5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E

25|$|Type 2: Antigenically A2B5+, GFAP+, FGFR3−, Ran 2−. These {{cells can}} develop in vitro from the either tripotential GRP (probably via O2A stage) or from bipotential O2A cells (which {{some people think}} may in turn have been derived from the GRP) or in vivo when these {{progenitor}} cells are transplanted into lesion sites (but probably not in normal development, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rat optic nerve). Type-2 astrocytes are the major astrocytic component in postnatal optic nerve cultures that are generated by O2A cells grown {{in the presence of}} fetal calf serum but are not thought to exist in vivo.|$|E
25|$|Modern mayflies have {{eliminated}} all the instars between imago and nymph, except the single instar called subimago, {{which is still}} not (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> males) fully sexually mature. The other flying insects with incomplete metamorphosis (Exopterygota) have gone a little further and completed the trend; here all the immature structures of the animal from the last nymphal stage are completed at once in a single final moult. The more advanced insects with larvae and complete metamorphosis (Endopterygota) have gone even further. An interesting theory {{here is that the}} pupal stage is actually a strongly modified and extended stage of subimago, but so far it {{is nothing more than a}} theory. Interestingly enough there are some insects within the Exopterygota, thrips and whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), who have evolved pupae-like stages too.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, {{historian}} Norman Cantor, in In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World It Made (2001), suggests the Black Death {{might have been}} a combination of pandemics including a form of anthrax, a cattle murrain. He cites many forms of evidence including: reported disease symptoms not in keeping with the known effects of either bubonic or pneumonic plague, the discovery of anthrax spores in a plague pit in Scotland, and the fact that meat from infected cattle was known to have been sold in many rural English areas prior to the onset of the plague. The means of infection varied widely, with infection in the absence of living or recently dead humans in Sicily (which speaks against most viruses). Also, diseases with similar symptoms were generally not distinguished between in that period (see murrain above), <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Christian world; Chinese and Muslim medical records can be expected to yield better information which however only pertains to the specific disease(s) which affected these areas.|$|E

500|$|Background vocals on [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] and [...] "Your Star" [...] were {{performed}} by The Millennium Choir, which {{worked with the}} band on several songs on Fallen. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said the album consists of gothic rock songs with brooding lyrics and Lee's vocals accompanied by pianos, strings and choirs. Other genres present on the album are heavy metal, opera and pop music. Jim Farber of Daily News explained, [...] "Evanescence's music again isn't quite metal (unless you think Creed qualifies). Neither is it exactly pop (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current R sense of the term). But the resulting hybrid offers a genuine alternative to everything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|D'Angelo and {{his crew}} also {{utilized}} a hip hop production style, which often subordinates song structure to a stable foundation for a rapper's delivery and flow. This was familiar to D'Angelo, as his first original recordings were rap demos. Subsequently, most of the songs were performed without a definitive structure, settling into a mid-tempo groove with minimal verse-chorus-bridge progression. This also resulted in an emphasis on texture over both structure and hooks. New York writer Ethan Smith noted this occurrence, stating [...] "most of the songs aren't really songs at all -- <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional sense". While not predominant on the album, some tracks incorporate sampling. Most of its production was influenced by hip hop producer J Dilla's input. On J Dilla's influence, Questlove stated [...] "He's the zenith of hip-hop to us. Jay Dee helped {{to bring out the}} album's dirty sound and encouraged the false starts and the nonquantized sound of the record".|$|E
500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{track is}} [...] "American Wedding", a 7-minute remake of [...] "Hotel California" [...] by American rock band Eagles. The track expresses an extended {{tale of a}} shotgun marriage and subsequent divorce. Its here that we [...] "might get a little peek into {{the psychology of the}} man shirking the foremost genre for love songs: He doesn't believe in love. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States." [...] The song has a [...] "totally unexpected ending for a song told as a flashback." [...] The album ends with [...] "Nature Feels", a reinterpretation of MGMT's [...] "Electric Feel". The song exhibits Ocean as an [...] "openly fun character", opening the song with the line [...] "I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden." [...] According to Pitchfork, no matter the mood, Ocean is always [...] "quick to add fine particulars that make his songs his songs". Pitchfork called [...] "Nature Feel" [...] an [...] "MGMT-sampling Garden of Eden fuck ode".|$|E

500|$|Critic Allan Raible of ABC News {{compared}} the song to earlier Radiohead songs [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] and [...] "Pyramid Song" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} compositions Thom Yorke and company have ever released." [...] Richardson gave the song a score of seven out of ten in Pitchforks song review feature The Playlist, and wrote that while it could be criticized as [...] "a noble but failed experiment, overly maudlin and sentimental even if it is surface-level pretty", the song's [...] "simplicity and unsubtle affect, especially coming from this band, wind up being strengths." [...] In a later column, Richardson would further defend the song from charges of excessive sentimentality and attributes the song's emotional success to its severe subject, death: [...] "If these pieces were connected to thoughts of breaking up with a girlfriend or getting fired or lamenting cold weather or any of a million other of life's tragedies, they wouldn't work, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way. They need that huge weight [...] on the other end to balance them out." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV.com called the song a [...] "slow, florid affair" [...] and placed its [...] "typically dark" [...] lyrics in the context of Radiohead's previous political activism, such as their participation in the anti-human trafficking MTV EXIT campaign.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{an urban}} legend {{that a person}} who has used LSD more than seven times is {{automatically}} declared legally insane. The same claim is often suggested with large doses, the difference being that the person is considered psychotic only {{for the duration of the}} trip. An extension of this legend is {{that a person who}} does LSD more than [...] "X number of times" [...] is permanently disqualified from the military as a result of being [...] "legally insane," [...] a version which was likely inspired by wishful thinking of drug-using draft dodgers in the 1960s.

But, since that happy turn of times, when we were so miraculously preserved by just an inch, from Popery, slavery, massacre, and the Pretender, I must own it prudence in us, still to go on with the same cry, which hath ever since been so effectually observed, that the true political dirt is wholly removed, and thrown on its proper dunghills, there to corrupt, and be no more heard of.|$|E
