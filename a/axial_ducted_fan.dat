Performance of an axial fan is severely impaired by many factors mostly related to system instabilities due to rotating stall and surge phenomenon experienced during its operation. The present work involves measuring the sound spectrum measurements in <b>ducted</b> <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> under stall conditions at frequency range from 9000 Hz to 9600 Hz. Objective of the experiment is to measure the frequency domain signal and study the sound Characteristics in <b>ducted</b> <b>axial</b> <b>fan</b> by using spectrum analyser. Different types of FFT signals have been measured under stall conditions for the frequency range of 9000 Hz to 9600 Hz with respect to rotor speed and different graphs are plotted for <b>ducted</b> <b>axial</b> <b>fan...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the design of an <b>axial</b> flow <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> driven by a {{reciprocating}} engine. The solution minimizes the turbulization of the flow around the aircraft. The fan has a rotor - stator configuration. Due to the need for low weight of the fan, a carbon/epoxy composite material was chosen for the blades and the driving shaft. The fan is designed for optimal isentropic efficiency and free vortex flow. A stress analysis of the rotor blade was performed using the Finite Element  Method. The skin of the blade is calculated as a laminate and the foam core as a solid. A static and dynamic analysis were made. The RTM technology is compared with other technologies and is described in detail. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the control of a thrust {{vectored}} flying wing known as the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan,</b> developed at California Institute of Technology. The experiment was developed {{to serve as a}} testbed for nonlinear control design. In an earlier paper, the authors reported simulation results based on a simplified (no aerodynamics involved) planar model of the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> around hover position. In this paper we report on the modeling and simulation of the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> in forward flight, where aerodynamic forces and moments can no longer be ignored. A receding horizon scheme is developed to generate trajectories for the forward flight model. Using a more simplified version of the model, some aggressive trajectories are generated. These trajectories are then used as a reference in the receding horizon scheme, and morphed into the trajectories of the full model. Simulation results depict the capabilities of the <b>ducted</b> <b>fan</b> as well as this methodology in performing aggressive maneuvers. Keywords: <b>ducted</b> <b>fan,</b> thrust vectored aircraft, receding horizon control,nonlinear control design. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} this study is the noise {{generation}} by <b>ducted</b> <b>axial</b> <b>fans.</b> The work is chiefly concerned with the impact of source models on the excitation of the induct acoustic modes, and their effect on the total induct transfer function defined as the ratio of the induct to the free-field sound power. In the models, the sources are represented by static point sources (monopoles and dipoles) distributed along the stator vanes. These sources are assumed to be fully uncorrelated for broadband noise. Following Tyler and Sofrin, the sources are correlated and linear phase-shifted for the generation of rotor-stator interaction tones. The results show that the choice between monopole (volume) and dipole (force) sources does have a significant influence on the level of the excited induct modes. Whereas monopoles equally excite modes of positive and negative azimuthal order, the mode pattern generated by dipoles features a strong asymmetry between positive and negative modes. Based on the ray theory, it is shown that induct modes whose phase angle of propagations are perpendicular to the dipole axis are not excited. For both single and uncorrelated sources, the total induct transfer function tends asymptotically to one at high frequencies, which means that the influence of the duct on the total sound radiation can be neglected at hig...|$|R
