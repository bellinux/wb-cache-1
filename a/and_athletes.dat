40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether {{collective}} efficacy can mediate the association between (a) coach-athlete relationship <b>and</b> <b>athlete</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> (b) team cohesion <b>and</b> <b>athlete</b> satisfaction. The sample consisted of 135 Greek-Cypriot athletes who participated in interactive sports and responded to four questionnaires including the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sport, Greek Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire, Group Environment Questionnaire and three subscales of the Athlete Satisfaction Questionnaire. The results from a series of regression analyses indicated that dimensions of collective efficacy have the capacity to explain the association between the quality of the coach-athlete relationship <b>and</b> <b>athlete</b> satisfaction as well as between team cohesion <b>and</b> <b>athlete</b> satisfaction. Unity, preparation, and ability were dimensions of collective efficacy that appeared to be the best mediators. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and {{at the high school}} and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches <b>and</b> <b>athletes</b> tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E

Another event was presented by the Disney Imagineers, who explored the science of special effects and amusement park technology, from roller coasters and fireworks to motion capture and artificial fog.|$|E
5|$|Ice sledge {{hockey is}} open only to male {{competitors}} with a physical disability {{in the lower}} part of their body. The game is played using international hockey rules with some modifications. Athletes sit on sledges with two blades that allow the puck to go beneath the sledge. They also use two sticks, which have a spike-end for pushing and a blade-end for shooting. The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major impairment in both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate impairment in their extremities <b>and</b> <b>athletes</b> in group 3 have good balance and mild impairment in their upper and lower limbs.|$|E

A training restriction went into effect on 31 December 2009 where only host nation Canada <b>and</b> <b>athletes</b> from developing nations were allowed to train before the 2010 Games. For the 2009–10 season, there were a total of 15736 runs among bobsleigh (2512), luge (8794), and skeleton (4070) with a total of 115 crashes among the three sliding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number of sports <b>and</b> <b>athletes</b> is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E

5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's {{instructions to}} refurbish the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events <b>and</b> <b>athletes,</b> and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century <b>and</b> <b>athletes</b> from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
5|$|As {{world opinion}} {{hardened}} against South Africa during the 1960s because of apartheid, international governing bodies in various sports introduced boycotts of South African teams <b>and</b> <b>athletes.</b> Until 1976, non-whites were legally {{barred from the}} South Africa cricket team, and, as the law required matches to be racially homogenous, this also applied to visiting squads. The South African government provoked overseas ire in 1968 when it refused entry to the England cricket team because its proposed tour party included Basil D'Oliveira, a Cape Coloured. Amid the ensuing scandal, Marylebone Cricket Club (which then governed English cricket) called off the tour. Two years later, a tour of England by the South Africa cricket team was cancelled by the English Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) at a week's notice following public protests and immense pressure from the UK government. South Africa did not play another official international cricket match until 1991.|$|E
