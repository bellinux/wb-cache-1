5|$|Amateur astronomers {{continue}} to make scientific contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy and {{it is one of the}} few scientific disciplines where amateurs can still make significant contributions. Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets. They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars. Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of astrophotography.|$|E
5|$|Elwood Haynes (October 14, 1857– April 13, 1925) was an American inventor, metallurgist, {{automotive}} pioneer, entrepreneur and industrialist. He {{invented the}} metal alloys stellite and {{martensitic stainless steel}} and designed {{one of the earliest}} automobiles made in the United States. He is recognized for having created the earliest American design that was feasible for mass production and, with the Apperson brothers, he formed the first company in the United States to produce automobiles profitably.

5|$|Submarine eruptions are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption that occurs underwater. An estimated 75% of the total volcanic eruptive volume is generated by submarine eruptions near mid ocean ridges alone, however because of {{the problems associated with}} detecting deep sea volcanics, they remained virtually unknown until <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s made it possible to observe them.|$|E

Silk indeed occupies a privileged place in history on account of this.|$|E

5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{scientific study of}} stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that {{the color of a}} star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} much of the {{morphogenesis}} of organisms from fertilized egg to adult began to be unraveled after the discovery of the homeobox genes, first in fruit flies, then in other insects and animals, including humans.

5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. <b>Advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Believing that {{it would}} be an {{advantage}} for his son to gain a greater technical knowledge, Lilly sent Josiah to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy in 1880. Upon returning to the family business in 1882, Josiah was named superintendent of the laboratory. In 1890, Lilly turned over the day-to day management of the business to Josiah, who ran the company for thirty-four years. The company flourished despite the tumultuous economic conditions in the 1890s. In 1894, Lilly purchased a manufacturing plant to be used solely for creating capsules. The company made several technological <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manufacturing process, including the automation of capsule production. Over the next few years, the company annually created tens of millions of capsules and pills.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich Christian Accum or Frederick Accum (March 29, 1769 – June 28, 1838) was a German chemist, {{whose most}} {{important}} achievements included <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of gas lighting, {{efforts to keep}} processed foods free from dangerous additives, {{and the promotion of}} interest in the science of chemistry to the general populace. From 1793 to 1821 Accum lived in London. Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science.|$|E
5|$|I-174 {{departed}} from the major Japanese naval base at Truk on 16May1943 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Nobukiyo Nanbu and arrived off Sandy Cape, Queensland on 27May. She was the only Japanese boat operating off Australia at the time, as all other available submarines were deployed to counter Allied <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Islands. She made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on the American ship Point San Pedro on 1June, exchanged gunfire with U.S.Army transport EdwardChambers three days later, and on 5June was driven off by convoy PG53's escorts. On 7June, I-174 fired four torpedoes at the American Liberty ship John Bartram, all of which missed. She sighted another convoy on 13June, too far away to attack. During this period, she was repeatedly attacked by Allied aircraft and warships, but did not sustain any damage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the {{distinguished}} Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson promoted {{the ideas that}} Maya cities were essentially vacant ceremonial centres serving a dispersed population in the forest, and that the Maya civilization was governed by peaceful astronomer-priests. These ideas began to collapse with major <b>advances</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov. With breakthroughs in understanding of Maya script since the 1950s, the texts revealed the warlike activities of the Classic Maya kings, and {{the view of the}} Maya as peaceful could no longer be supported. Detailed settlement surveys of Maya cities revealed the evidence of large populations, putting an end to the vacant ceremonial centre model.|$|E
