5|$|After leaving WWE, Moretti {{began working}} in the {{landscaping}} industry. Moretti also worked with her niece to help the pet population affected by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, Moretti volunteered for an organization called Best Friends Animal Society, which is a no-kill animal shelter (a shelter that does not euthanize to control animal populations) in Utah. She also worked with her local animal shelter on San Juan Island in northwestern Washington, where she has resided since 2000. While working <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelter,</b> she met her eventual business partner Jessica Ray, with whom she opened Downtown Dog in 2007. The facility is an animal daycare, {{as well as a}} training, grooming, and cat boarding company located in Friday Harbor, Washington. In June 2007, they expanded the business to include veterinary care and later the Bow Wow Bus, which takes the dogs on outings. Moretti has taken classes to learn how to groom animals and now grooms them as part of the business.|$|E

Months later, following the tragic events involving Hurricane Katrina in the Gulf Coast throughout August2005, she was featured as a head-lining performer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shelter</b> from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast concert charity benefit. Carey, wearing a non-formal ensemble of a pink tank-top and blue jeans, performed [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] alongside a large church choir. According to Nielsen Media Research, the special was viewed by over twenty-four million United States citizens, airing on over twelve different cable channels and in ninety-five countries. Following the beginning of 2006, and the continued charting of the album, Carey was nominated for eight Grammy Awards, the most she had received in one night throughout her career. Due to the continued success of The Emancipation of Mimi, Carey decided to return to the Grammy stage for the 48th annual ceremony, held on February8,2006, for the first time since 1996. The performance opened with a pre-taped video of Carey discussing the importance of religion and God in her life, and how it helped her get through difficult times as a child and adult.

Midway through the song, a black temporary wall was removed, revealing a large choir, who joined Carey for the song's gospel climax.

40|$|Lake Waikare is a large, shallow {{eutrophic}} lake devoid of submerged macrophytes. I investigated potential methods for re-establishing submerged macrophytes {{in the lake}}. Specifically, I subjected charophyte (Chara corallina) plantlets to two treatments of exposure in the lake (in areas exposed and sheltered from wind) to test for survival and growth under these conditions, and inside and outside fish exclosures to test for growth and survival {{in the presence of}} fish. While plantlets grew outside the exclosures in winter, their accumulated biomass over 21 days was less than protected plantlets. In winter, the accumulated biomass was lower outside than inside exclosures (by ~ 40 %) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheltered</b> site and was lower outside than inside exclosures (by 43 %) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> exposed site. Overall, growth rates in winter were higher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheltered</b> site (compared to the exposed site) by ~ 7 %. In summer, charophyte accumulated biomass inside the exclosures increased by 85 %, while <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheltered</b> site accumulated biomass increased by 58 %. Outside the exclosures in summer the plantlets were completely removed at both sites. Overall, growth rates where higher <b>at</b> <b>the</b> exposed site than <b>the</b> <b>sheltered</b> site by 31 %. Fish were responsible for the partial removal of plantlets in winter and total removal of plantlets in summer, and therefore affect the survival and growth of charophytes in Lake Waikare. <b>The</b> embayment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheltered</b> site provides <b>the</b> best location in winter for re-establishment of charophytes from oospores because better growth rates were obtained there, and its sheltered location provides protection from severe wave action found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> exposed site. Oospores did not germinate after being submersed in the lake for 90 days due to heavy sedimentation. To induce an improvement in the present light climate, Alum was tested to determine its effectiveness and longevity for settling lake sediments to allow charophytes to establish and grow. Examining the settling rates of Lake Waikare sediments and water treated with Alum over a range of suspended sediment concentrations and time intervals, sediments settled faster with Alum than without for at least 15 days (at 200 g l^ 1 suspended sediment concentration) and it remained active to 60 days but at reduced effectiveness. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> other concentrations tested (100 g l^ 1 and 300 g l^ 1 suspended sediment concentration), Alum responses were insignificant. An improved light climate achieved by fish removal or Alum treatment will likely not be sufficient to permit the re-establishment of submerged macrophytes due to the turbid, algal-dominated state of the lake. The present nutrient and sediment levels, wave climate and fish influence must be mitigated so charophyte plantlets can be established...|$|R

40|$|Homelessness in South Africa is a multi-faceted {{issue with}} {{enormous}} dimensions; an issue which is deeply interrelated {{with questions of}} power, human dignity and social justice. In South Africa, women have been frequently neglected and marginalized with regard to contemporary housing policy and practice. In seeking {{to understand the nature}} of this marginalization, this paper focuses on structural disadvantages faced by homeless women in relation to <b>the</b> <b>shelter</b> regimes. To illustrate the latter, I engage excerpts from four in-depth interviews which I conducted in 2014 with homelessness social workers employed in homeless <b>shelters</b> and <b>the</b> government in Johannesburg, South Africa. Social workers’ narratives present a glimpse of how inclusion and exclusion is constructed in every day practices <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>shelters.</b> <b>The</b> <b>shelters</b> under investigation are exclusively for women. The results reveal that 1) migrant homeless women are preferred by <b>the</b> <b>shelters</b> 2) homeless women construct idiosyncratic modalities to manage the perceived shame that seem to accompany the homelessness condition and 3) women who are categorized as mothers with minor children are the most vulnerable. I draw implications from these findings that in order to understand how inclusion and exclusion criterion is constructed in everyday practices it is necessary to delve into the details of <b>the</b> homeless women <b>shelter</b> regimes as presented by social workers employed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> specific <b>shelter</b> under investigation...|$|R
