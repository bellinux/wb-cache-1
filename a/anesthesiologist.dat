40|$|<b>Anesthesiologists</b> in Taiwan had the {{heaviest}} workload {{compared with other}} Taiwanese specialists. In a previous study, anesthesia-related mortality was > 12 times the rate reported in the USA, UK, and Japan. Nine percent of Taiwanese <b>anesthesiologists</b> left their jobs to work as general practitioners in clinics. This study aims to assess the current working conditions of <b>anesthesiologists</b> in Taiwan and their satisfaction with their occupation, and to identify the factors associated {{with the intentions of}} <b>anesthesiologists</b> in Taiwan to leave anesthesia practice. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire was completed by 474 attending <b>anesthesiologists</b> in Taiwan. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the t test for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify the factors significantly associated with the willingness of <b>anesthesiologists</b> to continue in anesthesiology. Results: The sample <b>anesthesiologists</b> worked 59. 9 hours/week, however a reasonable length of time to work is 49. 6 hours/week.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Given {{the high}} levels of stress in <b>anesthesiologists</b> and also their close working liaison with surgeons, it may be {{worthwhile}} to compare the personality profiles of these two groups of professionals. AIM: To compare the personality profiles of surgeons and <b>anesthesiologists,</b> using a well-standardized and validated instrument. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Survey (cross-sectional) on surgeons and <b>anesthesiologists</b> working in several medical institutes in India. MATERIAL &#x 0026; METHODS: The self-report Temperament and Character Inventory, 125 -item version (TCI- 125) was mailed out to an incidental sample of surgeons and <b>anesthesiologists</b> working in medical institutes in India. Of the 200 questionnaires sent (100 to <b>anesthesiologists</b> and surgeons each), 93 completed responses were returned (46 <b>anesthesiologists,</b> 47 surgeons; return rate 46. 5 &#x 0025;). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Student&#x 2032;s unpaired &#x 2032;t&#x 2032; test; P< 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The mean scores of <b>anesthesiologists</b> vis-a-vis surgeons on the various temperament dimensions were Novelty seeking: 8. 6 vs. 9. 2; Harm avoidance: 7. 3 vs. 8. 1; Reward dependence: 8. 1 vs. 8. 0; and Persistence: 3. 0 vs. 3. 1, respectively. Similar scores for the character dimensions were Self-directedness: 16. 9 vs. 15. 9; Cooperativeness: 17. 5 vs. 16. 5; and Self-transcendence: 7. 0 vs. 6. 7, respectively. There {{was no significant difference between}} the surgeons and <b>anesthesiologists</b> on any of the temperament and character variables of personality chosen for the study. CONCLUSION: Personality measures did not differ significantly between surgeons and <b>anesthesiologists</b> in this preliminary investigation.

Perceived stress was very high {{in the early years}} of training. There was a negative correlation between age and emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, but positive correlation with personal accomplishment. Female <b>anesthesiologists</b> had higher personal accomplishment, but lower depersonalization points than male <b>anesthesiologists</b> in our study. There was no statistical association between marital status, PSS, and MBI; ≥ 2 children group had a significant high personal accomplishment but low depersonalization and emotional exhaustion scores.

Robbins receives a grant to aid children in Malawi, which leads to a falling out between her and Torres. While in Malawi, Robbins is replaced by Dr. Robert Stark (Peter MacNicol), a pediatric surgeon with an interest in Dr. April Kepner, who appears occasionally until season eight. Following the breakdown of Dr. Torres' relationship with Dr. Robbins, Dr. Sloan and Dr. Torres unite, and she becomes pregnant. Torres' relationship with Robbins is subsequently mended, and the couple endeavors to raise their new daughter, Sofia Robbin Sloan Torres, with the help of Dr. Sloan.

25|$|The {{incidence}} of anesthesia awareness is higher {{and has more}} serious sequelae when muscle relaxants or neuromuscular-blocking drugs are used. This is because without relaxant the patient will move and the <b>anesthesiologist</b> will deepen the anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesia {{awareness}} {{occurs when}} general anesthesia is inadequately maintained, {{for a number}} of reasons. Typically, anesthesia is 'induced' with an intravenous drug, but 'maintained' with an inhaled anesthetic given by the <b>anesthesiologist</b> (note that several other methods safely and effectively maintaining anesthesia). Barbiturates are used only for induction of anesthesia and these drugs rapidly and reliably induce anesthesia, but wear off quickly. A neuromuscular blocking drug may then be given to cause paralysis which facilitates intubation, although this is not always required. The <b>anesthesiologist</b> has the responsibility to ensure that the maintenance technique (typically inhalational) is started soon after induction to prevent the patient from waking up.|$|E

An updated report by the American Society of <b>Anesthesiologists</b> and the Society of Cardiovascular <b>Anesthesiologists</b> Task Force on transesophageal echocardiography 2010), esophageal varices are not an absolute contraindication to TEE.

An updated report by the American Society of <b>Anesthesiologists</b> and the Society of Cardiovascular <b>Anesthesiologists</b> Task Force on Transesophageal Echocardiography 2010). Studies have reported that TEE significantly improved the intraoperative management of patients undergoing OLT (Suriani et al. 1996; Rafferty et al. 1993).

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesModern {{international}} studies portray {{the lack of}} knowledge of patients regarding the education and role of <b>anesthesiologists.</b> There are no current data on this subject in the national scenario. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the level of knowledge of patients about the education and areas of performance of these specialists. MethodsThis is a prospective study undertaken at a tertiary university hospital in São Paulo. During an 18 -month period preoperative patients were interviewed. The data were analyzed by the Fisher's exact test, Chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney test according to the variable investigated. In the study, an α risk≤ 0. 05 of making a type I error was considered. ResultsFour hundred patients, 203 (50. 75 %) males and 197 (49. 25 %) females, aged between 18 and 89 years were included in this study. A total of 207 patients (51. 75 %) recognized <b>anesthesiologists</b> as physicians. Two hundred and eighty-nine (72. 25 %) patients answered that <b>anesthesiologists</b> care for patients during surgeries, while 256 (64 %) did not know that <b>anesthesiologists</b> determine whether patients are fit to undergo surgery.
