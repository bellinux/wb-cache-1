25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b>|$|E
50|$|All three {{currently}} licensed anti-HCMV drugs {{target the}} viral DNA polymerase, pUL54. Ganciclovir (GCV) acts as nucleoside analogue. Its antiviral activity requires phosphorylation by the HCMV protein kinase, pUL97. The second drug, Cidofovir (CDV), is a nucleotide analogue, {{which is already}} phosphorylated and thus active. Finally, Foscarnet (FOS) has a different mode of action. It directly inhibits polymerase function by blocking the pyrophosphate binding site of pUL54 (note: investigational drug letermovir acts through a mechanism that involves viral terminase).Two HCMV proteins are implicated in antiviral resistance against these three drugs: pUL97 and pUL54. Specific mutations in pUL97 can cause reduced phosphorylation activity of this viral protein kinase. Thus, fewer monophosphorylated - and thus active - GCV can be synthesized, leading to antiviral resistance against GCV. About 90% of all GCV resistances are caused by such mutations in UL97. Mutations in pUL54 may have different effects leading to antiviral drug resistance: A. They can lead to decreased affinity to antiviral compounds. This resistance mechanism concerns GCV, CDV and FOS and may lead to multidrug resistance. B. Some mutations in pUL54 can increase the polymerase’s exonuclease activity. This causes enhanced recognition of incorporated GCV and CDV. As a result, these dNTP analogues are excised more efficiently.Major risk factors for HCMV drug resistance are the residual capacity of the host’s immune system to control viral replication and the overall amount and duration of viral replication.HCMV <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> can be detected by phenotypic or by genotypic drug resistance testing. Phenotypic resistance testing involves cultivation of the virus in cell culture and testing its susceptibility using different antiviral drug concentrations {{in order to determine}} EC50 values. In contrast, genotypic resistance testing means the detection of resistance associated mutations in UL97 and UL54 by sequencing. Genotypic resistance testing is becoming the method of choice because it is faster, but requires previous phenotypic characterisation of each newly found mutation. This can be performed via a web-based search tool that links a patient’s HCMV sequence to a database containing all published UL97 and UL54 mutations and corresponding antiviral drug susceptibility phenotypes.|$|E

GCV resistance mutations {{have been identified in}} both genes, while FOS and CDV mutations occur only in the DNA polymerase gene. Confirmation of resistance mutations requires phenotypic analysis; however, phenotypic assays are too time-consuming for diagnostic purposes.

40|$|Background: The {{potential}} for emergence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> during influenza pandemics has raised great concern for public health. Widespread use of antiviral drugs {{is a significant}} factor in producing resistant strains. Recent studies show that some influenza viruses may gain <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> without a fitness penalty. This creates the possibility of strategic interaction between populations considering antiviral drug use strategies. Methods: To explain why, we develop and analyze a classical 2 -player game theoretical model where each player chooses from a range of possible rates of antiviral drug use, and payoffs are derived as a function of final size of epidemic with the regular and mutant strain. Final sizes are derived from a stochastic compartmental epidemic model that captures transmission within each population and between populations, and the stochastic emergence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> High treatment levels not only increase the spread of the resistant strain in the subject population but also affect the other population by increasing the density of the resistant strain infectious individuals due to travel between populations. Results: We found two Nash equilibria where both populations treat at a high rate, or both treat at a low rate. Hence the game theoretical analysis predicts that populations will not choose different treatment strategies than other populations, under these assumptions. The populations may choose to cooperate by maintaining a low treatment rate that does not increase the incidence of mutant strain infections or cause case importations to the other population. Alternatively, if one population is treating at a high rate, this will generate a large number of mutant infections that spread to the other population, in turn incentivizing that population to also treat at a high rate. The prediction of two separate Nash equilibria is robust to the mutation rate and the effectiveness of the drug in preventing transmission, but it is sensitive to the volume of travel between the two populations. Conclusions: Model-based evaluations of antiviral influenza drug use during a pandemic usually consider populations in isolation from one another, but our results show that strategic interactions could strongly influence a population's choice of antiviral drug use policy. Furthermore, the high treatment rate Nash equilibrium has the potential to become socially suboptimal (i. e. non-Pareto optimal) under model assumptions that might apply under other conditions.

Vaccination and antiviral treatments are the sole and essential way for the prevention and control of influenza infection. During an influenza epidemic before the production of effective vaccine, antiviral treatments are the first step for the prevention and treatment of influenza infection. Adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors are influenza antiviral drugs. Because of the increase of drug resistant viruses, the aim of this study was the evaluation of the <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> in influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses from 2005 - 2013 in Iran. Methods: In this study 50 influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses isolated in cell culture were tested. All samples were subjected to M and NA gene sequencing at the National Influenza Center, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences. RNA was ex-tracted from 200 µl of cell culture supernatants using the Roche high pure viral nucleic acid kit. RT-PCR with the Qiagen one step RT-PCR kit was done. The expected size of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 1 % agarose gels. The PCR products were sequenced for finding the drug resistant mutants. Results: All influenza A/H 3 N 2 viruses except four viruses circulating during 2005 - 2006 had Ser 31 Asn mutation at M 2 channel protein.

Mutations that occurred at a significantly higher frequency in the ART failure than the naïve-therapy group were submitted to the Stanford HIV <b>Drug</b> <b>Resistance</b> Database (SHDB) to analyze the correlation between HIV mutations and <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> For mutations whose impact on the <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> response is unknown, the site-directed mutagenesis approach was applied to construct plasmids containing the screened mutations. 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) to AZT, EFV and NVP was measured to determine {{the response of the}} genetically constructed viruses to <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> RESULTS: 7 mutations at 6 positions of the RT region, D 123 E, V 292 I, K 366 R, T 369 A, T 369 V, A 371 V and I 375 V, occurred more frequently in the ART failure group than the naïve-therapy group. Phenotypic characterization of these HIV mutants revealed that constructed viruses with mutations A 371 V and T 369 V exhibited dual resistance to AZT and EFV respectively, whereas the other 5 mutations showed weak resistance. Although the impact of the other six mutations on response to NVP was minimal, mutation T 369 V could enhance resistance to NVP. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that mutations at the RT C-terminal in subtype B' could result in resistance to RT inhibitors if the mutations occurred alone, but that some mutations could promote susceptibility to <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{concern for}} pharmaceutically active {{compounds}} (PhACs) as contaminants {{in the environment}} and the need to assess their environmental risk have greatly increased since the early nineties. Among PhACs, antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> are of important concern due to their role in growing antibiotic and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>resistance</b> among pathogenic bacteria and influenza viruses, respectively. Besides resistance issue, the compounds may upset sensitive ecosystems as they are designed to be highly bioactive. Clinically-important antibiotics are virtually ubiquitous contaminants in sewage water and surface water. Notably, recent emergence of novel influenza and use of anti-influenza drugs (specially Tamiflu®) during seasonal influenza、 influenza epidemics and for future pandemic are of emerging concern. Every year seasonal influenza epidemic causes tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250, 000 to 500, 000 deaths worldwide. WHO (World Health Organization) recommend the use of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> Tamiflu® during pandemic, as they are easy to use. Currently only Japan uses over eighty percent of Tamiflu® prescribed globally during common seasonal influenza. It is a fact that a huge amount of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> and antibiotics (for post infection cure of respiratory illness) will be used during an influenza pandemic and will arrive to sewage treatment plants (STPs). Unfortunately, these compounds behaviors are mostly unknown in both conventional and advanced STPs. The exposure of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> in the wild fowl gut and its implications for hastening the generation of antiviral-resistance in avian influenza viruses are also an emerging issue. The major objective of this thesis work was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in sewage treatment plants and their fate in different sewage treatment plants. The specific objectives were as follows: (a) to established appropriate analytical method for the selected antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in sewage treatment plants, (b) to investigate the occurrence and removal of antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in sewage treatment plants differ in technology and operation conditions; and (c) to predicts environmental concentration of the target compounds during a pandemics and appraisal of appropriate technology to reduce the risk associated with widespread use under pandemic conditions. In this study we selected twenty antibiotics: one beta-lactam: ampicillin; four macrolides: azithromycin, clarithromycin and roxithromycin; five quinolones: ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, levofloxacin, nalidixic acid and norfloxacin; two tetracycline: tetracycline and oxytetracycline; five sulfonamides: sulfadimethoxine, sulfadimizine, sulfamerazine, sulfam- ethoxazole and sulfamonomethoxine; and four others: lincomycin, novobiocin, salinomycin and trimethoprim. Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®) and amantadine (AMN) were selected as <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs.</b> This dissertation consists of nine chapters: Chapter I describe the background and objective of the study and chapter II represent a brief literature review. In Chapter III, analytical methods for selected antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> (for the first time) in water and wastewater were described. In Chapter IV, the occurrences and fate of antibiotics in sewage treatment plants were investigated in Japan and China. Clarithromycin was detected in the highest concentration in influent (1129 to 4820 　ng/L), followed by azithromycin (160 to 1347 　ng/L), levofloxacin (255 to 587 　ng/L) and norfloxacin (155 to 486 ng/L) and sulfamethoxazole (159 to 176 ng/L) in Japan. Ozonation as tertiary treatment of secondary effluent for wastewater reclamation provided significant elimination of antibiotics. Fifty present of the selected antibiotics were removed over eighty percent during ozonation. There was no elimination of antibiotics in dissolve phase during ultra filtration. From Chapter IV a hypothesis was drawn on antibiotics removal and its relation with longer sludge retention time (SRT) in STPs and in Chapter V the role of nitrifier in antibiotics removal was evaluated to verify the hypothesis established from Chapter IV. Nitrifying activated sludge (NAS) can biodegrade the tested antibiotics with different biodegradation rate between　 2. 74 to 9. 95 L/gSS/d. Sulfamethoxazole and sulfamerazine degraded faster than trimethoprim, clarithromycin and enrofloxacin. In Chapter VI, occurrence of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in sewage water discharge and in river water in Japan was conducted during seasonal influenza epidemic and their fate in different sewage treatment facilities were evaluated in Chapter VII. This is the fist findings of <b>antiviral</b> (anti-influenza) <b>drugs</b> in the environment in the world {{and for the first time}} the removal mechanism in STPs was elucidated. Finally, it was observed that only primary and secondary treatment processes in STPs were not sufficient to remove these compounds significantly. Overall OC and AMN removal in STP with ozonation as tertiary treatment was 90 % and 96 % respectively. In ozonation batch experiment, Chapter VIII, (feed ozone gas concentration 4. 0 mg/L, ozone gas flow rate 0. 23 L/min to maintain ozone feed rate of 0. 6 mg/L/min), it was observed that AMN and OC concentration decreased linearly with time in all the experiments conducted and it can be, therefore, said that the degradation reactions follow pseudo first-order reaction. The k'O 3 (pseudo first-order rate constant for O 3) of AMN was 0. 596 /min (0. 00993 /sec), and OC was 0. 524 /min (0. 008725 /sec) and over 99 % removal within 10 min. Chapter VIII described the predicted OC and antibiotics concentration in STPs influent, secondary effluent, after advance tertiary treatment (ozonation) and receiving water during a pandemic with three expected infection scenario (according to US CDC FluAid model 2. 0) in Kyoto city. Both <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> and antibiotics pose an environmental risk associated to there widespread use during a future pandemic. Ozonation as tertiary treatment can provide a technological solution to reduce the ecotoxicological effect of antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> uses during a pandemic. In a full scale STP, the <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> (OC and AMN) reduction were over 90 % from secondary effluent after ozonation during seasonal influenza outbreak in Kyoto city in 2008 / 2009. Finally, (1) analytical methods for commonly used antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> in water sample was developed with an excellent precision and accuracies, (2) both antibiotics and <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs</b> were detected in environmental sample, and their behavior in STPs were elucidated. Antivirals in this study were the first time findings in sewage water. This study will provide a surrogate for planning a pandemic preparedness action plan for sewage treatment pants for ecotoxicological risk management.

40|$|International audienceLicensed oral {{agents for}} {{antiviral}} therapy {{in patients with}} chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection include lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, and telbivudine. Emtricitabine, tenofovir, and the combination of tenofovir plus emtricitabine in 1 tablet, which are licensed {{for the treatment of}} human immunodeficiency virus infection, are additional off-label options for treating HBV infection. Preventing HBV <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> to nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and appropriate management when resistance occurs has become a major focus in the management of chronic hepatitis B. HBV <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> may be best prevented by using an agent or combination of agents with a high genetic barrier to resistance, and 2 potent nucleoside and nucleotide drugs with different resistance profiles may prove to be the optimal first-line treatment for chronic hepatitis B. Frequent assessment of quantitative serum HBV DNA remains the best approach to early detection of resistance, and antiviral therapy should be modified as soon as resistance is detected. Results from several clinical trials have shown that the addition or substitution of newer antiviral agents can restore suppression of viral replication, normalize alanine aminotransferase levels, and reverse histologic progression in patients with resistance to lamivudine, but little information exists regarding the long-term benefits of second-line treatment regimens. Despite the substantial advances in treatment made to date, new agents with novel viral targets will be needed for patients who ultimately may fail second- or third-line therapy...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project on <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> of influenza viruses circulating in Portugal {{has been carried}} out since 2007. Here, the first results obtained regarding the evaluation of susceptibility to amantadine and oseltamivir are presented. Information about antiviral prescription and exposure was available through the National Influenza Surveillance Programme. Amantadine susceptibility was evaluated by pyrosequencing for known resistance markers on 178 influenza A strains from 2004 / 2005 to 2006 / 2007. Susceptibility to oseltamivir was evaluated by 50 % inhibitory concentration determination on 340 virus strains from 2004 / 2005 to 2008 / 2009, 134 of which were further analyzed by sequencing of the neuraminidase gene. This study revealed that influenza antiviral drugs were rarely prescribed at national level. Resistance to amantadine was observed on only A(H 3 N 2) strain isolated during 2005 / 2006 and on 38 (74. 5 %) of the 51 A(H 3 N 2) strains from 2006 / 2007, all carrying the mutation S 31 N in their M 2 sequence. Oseltamivir resistance was observed in 6 (20. 7 %) of the 29 A(H 1 N 1) strains from 2007 / 2008 and in all strains from 2008 / 2009, which exhibited extremely high IC(50) values and carrying the mutation H 275 Y in their neuraminidase sequence. The national data generated and analyzed in this study may contribute to increase the knowledge on influenza <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> which is a problem of global concern...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{overcoming}} of <b>antiviral</b> <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> is {{an important}} challenge {{in the treatment of}} HIV- 1 infection. According to the theory of viral error catastrophe, slightly increasing the mutation rate could exceed the error threshold for viability of a viral population and kill it. Investigation of this mechanism could lead to the discovery of new antiviral agents capable of bypassing viral resistance. To this aim, we designed several modified nucleosides. We describe here the synthesis and partial evaluation of 8 -amido- 2 '-deoxyadenosine. The supplementary amide group on the base should allow base-pairing with several natural nucleosides, thus creating supplementary mutations that would kill the virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{influenza}} A virus M 2 proton channel equilibrates pH {{across the}} viral membrane during entry {{and across the}} trans-Golgi membrane of infected cells during viral maturation. It is an important target of adamantane-family <b>antiviral</b> <b>drugs,</b> but <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> has become a critical problem. Two different sites for drug interaction have been proposed. One is a lipid-facing pocket between 2 adjacent transmembrane helices (around Asp- 44), at which the drug binds and inhibits proton conductance allosterically. The other is inside the pore (around Ser- 31), at which the drug directly blocks proton passage. Here, we describe structural and functional experiments on the mechanism of <b>drug</b> inhibition and <b>resistance.</b> The solution structure of the S 31 N drug-resistant mutant of M 2, a mutant of the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H 5 N 1, shows that replacing Ser- 31 with Asn has {{little effect on the}} structure of the channel pore, but dramatically reduces drug binding to the allosteric site. Mutagenesis and liposomal proton flux assays show that replacing the key residue (Asp- 44) in the lipid-facing binding pocket with Ala has a dramatic effect on drug sensitivity, but that the channel remains fully drug sensitive when replacing Ser- 31 with Ala. Chemical cross-linking studies indicate an inverse correlation between channel stability and <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> The lipid-facing pocket contains residues from 2 adjacent channel-forming helices. Therefore, it is present only when the helices are tightly packed in the closed conformation. Thus, drug-resistant mutants impair drug binding by destabilizing helix-helix assembly...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{infection}} with hepatitis B virus (HBV) leads to adverse clinical outcomes in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) {{because of increased}} hepatic complications. The use of oral nucleos(t) ide analogs (NAs) has brought the management of HBV infection in RTRs to a new paradigm. Lamivudine (LAM) can effectively suppress HBV DNA levels, normalize liver biochemistry, and significantly improve short- and long-term patient survival in HBsAg-positive RTRs. However, it has the burden of high <b>drug</b> <b>resistance.</b> The prevention and management of drug-resistant HBV infection in RTRs has emerged as an important clinical issue. In treatment-naïve hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -positive RTRs, ETV has demonstrated high efficacy, low resistance rates, and favorable tolerability. Entecavir can also significantly improve transaminasemia in LAM-resistant patients, although the virological response is relatively modest {{in comparison to the}} virological response in treatment-naïve patients. Adefovir (ADV) and tenofovir (TDF) are viable options for LAM-resistant HBV infection in RTR; however, their use in patients with moderate to severe allograft dysfunction entails a balance between the potential risk and benefit, the appropriate dose adjustment, and allograft function monitoring for nephrotoxicity. The long-term patient survival of HBsAg-positive RTRs has significantly improved with the progress in these effective antiviral treatments, and is approaching the survival rate of their HBsAg-negative counterparts. Many efficacious options of first-line and rescue therapies are available, but the choice of NA in HBsAg-positive RTR should take into consideration <b>antiviral</b> potency, <b>drug</b> <b>resistance</b> pattern, renal allograft function, and the cost and availability of drugs in different localities...|$|R
40|$|The saliva is {{indispensable}} for preservation of healthy mouth and teeth, {{due to its}} composition and physical and chemical properties.
