Because I needed something in the show that was meaningless, because there is always something in the dream that doesn't make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> In this case it was the Cheese Man. He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing as {{a witness}} at the Leveson Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a {{recording}} of Paul McCartney's phone calls or answer phone messages and had ever played it to Piers Morgan or [...] "anybody else", she replied, [...] "Never, ever." [...] Giving evidence in December 2011, Morgan, who bragged in a newspaper column for the Daily Mail in 2006 about hearing the message, refused to say who had played him the recorded message of the call, saying he was protecting a source. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan was [...] "a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years and would have relished telling the inquiry if I had played a personal voicemail message to him." [...] In the official findings of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson said Morgan's testimony under oath on phone hacking was [...] "utterly unpersuasive. This was not, in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> a convincing answer" [...] and [...] "What it does, however, clearly prove {{is that he was}} aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it."

If significant, this trade effect would cast doubt on the oft-stated conclusion that economic growth automatically leads to environmental improvement. Research has been insufficient, although a number of promising approaches have been developed. Although evidence on the pollution-haven hypothesis is mixed, there is enough to suggest that the EKC development path may not be available to today's developing countries.

2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{marriage}} equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, We actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker to our home. When the social worker arrived, she had to sit us down to talk to us {{to make sure that this}} was a fit home.Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s, said [...] "I never had <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality.

2500|$|In the Register's {{earliest}} years, {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPO were small, understaffed and underfunded. Indeed, money was tight, but funds {{were still being}} supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first in house museums [...] and institutional buildings but later in commercial structures as well. During this time period, the SHPO had little time to devote to serious planning, even if it wanted to; the demands of saving historic properties and building the organizations {{from the ground up}} consumed most of the early state office's resources. As a result, neither the State Historic Preservation Offices nor OAHP really took planning seriously. In 1969 Connally told Charles Lee, a State Historic Preservation Officer from South Carolina, [...] "write a paragraph of two on each of these headings. Call it 'The Preliminary South Carolina Historic Preservation Plan.'

5000|$|One {{implication}} of a determined will, Harris says, {{is that it}} becomes unreasonable to punish people out of retribution—only behaviour modification and the deterrence of others still seem to be potentially valid reasons to punish. This, especially because behaviour modification {{is a sort of}} cure for the evil behaviours; Harris provides a thought experiment: [...] Consider what would happen if we discovered a cure for human evil. Imagine, for the sake of argument...the cure for psychopathy can be put directly into the food supply like vitamin D...consider, for instance, the prospect of withholding the cure for evil from a murderer as part of his punishment.

5000|$|Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine gave Heaven, Heartache and the Power of Love {{four and}} a half out of five stars, noticing that she has [...] "never sounded better" [...] with the release of the album. Keefe also {{mentioned}} that the album should receive recognition from country radio because [...] "more than half" [...] of the album's songs could be used as radio singles: [...] "Hopefully, Big Machine will make better choices in that regard than MCA did, because if country radio has <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> left <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> Heaven, Heartache, and the Power of Love should allow Yearwood to return {{to the top of the}} charts.

[...] The 9513's Jim Malec gave the release five out of five stars, calling the album in general [...] "breathtaking". Malec noted that the difference between a [...] "good album" [...] and a [...] "great" [...] comes because the choice of material, saying that Yearwood recorded a [...] "great album": [...] "The difference between a good album and a great album always-always-comes down to songs and song selection.

40|$|This text {{seeks to}} {{introduce}} the statements worked by the english thinker John Locke who, when forging an idea of society in the seventeen century, shows for the society a way to assimilate what has been proposed by him, which is {{the formation of the}} man through a political project, with the assumptions of liberalism argued by him. The initial point that will be highlighted is that, when forming the civil society, the men understood it as a form of political organization, so creating an institutional way so they could be bound to anything that could bring them guarantees, and it is always good to remember that the pursuit of such guarantees comes to the protection of life, personal security and mainly, of their property.

40|$|Although {{the name}} of the folklorist Peter Kireevskii is well known to historians of nineteenth-century Russia, {{comparatively}} little has been written about his place within the Slavophile circle. Some scholars have treated him as the 'first' Slavophile. Others have questioned whether his views were in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> really Slavophile <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> This article argues that Peter Kireevskii's life-long interest in Russian folklore was rooted both in his understanding of the Russian countryside and his exposure to the influence of a Russian Romantic tradition that viewed the narod as the authentic representative of national identity. It suggests that Kireevskii was from his youth convinced that Russia possessed a culture and history that was equal in value to any country in the West, but that {{it was only in the}} late 1830 s that he stressed the role played by Orthodoxy in shaping Russia's development. Although his mature views brought him closer to the Slavophile 'mainstream', there were always some elements that set him apart, perhaps reflecting the fact that Slavophilism was a more eclectic and diverse phenomenon than sometimes realized...|$|R

60|$|And then {{a strange}} thing happened. England, that had not in the modern <b>sense</b> <b>any</b> army <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> was {{justified}} of all her children. Respected institutions and reputations did indeed waver and collapse on many sides: though {{the chief of the}} states replied worthily to a bribe from the foreign bully, many other politicians were sufficiently wild and weak, though doubtless patriotic in intention. One was set to restrain the journalists, and had to be restrained himself, for being more sensational than any of them. Another scolded the working-classes in the style of an intoxicated temperance lecturer. But England was saved by a forgotten thing--the English. Simple men with simple motives, the chief one a hate of injustice which grows simpler the longer we stare at it, came out of their dreary tenements and their tidy shops, their fields and their suburbs and their factories and their rookeries, and asked for the arms of men. In a throng that was at last three million men, the islanders went forth from their island, as simply as the mountaineers had gone forth from their mountain, with their faces to the dawn.|$|R

Whether she had compromised herself or whether she had not seemed a question for the future rather than the present with him, a native islander, born when old island marriage views prevailed in families; he was fixed in his disapproval of her marriage with a hated Pierston.

60|$|Thus, man {{is capable}} of being truly affirmed of John, George, Mary, and other persons without {{assignable}} limit; and it is affirmed {{of all of them}} in the same sense; for the word man expresses certain qualities, and when we predicate it of those persons, we assert that they all possess those qualities. But John is only capable of being truly affirmed of one single person, at least in the same sense. For, though there are many persons who bear that name, it is not conferred upon them to indicate any qualities, or any thing which belongs to them in common; and can not be said to be affirmed of them in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> consequently not in the same sense. “The king who succeeded William the Conqueror,” is also an individual name. For, that there can not be more than one person of whom it can be truly affirmed, is implied in the meaning of the words. Even “the king,” when the occasion or the context defines the individual of whom it is to be understood, may justly be regarded as an individual name.|$|E
60|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we have to}} ask {{ourselves}} whether, in <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> {{there is such a thing}} as matter. Is there a table which has a certain intrinsic nature, and continues to exist when I am not looking, or is the table merely a product of my imagination, a dream-table in a very prolonged dream? This question is of the greatest importance. For if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we cannot be sure of the independent existence of other people's bodies, and therefore still less of other people's minds, since we have no grounds for believing in their minds except such as are derived from observing their bodies. Thus if we cannot be sure of the independent existence of objects, we shall be left alone in a desert--it may be that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream, and that we alone exist. This is an uncomfortable possibility; but although it cannot be strictly proved to be false, there is not the slightest reason to suppose that it is true. In this chapter we have to see why this is the case.|$|E
