25|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of the total hydrogen capacity, the intermediate compound LiH must be dehydrogenated as well. Due to its high thermodynamic stability this requires temperatures in excess of 400°C, which is not considered feasible for transportation purposes.

Another problem related to hydrogen storage is the recycling back to LiAlH4 which, owing to its relatively low stability, requires an extremely high hydrogen pressure in excess of 10000 bar. Cycling only reaction R2 — that is, using Li3AlH6 as starting material — would store 5.6 wt% hydrogen in a single step (vs. two steps for NaAlH4 which stores <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amount</b> of hydrogen).

To regulate {{the formation of}} these substances, mutation was carried out with an alkylating agent: ethylmethyl sulphonate (EMS). Screening the mutants generated for the levels of the traits expressed, four major groups were obtained. These are poor, moderate, good and super producers of either glucose or protein. They produced the properties at 0 - 1. 00, 1. 01 to 1. 99 (moderate) and 2. 0 to 2. 99 (good) and 3. 0 and above (super) mg. mL– 1 of each substance. The classes were made up of 37, 40, 20 and 3 mutants for glucose production and 13, 35, 40 and 12 mutants for protein synthesis. The wild strain bacterium made 0. 86 mg. mL– 1 glucose and 1. 2 mg. mL– 1 protein describing the M. luteus as poor glucose maker and moderate protein producer. It was also noticed that the mutation caused some variants (25 %) to form more glucose than protein; the remaining 75 % of the population {{are made up of}} two sets viz: mutants having better ability to synthesise protein at higher concentrations than glucose and those that formed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of <b>the</b> substances.

Recruitment in this non-clonal species relies exclusively on seeds. The population density rose significantly with increasing altitude. A mean number of 368 seeds per m 2 was observed. Whereas the quantity of the generative rosettes (metamers) was relatively constant, the annual seed production strongly varied and was found vulnerable, particularly in 1996, when it was suppressed by unfavorable weather conditions. In 1997 seed production again reached the usual level, when <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of seeds were recorded as in previous years, indicating the strong resistance of elevated E. nanum populations against the severe climate at high altitudes. With rising population density, E. nanum produces distinctly higher seed numbers. This increasing amount of seeds seems essential for the persistence of its uppermost populations. Our results indicate that it {{is caused by the}} rising number of rosettes/ surface and not a higher reproduction by single rosettes. Compared to other alpine species, the seed weight of E. nanum (average 0. 76 mg) is high. Most of its neighboring species are clonal, producing much lighter seeds. The strategy of producing heavy seeds favors successful recruitment and appears to be decisive for an obligatory seeder such as E. nanum...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of mengovirus in Novikoff rat hepatoma cells is progressively reduced {{with an increase}} in incubation temperature of the cells from 34 to 40 C, in spite of <b>the</b> fact that <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>amounts</b> of single-stranded and double-stranded viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) are synthesized at 34, 37, and 40 C; the rate of overall protein synthesis is as high at 40 C as at 37 C. At 40 C, progeny viral RNA accumulates in an undegraded form without being incorporated into virus particles. The results suggest that virus maturation is preferentially inhibited at supraoptimal temperatures. At 42 C, on the other hand, no viral RNA is produced and no viral RNA polymerase activity is detectable in cell lysates. Failure of infected cells to form viral RNA polymerase at 42 C is probably due to an impairment of protein synthesis since most of the polyribosomes are rapidly lost during incubation at 42 C and the rate of amino acid incorporation into protein is 70 % lower at 42 C than at 37 C. When infected cells are shifted from 37 to 42 C during the period of active viral RNA synthesis, viral RNA polymerase activity is rapidly lost from the cells, and viral RNA synthesis ceases within 45 min. In contrast, the RNA polymerase is as active in vitro at 42 C as at 37 C, and the activity is relatively stable at 42 C...|$|R
