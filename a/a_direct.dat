5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>directed</b> graph {{is called}} weakly {{connected}} if replacing {{all of its}} directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph.

In this paper we present an efficient algorithm which constructs to a given graph a representation by <b>a</b> family of <b>directed</b> paths on <b>a</b> <b>directed</b> tree, if one exists.
