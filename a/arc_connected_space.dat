The main aim of this text is to study P_ I^α(X) s and compare them. Most interest is in α∈{ω,c} and I∈{ P_fin(X),{∅}}, where P_fin(X) denotes the collection of all finite subsets of X. We denote P_{∅}^α(X) with P^α(X). We prove the following statements: ∙ for <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> topological <b>spaces</b> X and Y if P^α(X) is isomorphic to P^α(Y) for all infinite cardinal number α, then π_ 1 (X) is isomorphic to π_ 1 (Y); ∙ there are <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> topological <b>spaces</b> X and Y such that π_ 1 (X) is isomorphic to π_ 1 (Y) but P^ω(X) is not isomorphic to P^ω(Y); ∙ for <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> topological <b>space</b> X we have P^ω(X) ⊆ P^c(X) ⊆π_ 1 (X); ∙ for Hawaiian earring X, the sets P^ω(X), P^c(X), and π_ 1 (X) are pairwise distinct. So P^α(X) s and P_ I^α(X) s will help us to classify the class of all <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> topological <b>spaces</b> with isomorphic fundamental groups...|$|R

40|$|A <b>space</b> is n-strong <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> (n-sac) if for any n {{points in}} the space there is an arc in the space visiting them in order. A <b>space</b> is ω-strong <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> (ω-sac) if it is n-sac for all n. We study these {{properties}} in finite graphs, regular continua, and rational continua. There are no 4 -sac graphs, but there are 3 -sac graphs and graphs which are 2 -sac but not 3 -sac. For every n there is an n-sac regular continuum, but no regular continuum is ω-sac. There is an ω-sac rational continuum. For graphs we give a simple characterization of those graphs which are 3 -sac. It is shown, using ideas from descriptive set theory, {{that there is no}} simple characterization of n-sac, or ω-sac, rational continua. Primary 54 F 15, 54 H 05; Secondary 54 F 50.

40|$|Subspace {{and product}} topologies Problem 1. Are the {{subspace}} and product topologies {{are consistent with}} each other? Let {Xα}α∈A be a collection of topological spaces and let {Yα} be a collection of subsets; each Yα ⊂ Xα. There {{are two ways to}} put a topology on Y = α∈A Yα: 1. Take the subspace topology on each Yα, then form the product topology on Y. 2. Take the product topology on X, then equip Y ⊂ X with the subspace topology. Is the outcome the same either way? If yes, prove it using only the universal properties. Connectedness The definitions of connected, path connected, locally connected and locally path con-nected are in Section 4 of May’s notes [1]. Definition 1. Define an arc in a space X to be an path I → X that is an embedding. A <b>space</b> X is <b>arc</b> <b>connected</b> if every two points can be <b>connected</b> by an <b>arc.</b> Prove (to yourself) that arc-connected ⇒ path-connected ⇒ connected. The fol-lowing problem gives an example of a path <b>connected</b> <b>space</b> that is not <b>arc</b> <b>connected.</b> Problem 2. Let X = { 2, 3, 4, 5, [...] . }. For any k ∈ X, let Uk = {n ∈ X: n divides k}. Check that the sets {Uk} form a basis for a topology on X and prove that it is path connected and locally path connected but not arc-connected.
