He deserves more. He's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift.

That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy because he is <b>a</b> <b>GOOD</b> <b>guy</b> and that's what George is. He is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> and that's something that Lexie could use now.

[...] Fleming agreed with some critics' characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer, but expressed that he was a product of his time: [...] "James Bond is a healthy, violent, noncerebral man in his middle-thirties, and a creature of his era. I wouldn't say he's particularly typical of our times, but he's certainly of the times." ...|$|E

500|$|Rockstar drew upon game protagonist archetypes {{during the}} {{scripting}} the characters; Trevor {{was considered to}} embody insanity. Houser said the team characterised Michael and Trevor as juxtapositions of each other. He said, [...] "Michael is like the criminal who wants to compartmentalise and be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> {{some of the time}} and Trevor is the maniac who isn't a hypocrite". He said that having three lead characters would help move the game's plot into more original territory than its predecessors, which traditionally followed a single protagonist rising through the ranks of a criminal underworld. In Grand Theft Auto V, Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor. During the initial audition process, Ogg noticed an on-set chemistry between him and Ned Luke (who portrayed Michael), which he felt helped secure them the roles. Ogg said, [...] "When [...] and I went in the room together we immediately had something". While the actors knew their auditions were for Rockstar Games, it was when they signed contracts that they learned they would be involved in a Grand Theft Auto title. Ogg felt Trevor's characterisation had evolved over time.

[...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>guy</b> really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an accident victim as he does not want his [...] "brand new car" [...] to be soiled with blood.

Soon, however, he is distracted by women playing in a fountain in the shopping mall and panics, running into a CCTV camera operation room monitoring women's changing rooms. Discovering that a lady in a fitting room is having a heart attack, he appears to rush to her aid, performing CPR and saving her life.
