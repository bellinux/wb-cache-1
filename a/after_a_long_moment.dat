6000|$|... "What then am I {{to say to}} them?" [...] Lord John spoke but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> {{during which}} he had only looked hard and--an {{observer}} might even then have felt--ominously at his taskmaster.|$|E
50|$|Tetrahedron: Round 3 boss. Lightning {{can appear}} around boss that kills player. When it splits, {{the boss is}} {{replaced}} by spheres, bars, stars, and halos, with {{only one of them}} is the true boss, which reveals itself <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> The impostors enemies self-destruct after a while.|$|E
5000|$|When the Frenchman {{arrived at}} the stadium, on the stroke of 4.30pm, making {{his way through the}} Jeeps of the police which gave a real feeling of {{something}} special happening, 12,000 people had already taken their place in the stadium. On the track, Renée Vissac was busy beating the women's record. The Stéphanois [...] watched her not without some amusement, exchanged small talk, then went to his cabin, while his entourage measured the strength of the wind: matches blew out and the smoke from cigarettes stretched out horizontally. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> Rivière reappeared. He was wearing a helmet covered in nylon, varnished shoes and a world champion's jersey made of silk. He rode a few laps of the track behind a scooter and then stopped.|$|E
60|$|Presently a black-maned male {{raised his}} head, and, with cocked ears and glaring eyes, gazed {{straight}} at the bush behind which we lay. I could have sworn that he had discovered us, and {{when he took a}} few short and stately steps in our direction I raised my rifle and covered him. But, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> tense <b>moment</b> he looked away, and turned to glare in another direction.|$|R
60|$|The rustlers growled or {{laughed at}} their leader's order. Snap {{turned to his}} task. Mescal {{stood in the doorway}} and shrinkingly {{extended}} her clasped hands. Holderness whirled to the fire with a look which betrayed his game. Snap bound Mescal's hands securely, thrust her inside the cabin, and <b>after</b> hesitating for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> finally shut the door.|$|R
5000|$|To {{prepare for}} the date, Marge ironed her hair to make it straight, but burned it brown by accident, which she {{explains}} was why Homer did not recognize her in high school. She met Homer, and <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> awkward <b>moment</b> of self-consciousness for both, they finally kissed, leading each to dream of being in an imaginary paradise (both equally colorful, though Marge's paradise is a high fantasy fairy tale while Homer's is a darkly comedic candy land where Homer devours all living things that he sees ahead). They agreed that the following night they would meet again, but Homer did not come for Marge, who waited the entire night and left in the morning deeply saddened. Marge mentions that because of boy Homer she could not trust another boy for years. Homer then gives {{his side of the}} story explaining why he did not show up. He claims that right after the date, during which he had given Marge a heart-shaped rock he had found, he was so dazed with bliss that he accidentally fell off a cliff into the lake and drifted to a fat camp, [...] "Camp Flab-Away", which counted Mayor Quimby, Chief Wiggum and Comic Book Guy as its participants. He is caught by the Camp Instructor (who does not distinguish between boys who drift into the camp and actual participants).|$|R
5000|$|On video, we {{see another}} Pilot and Passengers party, this time being hosted by Georg and Anna. In [...] "life," [...] we see Anna and Georg {{at a concert}} of the choir Benny is in. The choir sings: [...] "Despite the ancient dragon, despite the gaping jaws of death, despite the {{constant}} fear, let the world rage and toss. I stand here and sing in perfect calm." [...] On video, we see from the door of Benny's darkened bedroom, standing slightly ajar, and we hear faint voices discussing what to do. In life, a voice-over asks, [...] "Why {{did you come to}} us now?" [...] We see Benny being interviewed by policemen, and he answers merely, [...] "Because." [...] With no following questions, Benny asks, [...] "Can I go now?" [...] After the questioning, Benny meets Georg and Anna in the hall and, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> says merely, [...] "Entschuldigung." [...] (Excuse me, as it is used to apologize for brushing by a stranger in a crowded location.) ...|$|E
50|$|In a local {{department}} store, Jane {{is shifting}} through a rack and Tony appears. She orders him to leave, {{so it will}} not attract attention when she steals the blouse, but before he moves away, she asks him what colour the shirt is, as she is colour blind. Annoyed, she shoves the blouse {{down the front of}} her pants but is caught by a floor manager. Tony distracts the security guard and manager by breaking a mirror and shouting, allowing both him and Jane to escape. Jane then begins to warm up to Tony. Over milkshakes, they talk about their families, Tony tells her his dad is gone and his mother drowned in a lake trying to save him. They then depart when Jane begins to itch for another fix. She tries to work at her usual corner, but her fellow prostitutes shoo her away because Dr. Gordon came around looking for her, informing them Jane has HIV. After a failed attempt at taking another hooker's purse, Jane encounters another prostitute, who is willing to help her. She gives Jane an address for a hotel where a sleazy wanna-be director is filming a porno, but will pay $250 for her services. Jane goes, finds the motel room filled with five men who will be on camera with her, and is about to go through with it, but changes her mind as the men hold her down and the director shouts at her to struggle more. Desperate now, Jane decides to rob a convenience store with a toy gun, but the attempt fails. Tony comes out and helps her escape, but not before Jane takes the money from the register. She goes back to her dealer, but <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> of just looking at one another, Jane reconsidering and thinking about what Tony said to her, Jane leaves.|$|E

60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> none spoke. Then Kulan Tith {{cleared his}} throat.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{stood looking}} at him for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> before she spoke.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} me for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> each {{looked into}} the other's eyes with a {{singular}} intentness that nothing here would seem to warrant.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in {{speechless}} horror, {{both women}} stared at him, until, perceiving them, blankest surprise invaded his stern face.|$|R
60|$|They {{looked into}} each other's eyes for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> And then, hand in hand, they walked {{slowly into the}} palace.|$|R
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> {{montage of}} clips {{from the movie}} shown before were played, there is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> of silence before the wall begins to fall apart, {{accompanied}} by a scream of agony and terror from Pink.|$|R
60|$|She stopped again, {{clenching}} and unclenching her fingers, as if {{she were}} strangling some living thing. There was silence for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|The park seemed full of shrill, {{piercing}} strife. It swelled, {{reached a}} highest pitch, sustained that for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> and then declined.|$|R
60|$|Lionel {{looked at}} him for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, sitting up a little. Then he sank back again slowly against Sir John's breast.|$|R
60|$|But he did {{not speak}} a word. He {{remained}} motionless for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> his eyes pale and steady, his right hand like a claw.|$|R
60|$|Sully {{stared at}} his master for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in stupefied silence, his loyal Huguenot soul refusing to {{discount}} by flattery the truth that he perceived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lend me that glass," [...] demanded Guy, forcefully. He {{surveyed}} {{the band of}} men for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> then he handed the glass back to Jean.|$|R
6000|$|Verrian rose awkwardly {{and stood}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> before his chair. Then he dropped back again, saying, dryly, [...] "I don't think I {{want to ask}} it anything." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus face to face, each {{looking into}} the eyes of the other, they stood for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> the jostling crowd {{streaming}} past them, unheeded. Then Andre-Louis laughed.|$|R
5000|$|During [...] "Whiskey Business" [...] in the 24th season Carl and Lenny {{hold hands}} {{together}} for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> and then release while standing together through a limo moonroof.|$|R
60|$|Rosamund {{sank down}} upon the divan, and sat there with bowed head, her hands folded in her lap. Sakr-el-Bahr stood by in silence for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> contemplating her.|$|R
60|$|She let {{him take}} her fingers in his and raise them to his lips, and then they stood looking into each other's eyes in silence for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
60|$|Rotherby {{closed the}} door after him, and {{returned}} slowly, head bowed, to the window where his mother was still seated. They {{looked at each other}} gravely for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... [MRS. BRADMERE {{stares at}} his smiling face <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> in [...] silence, then with a little sound, half sniff, half snort, she [...] goes to the door. There she halts.] ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could find}} no voice to answer her, and for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> we were locked in an embrace, breast to breast and lips to lips, an embrace of sweet pain.|$|R
60|$|Knell waited <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} his face broke its cold immobility in an {{extraordinary}} expression of devilish glee. He had hounded the great Poggin into something that gave him vicious, monstrous joy.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> of silence, {{during which}} he studied certain pencilled entries against the name. The {{sections}} had {{been working in the}} last few weeks much more systematically than was generally suspected.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are ignorant," [...] he {{repeated}} thoughtfully. He had raised his head, {{and was looking}} straight into her face now, while she held his hand. They stood like this for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> She released his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> {{she looked}} at him. Then {{brushing}} aside the tears that dimmed her sight, she set a hand on either of his shoulders, and stood so, before them all, gazing up into his calm face.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> {{the girl}} let her level gaze rest full upon {{the face of}} Astok of Dusar. Then she spoke, and though the words were few, the unimpassioned tone carried unfathomable depths of cold contempt.|$|R
60|$|Her {{manner of}} uttering it {{suggested}} that it awakened memories, memories perhaps of the departed youth with which it was associated. And she paused <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> considering him, <b>a</b> little wide-eyed, what time he bowed before her.|$|R
