50|$|The {{official}} RIAA standard defines three time-constants <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis</b> rising indefinitely above 75 µs, but {{in practice}} this is not possible. When the RIAA equalization standard was written the inherent bandwidth limitations of the recording equipment and cutting lathe imposed their own ultimate upper limit on the pre-emphasis characteristic, so no official upper limit {{was included in the}} RIAA definition.|$|R

These devices are of paramount importance to enable multi-gigabit data transmission over conventional copper interconnects. The proposed models preserve the accuracy and efficiency strenghts of behavioral parametric macromodels for conventional devices. Their operation is demonstrated in a realistic simulation example involving a 3. 125 Gb/s commercial driver <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Low-Life is {{the third}} studio album by English rock band New Order. Released in May 1985 by Factory Records, Low-Life is {{considered}} to be among New Order's strongest work, displaying the moment at which the band completed its transformation from post-punk hold-overs to dance rockers. The album shows New Order's increased incorporation of synthesizers and samplers, while still preserving the rock elements of their earlier work. The original Factory release (Japan and UK) CD versions of this album are mastered <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{spectral}} subtraction algorithm [14] {{was implemented}} {{separately from the}} beamformers. Only the outputs of the beamformers were passed to the spectral subtraction algorithm. In the spectral subtraction algorithm, we obtained the frequency-domain signals using the STFT of 256 points <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis</b> and a Hanning window of 16 ms long and 75 % overlap. The reverberation time used in the algorithm was estimated from the beamformer output by the ML method [35]. Noting that this estimator takes {{the advantage of a}} long input signal, we repeatedly refined the reverberation time estimation by using the up-to-date output signals of the beamformers for each utterance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Pre-emphasis of LVDS {{driver for}} HDMI {{transmitter}} (HDMI-TX) is designed and implemented in this paper. HDMI supports high bandwidth and long distance transmission. However, HDMI cable high cost and instability limit its application. Therefore pre-emphasis of LVDS driver is proposed. Compared with traditional LVDS driver, pre-emphasis of LVDS driver can {{compensate for the}} high frequency loss. Through research on the encoding method, and clock frequency reduction technology, a FPGA prototype based on HDMI-TX <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis</b> is implemented. The simulation shows that the FPGA prototype not only effectively saves energy, but also improves reliability. Keywords-HDMI; FPGA; Pre-emphasis; LVDS Driver I...|$|R

50|$|Some CDs are {{mastered}} <b>with</b> <b>pre-emphasis,</b> {{an artificial}} boost of high audio frequencies. The pre-emphasis improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making {{better use of}} the channel's dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. Pre-emphasis time constants are 50µs and 15µs (9.49 dB boost at 20 kHz), and a binary flag in the disc subcode instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or 'ripping' to wave files typically {{does not take into}} account the pre-emphasis, so such files play back with a distorted frequency response.|$|R
