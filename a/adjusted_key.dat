40|$|Self-organization to {{ferromagnetic}} {{phase transition}} in cellular automata of spins governed by stochastic majority rule and when topology between spins is changed, is investigated numerically. Three types of edge rewiring are considered. The algorithm of Watts and Strogatz is applied at each time step {{to establish a}} network evolving stochastically (the first network). The preference functions are defined to amplify the role of strongly connected vertices (the second network). Demand to preserve graph connectivity provides the third way of edge rewiring. Each of these processes yields the different network: small-world, scattered nodes with one strongly connected component, and scale-free network when rewiring is properly adjusted. The stochastic majority rule applied to these networks can lead or not to ferromagnetic transition. Classical mean-field transition in case {{of the first and}} third network is observed.

40|$|Polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) are {{essential}} components of biological membranes and of lipoproteins; they regulate {{a number of}} cellular and physiological processes, mostly by influencing cellular membrane lipid composition, metabolism and signal-transduction pathways, either in a tissue-specific way or by oxidation. The methylene group between two double bonds makes a fatty acid vulnerable to free radical-induced damage converting it to a polar hydroperoxide. This peroxidation is f tremendous importance for the transport of different nutrients through membranes and has a significant function as modulator of enzymes and as intermediate in biosynthetic processes. Moreover, peroxidation plays {{a central role in}} numerous pathological processes such as atherosclerosis and cancer. Two difficulties arise when separating oxidized lipids via HPLC: (1) the amphipathic nature of many membrane lipids makes peak resolution difficult; (2) most membrane lipids lack accessible spectral signals making detection difficult. Using a reverse phase HPLC system tosharpen the peak resolution, we report on an improved method for postcolumn detection of lipid hydroperoxides using diphenyl- 1 -pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) that no longer requires a heated reaction chamber.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of ipsilateral arm move-ment and contralateral hand grasp on the spastic hand opened by open-loop electri-cal stimulation. The major problem of applying proper electrical stimulation is vari-able spasticity, the intensity of which changes with posture and movements of other parts of the body. Electrical stimulation was applied to extensor digitorum communis and ulnar nerve to open the affected hand. Different procedures were then used to assess the effects of moving the ipsilateral forearm and contracting the contralateral normal hand. Electrical stimulation opened the spastic hand in more than 95 % of trials in all subjects, whether stimulation wasapplied before or after the movement of the forearm. Moving the ipsilateral forearm did have an effect on opening the hand, and making adjustment of stimulation intensities was necessary in all subjects. The stimulation opened the spastic hand during the contraction of the contralateral nor-mal hand. Electrical stimulation could open the spastic hands most of the time, in the presence of ipsilateral forearm movement and contralateral normal hand con-traction. If electrical stimulation wasapplied before the ipsilateral forearm wasmoved toward the target, stimulation intensities needed to be <b>adjusted.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: Spas-ticity-Functional electrical stimulation-Hand.

We interpret this as evidence of stock market influencing.

5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, {{the fuel tank}} must first be {{pre-heated}} and pressurized by lighting {{a small amount of}} fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank {{at the base of the}} vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one’s hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan. [...] The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the <b>adjusting</b> <b>key.</b> This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the <b>adjusting</b> <b>key)</b> it opens like a faucet (counter-clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the modeling of non-linear {{operation of a}} silicon waveguide on an insulator of simox type with grating coupler in a dynamic regime, the simulation parameters are determined {{in accordance with the}} experiment, with the aim of achieving fast threshold optoelectronic switches. The optical non-linearities in the silicon are related to the change of the refractive index, and are used to obtain fast switching on the transmitted beam due to the propagation of the fundamental mode in the guide. The performances of these components are highly dependent of its rising time and its sensitivity. We will maximize the latter two. The model of non-linear operation of fast threshold optoelectronic switches are made in the dynamic regime based on the variations of the refractive index caused by both of the creation of free carriers and by the thermal effects due to the recombination of the carriers.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce an advanced concept of Power-to-Gas (PtG) plant, which is designed to bring a closed-loop solution able to absorb electricity surplus and to restore it later, via the transient storage of energy carriers. After a brief conceptual overview of the studied unit and its individual components, the paper introduces the key results of the steady state model used to assess process flowsheets as well as operating conditions of the industrial scale unit. These results indicate that during the storage phase, a 200 MW power supply to the electrolysis process leads to a corresponding 155 MW of Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) produced in a thermally integrated methanation process with an efficiency of 83. 1 %. By producing and storing enough amount of SNG and oxygen, an Oxy-combustion power plant can be subsequently used to recover up to 480 MW electric power as well as to produce CO 2 rich gas with an overall efficiency of 51. 8 %.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} change on animal populations is {{strongly influenced by}} the ability of individuals to plastically <b>adjust</b> <b>key</b> life-history events. There is therefore considerable interest in establishing the degree of plasticity in traits and how selection acts on plasticity in natural populations. Breeding time is a key life-history trait that affects fitness and recent {{studies have found that}} females vary significantly in their breeding time–environment relationships, with selection often favouring individuals exhibiting stronger plastic responses. In contrast, here, we show that although breeding time in the common guillemot, Uria aalge, is highly plastic at the population level in response to a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO), there is very little between-individual variation—most individuals respond to this climate cue very similarly. We demonstrate strong stabilizing selection against individuals who deviate from the average population-level response to NAO. This species differs significantly from those previously studied in being a colonial breeder, in which reproductive synchrony has a substantial impact on fitness; we suggest that counter selection imposed by a need for synchrony could limit individuals in their response and potential for directional selection to act. This demonstrates the importance of considering the relative costs and benefits of highly plastic responses in assessing the likely response of a population to the environmental change. ...|$|R

In the traditional study of queueing theory, a typical ics. assumption is that the server is not subject to failures. This assumption, however, is not realistic for modeling many queueing systems in practice. Since the late 1950 's, there has been research into finding exact or approximate methods that <b>adjust</b> <b>key</b> performance measures of a system to reflect server failures. Many of the methods that have been developed suffer either from a high degree of computational complexity or from tight restrictions on possible system structures feasible for the particular method. In this thesis, an approximation method is formulated which allows for a general system structure (i. e. the distributions for arrival, service, failure, and repair times are arbitrary), and yet maintains computational simplicity and efficiency. This method will be obtained through the implementation of a stationary delayed renewal process and simple modifications of common approximation formulas for a G/G/m queue.

Image analysis is considered a robust technique in high-throughput phenotyping with non-destructive sampling. However, analysis of digital field-derived images remains challenging because {{of the variety of}} light intensities, growth environments, and developmental stages. The plant canopy coverage (PCC) ratio is an important index of crop growth and development. Here, we present a tool, EasyPCC, for effective and accurate evaluation of the ground coverage ratio from a large number of images under variable field conditions. The core algorithm of EasyPCC is based on a pixel-based segmentation method using a decision-tree-based segmentation model (DTSM). EasyPCC was developed under the MATLAB® and R languages; thus, it could be implemented in high-performance computing to handle large numbers of images following just a single model training process.

The core of DATAXRAY combines an intuitive and principled cost model derived by Bayesian analysis, and an efficient, highly-parallelizable diagnostic algorithm that discovers common proper-ties among erroneous data elements in a top-down fashion.

40|$|Dual {{apprenticeship}} training is increasingly {{seen as an}} important educational track that provides youth with the skills necessary for a smooth transition into the labour market. However, providing skills at the workplace rather than at (vocational) school comes at a cost for firms that hire such apprentices. Nonetheless, as apprentices {{become part of a}} firm’s workforce, they also generate a benefit from working productively. This paper provides a theoretical framework and the latest empirical evidence about a firm’s costs and benefits that are associated with offering dual {{apprenticeship training}}. While many aspects of such training are determined by external factors such as government policies, training regulations, and labour market institutions, firms can still influence many other aspects. The available empirical evidence suggests that there is no single optimal model of dual apprenticeship training. However, given the differences in the institutional setting across countries, <b>adjusting</b> <b>key</b> framework conditions can allow training firms to generate a sufficiently high return on their training investments. The main parameters affecting the cost–benefit ratio are apprentice wages, amount of training provided at the workplace, apprenticeship duration, {{and the manner in which}} firms integrate apprentices into the production process (to perform both skilled and unskilled tasks). An important prerequisite to successful apprenticeships, however, is also an adequate supply of suitable apprentices, which in turn (among other factors) depends on the training quality at the workplace, certification of the acquired skills, and future wages and career opportunities from obtaining a vocational qualification...|$|R
