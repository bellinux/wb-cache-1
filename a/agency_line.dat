50|$|In August 1980, the National Earth Satellite Service (NESS) {{was removed}} from the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Services and became a {{principal}} <b>agency</b> <b>line</b> organization in NOAA with an Assistant Administrator who reported directly to the Administrator. This move reflected the increasing importance of satellite observations to NOAA's environmental science and service responsibilities. It was largely precipitated by a decision by the Carter Administration in November 1979 to assign NOAA management responsibility for all civil operational remote sensing from space. NESDIS was formed in 1982 with the merger of NESS and the Environmental Data Service.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is little}} {{difficulty}} when {{the claim is}} that the company either conspired with a second company or {{with at least two}} natural persons. The requisite knowledge can be attributed under either head as appropriate. But there is a problem under the first heading when fraud is involved because there is a clash of authority. Lloyd v Grace, Smith & Co 1912 AC 716 held that a Principal may be liable where the Agent commits a fraud within actual or apparent authority, whereas in In re Hampshire Land Company 1896 2 Ch 743, it was held that the knowledge and, sometimes, the conduct of an Agent acting fraudulently so as to cause loss to the Principal will not be imputed to the Principal. In theory, vicarious liability may be of more assistance in that it is attributing the wrong done by one (natural) person to another (fictitious) but, in Belmont Finance Corporation v Williams Furniture Ltd 1979 Ch 250, the Hampshire Land <b>agency</b> <b>line</b> of authority was preferred. Belmont, a company in liquidation, sued a number of defendants, including the majority of its own directors, for conspiracy to procure Belmont to buy shares in another company at a gross overvalue. The purpose of this plan was to fund the acquisition of shares in Belmont itself by some of the defendants. Foster J. struck out the claim on the basis that Belmont was itself a party to the conspiracy. On appeal, Buckley LJ. said: ...|$|E

40|$|The era {{following}} September 11, 2001 will {{be remembered}} as the golden age of law enforcement, the age of a bold paradigm shift inspired by the great challenges we face. It is instructive first to reflect on the old paradigm: as law enforcement agencies, we moved like swimmers in different lanes, all going the same direction with the same mission, yet also working by and for ourselves. Each criminal justice agency dealt with its own issues, staying—for the most part—in its own lane. Then, 9 / 11 changed everything. Indeed, it is our turn to be the greatest generation. Just as World War II fundamentally changed the world, so too have the events of 9 / 11. It is now our turn to rise to the challenge. We {{can no longer afford to}} fight crime independently; rather, we must build partnerships across <b>agency</b> <b>lines.</b> We can no longer afford to limit access to criminal intelligence to only those officers in a particular agency; rather, we must share information across <b>agency</b> <b>lines.</b> We can no longer afford to react to crimes after they have taken place; instead, we must prevent them in the first place, just as the NYPD has done through its renowned CompStat crime fighting strategy. To become today’s greatest generation, we must fight crime strategically, and we must do so together...|$|R

50|$|In April 2007, the Australian Financial Review's Laura Tingle ran a {{story about}} Henry’s semi-annual speech to staff. In {{the wake of the}} Howard Government's {{development}} of an 10 billion policy proposal, Henry was reported as saying that there was a 'greater than usual risk of the development of policy proposals that are, frankly, bad' in the lead-up to the federal election.’ Former Howard Government ministers suggested that it was a deliberate attempt to have Henry’s critical views aired publicly {{to the detriment of the}} Howard Government, and called it ‘a deliberate piece of political positioning by Henry’ prior to the 2007 federal election. Following the initial controversy, Henry released the full text of the speech, along with clarification. It said, in part, that:The Government, our ministers and other agencies are under no compulsion to rely on our advice. In respect of water, that point is all too obvious. We are competing for influence with other central <b>agencies,</b> <b>line</b> <b>agencies</b> and independent policy advisers, such as think-tanks, commentators and consultants....

Functional categories often cut across <b>agency</b> <b>lines.</b> For example, the National Defense function includes certain Department of Energy {{programs as well}} as Department of Defense programs. Functions are further subdivided into [...] "subfunctions." [...] In addition, though these functions and subfunctions are included in a budget resolution, which determines how Congress considers budget related legislation, they have little correspondence to any committee jurisdictions. Functions are, however, useful in understanding the placement of any given account in the federal government: Each account number has a series of numbers, the last three will indicate the function and subfunction; for example an account ending in [...] "051" [...] will indicate function 050 (Defense) and subfunction 051, which indicates a type of spending within the Defense category.|$|R
