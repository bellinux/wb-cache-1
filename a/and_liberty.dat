5|$|At {{the same}} time, Werber was {{attempting}} to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records <b>and</b> <b>Liberty</b> Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group's music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential. On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{building}} had not officially opened, Comcast office workers began moving in early December 2007, ahead of the scheduled completion in March 2008. The Comcast Center officially opened on June 6, 2008. A study sponsored by Comcast <b>and</b> <b>Liberty</b> Property Trust said {{the construction of the}} Comcast Center created 17,200 jobs and generated US$2 billion of economic activity for Pennsylvania. Despite opposition by other building owners to construction of the Comcast Center, by the time most space in the Comcast Center had been leased vacancy rates in Center City offices were falling and rents were rising. Even HRPT Properties Trust had leased 70 percent of the space Comcast vacated by 2007. The predictions by opponents did not occur mainly because Comcast ended up leasing 89 percent of the building and the offices for the Comcast Center's second largest tenant, Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, were new to the city.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate {{discusses}} the capability <b>and</b> <b>liberty</b> of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis {{asserts that the}} U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor Jeremy Waldron gave the example {{of his ability to}} criticize the president or call the vice president and Secretary of Defense war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 <b>and</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the one on his F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1938, the Broadway Limited {{received}} lightweight streamlined cars {{to replace}} its heavyweight steel cars; {{on the same}} day rival New York Central's 20th Century Limited was streamlined. Raymond Loewy styled the new cars and the PRR GG1 electric locomotive as well as some streamlined steam locomotives for the Pennsylvania, notably the S1 and T1 Duplex drive engines. The Broadway Limited was one of four pre-World War II Pennsylvania trains to receive such equipment; the others being the General (New York–Chicago), Spirit of St. Louis (New York–St. Louis), <b>and</b> <b>Liberty</b> Limited (Washington–Chicago). Other Pennsylvania trains continued to use heavyweight cars until after the end of World War II. Most of the 1938 cars were built new by Pullman-Standard between March and May of that year, but the diners, RPO and baggage cars were rebuilt from heavyweight cars by the railroad's Altoona shops. The Broadway Limited was the only Pennsylvania train to be completely re-equipped with lightweight sleeping cars before World War II. The train's running time was further reduced to 16 hours.|$|E
