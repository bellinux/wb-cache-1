5000|$|First {{introduced}} to the market in 1979 as 0.025% and 0.1% creams, <b>Amcinonide</b> has been available continuously since then, being prescribed {{for a variety of}} similar dermatological symptoms. [...] Lederle Laboratories first manufactured <b>Amcinonide</b> for distribution to countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 1979, marketed under the trade name of Cyclocort, <b>Amcinonide</b> was made available in the United States. Also produced by American Cyanamid, <b>Amcinonide</b> was then marketed to West Germany as Amcinonid beginning in 1981. Shortly thereafter in 1982, Lederle introduced the product to France and Japan as Visderm and Penticort, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the Woodford & Barry {{study in}} 1977, Woodford & Haigh, 1979 sought to {{determine}} the potency of 0.1% <b>Amcinonide</b> {{through the use of}} a vasoconstrictor assay. Three equal strength formulations of <b>Amcinonide</b> were prepared (cream, combination-ointment, combination-cream) were compared against similar corticosteroids already on the market in the United Kingdom (Betnovate, Metosyn, Synalar, Temetex, Dermovate, and Halciderm). It was found that 0.1% <b>Amcinonide</b> cream was significantly more bio-active than other 'potent' classified drugs and was subsequently assigned to the 'very potent' category, as established by the UK MIMS potency classification system. <b>Amcinonide</b> cream was also determined to be bioequivalent to other proprietary corticosteroids on the English market.|$|E
5000|$|After {{acquiring}} production {{rights from}} American Home Products, <b>Amcinonide</b> {{is currently being}} produced in the United States by Taro Pharmaceuticals USA and Fougera, a subsidiary of Sandoz and Novartis. [...] GlaxoSmithKline and Teva Canada also produce <b>Amcinonide</b> for international sales. While most products are manufactured at 0.1% strength ointment, cream, or lotion, {{it is important to}} note that none of the producers sell <b>Amcinonide</b> as an over-the-counter (OTC) medication but only as a prescription product.|$|E
5000|$|Taro Pharmaceuticals {{obtained}} FDA {{approval to}} begin production of <b>Amcinonide</b> cream in 2002 after proving {{the product was}} bioequivalent to Cyclocort products already on the market. This was the first generic <b>Amcinonide</b> product to be sold in the United States, thus introducing a lower-priced alternative for patients with applicable dermatological ailments. [...] In 2003, Fougera Pharmaceutical became the main competitor to Taro after acquiring FDA approval for production of 0.1% <b>Amcinonide</b> cream.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} by Fedler, Pilz, & Frosch, 1993, the long term usage of <b>Amcinonide,</b> along with other topical corticosteroids, was tested on women with a history of dermatitis who had otherwise been relatively healthy. It was found that corticosteroid usage may eventually cause erythematous reactions and spreading hives. The study concluded that contact allergies may be developed, in some cases, when using <b>Amcinonide</b> to treat chronic dermatitis. These findings should be considered when treating dermatological conditions with multiple corticosteroids, including <b>Amcinonide.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the initial}} {{clinical}} studies into <b>Amcinonide,</b> conducted by Woodford & Barry, 1979, compared topical applications <b>Amcinonide</b> to Triamcinolone Acetonide. Specifically, 0.1% strength preparations of each compound were tested against 0.025% Synalar Gel and 0.1% Betnovate Cream using a vasoconstrictor assay to determine bioavailability and anti-inflammatory effects. All formulations had similar bioavailability profiles with {{the peak of the}} curve coming approximately 12 hours after topical administration and covering with an occlusive dressing. Concluding, the study found <b>Amcinonide</b> cream to be the most effective with the highest bio-activity and area under the curve (pharmacokinetics).|$|E

50|$|A French {{study by}} Binet et al., 1979, {{compared}} 0.1% <b>Amcinonide</b> ointment to equal strength Fluocinonide ointment, a similar corticosteroid {{already on the}} market. A double-blind comparative analysis was conducted to determine if <b>Amcinonide</b> was bioequivalent {{for the treatment of}} psoriasis and eczema. Each group contained both males and females of varying ages (mean = 54.8) and compared objective criteria (crust, scales, swelling, etc.) and subjective criteria (itching, burning, pain). It was found that treatment of dermatitis with <b>Amcinonide</b> achieved significant improvement over the one-week trial period, thus demonstrating adequate efficacy in treating psoriasis, eczema, and even parapsoriasis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amcinonide</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s before being patented by the American Cyanamid company. [...] Lederle Laboratories, most famous for {{the discovery of the}} antibacterial tetracycline drug class, began to manufacture of <b>Amcinonide</b> before being acquired by Cyanamid. In 1994, American Cyanamid and its Lederle Lab division was purchased by American Home Products (AHP) before eventually changing the company's name to Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2002. [...] Wyeth Pharma was eventually purchased by rival Pfizer in 2009 for $68 billion although the manufacture of <b>Amcinonide</b> has since been discontinued by the company.|$|E

5000|$|... 0.1% <b>Amcinonide</b> {{cream or}} {{ointment}} is typically applied {{two to three}} times daily to treat dermatitis, psoriasis, and/ or eczema while the same strength lotion is usually only used twice daily.

5000|$|<b>Amcinonide</b> is {{produced}} from {{the reaction of}} 16α,17α-Cyciopentylidenedioxy-9α-fluoro-11β,21-dihydroxy-1,4pregnadiene-3,20-dione and acetic anhydride in which 11.1g and 5.5mL, respectively, of each reactant are consumed to produce 7.0g of pure product. [...] Only 4.7% of patients in clinical trials reported experiencing side effects {{as a result of}} continued use of <b>Amcinonide.</b> Specifically, in one acceptability study conducted on a weekly basis, one-fifth of patients using both placebo and Cyclocort 0.1% lotion reported various discomforts at multiple interviews.

50|$|In organic chemistry, cyclopentanonide is a {{functional}} group which {{is composed of}} a cyclic ketal of a diol with cyclopentanone. It is seen in <b>amcinonide</b> (triamcinolone acetate cyclopentanonide).|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>Amcinonide</b> causes anti-inflammatory responses is unclear with current research focused on similar topical steroids that may possess the same mechanism. [...] This is thought to occur via the induction of lipocortin (phospholipase A2 inhibitor proteins). Ongoing research predicts that <b>Amcinonide</b> presents the release of arachidonic acid which, in turn, stops the synthesis of the inflammation mediators prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Phospholipase A2 normally causes membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid, therefore causing a cascade of reactions leading to inflammation of the skin. Due to Amcinonide's high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, a neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction occurs and the initial acid release is inhibited, thus helping to alleviate any itching/ burning symptoms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amcinonide</b> {{undergoes}} transdermal absorption with pharmacokinetic profiles {{similar to}} that of other corticosteroids administered systematically. Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver and its hepatic cells. The metabolized compound is predominately filtered through the kidneys and excreted in urine although a small amount is excreted in the bile.|$|E
50|$|Cyclocort is a {{synthetic}} corticosteroid created to imitate natural glucocorticoids. In {{order to do}} so, <b>amcinonide</b> acts as an agonist to target glucocorticoid receptors. After interacting with the receptor, endocytosis occurs {{at which point the}} drug can bind to DNA within the cell. Gene expression is subsequently modified to produce anti-inflammatory mediators while preventing the formation of inflammatory agents thus reducing overall inflammation and immune system response.|$|E
5000|$|Corticosteroids applied topically {{are used}} for the relief of the {{inflammatory}} and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, particularly dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. [...] Cyclocort's active ingredient is <b>Amcinonide,</b> with inactive ingredients including petrolatum, benzyl alcohol, sorbitol, butylated hydroxyanisole, propyl gallate, citric acid, glycerin, and/ or propylene glycol. The specific inactive ingredients used depend on the dosage form (ointment, area, or lotion) and help the product retain its chemical and physical integrity while increasing the shelf-life.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amcinonide</b> (trade name Cyclocort) is {{a topical}} {{glucocorticoid}} {{used to treat}} itching, redness and swelling associated with several dermatologic conditions such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis.Amcinonide can also be classified as a multi-functional small molecule corticosteroid, which has {{been approved by the}} FDA and is currently marketed as an ointment, lotion, or cream. [...] It acts as both a transcription factor for responses to glucocorticoids and modulator for other transcription factors while also regulating phospholipase A2 activity.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amcinonide</b> {{exhibits}} {{side effects}} common among other corticosteroids. While these reactions are uncommon for most delivery vehicles, {{the use of}} occlusive dressings {{increases the likelihood of}} such effects. [...] These include burning, itching, skin dryness and irritation, acne/ pimples, skin atrophy, blistering, and/ or skin discoloration. While most side effects are mild, a medical professional should be contacted if severe rash, acne, skin deterioration, excessive hair growth, or abnormal weight gain occur. Following package insert instructions for a single topical dose, as detailed on the package insert, should not lead to any toxicities.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the initial}} patents {{obtained}} by American Cyanamid {{company in the}} late 1970s/ early 1980's for ointment, cream, and lotion formulations have expired, new patents have been obtained for alternative transdermal delivery methods. [...] More recently, however, the drug formulation itself has not been patented but ways to incorporate it into occlusive dressings such as a pressure sensitive adhesive layer as demonstrated by Senju USA, Inc. in 2012 - 2014. Specifically, these new dosage forms target diseases of the eyelid such as blepharitis, allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. [...] This is significant as previous formulations of <b>Amcinonide</b> have not been used to treat ocular inflammations. Patents such as these {{are likely to continue}} to be published as research searches for low cost alternatives to new drugs to increase bioavailability and patient compliance.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Budesonide, {{a marker}} for {{corticosteroid}} allergy, is a 1 : 1 mixture of 2 diastereomers, the R and S, {{present in all}} commercial formulations. Budesonide is said to cross-react with group B substances through the R and S diastereomer and some group D substances only through the S diastereomer. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cross-reactivity pattern between the R and S diastereomers and 4 potentially cross-reacting substances, 2 from group B and 2 from group D. METHODS: By patch testing 10 patients hypersensitive to budesonide with a serial dilution of budesonide, the R and S diastereomer, triamcinolone acetonide, <b>amcinonide,</b> prednicarbate, and hydrocortisone- 17 -butyrate. RESULTS: Nine of 10 patients reacted to budesonide and the S diastereomer. Seven of 9 to the R diastereomer. Each of the 9 patients with S diastereomer allergy reacted to the group B and/or group D substances. Five patients reacted to triamcinolone acetonide, not to 1. 0 % but only to 0. 0010 % and 0. 00010 %. CONCLUSION: The R and S diastereomers can induce positive patch test reactions in budesonide-hypersensitive individuals. The potential of budesonide to cross-react with substances from group B and D might {{be explained by the}} presence of the 2 diastereomers. When patch testing with triamcinolone acetonide, much lower concentrations than recommended should be used. status: publishe...|$|E

The analytical technique comprises a pre treatment procedure and the instrumental {{analysis of the}} trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives, performed by GC–MS (quadrupole) with electron impact (EI) ionization. The derivatization yields obtained by two different derivatizing mixtures, namely N-methyl N(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MTSFA) :NH 4 I:dithioerythritol (DTE) 1000 : 2 : 4 (usually indicated as TMSiodine); and N-trimethylsilylimidazole (TMSim) :N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) acetamide (BSA) :trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) 3 : 3 : 2, both under direct thermal heating and with microwave (MW) irradiation, were evaluated, also {{as a function of}} the temperature, of the MWì power and of the incubation time. The highest yields of the derivatization process were obtained, for most of the compounds here considered, by a two-step procedure: a microwave-assisted derivatization stage (40 min in a microwave oven at 900 Wemitted power), followed by a traditional heat transfer derivatization (1. 5 h in a thermostated bath at 70 ◦C) with the derivatization mixture TMSim:BSA:TMCS 3 : 3 : 2. In these operating conditions, diagnostic EI–MS spectra of all considered glucocorticoids were obtained. Limits of detection (LOD) of synthetic glucocorticoids in urine ranged from 3 to 25 g/l. The effectiveness of the method for the determination of glucocorticoids in urine was evaluated on spiked urine samples and on real samples obtained from patients under pharmacological treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids.

40|$|The death-associated {{protein kinase}} 1 (DAPK 1) {{can act as}} an {{oncogene}} or a tumor suppressor gene depending on the cellular context as well as external stimuli. Our study aims to investigate the prognostic significance of DAPK 1 in liver cancer in both mRNA and protein levels. The mRNA expression of DAPK 1 was extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus database in three independent liver cancer datasets while protein expression of DAPK 1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in our Chinese liver cancer patient cohort. The associations between DAPK 1 expression and clinical characteristics were tested. DAPK 1 mRNA expression was down-regulated in liver cancer. Low levels of DAPK 1 mRNA were associated with shorter survival in a liver cancer patient cohort (n =  115; p =  0. 041), while negative staining of DAPK 1 protein was significantly correlated with shorter time to progression (p =  0. 002) and overall survival (p =  0. 02). DAPK 1 was an independent prognostic marker for both time to progression and overall survival by multivariate analysis. Liver cancer with the b-catenin mutation has a lower DAPK 1 expression, suggesting that DAPK 1 may be regulated under the b-catenin pathway. In addition, we also identified genes that are co-regulated with DAPK 1. DAPK 1 expression {{was positively correlated with}} IRF 2, IL 7 R, PCOLCE and ZBTB 16, and negatively correlated with SLC 16 A 3 in both liver cancer datasets. Among these genes, PCOLCE and ZBTB 16 were significantly down-regulated, while SLC 16 A 3 was significantly upregulated in liver cancer. By using connectivity mapping of these co-regulated genes, we have identified <b>amcinonide</b> and sulpiride as potential small molecules that could potentially reverse DAPK 1 /PCOLCE/ZBTB 16 /SLC 16 A 3 expression.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: Most corticosteroid-allergic {{patients}} {{react to}} several corticosteroids. Irrefutable proof {{for the existence}} of cross-reactions is provided by reactions to substances to which the patient has never been exposed. Four groups of cross-reactions have been proposed, and our own observations support this. However, we have found that budesonide, in particular, tends to be involved not only in cross-reactions with corticosteroids of its own group (group B) but also with those of the ester group (group D). To test clinical observations on patients sensitive to corticosteroids and to establish a molecular basis for cross-reactivity patterns, a statistical analysis of our cases and a conformational study of major corticosteroids were performed. RESULTS: Statistically highly significant positive or negative correlations were found for the combination of tixocortol pivalate plus hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone plus budesonide, respectively. This indicates that budesonide and hydrocortisone or tixocortol pivalate detect different groups of corticosteroid-sensitive patients. Moreover, significant positive correlations were found between budesonide and <b>amcinonide,</b> both molecules belonging to the acetonide group C, and also between budesonide and some esters of group D such as hydrocortisone- 17 butyrate and alclometasone dipropionate. These clinical observations were fully supported by a conformational analysis of the electronic shape of corticosteroids involved in this study. Groups A, B, and D were found to be highly homogeneous within each group in terms of molecular structures, while significant differences were observed among the groups. The special behavior of budesonide can be fully explained on the base of its unique molecular structure. Finally, molecular characteristics have been defined for each group. This could be useful for the prediction of potential cross-reactions to new corticosteroid molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The statistical analysis confirms that tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone contact allergies are definitely associated, while reactions to budesonide are strongly correlated with the reactions to both the acetonide group and the ester group. These clinical observations are fully supported by the conformational analysis of the molecules involved in this study. Tixocortol pivalate and budesonide should certainly be added to the standard series for the detection of patients sensitized to corticosteroids. status: publishe...|$|E
