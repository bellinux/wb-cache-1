That <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> as directors and will be held to be responsible as such by the public, we ought {{to know what is}} being done. We ought to know where the shares really are. I for one do not even know what scrip has been issued.' ...|$|E

Take the orchard for your archery ground; that is safe, {{and we can see}} you <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here.</b> I wish I had two hands, so that I could paint you a fine, gay target;" [...] and Miss Celia looked regretfully at the injured arm, which as yet was of little use.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd rather not," [...] she admitted. [...] "My {{brain is}} too full. I have a hundred fancies dancing about. I even find myself, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> rehearsing my gestures, tuning {{myself to a}} new outlook. Oh! You most {{disturbing}} person--intellectually of course, I mean," [...] she added, laughing into his face. [...] "Take off my rugs and help me up. No, we'll leave them there. Perhaps, after dinner, we might walk for a little time." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{say nothing}} {{in defense of}} his character--nothing in palliation of the offense for which he suffered. But I cannot forget that {{in the time of}} his most fearful extremity, when the strong arm of the law had already seized him, he thought of the young man whose humble {{fortunes}} he had helped to build; whose heartfelt gratitude he had fairly won; whose simple faith he was resolved never to betray. I leave it to greater intellects than mine to reconcile the anomaly of his reckless falsehood toward others and his steadfast truth toward me. It is as certain <b>as</b> that <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> that one of Fauntleroy's last efforts in this world was the effort he made to preserve me from being a loser by the trust that I had placed in him. There is the secret of my strange tenderness for the memory of a felon; that is why the word villain does somehow still grate on my heart when I hear it associated with the name--the disgraced name, I grant you--of the forger Fauntleroy. Pass the bottles, young gentlemen, and pardon a man of the old school for having so long interrupted your conversation with a story of the old time.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} of my motive for leaving Italy," [...] he began, [...] "except that it was for {{political}} reasons. If I had been driven to this country by the persecution of my government, I should not have kept those reasons a secret from you or from any one. I have concealed them because no government authority has pronounced the sentence of my exile. You have heard, Walter, of the political societies that are hidden in every great city on the continent of Europe? To one of those societies I belonged in Italy--and belong still in England. When I came to this country, I came by the direction of my chief. I was over-zealous in my younger time--I ran the risk of compromising myself and others. For those reasons I was ordered to emigrate to England and to wait. I emigrated--I have waited--I wait still. To-morrow I may be called away--ten years hence I may be called away. It is all one to me--I am here, I support myself by teaching, and I wait. I violate no oath (you shall hear why presently) in making my confidence complete by telling you {{the name of the}} society to which I belong. All I do is to put my life in your hands. If what I say to you now is ever known by others to have passed my lips, <b>as</b> certainly <b>as</b> <b>we</b> two <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> I am a dead man." ...|$|R

So I give him up," [...] she went on, as he was going. [...] "I 'm sure you 'll be {{the best of friends}} to him, but if you should ever forget him, or grow tired of him, or lose your {{interest}} in him, and he should come to any harm or any trouble, please, sir, remember"--And she paused, with a tremulous voice.|$|E

[...] "I take {{my friend}} Maraton somewhere. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> Mr. Foley, we have spoken of politics. You {{are a great}} man. If any one can lift your country from the rut along which she is travelling, you will do it. A Unionist Prime Minister and you hold out the hand to Maraton! But what foresight! What acumen! You see beyond the thunder-clouds {{the things that we}} have seen. Not only do you see them, but you have the courage to follow your convictions. What a mess you are making of Parties!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you: and I'd rather suffocate than {{accept your}} help--now. Listen to myself, indeed! That's just the pious hypocrite all over. Well, {{declarations}} of love you know quite enough about for your--for your age. Now you shall hear {{one of a}} different kind. I tell you, Midgetina, I hate you: I can't endure the sight or sound or creep or thought of you any longer. Why? Because of your unspeakable masquerade. You play the pygmy; pygmy you are: carried about, cosseted, smirked at, fattened on nightingales' tongues--the last, though, you'll ever eat. But where have you come from? What are you in your past--in your mind? I ask you that: a thing more everywhere, more thief-like, more detestable than a conscience. Look at me, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> now. I am the monstrosity. You see it, you think it, you hate even to touch me. From first moment to last you have secretly despised me--me! I'm not accusing you. You weren't your own maker. As often as not you don't {{know what you are}} saying. You are just an automaton. But these last nights I have lain awake and thought of it all. It came on me as if my life had been nothing but a filthy, aimless nightmare; and chiefly because of you. I've worked, I've thought, I've contrived and forced my way. Oh, that house, the wranglings, the sermons. Did I make myself what I am, ask to be born? No, it's all a devilish plot. And I say this, that while things are as they are, and this life is life, and this world my world, I refuse to be watched and taunted and goaded and defamed." ...|$|E

6000|$|There, {{take your}} tired eyes down again; {{and turn them}} right, or left, or where you will, {{to see the same}} scene, and yet never the same. New forms, new combinations; a wealth of {{creative}} Genius--let us use the wise old word in its true sense--incomprehensible by the human intellect or the human eye, even as He is who makes it all, Whose garment, or rather Whose speech, it is. The eye is not filled with seeing, or the ear with hearing; and never would be, did you roam these forests for a hundred years. How many years would you need merely to examine and discriminate the different species? And when you had done that, how many more to learn their action and reaction on each other? How many more to learn their virtues, properties, uses? How many more to answer the perhaps ever unanswerable question--How they exist and grow at all? By what miracle they are compacted out of light, air, and water, each after its kind? How, again, those kinds began to be, and what they were like at first? Whether those crowded, struggling, competing shapes are stable or variable? Whether or not they are varying still? [...] Whether even now, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here,</b> the great God may not be creating, slowly but surely, new forms of beauty round us? Why not? If He chose to do it, could He not do it? And even had you answered that question, which would require whole centuries of observation as patient and accurate as that which Mr. Darwin employed on Orchids and climbing plants, how much nearer would you be to the deepest question of all--Do these things exist, or only appear? Are they solid realities, or a mere phantasmagoria, orderly indeed, and law- ruled, but a phantasmagoria still; a picture-book by which God speaks to rational essences, created in His own likeness? And even had you solved that old problem, and decided for Berkeley or against him, you would still have to learn from these forests a knowledge which enters into man, not through the head, but through the heart; which (let some modern philosophers say what they will) defies all analysis, and can be no more defined or explained by words than a mother's love. I mean, the causes and the effects of their beauty; that 'AEsthetic of plants,' of which Schleiden has spoken so well in that charming book of his, The Plant, which all should read who wish to know somewhat of 'The Open Secret.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Eurogamer gave Evil Genius a 7 out of 10, commenting that [...] "even <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> picking {{over the}} carcass, we're not {{actually}} all that {{angry about the}} things that are wrong with the game. They're bad on paper, but they didn't interfere hugely with our having fun - a sure sign that that Evil Genius overcomes its flaws and ultimately satisfies." ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon meeting Premier Li Peng for {{the first}} time in May 1989, in an {{encounter}} recorded on national television, Wu'er Kaixi interrupted Li during his introduction, saying [...] "I understand it is quite rude of me to interrupt you, Premier, but there are people sitting out there in the square, being hungry, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>sit</b> <b>here</b> and exchange pleasantries. We are only here to discuss concrete matters, sir." [...] After being interrupted by Li, who said that he was being somewhat impolite, Wu'er Kaixi continued. [...] "Sir, you said you are here late of traffic congestion... we've actually been calling you to talk to us since 22 April. It's not that you are late, it's that you're here too late. But that's fine. It's good that you are able to come here at all ..." ...|$|E

5000|$|Miss M. {{is taken}} up by the worldly and jaded Mrs. Monnerie, [...] "the {{youngest}} daughter of Lord B.", whose blood is said to be [...] "as blue as Caddis Bay on a cloudless morning." [...] Mrs. Monnerie is a stout, mushroom-shaped woman of middle age who collects unusual objects and people. Highly intelligent, she is attracted as much by Miss M.'s wide reading and knowledge of poetry as by her unusual appearance, and she sets her up in her London house as a curiosity, a [...] "pocket Venus" [...] to be displayed at social gatherings. Mrs. Monnerie is likewise intrigued by Fanny Bowater's combination of beauty and cynicism and invites her into the household to be her personal companion. Unaware that everyone has read about it in the newspapers, Fanny makes Miss M. swear never to mention the affair of Mr. Crimble's suicide. She sets about to ensnare Miss Monnerie's empty-headed nephew Percy Maudlen and also flirts with the handsome fiancé of Miss Monnerie's niece Susan, a kind and considerate young woman, the polar opposite of Fanny, causing the breakup of that couple. Disgusted with her life in captivity as a living bibelot and wounded by Fanny's coldness, Miss M. becomes increasingly bad tempered. Her sourness offends her patroness and she is banished to Monk's House, Mrs. Monnerie's country residence. There Fanny visits her and accuses her of having betrayed her by breaking her promise not to gossip about the past. She tells Miss M. she hates her:I can't endure the sight or sound or creep of you any longer[...] [...] [...] Why? Because of your unspeakable masquerade.
