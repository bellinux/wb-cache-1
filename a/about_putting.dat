5|$|Between {{the time}} of the initial sales {{agreement}} in November 1988 and the finalization of the acquisition of Pillsbury in January 1989, Grand Metropolitan set <b>about</b> <b>putting</b> its own corporate stamp on Burger King; the stated goal of Grand Met CEO Allen Sheppard was to upgrade the overall performance of the chain and improve its standing as the second largest fast-food burger chain globally. To that end, he had the company initiate a three-prong strategy of evaluation of operations, personnel moves, and structural changes and improvements to fortify the company.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Liberals gained {{office on}} Prince Edward Island. They {{immediately}} went <b>about</b> <b>putting</b> in place measures to gradually dismantle the proprietor/tenant system, although their efforts generally had limited effect largely because Samuel Cunard, who owned one-sixth of the Island, refused to sell {{any of his}} land. In 1864, the tenants organised into the Tenant League, and vowed to resist the collection of rent by their proprietors. Efforts by law enforcement to quell this rebellion had little effect, so {{the government of the}} island requested the assistance of British troops to enforce the collection of rent. In 1865, British troops arrived in the colony and successfully enforced the collection of the unpaid rent, and the Tenant League crumbled. It appeared that the operation of the Tenant League was a matter of principle rather than practical necessity; the rent paid by tenants to the proprietors was to the amount of one shilling per acre, and the proprietors allowed rent to go unpaid for years at a time.|$|E

25|$|In March 1983, {{under two}} years before EastEnders first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea {{in the mind of}} a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what BBC1 needed was a popular {{bi-weekly}} drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with Coronation Street. The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were Julia Smith and Tony Holland, a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on Z-Cars. The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year. After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went <b>about</b> <b>putting</b> their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London. Granada Television gave Smith unrestricted access to the Coronation Street production for a month so that she could get a sense how a continuing drama was produced.|$|E

In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued The Best of Volume 1 without the band's involvement.

Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Louis XVIII {{returned}} to France promptly after Napoleon's defeat to ensure his second restoration [...] "in baggage train of the enemy", i.e. with Wellington's troops.

King Louis arrived at Cambrai on 26 June, where he released [...] stating that those who served the Emperor in the Hundred Days would not be persecuted, except for the [...] "instigators". It was also acknowledged that Louis XVIII's government might have made mistakes during the First Restoration. On 29 June, a deputation of five from the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers approached Wellington <b>about</b> <b>putting</b> a foreign prince on the throne of France. Wellington rejected their pleas outright, declaring that [...] " [...] the best way to preserve the integrity of France". Wellington ordered the deputies to espouse King Louis's cause.
