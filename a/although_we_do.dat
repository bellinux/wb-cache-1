25|$|Where arable {{cultivation}} {{continued in}} early Anglo-Saxon England, {{there seems to}} have been considerable continuity with the Roman period in both field layout and arable practices, <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know whether there were also changes to patterns of tenure or the regulation of cultivation. The greatest perceptible alterations in land usage between about 400 and 600 are therefore in the proportions of the land of each community that lay under grass or the plough, rather than in changes to the layout or management of arable fields.|$|E
25|$|Gerard {{was born}} in Cremona in {{northern}} Italy. Dissatisfied with the meager philosophies of his Italian teachers, Gerard went to Toledo. There he learned Arabic, initially {{so that he could}} read Ptolemy's Almagest, which had a traditionally high reputation among scholars, but which, before his departure to Castile, was not yet known in Latin translation. The first Latin translation was made, from the Greek around 1160 in Sicily. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have detailed information of the date when Gerard went to Castile, it was no later than 1144.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel of Christ Crucified (Capela do Senhor Jesus Crucificado) was {{constructed}} in 1589, according to a date {{on the front of}} the arch over it. In the same area are two Renaissance medallions showing the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul. The altarpiece dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, a good example of the Rococo style. The central area is filled by pictures of Our Lady of Sorrows and of St. John the Evangelist, and by the large sculpture of Christ Crucified. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know the creator of this piece, it appears to be by an Algarve artist, reflecting the technical and artistic mastery found elsewhere in the region.|$|E

2500|$|Preces are short, lightly neumatic musical prayers {{in rhyme}} with a refrain. [...] They exist {{in both the}} Visigothic /Mozarabic rite and the Gallican rite, but the {{concordance}} between the two rites appears to be liturgical and not musical.

The {{standard}} error (.016 or 1.6%) helps to {{give a sense of}} the accuracy of Kerry's estimated percentage (47%). A Bayesian interpretation of the standard error is that <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not know the [...] "true" [...] percentage, it is highly likely to be located within two standard errors of the estimated percentage (47%). [...] The standard error can be used to create a confidence interval within which the [...] "true" [...] percentage should be to a certain level of confidence.|$|E

Bulgakov concludes: [...] "The patristic teaching of the fourth century lacks that exclusivity which came to characterize Orthodox theology after Photius under the influence of repulsion from the Filioque doctrine. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not here find the pure Filioque that Catholic theologians find, we also do not find that opposition to the Filioque that became something of an Orthodox or, rather, anti-Catholic dogma." ...|$|E
2500|$|So {{what can}} it mean when America {{says it will}} now protect its friends? It can only mean {{prejudice}} against Iraq. This stance plus maneuvers and statements which have been made has encouraged the UAE and Kuwait to disregard Iraqi rights. ... If you use pressure, we will deploy pressure and force.

2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Hoyle became a staunch critic of {{theories}} of abiogenesis {{to explain the}} origin of life on Earth. With Chandra Wickramasinghe, Hoyle promoted the hypothesis that the first life on Earth began in space, spreading through the universe via panspermia, and that evolution on Earth is influenced by a steady influx of viruses arriving via comets. His belief that comets had a significant percentage of organic compounds was well ahead of his time, as the dominant views in the 1970s and 1980s were that comets largely consisted of water-ice, and the presence of organic compounds [...] was then highly controversial. Wickramasinghe wrote in 2003: [...] "In the highly polarized polemic between Darwinism and creationism, our position is unique. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not align ourselves with either side, both sides treat us as opponents. Thus we are outsiders with an unusual perspective—and our suggestion for {{a way out of the}} crisis has not yet been considered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Domitius Calvinus's {{activities}} {{after the}} death of Caesar are unknown, but in 43 BC he was a strong supporter of Octavianus and participated in the civil war against Brutus and Cassius. During the Philippi campaign in 42 BC, he had to bring reinforcements from Italia to Greece for Mark Antony and Octavianus' army, however his fleet was destroyed by the enemy in the Ionian Sea with the loss of two legions. Despite this defeat he was awarded the honor of a second consulship in 40 BC and was sent by Octavianus as governor to Hispania, where he remained for three years (39 BC-36 BC). [...] Apparently, his military activities in Spain had success, since he was saluted as imperator by his troops and on his return he was awarded a triumph. [...] He also rebuilt the Regia in the Roman Forum. <b>Although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not have many facts concerning his further political activities, an inscription shows that in 20 BC he was still alive {{and a member of the}} important Arval Brethren priesthood, reserved only for members of the nascent Imperial family and to the emperor's most distinguished supporters.|$|E

But <b>although</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> {{not find}} a {{transition}} from one school into {{the other in the}} slope of the gables, there is often a confusion between the two schools in the association of the gable with the arch below it. It has just been stated that the pure Romanesque condition is the round arch under the low gable, a, Fig. XIV., and the pure Gothic condition is the pointed arch under the high gable, b. But in the passage from one style to the other, we sometimes find the two conditions reversed; the pointed arch under a low gable, as d, or the round arch under a high gable, as c. The form d occurs in the tombs of Verona, and c in the doors of Venice.|$|E
