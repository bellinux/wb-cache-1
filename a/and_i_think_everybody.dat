It was pitch dark, and, of course, absolutely no lights, and the firing seems so much more at night, as you could see the flashes lighting up the sky, and it seemed to make much more noise, and you could see ships on fire and blowing up. Of course we showed absolutely no lights. One expected to be surprised any moment, and eventually we were. We suddenly found ourselves within 1000 yards of two or three big Hun cruisers. They switched on their searchlights and started firing like nothing on earth. Then they put their searchlights on us, but for some extraordinary reason did not fire on us. As, of course, we were going full speed we lost them in a moment, but I must say, that I, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> else, thought that that was the end, but one does not feel afraid or panicky. I think I felt rather cooler then than at any other time. I asked lots of people afterwards what they felt like, and they all said the same thing.

5000|$|The album's opening track, [...] "And Winter Came...", is an {{instrumental}} piece {{which is a}} reworked version of [...] "Midnight Blue", a song released as a B-side to [...] "Wild Child", the second single from A Day Without Rain (2000). The majority of Enya's albums begin with {{an instrumental}}, and she selected the title track as the first because its themes [...] "sets the mood of autumn going into winter". [...] "Journey of the Angels" [...] {{was written in the}} style of what Enya described as a [...] "slow traditional carol", with Roma emphasising its religious aspect to it, and chose it as a personal highlight of the album. The song is dedicated to the American director and editor Tim Royes, who produced the music video for Enya's songs [...] "Amarantine" [...] and [...] "It's in the Rain" [...] and died in 2007. For [...] "White Is in the Winter Night", Enya was inspired by the idea of writing a [...] "21st century Christmas carol", and pointed out Roma's descriptive lyrics that describe the various colours associated with Christmas time: [...] "Green is in the mistletoe and red is in the holly ... Gold is in the candlelight and crimson in the embers". The album contains two traditional songs that were rearranged by Enya and Nicky; [...] "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" [...] is an Advent Christian hymn that was introduced to Enya during her time in the choir at boarding school and became a longtime favourite of hers and Roma's, which inspired the decision to record it for the album. The song is sung in Latin. Enya described the meaning behind [...] "Trains and Winter Rains": [...] "The song ... is like a dark winter journey <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> has taken this journey where it's time to leave home. It's exciting but because it is the unknown, that's why we wanted to capture the little dark aspects in both the lyric and in the music."

We did quite a few T.V. shows to promote it - but when we recorded them, when the record first came out - all the T.V. shows centred around Christmas, so we missed out on the initial thing.

40|$|Estimating cancer {{risks from}} {{pediatric}} CT: {{going from the}} qualitative to the quantitative Being quantitative, I think, always focuses the mind in these discussions, {{and this is really}} our rationale – to get some sort of feel for the absolute risks that may be involved. Let me start with a bit of background. It is clear, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> in the audience knows this, that pediatric CT is different from adult CT and also from any other sort of radiological exam as our article [1] points out. The organ doses are clearly higher for children than for adults [2]. Pediatric CT is of course increasing in frequency quite rapidly and probably more so than adult CT [3], and as Eric mentioned children are much more sensitive to radiation-induced cancer than adults [4]. I will go through these differences in some detail. First, let’s talk about the organ doses. For a given set of machine parameters (including the mAss), organ doses are larger in a child compared to a (larger) adult. Consider, for example, an organ located on the proximal side of the body relative to the x-ray source. This organ will get roughly the same dose in both adult and child (Recall that dose is energy deposited divided by mass.). As the x-ray source rotates, that same organ will be on the distal side of the body relative to the x-ray source; now that organ is partly shielded by the body tissue proximal to it, reducing the organ dose. But this dose-reducing, partial shielding will be much less for a thin individual, such as a child, compared to a thicker adult. Thus organ doses for children are larger than for adults...|$|E

5000|$|The {{decision}} to release 'Safe' {{as the first}} and only single from the group's new album came from executive producer, Simon Cowell. When interviewed about his choice, Cowell claimed [...] "It's such a fabulous track, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't be surprised if it became a smash song". The track was written by album producer John Shanks and James Grundler, frontman of American rock group Golden State. In an interview for the band's official website, Grundler revealed the process of writing such a track: [...] "We sat down at the piano, and John started banging some chords out. We just start tapping into the music until it struck a feeling. I left town shortly after because my father was being inducted into his universities athletic hall of fame in Pennsylvania. I kept writing ideas down on the computer every chance I could. I remember sitting on a chair at my aunt's house, in her basement, when it all clicked. I sang a rough idea into the computer and sent it to John. We were so ecstatic about the track and knew we had something beautiful, a timeless classic. The lyrics are from an outside perspective, for example, if you were looking at someone from afar, and maybe you have an interest in them, but every time you see them, they look as though they are going through a real rough moment in their life. And, if for that single moment, you wish you could just reach out and make it all better. Inspiration for the track came from a real life experience. There is a cafe that I used to visit when I was meeting my father in Pennsylvania - and every time we were there, I saw this attractive girl sitting {{at a table in the}} back. She had this look on her face, as though something terrible had happened, <b>and</b> all <b>I</b> wanted to do was reach out and comfort her. For me it tells the story of courage, spirit, and desire.". On September 30, 2010, the band officially revealed the release date for the single. On October 22, 2010, the single's artwork was revealed by band member Mark Feehily. The single's release date was changed from 7 November 2010 to 14 November 2010 on 27 October 2010. The single was first performed live on BBC Radio 2 Weekend Wogan Show. They held it on the world famous BBC Maida Vale Studios in London. Press releases stated, Westlife return with their most heart-stirring offering to date. New single Safe showcases the awesome emotional weight of an outfit at the height of their powers. Recorded in Los Angeles, with legendary producer John Shanks, the soaring ballad features the quartet in their most nakedly raw form. 'I'm crawling on the floor to reach you/I'm a wreck you see' sings band member Mark Feehily as strings swell to head-spinning effect. More than a decade into their career, and ten albums down the line, any competition has long ago fallen by the wayside for an outfit whose ability to chime so skillfully with the emotional landscape of their audience remains undimmed. While Shane said in an interview in Philippine Star: [...] "I think that lyrically, Safe is a very positive song, it's very strong, it's about keeping somebody safe <b>and</b> protecting people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> anywhere in the world can relate to it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>everybody</b> wants to feel safe; everybody wants to feel protected. We made the video for that song in that context. We feel that lyrically, Safe is one of the best songs that we have in a very long time." ...|$|R
