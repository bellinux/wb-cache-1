40|$|When {{negotiating}} irregular surfaces, {{the control}} of dynamic stability is challenged. In this study, we compared the <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> <b>stepping</b> behaviour and arm-swing of 18 unilateral transtibial amputees and 17 able-bodied participants when walking on flat and irregular surfaces. Experimental findings revealed that unilateral transtibial amputees reduced their gait velocity only slightly when walking on irregular surfaces. Analyses of the temporal gait characteristics, i. e. stride time, stance time, double-support time and step frequency, showed no statistically significant adjustments. Interestingly, the amputees did not increase the stability margins for lateral balance which were calculated based {{on the concept of}} the "extrapolated center of mass". Furthermore, they did not increase their step width, which was already wide when walking on the flat surface. However, amputees did increase the lateral component of relative arm-swing velocity in order to walk stable on irregular surfaces. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Field measurements {{were conducted to}} determine variations in the channel top-width at bankfull stage {{in relation to the}} drainage area and to the length of the flow path. After grouping the bed morphologies according to the Montgomery and Buffington [Montgomery, D. R., Buffington, J. M., 1997. Channel-reach morphology in mountain drainage basins. Geol. Soc. of Am. Bull. 109 (5) 596 – 611. ] classification, we analyzed the increase in bankfull width for the dominant stream units (cascades, step pools, isolated pools and colluvial reaches {{at the head of the}} basin). We observed that the morphologies more related to the drainage area are colluvial reaches and pools; the less adaptable are steps and cascades. These differences likely result from the absence of lateral constriction in the colluvial reaches and pools, whereas the presence of coarser sediments in the bed can affect the transverse <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> <b>steps</b> and reaches dominated by cascades. Linkages between cross-section geometry and parameters related to flow (i. e. drainage area and stream power) have been analyzed together with the distribution of surface grain sizes and its coarsening pattern. The existence of distinctive bankfull widths between different morphological units points out the degree of susceptibility to be modeled according to the channel slope, reference diameter (D 90), and contributing area...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{designed}} to assess balance recovery in older adults often involve exposing participants to repeated loss of balance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the adaptive balance recovery response exhibited by older adults following repeated exposure to forward loss of balance induced by releasing participants from a static forward lean angle. Fifty-eight healthy, community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 - 80 years, participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attempt to recover with a single step and performed four trials at each of three lean angles. Adaptive recovery responses at four events (cable release, toe-off of the stepping foot, foot contact and maximum knee flexion angle following landing <b>in</b> the <b>stepping</b> leg) were quantified for trials performed at the intermediate lean angle using the concept of margin of stability. The antero-posterior and medio-lateral margin of stability were computed as the difference between the velocity-adjusted position of the whole body centre of mass and the corresponding anterior or lateral boundary of the base of support. Across repeated trials adaptations <b>in</b> reactive <b>stepping</b> responses were detected that resulted in improved antero-posterior stability at foot contact and maximum knee flexion angle. Improved antero-posterior stability following repeated trials was explained by more effective control of the whole body centre of mass during the reactive stepping response and not by <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> <b>step</b> timing or base of support. The observed adaptations occurred within a single testing session and need to be considered in the design of balance recovery experiments.

The spatiotemporal characteristics of footstep adjustments used to turn 60 and 120 degrees {{were examined in}} 10 people with PD and 10 age, gender- and height-matched control subjects, using three-dimensional motion analysis. Control subjects used a recognizable pattern of spatial and temporal footstep modulations to turn. Participants with PD demonstrated significant differences in almost all variables. They (1) failed to turn {{as far as their}} peers; (2) showed a similar but scaled-down pattern of spatial adjustments to turn; (3) used shorter strides when walking, with exaggerated reductions when turning; and (4) demonstrated small but significant temporal differences <b>in</b> <b>step</b> time <b>adjustments.</b> Group differences were more marked for the larger turn.

Since the symptom of hip OA includes joint pain, which mostly occurs upon initial movement, patients with hip OA might have disabling problems with movement initiation. This study aimed to identify the movement strategy during the anticipatory postural <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> the lateral <b>step</b> motion <b>in</b> patients with hip OA. We studied 18 female subjects with unilateral hip OA and 10 healthy subjects, and measured temporal, kinetic, and kinematic variables. Patients with hip OA required a longer duration of anticipation phase than the control subjects, the total duration of lateral stepping was not different between the groups. Displacement {{of the center of}} mass to the supporting (affected) side during the anticipation phase was not different between the two groups. These findings suggest that, in patients with hip OA, the center of mass slowly moved to the affected side. Furthermore, patients with hip OA showed greater shift of the trunk to the supporting side than did the control subjects. These movement characteristics might contribute to the achievement of both protection of the affected hip joint and quickness in the subsequent lateral <b>step</b> <b>in</b> patients with hip OA...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{tracking}} {{in mobile}} robots have to track various target objects in fast processing, but existing state-of-the-art methods only use specific image feature which only suitable for certain target objects. In this paper, we proposed new approach without depend on specific feature. By using deep learning, {{we can learn}} essential features {{of many of the}} objects and scenes found in the real world. Furthermore, fast visual tracking can be achieved by using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The developed tracking algorithm is based on bootstrap particle filter. Thus the observation model of particle filter is enhanced into two steps: offline training step and online tracking step. The offline training stage is carried out by training one kind of deep learning techniques: Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) with auxiliary image data. During the online tracking process, an additional classification layer based on ELM is added to the encoder part of the trained. Using experiments, we found (i) the specific feature is only suitable for certain target objects (ii) the running time of the tracking algorithm can be improved by using ELM with regularization and intensity <b>adjustment</b> <b>in</b> online <b>step,</b> (iii) dynamic model is crucial for object tracking, especially when adjusting the diagonal covariance matrix values.

40|$|Statistical {{parametric}} mapping (SPM), {{relying on}} the general linear model and classical hypothesis testing, is a benchmark tool for assessing human brain activity using data from fMRI experiments. Friston et al. (2002 a) discuss some limitations of this frequentist approach and point out promising Bayesian perspectives. In particular, a Bayesian formulation allows explicit modeling and estimation of activation probabilities. In this paper, we directly address this issue and develop a new regression based approach using spatial Bayesian variable selection. Our method has several advantages. First, spatial correlation is directly modeled for activation probabilities and indirectly for activation amplitudes. As a consequence, {{there is no need}} for spatial <b>adjustment</b> <b>in</b> a post-processing <b>step.</b> Second, anatomical prior information, such as the distribution of grey matter or expert knowledge, can be included as part of the model. Third, the method has superior edge-preservation properties as well as being fast to compute. When applied to data from a simple visual experiment, the results demonstrate improved sensitivity for detecting activated cortical areas and for better preserving details of activated structures. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{prosthetic}} devices and rehabilitation {{programs can be}} improved. This is Carolin Curtze’s conclusion {{on the basis of}} her dissertation project. Curtze studied the complex inter¬action between brain, body, prosthesis and environment. By means of a self developed measurement device, Curtze investigated the roll-over properties of prostheses and found that these were crucial for standing stability. Furthermore, shoes appeared {{to have an impact on}} this property. Although the roll-over shapes found in prosthetic feet approximated the roll-over shapes of able-bodied people, amputees do not walk symmetric due to limitations of the prosthesis. Adjustment strategies of amputees during walking can only be made by the sound limb, for which the patient’s balance control is crucial. Curtze developed a number of tests to determine the balance control. Amputees appeared to use efficient strategies to compensate for the shortcomings of the prosthesis. Moreover, the passive properties of the prosthesis contributed to balance control. Curtze studied environmental influences by challenging the participants through an evoked forward fall and walking over an irregular surface. Amputees were equally efficient in recovering from an impending fall as able-bodied people, irrespective of whether they led with their prosthetic or sound limb. When walking on irregular surface, amputees increased the amount of lateral arm swing to increase stability. No <b>adjustments</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stepping</b> behavior were found. In general, walking is a highly automated process. The research showed that amputees need to adjust their movement to the limitations of current prosthetics. For future developments, the technical properties of prostheses should be adapted to the motor abilities of the amputee, instead of the other way around; innovations need to be patient driven instead of technology driven. The research results furthermore advocate training programs to be maximally challenging, thereby improving self-confidence. ...|$|R

Models of in-hospital mortality and length of stay were generated for Aristotle Basic Complexity and Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery using an identical data set in which both Aristotle Basic Complexity and Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery scores were assigned. The likelihood ratio test for nested models and paired concordance statistics were used. ResultsAfter adjustment for year of operation, the odds ratios for Aristotle Basic Complexity score 3 versus 6, 9 versus 6, 12 versus 6, and 15 versus 6 were 0. 29, 2. 22, 7. 62, and 26. 54 (P <. 0001). Similarly, odds ratios for Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery categories 1 versus 2, 3 versus 2, 4 versus 2, and 5 / 6 versus 2 were 0. 23, 1. 98, 5. 80, and 20. 71 (P <. 0001). Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery added significant predictive value over Aristotle Basic Complexity (likelihood ratio χ 2 = 162, P <. 0001), whereas Aristotle Basic Complexity contributed much less predictive value over Risk <b>Adjustment</b> <b>in</b> Congenital Heart Surgery (likelihood ratio χ 2 = 13. 4, P =. 009).
