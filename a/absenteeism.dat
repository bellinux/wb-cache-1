5|$|Shortly {{after her}} 17th {{birthday}} {{she changed her}} hair colour with a pink rinse. She took judo lessons once {{a week at a}} local school, but found partners reluctant to train with her, as she was often slow to release her grip. She took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for <b>absenteeism</b> after six months.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{government}} {{was concerned about}} the results of the March firebombing attacks as the raids had demonstrated that the Japanese military was unable to protect the nation's airspace. As well as the extensive physical damage in the targeted cities, the attacks also caused increased <b>absenteeism</b> as civilians were afraid to leave their homes to work in factories which might be bombed. Japanese air defenses were reinforced in response to the firebombing raids, but remained inadequate; 450 fighters were assigned to defensive duties in April.|$|E
5|$|The War Production Board {{was asked}} to keep stores in Oak Ridge {{well-stocked}} {{in order to reduce}} <b>absenteeism</b> among the workers. When shortages occurred, the relatively well-paid Oak Ridge residents bought up scarce goods in surrounding areas. In both cases, they attracted the ire of their residents. Personnel employed by the Manhattan District were not exempted from being drafted under the Selective Service System. Efforts were made to employ draft-exempt personnel, and deferments were requested only for critical personnel, mainly young scientists and technicians.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual underpinnings of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school <b>absenteeism,</b> refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's <b>absenteeism,</b> and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to <b>absenteeism</b> and reduced productivity. This {{was not the case}} for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of <b>absenteeism.</b> The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school <b>absenteeism</b> in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|With 16,000 employees, the Glasgow factory {{was one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} operations in Scotland. Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external subcontractors, it produced almost all the Merlin's components itself. Engines began to leave the production line in November 1940, and by June 1941 monthly output had reached 200, increasing to more than 400 per month by March 1942. In total 23,675 engines were produced. Worker <b>absenteeism</b> became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air-raid shelters. It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82 hours a week, with one half-Sunday per month awarded as holiday. Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day.|$|E
5|$|Much of Japan's {{industrial}} capacity was also destroyed by Allied bombing. Over 600 major industrial facilities were destroyed or badly damaged, {{contributing to a}} large decline in production. <b>Absenteeism</b> caused by the air attacks further reduced output. It {{is not possible to}} determine the exact damage bombing caused to Japan's economy, however, as the Allied naval blockade also contributed to general breakdown which occurred from late 1944. Statistics compiled by the USSBS show a correlation between the number of B-29 sorties directed at different industries and the amount by which their production declined, but air attacks were not the only reason for these differences. In addition to the heavy bomber attacks, the operations by Allied aircraft carriers tightened the blockade by disrupting Japanese coastal shipping; the naval aircraft were unable to carry enough bombs to seriously damage Japanese industrial plants, however. Compounding the effects of the air attacks, Japan's rice crop of 1945 failed. The resulting shortage of rice caused widespread malnutrition, and mass starvation would have occurred had the war continued. In financial terms, the Allied air campaign and attacks on merchant ships destroyed between one third and a quarter of Japan's wealth.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of <b>absenteeism</b> from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943) – in {{the autumn}} of 1942 the WAAC {{commissioned}} Knight to paint a portrait to bolster female recruitment to the ordnance factories, as the Ministry of Supply were concerned at the level of disaffection and <b>absenteeism</b> among women working in the factories. The resulting painting {{is one of the largest}} oil paintings in the entire WAAC collection, and the largest single figure portrait it acquired throughout the war. The painting was first shown on 30April 1943 at the Royal Academy and the next day was reproduced in eight British newspapers. The painting, along with Knight and Loftus, also featured in a British Paramount News short film shown in cinemas, and was reproduced in a poster version by WAAC. The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the historic win and to combat <b>absenteeism</b> the following day, classes at Villanova were cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The UK Home Office {{estimated}} that {{the social and economic}} cost of drug abuse to the UK economy in terms of crime, <b>absenteeism</b> and sickness is in excess of £20 billion a year.|$|E
25|$|The {{forms of}} {{counterproductive}} behavior {{with the most}} empirical examination are ineffective job performance, <b>absenteeism,</b> job turnover, and accidents. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and sexual harassment.|$|E
25|$|The {{socioeconomic}} {{consequences and}} health risks of alcohol hangover include workplace <b>absenteeism,</b> impaired job performance, reduced productivity and poor academic achievement. A hangover may also compromise potentially dangerous daily {{activities such as}} driving a car or operating heavy machinery.|$|E
25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl <b>absenteeism</b> could be cut in half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing <b>absenteeism</b> and increasing student attention.|$|E
25|$|According to Thomas, there {{tends to}} be a higher level of stress with people who work or {{interact}} with a narcissist, which in turn increases <b>absenteeism</b> and staff turnover. Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is a corporate psychopath in the organisation.|$|E
25|$|After Henderson CUR administrators {{remained}} as chairmen {{of the sports}} club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and <b>absenteeism</b> by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{suggests}} that there {{tends to be a}} higher level of stress with people who work or interact with a narcissist, which in turn increases <b>absenteeism</b> and staff turnover. Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is corporate psychopath in the organisation.|$|E
25|$|Labor {{contract}} law was reformed in 1912. Defaults on contracts by workers or employers {{were no longer}} punishable unless there was intent to defraud or injure. Moros, unused to Western notions of work, were prone to <b>absenteeism,</b> {{which could lead to}} breach of contract suits.|$|E
25|$|Conscientious {{employees}} {{are generally more}} reliable, more motivated, and harder working. They also have lower rates of <b>absenteeism</b> and counterproductive work behaviors such as stealing and fighting with other employees. Furthermore, conscientiousness is the only personality trait that correlates with performance across all categories of jobs.|$|E
25|$|A {{tentative}} {{agreement was}} reached February 6, 1978, which imposed penalties for wildcat strikes and chronic <b>absenteeism,</b> turned the union's health and pension plans over to the employers, forced workers to pay part of their health insurance premiums, and instituted a bonus system for productivity increases.|$|E
25|$|The body {{went through}} two {{distinct}} phases. From 1947 to 1967, it followed {{the policy of}} <b>absenteeism,</b> which meant that the Commission would concentrate on promoting human rights and helping states elaborate treaties, but not on investigating or condemning violators. It {{was a period of}} strict observance of the sovereignty principle.|$|E
25|$|One can rather easily spot {{an office}} with a {{bullying}} problem - there is an exceptionally high rate of turnover. While not all places with high personnel turnover are sites of workplace bullying, nearly every place that has a bully in charge will have elevated staff turnover and <b>absenteeism.</b>|$|E
25|$|Officially, {{the pupil}} to teacher ratio {{within the public}} school system for primary {{education}} is 35:1. However, teacher <b>absenteeism</b> in India is exorbitant, with 25% never showing up for work. The World Bank estimates the cost in salaries alone paid to such teachers who have never attended work is US $2 billion per year.|$|E
25|$|The massive {{famine in}} the early 1930s (which was {{organized}} partly by the state) was blamed on religious believers who supposedly were infiltrating the collective farms and wrecking them from within. They were blamed in similar ways for {{the failures of the}} Soviet economy in the 1930s. Religious festivals were also blamed for hurting the economy by introducing high work <b>absenteeism</b> and drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|Jobs high in {{motivating}} potential must be high on both Autonomy and Feedback, {{and also}} must be high {{on at least one}} of the three factors that lead to experienced meaningfulness. If a job has a high MPS, the job characteristics model predicts motivation, performance and job satisfaction will be positively affected and the likelihood of negative outcomes, such as <b>absenteeism</b> and turnover, will be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Schools {{are well}} {{distributed}} throughout Ladakh but 75% of them provide only primary education. 65% of children attend school, but <b>absenteeism</b> of {{both students and}} teachers remains high. In both districts the failure rate at school-leaving level (class X) has for many years been around 50%. Before 1993, students were taught in Urdu until they were 14, after which the medium of instruction shifted to English.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 2012, her idol {{activities}} {{started as}} Bakusute Sotokanda Icchome 1.5th grade student. On her Akibahara Backstage Pass {{at the same}} time as idol activity there is also a job as a cafe clerk at a store, but she have never been sick even after two years have passed since she entered work, almost every day since she started working, there was a thing that the voice ceased to come out, but without doing <b>absenteeism,</b> she did cafe work by writing.|$|E
25|$|The {{average number}} of years of {{schooling}} is 6.7, which is the beginning of middle school, compared to the Mexico average of 8.6. 16.5% have no schooling at all, 59.6% have only primary school/secondary school, 13.7% finish high school or technical school and 9.8% go to university. Eighteen out of every 100 people 15 years or older cannot read or write, compared to 7/100 nationally. Most of Chiapas’ illiterate population are indigenous women, who are often prevented from going to school. School <b>absenteeism</b> and dropout rates are highest among indigenous girls.|$|E
25|$|Organizational support theory {{says that}} in order to meet socioemotional needs and to assess the {{benefits}} of increased work effort, employees form a general perception concerning {{the extent to which the}} organization values their contributions and cares about their well-being. Such POS would increase employees' felt obligation to help the organization reach its objectives, increase their identification with the organization, and contribute to their expectation that improved performance would be rewarded. Behavioral outcomes of POS would include increased in-role and extra-role performance, increased organizational commitment, and decreased withdrawal behaviors such as <b>absenteeism</b> and turnover.|$|E
25|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is often thought {{to reflect the}} extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), <b>absenteeism,</b> turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E
25|$|The bill {{establishing}} the union was carried through its final stages by substantial majorities. One of Grattan's main grounds {{of opposition to}} the union had been his dread of seeing the political leadership in Ireland pass {{out of the hands}} of the landed gentry; and he prophesied that the time would come when Ireland would send to the united parliament a hundred of the greatest rascals in the kingdom. Like Flood before him, Grattan had no leaning towards democracy; and he anticipated that by the removal of the centre of political interest from Ireland the evil of <b>absenteeism</b> would be intensified.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{addition}} of a number of units and increased mobility achieved during the 1970s and 1980s, the army's personnel complement has expanded only moderately since a major buildup was launched in the late 1960s. The army has been chronically understrength, in the case of some units by an estimated 30 to 50 percent. These shortages have been aggravated by a relaxed policy that permitted considerable <b>absenteeism</b> and by a serious problem of retaining experienced technicians and noncommissioned officers (NCOs). The continued existence of a separate national guard also limited the pool of potential army recruits.|$|E
