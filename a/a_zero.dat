Objetivou-se com este trabalho determinar o período de convivência {{anterior}} à interferência das plantas daninhas (PAI) na cultura do feijoeiro em diferentes espaçamentos e densidades de plantas.

Além dos períodos de convivência, realizaram-se ainda estudos com espaçamentos entre linhas de 0, 45 e 0, 60 m e mais duas densidades de semeadura: dez e 15 plantas m- 1. Adotou-se delineamento experimental de blocos casualizados, com quatro repetições. Quando o feijoeiro esteve presente com as plantas daninhas durante o ciclo, a produtividade dos grãos foi reduzida a 63, 50, 42 e 57 % para os tratamentos com espaçamento de 0, 45 m, densidades de semeadura de dez e 15 plantas m- 1, espaçamento de 0, 60 m e densidades de semeadura de dez e 15 plantas m- 1, respectivamente. Os períodos anteriores à interferência (PAIs) da cultura foram de 23, 27, 13 e 19 dias após emergência, respectivamente.

The treatments consisted of periods of coexistence between culture and weeds, with 0 to 10, 0 to 20, 0 to 30, 0 to 40, 0 to 50, 0 to 60, 0 to 70, and 0 to 80 days, and another test without weeds. In addition to the periods of coexistence, there were also studies with 0. 45 and 0. 60 m inter-row spacing and two sowing densities – 10 and 15 plants m- 1. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, with four replications per treatment. There was a reduction of 63, 50, 42 and 57 % in the productivity of grains common bean culture when coexisting with weeds for row spacing of 0. 45 m, sowing density of 10 and 15 plants m- 1, row spacing of 0. 60 m, and seeding density of 10 and 15 plants m- 1, respectively.
