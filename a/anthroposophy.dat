The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary <b>anthroposophy</b> (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like homeopathy, aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E

25|$|Waldorf education, {{also known}} as Steiner education, {{is based on the}} {{educational}} philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of <b>anthroposophy.</b> Its pedagogy emphasizes the role of imagination in learning, striving to integrate holistically the intellectual, practical, and artistic development of pupils.|$|E
25|$|Blavatsky was a {{controversial}} figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan and plagiarist by critics. Her Theosophical doctrines influenced {{the spread of}} Hindu and Buddhist ideas in the West {{as well as the}} development of Western esoteric currents like Ariosophy, <b>Anthroposophy,</b> and the New Age Movement.|$|E
25|$|Theosophy {{played a}} {{significant}} role in bringing knowledge of South Asian religions to Western countries, as well as in encouraging cultural pride in various South Asian nations. A variety of prominent artists and writers have also been influenced by Theosophical teachings. Theosophical ideas have also exerted an influence on a wide range of other esoteric movements and philosophies, among them <b>Anthroposophy</b> and the New Age.|$|E
25|$|While <b>anthroposophy</b> underpins the {{curriculum}} design, pedagogical approach, and organizational structure, it is explicitly not taught {{within the school}} curriculum and {{studies have shown that}} Waldorf pupils have little awareness of it. Tensions may arise within the Waldorf community between the commitment to Steiner's original intentions, which has sometimes acted as a valuable anchor against following educational fads, and openness to new directions in education, such as the incorporation of new technologies or modern methods of accountability and assessment.|$|E
25|$|A major {{influence}} on modern spirituality was the Theosophical Society, which searched for 'secret teachings' in Asian religions. It has been influential on modernist streams in several Asian religions, notably Neo-Vedanta, {{the revival of}} Theravada Buddhism, and Buddhist modernism, which have taken over modern western notions of personal experience and universalism and integrated them in their religious concepts. A second, related influence was <b>Anthroposophy,</b> whose founder, Rudolf Steiner, was particularly interested in developing a genuine Western spirituality, and {{in the ways that}} such a spirituality could transform practical institutions such as education, agriculture, and medicine.|$|E
25|$|Rudolf Steiner, {{who founded}} the esoteric spiritual {{movement}} <b>anthroposophy,</b> used the concept of Ahriman to name one of two extreme forces which pull humanity away from the centering influence of Christ. Steiner associated Ahriman, the lower spirit, with materialism, science, heredity, objectivity and soul-hardening. He thought that contemporary Christianity was subject to Ahrimanic influence, since it tended towards materialistic interpretations. Steiner predicted that Ahriman, as a supersensible Being, would incarnate into an earthly form, 'some little time after our present earthly existence, in fact in the third post-Christian millennium'.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anthroposophy</b> {{describes}} reincarnation {{from the}} point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). Rudolf Steiner described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next, and a number of successive lives of various individualities.|$|E
25|$|The White Rose {{group was}} {{motivated}} by ethical and moral considerations. They came from various religious backgrounds. Willi Graf and Katharina Schüddekopf were devout Catholics. Alexander Schmorell was an Orthodox Christian. Traute Lafrenz adhered to the concepts of <b>anthroposophy,</b> while Eugen Grimminger considered himself a Buddhist. Christoph Probst was baptized a Catholic only shortly before his execution. His father Hermann was nominally a Catholic, but also a private scholar of Eastern thought and wisdom. In their diaries and letters to friends, both Scholl siblings wrote about their reading of Christian scholars including Augustine of Hippo and Etienne Gilson, whose work on Medieval philosophy they discussed amongst other philosophical works within their network of friends.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} prove that Hitler had a fully {{developed}} psychosis in a clinical sense has only occasionally been made. An example is the book Hitler, Steiner, Schreber (1966) by the Freiburg psychiatrist Wolfgang Treher. Treher explains that both Rudolf Steiner (whose <b>anthroposophy</b> he attributes to mental illness) and Hitler suffered from schizophrenia. He writes that both managed {{to stay in touch}} with reality because they had the opportunity to create their own organizations (Steiner: the Anthroposophical Society; Hitler: the NSDAP and its many subdivisions) that they could influence according to their delusions – and therefore avoid the, normally expected, “schizophrenic withdrawal”. Treher finds that Hitler’s megalomania and paranoia are quite striking.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{had split}} from Theosophy when renouncing Leadbeater's {{claim that he}} was the World Teacher, Krishnamurti {{continued}} to exhibit Theosophical influences in his later teachings. In 1923 a former Theosophist, the Anglo-American Alice Bailey, established the Arcane School, which also rested on claims regarding contact with the Ascended Masters. Another former Theosophist, the Austrian Rudolf Steiner, split from the Theosophical Society over the claims about Krishnamurti and then established his own Anthroposophical Society in 1913, which promoted <b>Anthroposophy,</b> a philosophy influenced by Theosophical ideas. In the United States during the 1930s, the I AM group was established by Guy Ballard and Edna Ballard; the group adopted the idea of the Ascended Masters from Theosophy.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{origins of}} the New Age {{movement}} remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s, whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s. This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and <b>Anthroposophy.</b> Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the New Age sensu stricto, or [...] "New Age in the strict sense".|$|E

2500|$|While Walter {{had many}} {{influences}} within music, in his Of Music and Making (1957) he notes a profound influence from the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. He notes, [...] "In old age I {{have had the}} good fortune to be initiated into the world of <b>anthroposophy</b> and during the past few years to make a profound study of the teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Here we see alive and in operation that deliverance of which Friedrich Hölderlin speaks; its blessing has flowed over me, and so this book is the confession of belief in <b>anthroposophy.</b> There is no part of my inward life that has not had new light shed upon it, or been stimulated, by the lofty teachings of Rudolf Steiner ... I am profoundly grateful for having been so boundlessly enriched ... It is glorious to become a learner again at my time of life. I have a sense of the rejuvenation of my whole being which gives strength and renewal to my musicianship, even to my music-making." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, recent Theosophists and Anthroposophists {{have tried}} to {{incorporate}} the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in <b>Anthroposophy</b> Hermann Poppelbaum is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate Lemuria with Gondwanaland, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential. [...] Theosophy-like teachings also continue today {{in a group of}} religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "spiritual" [...] is now {{frequently}} used in {{contexts in which}} the term [...] "religious" [...] was formerly employed. Contemporary spirituality is also called [...] "post-traditional spirituality" [...] and [...] "New Age spirituality". Hanegraaf makes a distinction between two [...] "New Age" [...] movements: New Age in a restricted sense, which originated primarily in mid-twentieth century England and had its roots in Theosophy and <b>Anthroposophy,</b> and [...] "New Age" [...] in a general sense, which emerged in the later 1970s ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophical}} {{foundation of}} the Waldorf approach, <b>anthroposophy,</b> underpins its primary pedagogical goals: to provide an education that enables children to become free human beings, and to help children to incarnate their [...] "unfolding spiritual identity", carried from the preceding spiritual existence, as beings of body, soul, and spirit in this lifetime. Educational researcher Martin Ashley suggests that the latter role would be problematic for secular teachers and parents in state schools, and the commitment to a spiritual background both {{of the child and}} the education has been problematic for some committed to a secular perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Blavatsky took up Donnelly's interpretations {{when she}} wrote The Secret Doctrine (1888), which she claimed was {{originally}} dictated in Atlantis. She maintained that the Atlanteans were cultural heroes (contrary to Plato, who describes them mainly as a military threat). She believed in a form of racial evolution (as opposed to primate evolution), in which the Atlanteans were the fourth [...] "Root Race", succeeded by the fifth and most superior [...] "Aryan race" [...] (her own race). The Theosophists believed that the civilization of Atlantis reached its peak between 1,000,000 and 900,000 years ago, but destroyed itself through internal warfare {{brought about by the}} dangerous use of psychic and supernatural powers of the inhabitants. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of <b>anthroposophy</b> and Waldorf Schools, along with other well known Theosophists, such as Annie Besant, also wrote of cultural evolution in much the same vein.|$|E
2500|$|Ryti did, {{according}} {{to some of his}} friends and acquaintances, strongly believe in fate. After a dinner in the 1930s at the home of a friend, Alvar Renqvist, in Helsinki, Ryti told the other guests, {{according to}} Heikki A. Reenpää, Alvar Renqvist's grandson: [...] "In my life, fate has been the ruling force. If it had not been benevolent, I would not sit here now." [...] One of Finland's most famous clairvoyants, Aino Kassinen, recalled in her memoirs that she met Ryti in the 1930s in Helsinki, and got the understanding that Ryti strongly believed in people's being guided by the higher divine powers, and that he strongly believed in God, and had studied theosophy and <b>anthroposophy.</b> Ryti's wife Gerda was a much more active spiritualist and theosophist than Ryti himself; [...] she even claimed to have a spirit guide.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, BBC News {{broadcast}} an item about {{accusations that}} {{the establishment of}} a state-funded Waldorf School in Frome was a misguided use of public money. The broadcast reported that concerns were being raised about Rudolf Steiner's beliefs, stating he [...] "believed in reincarnation and said it was related to race, with black (schwarz) people being the least spiritually developed, and white (weiß) people the most." [...] In 2007, the European Council for Steiner Waldorf Education (ECSWE) issued a statement, [...] "Waldorf schools against discrimination", which said in part, [...] "Waldorf schools do not select, stratify or discriminate amongst their pupils, but consider all human beings to be free and equal in dignity and rights, independent of ethnicity, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, and political or other convictions. <b>Anthroposophy,</b> upon which Waldorf education is founded, stands firmly against all forms of racism and nationalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this context, Cioculescu's main {{grievance}} against Eliade was the latter's {{rejection of}} rationalist approaches, {{as well as}} Eliade's exclusive focus on the Romanian Orthodox Church as a vehicle of Romanian spirituality. In particular, Cioculescu noted that Eliade's ideas, borrowed from his mentor Nae Ionescu, vainly attempted to transform the local Orthodoxy into a political movement, and did so by imitating the Roman Catholic Church. To this, he argued, were added Eliade's own eclecticism and [...] "mystical spasms", which he believed explained why the thinker had tried to reconcile Orthodoxy with <b>Anthroposophy,</b> Eastern philosophy, Liberal Christianity or Urreligion. In his replies to Cioculescu's articles, Eliade explained that he neither excluded reason nor prioritized Orthodoxy, but that he believed {{in the importance of}} intuition and understood the local church as just one of several supports of a spiritual revolution. In tandem, Cioculescu also reacted against his fellow secularist, philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who viewed Romanian spirituality as tied not to a religious institution, but to rural traditions and an immutable village—in Cioculescu's view, even this theory was proven false by the [...] "rapid evolutionary process" [...] which had transformed the Romanian peasantry.|$|E
2500|$|Blavatsky's Theosophy {{has been}} {{described}} as representing [...] "a major factor in the modern revival" [...] of Western esotericism. Godwin deemed there to be [...] "no more important figure in modern times" [...] within the Western esoteric tradition than Blavatsky. For Johnson, Blavatsky was [...] "a central figure in the nineteenth-century occult revival". Lachman claimed that [...] "practically all modern occultism and esotericism" [...] can trace its origins back to her influence. [...] Blavatsky's published Theosophical ideas, particularly those regarding Root Races, have been cited as an influence on Ariosophy, the esoteric movement established in late 19th- and early 20th-century Germany and Austria by Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels. Hannah Newman stated that via Ariosophy, Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas [...] "contributed to Nazi ideology". Nevertheless, Lachman has asserted that Blavatsky should not be held accountable to any of the antisemitic and racist ideas that the Ariosophists promoted, commenting that were she alive to witness the development of Ariosophy she probably would have denounced its ideas regarding race. Blavatsky's Theosophical ideas regarding Root Races have also been cited as an influence on <b>Anthroposophy,</b> the esoteric movement developed by Rudolf Steiner in early 20th-century Germany, with Steiner's Anthroposophical Society being termed a [...] "historical offshoot" [...] of the Theosophical Society.|$|E

PLANS argued that Steiner himself described <b>anthroposophy</b> as a training to access skills of psychic awareness latent in each human being, and argued that the discipline [...] "spiritual science" [...] is not a true science nor philosophy, but a theology. PLANS acknowledged that Steiner's supporters frequently concede the spiritual foundations of <b>anthroposophy</b> and Waldorf education, but claimed they make a false distinction between spiritual and religious.
