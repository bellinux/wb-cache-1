40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Lateral {{movement}} of reclamations and ground adjoining rivers and foreshores can {{occur as a}} result of earthquake shaking. The mechanism of this lateral movement is discussed and methods <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> used are presented. Both empirical and mechanics based methods <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> are used. Case studies <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>of</b> construction works to mitigate the effects of lateral movement are presented. The mechanics based and empirical methods <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> include simplifications and assumptions. It is concluded that any assessment of lateral movement potential should include as many methods <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> as practical and include sensitivity checks on the assumed parameters. Ultimately, these methods provide support to engineering judgement to assess the likely performance of a site. ...|$|R
