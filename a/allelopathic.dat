5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and <b>allelopathic.</b> An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties are due to alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins. The most-studied alkaloids in this group are galantamine (galanthamine), lycorine, narciclasine, and pretazettine.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an <b>allelopathic</b> chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Towards the {{southern}} parts of its range, white spruce encounters increasingly effective ecological competition from hardwoods, {{some of which}} may reinforce their growth-rate/sprouting competitiveness with <b>allelopathic</b> depredation of coniferous regeneration (Tubbs 1976). Further southward extension of the distribution is inhibited by white spruce’s cold requirement.|$|E
25|$|Allelopathy: Bracken fern {{is known}} to produce and release <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals, which is an {{important}} factor in its ability to dominate other vegetation, particularly in regrowth after fire. Its chemical diffusions, shady canopy and its thick litter inhibit other plant species from establishing themselves – with the occasional exception of plants which support rare butterflies. Herb and tree seedling growth may be inhibited even after bracken fern is removed, apparently because active plant toxins remain in the soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{planting}} of Eucalyptus sp. has been criticised {{because of concerns}} that soil would be degraded by nutrient depletion and other biological changes. During the last ten years, in the northwestern regions of Uruguay the Eucalyptus sp. plantations have reached annual forestation rates of 300%. That zone has a potential forested area of 1,000,000 hectares, approximately 29% of the national territory dedicated to forestry, of which approximately 800,000 hectares are currently forested by monoculture of Eucalyptus spp. It is expected that the radical and durable substitution of vegetation cover leads {{to changes in the}} quantity and quality of soil organic matter. Such changes may also influence soil fertility and soil physical and chemical properties. The soil quality effects associated with Eucalyptus sp. plantations could have negative effects on soil chemistry; for example: soil acidification, iron leaching, <b>allelopathic</b> activities and a high C:N ratio of litter. Additionally, as most scientific understanding of land cover change effects is related to ecosystems where forests were replaced by grasslands or crops, or grassland was replaced by crops, the environmental effects of the current Uruguayan land cover changes are not well understood. The first scientific publication on soil studies in western zone tree plantations (focused on pulp production) appeared in 2004 and described soil acidification and soil carbon changes, similar to a podzolisation process, and destruction of clay (illite-like minerals), which is the main reservoir of potassium in the soil. Although these studies were carried out in an important zone for forest cultivation, they cannot define the current situation in the rest of the land area under eucalyptus cultivation. Moreover, recently Jackson and Jobbagy have proposed another adverse environmental impact that may result from Eucalyptus culture on prairie soils: stream acidification.|$|E
500|$|Red maple {{is able to}} {{increase}} its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after clearcutting a [...] Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than [...] One of its associates, the black cherry (Prunus serotina), contains benzoic acid, which {{has been shown to}} be a potential <b>allelopathic</b> inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow [...] in their first year and up to [...] each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.|$|E
500|$|The {{tree was}} first brought from China to Europe in the 1740s {{and to the}} United States in 1784. It {{was one of the}} first trees brought west during a time when chinoiserie was {{dominating}} European arts, and was initially hailed as a beautiful garden specimen. However, enthusiasm soon waned after gardeners became familiar with its suckering habits and its foul smelling odour. Despite this, it was used extensively as a street tree during much of the 19th century. Outside Europe and the United States the plant has been spread to many other areas beyond its native range. In a number of these, it has become an invasive species due to its ability both to colonise disturbed areas quickly and to suppress competition with <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals. It is considered a noxious weed in Australia, the United States, New Zealand and many countries of central, eastern and southern Europe. The tree also resprouts vigorously when cut, making its eradication difficult and time-consuming. In many urban areas, it has acquired the derisive nicknames of [...] "ghetto palm", [...] "stink tree", and [...] "tree of Hell".|$|E
500|$|The dried bark, however, {{is still}} an {{officinal}} drug and is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (...) , meaning [...] "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then scraping off the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark {{is said to have}} cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the <b>allelopathic</b> chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known antimalarial agent. It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{eucalyptus}} {{species have}} attracted attention from horticulturists, global development researchers, and environmentalists because of desirable traits {{such as being}} fast-growing sources of wood, producing oil {{that can be used}} for cleaning and as a natural insecticide, or an ability to be used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria. Eucalyptus oil finds many uses like in fuels, fragrances, insect repellance and antimicrobial activity. Eucalyptus trees show <b>allelopathic</b> effects; they release compounds which inhibit other plant species from growing nearby. Outside their natural ranges, eucalypts are both lauded for their beneficial economic impact on poor populations and criticised for being [...] "water-guzzling" [...] aliens, leading to controversy over their total impact.|$|E
2500|$|Some plants become {{dominant}} when {{introduced into}} new environments because {{the animals in}} their original environment, that compete with them or feed on them are absent; in what is sometimes called the “natural enemies hypothesis”, plants freed from these specialist consumers may become dominant. An example is Klamath weed, that threatened millions of hectares of prime grain and grazing land in North America after it was accidentally introduced, but {{was reduced to a}} rare roadside weed within several years after some of its natural enemies were imported during World War II. In locations where predation and mutually competitive relationships are absent, weeds have increased resources available for growth and reproduction. The weediness of some species that are introduced into new environments may be caused by their production of <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals which indigenous plants are not yet adapted to, a scenario sometimes called the [...] "novel weapons hypothesis". These chemicals may limit the growth of established plants or the germination and growth of seeds and seedlings.|$|E
2500|$|As garden trees, {{they have}} some drawbacks, in {{particular}} the falling nuts, and the releasing of the <b>allelopathic</b> compound juglone, though a number of gardeners do grow them. However, different walnut species vary {{in the amount of}} juglone they release from the roots and fallen leaves - J.nigra, in particular, is known for its toxicity, both to plants and horses. Juglone is toxic to plants such as tomato, apple, and birch, and may cause stunting and death of nearby vegetation. [...] Juglone appears {{to be one of the}} walnut's primary defence mechanisms against potential competitors for resources (water, nutrients and sunlight), and its effects are felt most strongly inside the tree's [...] "drip line" [...] (the circle around the tree marked by the horizontal distance of its outermost branches). However, even plants at a seemingly great distance outside the drip line can be affected, and juglone can linger in the soil for several years even after a walnut is removed as its roots slowly decompose and release juglone into the soil.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{aspect of}} diffuse knapweed’s success {{relies on the}} effect of its <b>allelopathic</b> {{chemicals}} in its novel environment. [...] Although there is still debate concerning the effectiveness of <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals in the field, the evidence of <b>allelopathic</b> effects demonstrated in a laboratory setting and its propensity to establish monocultures support the importance of allelopathy to diffuse knapweed’s success.|$|E
50|$|The Manchurian walnut {{contains}} and exudes much lesser {{quantities of}} <b>allelopathic</b> compounds (such as juglone) than other popular Juglans species and usually causes few significant <b>allelopathic</b> effects in cultivation.|$|E
50|$|Many crop cultivars show strong <b>allelopathic</b> properties, {{of which}} rice (Oryza sativa) {{has been most}} studied. Rice {{allelopathy}} depends on variety and origin: Japonica rice is more <b>allelopathic</b> than Indica and Japonica-Indica hybrid. More recently, critical review on rice allelopathy and the possibility for weed management reported that <b>allelopathic</b> characteristics in rice are quantitatively inherited and several allelopathy-involved traits have been identified.|$|E
50|$|Singrin is {{also known}} to be <b>allelopathic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Curiously, diffuse knapweed’s <b>allelopathic</b> {{chemicals}} {{were shown}} to have a deleterious effect on the North American competitors but were beneficial to its native competitors. [...] While diffuse knapweed’s native competitors are able to compete more effectively {{in the presence of}} <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals, the novel competitor’s fitness is decreased. This situation provides an example of the effectiveness of the allelopathy mechanism benefiting from the ERH. The increased effectiveness of <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals cause diffuse knapweed to experience less competitive pressure. As a result, diffuse knapweed is able to establish more predominantly in this new area.|$|E
50|$|The {{species can}} be {{strongly}} <b>allelopathic,</b> preventing other plants from growing nearby.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} been shown to have <b>allelopathic</b> effects on other plants.|$|E
50|$|Natural phenols can be {{involved}} in <b>allelopathic</b> interactions, for example in soil or in water. Juglone {{is an example of}} such a molecule inhibiting the growth of other plant species around walnut trees. The aquatic vascular plant Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic, gallic and pyrogallic acids and (+)-catechin, <b>allelopathic</b> phenolic compounds inhibiting the growth of blue-green alga Microcystis aeruginosa.|$|E
5000|$|Cover crops (especially {{those with}} <b>allelopathic</b> properties) that out-compete weeds or inhibit their regeneration.|$|E
50|$|Flax and Myriophyllum spicatum (a {{submerged}} aquatic plant) secrete polyphenols {{that are}} involved in <b>allelopathic</b> interactions.|$|E
5000|$|The hulls, or shells, mostly {{composed}} of cellulose, decomposes slowly {{and may be}} burned as biomass fuel. [...] Sunflower hulls of the cultivated sunflower (Helianthus annuus) contain <b>allelopathic</b> compounds which are toxic to grasses {{and the vast majority}} of cultivated garden plants. [...] Only a small number of garden plants, such as day lillies, are unaffected by the <b>allelopathic</b> compounds found in sunflower hulls.|$|E
50|$|Sugarberry's {{leaf litter}} {{contains}} <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals that inhibit seed germination and growth {{in many other}} plant species.|$|E
5000|$|Living mulches control weeds in two ways. When {{they are}} seeded before weed establishment, they {{suppress}} weeds by competition. In some situations, the <b>allelopathic</b> properties of living mulches {{can be used}} to control weeds. For example, the <b>allelopathic</b> properties of winter rye (Secale cereale), ryegrasses (Lolium spp), and subterrain clover (Trifolium subterraneum) {{can be used to}} control weeds in sweet corn (Zea mays var [...] "rugosa") and snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).|$|E

50|$|The plant {{produces}} <b>Allelopathic</b> {{chemicals that}} suppress crop and pasture plants, and allergens that affect humans and livestock. It also frequently causes pollen allergies.|$|E
5000|$|Black walnut is <b>allelopathic</b> as it excretes {{chemicals}} {{into its}} environment which harm competition. While {{many species of}} plants are <b>allelopathic,</b> walnuts are particularly famous for it, records of walnut toxicity to other plants have been observed {{as far back as}} the first century when Pliny the Elder wrote: [...] "The shadow of walnut trees is poison to all plants within its compass." [...] Walnuts have since been observed as being toxic to many plants including herbaceous and woody plants ...|$|E
50|$|Allelopathy is a {{biological}} phenomenon by which an organism produces {{one or more}} biochemicals that influence the germination, growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms. These biochemicals are known as allelochemicals and can have beneficial (positive allelopathy) or detrimental (negative allelopathy) effects on the target organisms and the community. Allelochemicals are a subset of secondary metabolites, which are not required for metabolism (i.e. growth, development and reproduction) of the <b>allelopathic</b> organism. Allelochemicals with negative <b>allelopathic</b> effects {{are an important part}} of plant defense against herbivory.|$|E
5000|$|Fall rye has an <b>allelopathic</b> effect against many weeds, {{inhibiting}} weed germination and weed growth, these <b>allelopathic</b> {{effects have}} been found to reduce total weed biomass by 60-95% in the succeeding year that rye has been grown and the crop residue has been left on the field. Little to no herbicides may be required for fall rye as fall rye is sensitive to herbicides and if the competitive growth of the rye crop establishes a vigorous canopy early in the season, weed growth will be suppressed ...|$|E
50|$|Among other <b>allelopathic</b> {{effects of}} the species, the {{presence}} of Parthenium pollen grains inhibits fruit set in tomato, brinjal, beans, {{and a number of}} other crop plants.|$|E
50|$|Hydrilla verticillata is <b>allelopathic</b> to {{the common}} hornwort (Ceratophyllum demersum) and prickly hornwort (C. muricatum), that is, it {{produces}} compounds that inhibit growth of the latter two species.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{connection}} between allelopathy and the ERH {{is the fact}} that concentrations of <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals were found to increase when diffuse knapweed was planted in North American soil as opposed to Eurasian soil. [...] This effect is probably due to the absence of unfavorable soil conditions or soil microorganisms that exist in its native environment. As a result, the <b>allelopathic</b> chemicals will be able to reach higher concentrations, spread farther and therefore be more effective. By effecting more neighboring plants, the favorable changes in soil condition contribute to the success of diffuse knapweed.|$|E
50|$|It is a known <b>allelopathic</b> plant, whose roots secrete several {{substances}} inhibiting root growth, {{including its}} own. It {{can be controlled}} through rotation with clover and grasses where possible.|$|E
