40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{assessed}} whether undergraduate electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers {{would be more}} apt to set <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> and spend less time gambling when asked to consider setting <b>an</b> explicit <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> prior to their gambling session. To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on play and entering that <b>limit</b> in <b>an</b> available text box prior to commencing play. In the no <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> pop-up message). <b>As</b> predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions. The results provide preliminary support for the contention that setting <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on EGM play is an effective responsible gambling strategy...|$|R

5|$|Besides the anime {{television}} series, {{there have}} been two other animated adaptations: The Very Short Azumanga Daioh Movie, a six-minute trailer released to movie theaters to publicize the upcoming television series, and Azumanga Web Daioh, a shorter original net animation made available for paid streaming on chara-ani.com beginning from December 28, 2000, then offered as a paid download for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> Azumanga Web Daioh was originally intended to gauge whether there was enough interest to create a web-released anime adaptation; because of overwhelming demand, the original plan for web-release was changed to a television release.

5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, {{there was}} a call for the product's {{reinstatement}} from fans of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E

Because of delays in fulfilling the offer, Capcom shipped copies of all three covers to those that registered.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses whether <b>a</b> five-year <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> {{on welfare}} participation encourages behaviors {{that lead to}} less reliance on public assistance. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, it describes young women 2 ̆ 7 s decisions about childbearing, schooling, working and welfare participation over time. The parameters underlying these decisions are estimated by fitting the model to data on observed choices obtained from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Estimation is done using a simulated maximum likelihood procedure. Parameter estimates are used to simulate choices under current policy and under a policy of <b>a</b> five-year <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> on welfare participation. This provides a way of assessing effects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> The results suggest that <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> has <b>a</b> {{significant impact on the}} behavior of those at highest risk for welfare participation. When faced with <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> they have fewer children, work and attend school more and rely on less welfare. In fact, <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> leads to shorter-term welfare participation, apart from the purely 2 ̆ 2 mechanical 2 ̆ 2 effect of making long-term recipients categorically ineligible. Thus <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> does encourage self-sufficiency in the sense that individuals rely more on other sources of support. At the same time, it appears that the shift occurs towards sources of support other than full-time work {{to a greater extent than}} towards full-time school attendance or full-time work. ...|$|R

5|$|Though slavery persisted, {{some aspects}} of the {{relationship}} changed with the French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time</b> offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so {{appeared to be}} involved in the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} April, Himmler ordered Berger {{to obtain}} 20,000 new {{recruits}} for the Waffen-SS {{by the end of}} May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time.</b> He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the Allgemeine SS and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the Waffen-SS in this period, and they were sent to join the SS-Division-Wiking.|$|E
5|$|Band Hero also {{introduced}} an updated {{revision of the}} drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour.

The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous triangular design, and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted. An in-game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported. In the United States, the new controller was, for <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> <b>time,</b> exclusive to the game and instrument bundles of Band Hero on Wii. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date; Band Hero bundles for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour drum controller.|$|E
