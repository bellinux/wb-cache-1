6000|$|Yes, he had, {{first and}} last, seen {{a good many}} queer things both by day and night, in woods and other places, he replied, and then continued: [...] "But you see it's like this. We see {{something}} and say, 'Now that's a very curious thing!' and then we forget all about it. You see, we don't lay no store by such things; we ain't scholards and don't know nothing about what's said in books. We see something and say That's something we never saw before and never heard tell of, but maybe others have seen it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it in the books. So that's how 'tis, but if I hadn't forgotten them I could have told {{you a lot of}} queer things." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{worst of}} it is, however, that I don't know one thing which I ought very {{thoroughly}} to have known at least thirty years ago, namely, the true {{difference in the way}} of building the trunk in outlaid and inlaid wood. I have an idea that the stem of a palm-tree is only a heap of leaf-roots built up like a tower of bricks, year by year, and that the palm tree really grows on the top of it, like a bunch of fern; but I've no books here, and no time to read them if I had. If only I were a strong giant, instead of a thin old gentleman of fifty-five, how I should like to pull up one of those little palm-trees by the roots--(by the way, what are the roots of a palm like? and, how does it stand in sand, where it is wanted to stand, mostly? Fancy, not knowing that, at fifty-five!)--that grow all along the Riviera; and snap its stem in two, and cut it down the middle. But I suppose there are sections enough now in our grand botanical collections, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> it all out for yourself. That {{you should be able to}} ask a question clearly, is two-thirds of the way to getting it answered; and I think this chapter of mine will at {167} least enable you to ask some questions about the stem, though what a stem is, truly, [...] "I am not sent to tell thee, for I do not know." ...|$|E
60|$|Providence {{really helps}} {{those who do}} not help themselves. I went up a street, name unknown, {{attracted}} by the colour that was so wantonly flashed down its length. There is colour in Rajputana and in Southern India, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> a whole paletteful of raw tints at any down-country durbar; but the Burmese way of colouring is different. With the women the scarf, petticoat, and jacket are of three lively hues, and with the men putso and head-wrap are gorgeous. Thus you get your colours dashed down in dots against a background of dark timber houses set in green foliage. There are no canons of art anywhere, and every scheme of colouring depends on the power of the sun above. That is why men in a London fog do still believe in pale greens and sad reds. Give me lilac, pink, vermilion, lapis lazuli, and blistering blood red under fierce sunlight that mellows and modifies all. I had just made this discovery and was noting that the people treated their cattle kindly, when the driver of an absurd little hired carriage built to the scale of a fat Burma pony, volunteered to take me for a drive, and we drove {{in the direction of the}} English quarter of the town where the sahibs live in dainty little houses made out of the sides of cigar boxes. They looked as if they could be kicked in at a blow and (trust a Globe-trotter for evolving a theory at a minute's notice) it is to avoid this fate that they are built for the most part on legs. The houses are not cantonment bred in any way--nor did the uneven ground and dusty reddish roads fit in with any part of the Indian Empire except it may be Ootacamund.|$|E
