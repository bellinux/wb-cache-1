40|$|No {{aspect of}} the {{practice}} of pediatric anesthesia is more essential than airway management. Pediatric anesthesiologists are the ‘go to’ specialists when infants and children with difficult airways present anywhere in the hospital. To our advantage, rapid technical advances have taken place during the past decades and the number of tools available to <b>assist</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>providing</b> and maintaining a secure and stable airway has increased significantly. Until the 1970 s tracheal intubation with a conventional laryngoscope or blind nasal intubation were the mainstays of establishing an artificial airway. The choice of endotracheal tubes was limited. During the past 20 years a remarkable assortment of equipment and novel techniques to facilitate optimal airway management have been developed. These include supraglottic airways, direct and fiberoptic laryngoscopes and transtracheal devices. Improved imaging of the airway prior to initiation of airway management, with CT and MRI, for example, and during airway manipulation and instrumentation, using fiberoptic cameras and portable video displays, is now widely used. While new developments in airway management have helped us improve the quality of care of our patients, new challenges have also arisen. Which techniques should we learn, teach and employ? Which endotracheal tubes should be utilized – uncuffed or cuffed, old or new design? Which of our patients need preoperative imaging of the airway and/or sleep studies? What are the risks of newer interventions, including novel airway devices and laser instruments...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} comprises {{an invaluable}} {{part of the}} total health care provided to patients. Competency assessment is one method by which we can verify that our employees are competent to perform laboratory testing and report accurate and timely results. To derive the greatest benefit from the inclusion of competency assessment in the laboratory, we must {{be sure that we}} are addressing areas where our efforts can be best utilized to optimize patient care. To be competent, an employee must know how to perform a test, must have the ability to perform the test, must be able to perform the test properly without supervision, and know when {{there is a problem with}} the test that must be solved. In some cases, competency assessment protocols may demonstrate areas of competence but can fail to disclose incompetence. For example, challenges of low-complexity tasks (such as reading the technical procedure manual) are inferior to challenges that measure understanding and execution of a protocol, and poorly designed competency challenges will probably not detect substandard laboratory performance. Thus, if we are to receive the greatest benefit from our competency assessment programs, which may be time-consuming for the supervisors and the staff as well, we must not only meet the letter of the law but also find a way to make these assessments meaningful, instructive, and able to detect areas of concern. As we address competency assessment in our laboratories, we must understand that when done properly, competency assessment will reward our organizations and <b>assist</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>providing</b> the best possible care to our patients...|$|E
