40|$|During {{the latter}} half of 1990 the Royal Air Force {{established}} a medical evacuation chain in support of the British First Armoured Division during Operation Granby (known as Operation Desert Storm in the USA). Medical contingency plans, formulated prior to embarkation from the UK, foresaw the need for five <b>aeromedical</b> <b>staging</b> facilities sub-deployed throughout the east of the Arabian Peninsula. The early days of the deployment found personnel busy with the construction of tented and hardened facilities and with the establishment of local operating procedures. Many problems were initially encountered, especially with supply, communications and in co-ordinating with collaborating coalition and host nation units. Nevertheless, progress was rapid and non-combatant operations were started within days of arrival. As the ground offensive became more imminent, training took on a sense of urgency. Advanced first aid techniques were taught to all non-medical staff, whereas doctors, nurses and paramedical personnel were taught ACLS and ATLS skills. All studied field hygiene, the hazards of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare, casualty handling, battle psychology and the intricacies of loading and unloading various types of aircraft. By the start of the ground phase of the war the British evacuation chain was fully operational and capable of treating and transferring hundreds of casualties per day. In the event, only about 850 patients were transported down the evacuation chain during the conflict, and less than 10 % of these were battle casualties. This paper presents an overview of the British aeromedical evacuation system and discusses, in more detail, the establishment and operation of the busiest <b>aeromedical</b> <b>staging</b> facility at Al Jubail in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|Three {{separate}} estimators, for {{the estimation}} of the population total, based on two-stage sampling design on two successive occasions with partial replacement of secondary <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> only have been presented.

Empirically, it has been found that the estimator that uses individual weights within first <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> perform better than the other estimators that use common weights in estimating the population total. Theoretically, it has also been shown that the larger the ratio of the within first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability of the non-respondents to the between first <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> variability the higher the gain in efficiency of the proposed estimators over the estimator obtained when there is no partial matching of units...|$|R

Aircrews from all three flying squadrons flew supplies and equipment to Antarctica in Operation Deep Freeze, a presidential mandated mission to support the National Science Foundation's experiments at the South Pole. Aeromedical crews from the 446th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron flew their first C-17 aerovac mission airlifting an 8-month-old baby.

50|$|The 86th TFW and Ramstein {{had just}} begun to absorb the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union {{and the end of the}} Cold War when, in August 1990, the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Under Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, much to the dismay of the 86th TFW personnel, their F-16s did not deploy to the Persian Gulf like so many of its USAFE counterparts. Instead, Ramstein became an intermediate support base for American forces deployed to the Persian Gulf and, on 10 August 1990, Ramstein began receiving MAC stage crews as the base became an overflow airfield for Rhein-Main AB, supporting strategic airlift traffic to the Persian Gulf.In addition to serving as a central overflow hub for airlift traffic flying between the US and the Arabian Peninsula, Ramstein also established an intermediate engine repair facility for deployed F-16s, became a huge collection and distribution center for gulf-bound munitions, and on 15 January 1991, Ramstein AB's <b>aeromedical</b> <b>staging</b> facility activated a 150-bed hospital and blood transshipment center in Hangar 1. The hospital provided triage to its first patients from the Persian Gulf on the same day.

40|$|For large, {{national}} surveys, stratified {{two stage}} sample designs are frequently used. In these surveys, unequal probability sampling {{is almost always}} used {{in the selection of}} first <b>stage</b> <b>units.</b> Typically, the sampling procedure does not allow these first <b>stage</b> <b>units</b> to be selected more than one time (i. e., without replacement). This design has several desirable properties, but one major problem: the estimation of sampling errors can be quite complicated. One frequently used estimator of variance for two stage sample designs is Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR). In BRR, variance is estimated from "balanced " half-samples constructed from the original sample. BRR has been shown to produce unbiased estimates of variance for linear estimators when sampling takes place using with replacemen...|$|R
40|$|The cyclic or {{sequencing}} batch {{activated sludge}} process {{was applied for}} the treatment of septage originating from cesspools serving non-sewered areas. Single and two stage systems were investigated in bench scale <b>units.</b> The single <b>stage</b> aerated system was capable in removing practically all the biodegradable COD and producing a well stabilised excess sludge with excellent settling and thickening characteristics. With respect to nitrogen the average removal rate was to the order of 70 %, but the performance was unstable due to periodic strong inhibition of the nitrification process. Subsequent treatment in a second <b>stage</b> aerated <b>unit</b> improved nitrification but did not result in higher nitrogen removal rates due to the increased concentrations of oxidised nitrogen, An anoxic second <b>stage</b> post denitrification <b>unit</b> resulted in an overall nitrogen removal of 88 %, through a substantial reduction of nitrates. Further improvement of the system, with nitrogen removal of about 95 % and average effluent nitrogen concentrations lower than 10 mg. l(- 1), can be achieved by adoption of a two stage system consisting of a first aerated <b>stage</b> <b>unit,</b> followed by a second <b>stage</b> <b>unit</b> with alternating aerated and anoxic cycles and addition of external carbon during the anoxic cycle...|$|R
