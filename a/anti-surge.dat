Compressor surge can occur when the compression systems are subjected to rapid transients such as those caused by and emergency shutdown (ESD) or a power failure. Compression systems, like other second-order dynamic systems, are prone to instabilities. These depend on compressor head-flow characteristics of the compressor units as well as the dynamic characteristics of the machinery train and associated piping systems. Parameters such as gas volume capacitance in the recycle path, compressor power train inertia and the recycle valve capacity, <b>anti-surge</b> valve prestroke and stroke time, and check valve dynamic characteristics are crucial in determining the conditions for dynamic instabilities to occur. <b>Anti-surge</b> control protocols also contribute to potential compressor instabilities particularly when the compressor is operating close to the surge control line.

40|$|To {{provide a}} good deal of {{manufacturing}} processes, is used a compressed air, which is produced by compressors of various types, including turbochargers. In highlands, the turbocharger operation is characterized {{by the fact that the}} actual performance of the turbochargers differ significantly from the certified values, and the compressed air parameters do not always guarantee the smooth and efficient functioning of using equipment. The conducted theoretical and experimental studies have found out that the highland has impact on the probability of emerging surge. The paper proposes a method to determine a performance margin, which can reduce the overcapacity, i. e., to bring the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the <b>anti-surge</b> valve. The paper presents research results of the turbochargers of the type 4 CI 425 MX 4, a series of "CENTAC" manufactured by INGERSOL – RAND, made under production-line conditions in the highland under severe weather conditions. A boundary position of the surge can significantly vary depending on the atmospheric air condition (pressure, temperature, humidity). Knowing the current position of the surge zone and the operating point of the compressor it is possible to regulate the compressor capacity so that, when moving the operating point in the area of low consumption, to provide maximum approximation of the operating point to the border zone of the surge without opening the <b>anti-surge</b> valve. The performance margin relative to the border of surge margin sets the lower limit of regulation and its choice depends on the speed of the operating point movement towards reducing consumption. A reliably determined starting point of the unstable turbocharger operation is an important component to maintain the reliable operation of the air-compressed installations. As follows from the data in the article, the borders of the starting surge and the line of the maximum acceleration of the operating point movement towards surge with decreasing density of the intake air are moved to the left of the operating point, and the value of surge margin increases.

40|$|The {{development}} of wet gas compressors for installation subsea {{is key to}} increase the recovery {{of oil and gas}} from the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Safe operation of the compressor depends on understanding of how wet gas affects the behavior of the machine. The compressor operating range is limited by stall and surge, and it is therefore particularly important to determine how liquid will affect the inception of these phenomena. Measuring pressure transients within the compressor or in the inlet and discharge pipe are widely used in experimental investigation of stall and surge. Spectral analysis of the pressure signal is used to detect aerodynamic instabilities in compressor. Pressure measurements are also {{an important part of the}} <b>anti-surge</b> control systems, and it is used for continuous condition monitoring of the machine. It is therefore important to determine how liquid affect the pressure measurements. This thesis consists of three main parts. The first part describes and explains stall and surge, and introduces various pressure measurement techniques that can be used to measure pressure transients in centrifugal compressors. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors are well suited to this. They have a wide operating range, high stability and sensitivity, and are very robust. Pressure sensitive paint (PSP) and stress-sensitive films (S 3 F) are interesting alternatives. These techniques measure global surface pressure, which is very useful when investigating complex flow fields. The second part investigates how wet gas affects compressor stability, and how liquid presence affect pressure measurements in wet gas flows. Results from the test facility for wet gas compression at NTNU have shown that wet gas has a stabilizing effect on the compressor. Unfortunately, it is difficult to interpret the measurements due to large uncertainties around how liquid affects pressure measurements. Liquid presence may cause suppression and/or enhancement of certain frequencies, and also introduce additional frequencies that are specifically related to the dynamic characteristic of the liquid phase. The existing literature on this particular topic is very limited, but evaluation of various multiphase experiments has given some insight. It has been shown experimentally that droplets entrained in a gas phase dampen out pressure fluctuations. High frequency components will be most affected, but experiments have also shown significant dampening of frequencies down to 100 Hz. The presence of a liquid film is believed to cause amplification of random frequencies in the lower frequency range. Turbulence and vortex formation causes a chaotic and highly dynamic flow pattern in the film, and this will affect the pressure measured at the wall. The liquid film will also reduce the performance of PSP and make the use of S 3 F more complicated. Piezoelectric and piezoresistive pressure sensors will not be directly affected. To increase the understanding of how liquid affects the pressure measurements in wet gas flows an experiment is planned to examine how thin liquid films will affect the surface pressure in wet gas flows. More knowledge in this field is important for future research of wet stall and surge. The economical consequences of stall and surge are massive. In particular if the compressor is installed subsea. Safe running of the compressors is therefore dependent on a <b>anti-surge</b> system that prevents the compressor from becoming unstable. The final part of the report investigates <b>anti-surge</b> control in subsea compression, and how the performance of different systems is affected by liquid. Surge control based on surge avoidance is currently the safest and most reliable technique. However, the performance of these systems is significantly reduced in wet gas compression. Liquid changes the compressor characteristic, and affects the wear and tear of the machine. Liquid presence will also reduce the accuracy of flow, pressure and temperature measurements. By installing dynamic pressure sensors inside the compressor or outside in the connected pipeline, condition monitoring of the machine could be significantly improved. However, due to the challenging subsea environment and the high requirements to sensor performance, it is difficult to finding an optimal sensor is challenging. It is also difficult to determine where the sensors should be installed. This requires knowledge of how the liquid is distributed in the compressor, and will also depend on detailed knowledge of the liquid will affect the pressure measuremen...|$|E
40|$|TutorialTutorial 10 A: Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are subject}} to transient events, such as emergency shutdowns, which can cause energetic surge events during rapid shutdown transients. Many modeling tools are used to predict the behavior of compressor systems during fast transient events. Even more, centrifugal compressor dynamic modeling is a valuable assessment tool that can help improve {{the design of the}} compressor <b>anti-surge</b> system to prevent harsh conditions while the unit is coasting down. Modeling of centrifugal compressor transient events requires a detailed evaluation of many system variables to obtain accurate results. Additionally, many parameters should be included and analyzed to adjust the model and obtain acceptable predictions. Those parameters can include recycle valve characteristics, the controller and actuator, suction and discharge piping volumes, aftercoolers, and operating conditions. Other parameters, such as machine coast down speed and inertia and different control response times will determine if the compressor will reach its surge limit at a detrimental high head condition, avoid it or go through it at low acceptable energy conditions. Many designs use general guidelines to select and plan the compressor <b>anti-surge</b> system and its main components. For example, the recycle valve type, size and actuation time are key parameters during the shutdown of the compressor unit since they directly affect the amount of flow through the compressor and its reaction time. Other factors are also relevant and should be assessed in detail to assure a proper design to avoid such transient events as a sudden shutdown of a compressor from a full load or high head operating conditions resulting in damaging surge events. In order to refine the simulation approach of the transients in centrifugal compressors, an extensive assessment has been conducted of the main parameters that will affect the modeling predictions. Parameters such as recycle valve size, type, actuation time, after-cooler volume, friction factors, unit speed coast down predictions, compressor map, isolation valve control, acting time, as well as placement of the discharge check valve influence the modeling predictions considerably. Therefore, parametric studies of some of those variables have helped to refine and adjust the modeling technique while improving the accuracy of the results. Moreover, computational predictions have been compared against high fidelity ? high accuracy data collected in a full scale compressor system. Initial comparisons indicated reasonable results while adjustments in the technique and main assumptions improved the modeling predictions considerably. A generic methodology to improve modeling predictions and main considerations are part of the analysis. In addition, a comparison of the modeling results and experimental data are presented and complemented with parametric studies of different variables. In general, this work should provide guidelines for advancing the modeling of centrifugal compressor transients as well as showing the application of a valuable tool for designing surge control systems for centrifugal compressors...|$|E
40|$|Electronic and {{electrical}} appliances used in most {{homes in the}} country are designed to operate at a nominal 230 V AC, which ought to be acceptable within certain tolerable upper and lower limits. Excessive fluctuations beyond these limits may cause the appliance to malfunction or get irreparably damaged. Most protective devices are imported as well as expensive. The circuit presented is a relatively cheap automatic mains voltage switch (AVS) protector that senses undesirable and harmful fluctuations in mains voltages and disconnects the appliance whenever the mains voltage supply goes above or below pre-settable and safe tolerable limits or ‘window’. The appliance is automatically reconnected when mains power returns to normal within that ‘window’. The design features <b>anti-surge</b> protection, a transformerless power supply for the circuitry, a window comparator for the detection of low and excessively high mains voltages to the load and a switching relay capable of switching high currents, ideal for compressor-based appliances. A delay section for control of spurious low voltage drops as well as mains stability is incorporated. The design provides a safe operating voltage range of 180 V to 250 V and offers practically the same functions as those of the imported brands. Basically, the design consists of various circuit building blocks and circuit techniques that would be of interest to the electronic hobbyist...|$|E
