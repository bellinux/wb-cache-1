25|$|Many {{countries}} have passed safety standards limiting {{the types of}} toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials {{used to make a}} toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.|$|E

500|$|Marshall and Nichols {{discovered}} that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require [...] of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with Under Secretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository. [...] "Young man," [...] Bell told him, [...] "you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> silver in troy ounces!"

500|$|Bill Bowes, who {{received}} coaching by Hirst {{and went on}} to play for England, described him as [...] "the finest coach in the world". Len Hutton, another who was coached by Hirst, wrote [...] "I shall <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> George Hirst as the ideal coach. He was a 'natural' one, the guide, the philosopher, and friend of every young fellow who has had a trial under him". Part of Hirst's success at Eton came from his personality and ability to extract the best from people. Bowes noted how his enthusiasm inspired young players, and his humour and kindness led boys to worship him. He could pass on technical knowledge {{in a way that was}} easy to comprehend, backed up with anecdotes to illustrate his point. Bowes described how [...] "he had a rare skill in noting and demonstrating your faults and no less skill in illustrating the remedies".|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E

500|$|After slaking their thirst from {{a nearby}} stream, the crew {{unloaded}} the James Caird and spent the first night on South Georgia in a cave. The next day, Shackleton announced his intention to walk overland to the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness Bay, {{on the other side}} of the island. The crew were too exhausted, and the James Caird too battered, for Shackleton to consider sailing around the island. [...] The trek to Stromness Bay was [...] and after resting for several days, he, along with Worsley and Tom Crean, set out on 19 May. The interior of South Georgia was mountainous and covered with glaciers. Their map of South Georgia showed only the coastline, and on several occasions, they were forced to backtrack when their route was found to be impassable. After a non-stop trek of 36 hours, the trio reached Stromness Bay and were taken to the manager of the whaling station. He was unable to recognise Shackleton, whom he had met during the expedition's stopover on the island nearly two years previously. [...] After a hot bath and a large meal, Worsley set out on a whaler to collect the three men left behind at King Haakon Bay. That night a strong blizzard struck the island. Had it developed while Worsley and the others were on their trek, it would have likely killed them. [...] They were fortunate the weather had been relatively good for their trek across the island. Later, all three trekkers would talk of a [...] "fourth presence" [...] that accompanied them. [...] In his account of the walk, Worsley would write [...] "...I again find myself counting our party—Shackleton, Crean, and I and—who was the other? Of course, there were only three, but it is strange that in mentally reviewing the crossing we should <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a fourth, and then correct ourselves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jemison {{resigned}} from NASA in March 1993. [...] "I left NASA because I'm {{very interested in}} how social sciences interact with technologies," [...] Jemison said. [...] "People <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity." [...] NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed, saying, [...] "NASA had {{spent a lot of}} money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color." [...] Hickam had trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab-J/STS-47. In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008, Jemison said that she was not driven to be the [...] "first black woman to go into space." [...] "I wouldn't have cared less if 2,000 people had gone up before me... I would still have had my hand up, 'I want to do this.'" ...|$|E

[...] Samuel bar Nahman also {{taught in the}} name of Rabbi Jonathan that judges should <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> themselves as if they had a sword hanging over them and Gehenna gaping under them, as Song of Songs [...] says: [...] "Behold, it is the litter of Solomon; 60 mighty men are about it, of the mighty men of Israel. They all handle the sword, and are expert in war; every man has his sword upon his thigh, because of dread in the night." [...] Rabbi Josiah (or others say Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak) interpreted the words, [...] "O house of David, thus says the Lord: 'Execute justice in the morning and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,'" [...] in [...] to mean that judges should render judgment only if the judgment that they are about to give is as clear to them as the morning light.–b1.|$|E
2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I <b>always</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
