Pre-treatment of macrophage cualtures with <b>anti-C</b> 3 <b>antiserum</b> greatly diminished the level of immune adherence reactivity. Alveolar macrophages exposed to crocidolite asbestos in vitro did not exhibit significant levels of immune adherence reactivity. These results may reflect an in-vivo antigen-antibody-complement interaction {{on the surface of}} a alveolar macrophages from animals which have inhaled asbestos dust...|$|R

The C 6 content of the rabbit and human sera used as standards was estimated by precipitin analysis, using an <b>anti-C</b> 6 <b>antiserum</b> labelled with 125 I. The mean C 6 level in normal human serum was 11 μg/ml, whereas in normal rabbit serum it was 35 μg/ml.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the complement system evolved as a critical host defence mechanism among invertebrates, long before the origin among vertebrates of adaptive immune responses mediated by somatically re-arranging antibodies. The current study supports that contention by identifying a complement component C 3 a-like peptide in the tunicate, Pyura stolonifera. Activation of P. stolonifera serum with common inflammatory elicitors (lipopolysaccharide and zymosan) resulted in the proteolytic generation of an 8. 5 kDa peptide, and concomitantly conferred chemoattractant activity on the serum. The 8. 5 kDa peptide shares substantial amino acid sequence homology with a previously characterised tunicate complement component C 3 -like protein (72 % amino acid identity in an 18 amino acid overlap). It is also recognised by an <b>anti-C</b> 3 <b>antiserum</b> that is known to cross react with tunicate C 3 homologues. Hemocyte migration assays performed with the 8. 5 kDa peptide that had been partially purified by gel filtration confirmed that the molecule acts as a powerful chemotactic agent. This suggests that the proteolytic activation of tunicate C 3 -like molecules can initiate inflammatory responses involving cellular recruitment by liberating a pro-inflammatory peptide akin to the vertebrate anaphylatoxin, C 3 a. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Monospecific {{neutralizing}} and precipitating antisera to C 1 r, a subunit of {{the first}} complement component, were obtained. These antisera neutralized C 1 r activity in purified preparations and in macromolecular C 1 and did not react with C 1 q or C 1 s. They formed one line of precipitation in the β-globulin region with normal human serum, C 1 hu and C 1 r at various stages of purification. Using <b>anti-C</b> 1 r <b>antiserum</b> and a radial immunodiffusion technique, the concentration of C 1 r was determined in normal, SLE and RA sera. It was 101 μg/ml in normal sera and lower in sera of active SLE patients (69 · 7 μg/ml). No significant variations from normal were found in sera of SLE patients in periods of remission or in RA patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{show here}} that human {{peripheral}} blood NK cells contain a pore- forming protein (PFP) with an Mr of 70, 000 - 72, 000 that assembles structural lesions (with an average internal diameter of 150 - 170 A) and forms functional channels. The PFP was isolated by affinity chromatography from human NK cells, using a specific <b>anti-C</b> 9 <b>antiserum</b> as the immunoadsorbent. The NK cells were isolated from PBL by {{positive or negative}} selection by indirect rosetting using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against different NK and T cell surface antigens. PFP was identified in NK cells freshly isolated and isolated from cultured PBL, both stimulated with interleukin 2, but not in NK cell- depleted lymphocytes. In planar bilayers, the channels formed by the NK cell-derived PFP are highly voltage resistant, with most channels persisting in the open state once they have inserted into the bilayer. The unit conductances of these channels range 0. 3 - 1 nS in 0. 1 M NaCl. The channels show poor selectivity for monovalent and divalent ions. The PFP is also released from human NK cells stimulated with the calcium ionophore A 23187, suggesting that this protein, like the one produced by murine CTL lines, may be similarly secreted during cell- mediated killing. Its identification in primary human NK cell cultures indicates that this protein may {{play an active role}} in NK cell-mediated killing...|$|R
40|$|Two sera from {{unrelated}} individuals, each lacking C 8 activity, {{were examined}} by Western blot analysis. Using antisera raised against whole C 8, the two sera are shown to lack the C 8 beta chain, indicating a C 8 beta deficiency, which is frequently observed {{in cases of}} dysfunctional C 8. In contrast, {{by means of a}} specific <b>anti-C</b> 8 -beta <b>antiserum,</b> a C 8 beta-like polypeptide chain of apparently identical molecular weight compared to normal C 8 beta was detected. Digestion of normal and dysfunctional C 8 beta with Staphylococcus aureus V 8 protease revealed distinct differences in the enzymatic digestion pattern. We conclude that the dysfunction in the C 8 protein in these two patients resides in the dysfunctional C 8 beta chain, and that this form of C 8 deficiency is distinct from C 8 deficiencies previously reported, in which one or both C 8 subunits are lacking...|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans strains can be {{assigned}} to either of two major serogroups, A or B. Antigenic surface determinants present only in serotype A strains allow such a distinction, which has epidemiologic relevance. Reports have established that the relative distributions of the two serotypes can {{vary depending on the}} geographic origin of the isolates. A prevalence of susceptibility to an antifungal agent, flucytosine, was also observed with isolates of serotype A. More recently, it was suggested that the occurrence of serotype B isolates in various clinical forms of candidiasis is increasing. However, this latest finding remains controversial since serotyping results vary widely from one laboratory to another {{because of the lack of}} standardized methodologies. Difficulty in interpretation of results, which may lead to erroneous serotype identification, is the major setback associated with current methods. For this study, we thus devised a procedure that relies on flow cytometry and that may eliminate ambiguities in serotype determination. The validation of results was achieved with two types of serotype A-specific antisera, Iatron Factor 6 <b>antiserum</b> and an <b>anti-C.</b> albicans <b>antiserum</b> adsorbed on serotype B yeast cells. Agreement between results obtained with these two reagents was 100 % with a wide array of Candida strains. These results confirmed the potential of the flow cytometric procedure as a reliable and reproducible method to establish the serotypes of C. albicans strains. Furthermore, some applications of this procedure to the epidemiological study of this human pathogen are presented...|$|R
40|$|Kinase-negative mutants of S 49 mouse {{lymphoma}} cells, which lack detectable catalytic (C) subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, nevertheless contain cytoplasmic mRNAs for the {{two major}} forms of C subunit, C alpha and C beta. Investigation of the metabolism of C subunits in wild-type and mutant cells was undertaken to identify the step(s) at which C subunit expression was defective in kinase-negative cells. [35 S]methionine-labeled C subunits from cytosolic fractions of wild-type S 49 cells or C subunit-overexpressing cell lines were visualized by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after purification by either affinity chromatography using a peptide inhibitor of C subunit as the ligand or immunoadsorption with an <b>anti-C</b> subunit <b>antiserum.</b> Immunoadsorption revealed electrophoretic forms of C alpha and C beta subunits that migrated faster than those detected in affinity-purified samples; this unexpected heterogeneity suggested that functional activation of C subunit may require posttranslational modification. Immunoadsorption of cytosolic fractions from wild-type cells labeled for various times with [35 S]methionine revealed an additional posttranslational maturation step. The bulk of immunoadsorbable C subunit label in cells pulse-labeled for 5 min or less was in an insoluble fraction from which it could be solubilized with a detergent-containing buffer; solubilization of the newly synthesized material proceeded over an incubation period of about 10 min. The primary defect in kinase-negative cells {{appeared to be in}} this solubilization step, since about equal C subunit radioactivity was found in detergent extracts of wild-type and kinase-negative cells but very little was found in mutant cytosols. I speculate that an accessory factor required for proper folding of newly synthesized C subunit in defective in the kinase-negative cells...|$|R
40|$|A new nephelometric {{technique}} to measure C 3 d {{as an indicator}} of complement activation, is described. C 3 d is isolated at high concentration of polyethyleneglycol (PEG), incubated with commercially available <b>anti-C</b> 3 d <b>antiserum</b> at a final concentration of 2. 5 % PEG and then measured in a Behring Laser Nephelometer. In contrast to previously available techniques our assay detects the low concentrations of C 3 d present in all normal subjects, which result from the continuous C 3 catabolism occurring in vivo. We have also measured C 3 d blood concentrations in a large number of patients with diseases associated with complement activation. Raised C 3 d concentrations were found in 68 % of rheumatoid arthritis, 57 % of primary biliary cirrhosis, 38 % of chronic active hepatitis, 100 % of Gram-negative bacteraemia and 100 % of malaria. The nephelometric technique has proved to be sensitive, economical and fast, and could be adapted for routine determination of C 3 d blood concentrations to monitor disease activity and response to treatment...|$|R
40|$|A 4 -yr-old female {{patient who}} has {{recurrent}} infections with encapsulated bacteria and gramnegative organisms {{was found to}} have a complete absence of total hemolytic complement and C 3. Total hemolytic complement was reconstituted by the addition of functionally pure C 3. With the exception of a moderately reduced homolytic C 4, all other C components, measured homolytically and by radial immunodiffusion, were present in normal amounts. By Ouchterlong analysis, the patient's serum contained C 3 b inactivator and properdin but no antigenic C 3. Activation of the alternate pathway was examined by purified cobra venom factor (CVF) and inulin. Neither of these substances led to activation of properdin factor B to B. On addition of partially purified Cordis C 3, in four out of four instances and with different preparations of Cordis C 3, activation of factor B to B occurred in the inulin-serum-C 3 mixture. In contrast, activation of factor B to B occurred only once out of four times with CVF-serum-C 3 mixtures. Immune adherence was found to be normal in the patient's serum and could be removed by <b>anti-C</b> 4 <b>antiserum</b> of hydrazine treatment. A marked opsonic defect was present against Escherichia coli. Serum bactericidal activity against a rough strain of E. coli was also defective. The ability to mobilize an infalmmatory response was examined by Rebuck skin window technique. A delay in neutrophil migration occurred until the 6 th h. In vitro lymphocyte transformation and serum immunoglobulins were normal. The proportion of peripheral blood T cells forming spontaneous sheep erythrocyte rosettes and the percentage of B cells forming EAC rosettes by the C 3 receptor were normal. The significance of the absence of C 3 in our patient is emphasized by the increased number of infections with encapsulated bacteria and the decreased functional biological activities of the C system, important in host defense mechanism(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The "toxic" {{effect of}} guinea pig serum (GPS) on Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells was tested under various conditions, using {{rounding}} and {{killing of the}} cells as test systems. Both activities could be inhibited by heat inactivation (56 C, 30 min). Killing required both Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, rounding only Mg 2 +. Both activities were temperature dependent and no rounding or killing occurred at 4 C. Incomplete complement sequences with natural of artificial defects in C 1, C 4, or C 6 resulted in lost or reduced killing. The rounding activity was only slightly affected. <b>Anti-C</b> 3 <b>antiserum</b> blocked both phenomena; incubation of GPS with 10 mg of inulin per ml reduced the rounding activity, and the same treatment of GPS deficient in C 4 inhibited rounding totally. Properdin factor D was shown to be necessary for rounding by GPS, with defects in either C 1 or C 4. By immune adherence bound C 3 b could be demonstrated on M. pneumoniae cells after GPS treatment, no antibodies against M. pneumoniae {{could be found in}} GPS by immune fluorescence. The results give evidence for complement being the toxic factor in GPS. Efficient killing requires the intact complement sequence. Furthermore, M. pneumoniae cells are able to activate the alternate pathway of complement. Activation of this pathway results in rounding of the cells, which are partly able to recover after this reaction. Biological consequences for the mycoplasmas are death or damage and possibly opsonization, {{even in the absence of}} specific antibodies. The host, too, is possibly affected by products of the reaction. The interaction of M. pneumoniae and complement could be involved in the early stages of the development of M. pneumoniae disease...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the C-C chemokine C 10 is involved in the chronic stages of host defense reactions. The present study addressed the role of C 10 in a murine model of septic peritonitis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Unlike other C-C chemokines, C 10 levels in the peritoneal wash were increased approximately 30 -fold above baseline levels at 48 h after CLP surgery. Immunoneutralization of peritoneal C 10 levels with polyclonal <b>anti-C</b> 10 <b>antiserum</b> during CLP-induced peritonitis negatively impacted mouse survival over 4 days. In contrast, when 500 ng of recombinant murine C 10 was administered immediately after CLP surgery, the 4 -day survival rate increased from 20 % to over 60 %. The C 10 therapy appeared to facilitate a rapid and significant enhancement of the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and a later increase in interleukin- 13 (IL- 13) levels in the peritoneal cavity. In vitro studies showed that the combination of IL- 1 β and C 10 markedly augmented TNF-α synthesis by peritoneal macrophages and that C 10 synthesis was induced in these cells following their exposure to IL- 13. At 24 h after CLP surgery, only 25 % of C 10 -treated mice were bacteremic versus 85 % of the control group that exhibited dissemination of bacteria into the circulation. The lack of bacteremia in C 10 -treated mice appeared to be related, in part, to in vitro evidence that C 10 significantly enhanced the bacterial phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages. In addition, in vivo evidence suggested that C 10 therapy significantly reduced the amount of material that leaked from the damaged gut. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that the C 10 chemokine rapidly promotes disease resolution in the CLP model through its direct effects on the cellular events critically involved in host defense during septic peritonitis...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} was to find a third genetic marker of the chicken B complex. The approach followed three stages: First, isolate and purify the fourth component of complement (C 4) from chicken plasma. Secondly, generate a monospecific antibody to C 4 to permit a study of its genetic variation. Thirdly, investigate the linkage relationship between C 4 and B complex.;The primary objective achieved was that a C 4 like protein was isolated and purified using affinity chromatography. The purified C 4 protein has a molecular weight of 210, 000 daltons determined by SDS-PAGE and dissociates into three subunits of 91, 000, 79, 000 and 30, 000 daltons after reduction.;The monospecific antisera to chicken C 4 was generated from rabbits. This antiserum not only cross-reacted with human C 4 but also blocked the hemolytic ability of both human and chicken plasma.;A kinetic study of C 4 protein serum concentration was carried out. The means levels of C 4 protein were 1. 06 mg/ml, 1. 30 mg/ml, 1. 90 mg/ml, 2. 20 mg/ml, and 2. 50 mg/ml at age of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks and 20 weeks, respectively.;The C 4 protein level differed significantly between tumor progressors and tumor regressors and tumor regressors after Rous sarcoma virus inoculation. The progressors had an average C 4 protein level of 77. 3 d(2 ̆ 72), which is less than that of the regressors, 85. 7 d(2 ̆ 72).;A Class I antigen was immunoprecipitated from erythrocytes by monospecific <b>anti-C</b> 4 <b>antiserum</b> whereas a Class II antigen (in question) was immunoprecipitated from B lymphocytes by the same antiserum.;The molecular weight of chicken C 4, its hemolytic function in tumor regression and its relationship to Class I antigens {{have been found to be}} rather similar to the C 4 properties of the human and mouse systems. Thus, it seems that chicken C 4 is linked to the MHC just as found in human and mouse system. In particular, this possibility was strongly suggested by the results of the elaborate immunoprecipitation study. However, conclusive evidence for the linkage relation between C 4 and B complex requires further study...|$|R
40|$|A Mr 70, 000 protein was {{isolated}} from cytotoxic human large granular lymphocytes and {{shown to have}} cytotoxic activity. The protein was demonstrated to be immunochemically related to the ninth component (C 9) of complement and was therefore designated C 9 -related protein (C 9 RP). This finding suggests that C 9 RP and C 9 share homology in primary structure and have a common evolutionary ancestry. C 9 RP {{was isolated}}, by affinity chromatography employing anti-human C 9 -Sepharose, from either purified cytoplasmic granules or whole-cell lysates of cultured human large granular lymphocytes. The cells were isolated from healthy blood donors and maintained in interleukin- 2 -dependent cultures. The immunochemical crossreactivity of C 9 with C 9 RP was 3 - 4 %, using a murine <b>anti-C</b> 9 RP <b>antiserum.</b> Certain murine monoclonal antibodies to C 9 RP and to C 9 inhibited killing of K 562 cells by human large granular lymphocytes. Killed target cells, identified by propidium iodide staining and isolated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting, exhibited clusters of circular membrane lesions that resembled poly(C 9) in appearance. Polymerization of isolated C 9 RP {{in the presence of}} Ca 2 + resulted in the formation of two different circular structures, one having an inner diameter of approximately equal to 60 A, and the other, of 125 A. Polymerized C 9 RP could be incorporated into liposomes and, as such, gave rise to channels of two different sizes.

40|$|Using a new {{adaptation}} of the 51 Cr release assay, {{it was found that}} plasma membrane vesicles from the human placental microvillous surface were not only capable of eliciting both cellular and humoral immunity in mice, but were also susceptible to lysis by these immune components. The production of cytotoxic cells and circulating antibody in immunized animals was only observed in the presence of Freund's complete adjuvant. The cells exhibited reactivity only against vesicles from a limited range of placentae, while the antibodies showed reactions against vesicles from a wider range of placentae. These vesicles were also susceptible to lysis by antisera raised against placental alkaline phosphatase but were resistant to attack by antibodies raised against normal human serum and HLA (multispecific) determinants and by a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody against human beta 2 -microglobulin. The cellular cytotoxicity in the spleens of immunized animals could be abrogated if the cells were pretreated with AKR <b>anti-C</b> 3 H <b>antiserum</b> and complement. Further, in the spleens of in immunized animals, a population of cells was detected that exhibited a 'natural' cytotoxicity against several of the membrane preparations. This cytotoxicity was heat-labile, being abrogated if the cells were preincubated at 37 degrees for 4 hr before the assay, but was resistant to attack by the anti-Thy 1 antiserum. The results indicate that the use of 51 Cr-labelled placental microvillous vesicles is a useful way of searching for anti-trophoblast immunity which may now be applied to the search for immune responses in pregnancy...|$|R
