2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (<b>axial</b> <b>clearance,</b> due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|E
30|$|Joint {{clearances}} in antenna pointing mechanisms lead to {{uncertainty in}} function deviation. Current studies mainly focus on radial clearance of revolute joints, while <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has rarely been}} taken into consideration. In fact, owning to errors from machining and assembly, thermal deformation and so forth, practically, <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> is inevitable in the joint. In this study, an error equivalent model (EEM) of revolute joints is proposed with considering both radial and axial clearances. Compared to the planar model of revolute joints only considering radial clearance, the journal motion inside the bearing is more abundant and matches the reality better in the EEM. The model is also extended for analyzing the error distribution of a spatial dual-axis (“X–Y” type) antenna pointing mechanism of Spot-beam antennas which especially demand a high pointing accuracy. Three case studies are performed which illustrates the internal relation between radial clearance and <b>axial</b> <b>clearance.</b> It is found that when the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> is big enough, the physical journal can freely realize both translational motion and rotational motion. While if the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> is limited, {{the motion of the}} physical journal will be restricted. Analysis results indicate that the consideration of both radial and axial clearances in the revolute joint describes the journal motion inside the bearing more precise. To further validate the proposed model, a model of the EEM is designed and fabricated. Some suggestions on the design of revolute joints are also provided.|$|E
40|$|Clearance {{flows in}} the {{sidewall}} gaps of centrifugal pumps are unsteady {{as well as}} main flows in the volute casing and impeller, which may cause vibration and noise, and the corresponding pressure fluctuations {{are related to the}} <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> size. In this paper, unsteady numerical simulations were conducted to predict the unsteady flows within the entire flow passage of a centrifugal pump operating in the design condition. Pressure fluctuation characteristics in the volute casing, impeller, and sidewall gaps were investigated with three <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> sizes. Results show that an <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> variation affects the pressure fluctuation characteristics in each flow domain by different degree. The greatest pressure fluctuation occurs at the blade pressure surface and is almost not influenced by the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> variation which has a certainly effect on the pressure fluctuation characteristics around the tongue. The maximum pressure fluctuation amplitude in the sidewall gaps is larger than that in the volute casing, and different spectrum characteristics show up in the three models due to the interaction between the clearance flow and the main flow as well as the rotor-stator interaction. Therefore, clearance flow should be taken into consideration in the hydraulic design of centrifugal pumps...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{functional}} approach to optimal dimensioning of automotive transmission shafts. In particular, the paper summarizes {{the results of a}} research activity developed on automotive transmission shafts to reduce the unpleasant movement of the transmission lever known as “shift lever movement”. The design problem was faced by focusing the <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> of the wheels assembled on the transmission shaft. First, the functional approach to optimal dimensioning proceeds from the study of different working conditions of the automotive manual transmission and focuses on corresponding geometrical constraints and design parameters. Then, it uses simplified schemes, each of them related to a different working condition, to set a series of functional dimensioning loops for the transmission shaft. Subsequently, the approach introduces an appropriate index to evaluate the Information Content for each dimensioning scheme and it addresses the optimal dimensioning scheme, related to the minimization of the Information Content. After this, the approach foresees worst-case to check the <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> of the wheels assembled on the shaft. In a such way the effect of the dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission. In fact, the reduction of <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> for the wheels assembled on the shaft causes a direct reduction of the “shift lever movement”. The functional approach to optimal dimensioning is applied to an automotive transmission set and the proposed dimensioning schema of the shaft is compared with different dimensioning schemes including one currently used in an international automotive company.

The paper demonstrates also that the study of assembly conditions allows simplifying the analysis and the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. Method - A previous functional approach to optimal dimensioning is used but it is associated to the analysis of relationships between the parts assembled on the shaft, the corresponding functional surfaces and the related dimensioning schemes. Then, a statistical analysis of tolerance chain is accomplished by using different IT grades that characterize dimensional tolerances. Result - The optimal functional dimensioning scheme of an automotive transmission shaft is accomplished. The scheme is able to guarantee the minimum <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> of parts assembled on the shaft. Discussion & Conclusion - The paper deals with the application of a functional approach to the optimal dimensioning of an automotive transmission shaft. The automotive transmission set is characterized by different working conditions, geometrical constraints and design parameters. Therefore, a preliminary decomposition of the assembly in several subsystems or groups is necessary to clearly analyse the longitudinal gearbox. Then, the study of assembling conditions and related functional surfaces allow simplifying the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. In fact, the functional approach, aimed to optimal dimensioning, uses a worst-case and statistical analyses to directly check the <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> of the wheels assembled on the shaft. Therefore, the effects of dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission.

40|$|Conventionally {{the size}} of the back {{clearance}} played a great importance on reducing the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> by utilizing the concept that the decreased <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> results in lower axial force acting on the impeller. However, from the previous works on the effect of the back clearance on the hydrodynamic forces upon the semi-open impeller showed the opposite trend: increasing the back clearance results in the reduced axial loading. In this work, the CFD simulation of an entire pump and detailed analysis on the back clearance flow are performed. By utilizing the commercially available software, meshing and CFD simulations are performed. LDA data, unsteady pressure data, and pressure distributions on the housing are used to validate the CFD model. The flow field prediction of the back clearance flow is then compared with other researcher?s works of the gap flow analysis between the rotating and stationary disks.

40|$|A {{thrust bearing}} test rig {{experienced}} a catastrophic failure while operating with gas bearings. After many repairs, {{the test rig}} is in operating condition with water-lubricated bearings. Previous work details the failure and several initial repairs and modifications. Further modifications include manufacturing two rotors, repairing the main housing, aligning the motor shaft and test rotor, upgrading the water pipeline system, developing a static load system, installing instrumentation, and developing means of data acquisition. Presently, the revamped system has rotated to a speed of 5 krpm. Measurements of the free-free mode natural frequencies and lateral mode shapes of the rotor-coupling system show that the rotor and quill shaft operate as a unit. Once assembled, water lubricates the bearings to lift and support the test rotor connected to the motor through its coupling. Impact loads identify the system fundamental natural frequency and damping ratio for operation without rotor speed or active thrust bearings. The flexibility of the quill shaft commands {{the location of the}} system lateral natural frequency (~ 93 Hz) and its low damping ratio. XLTRC 2 ? based predictions agree well with the measured natural frequency and identified damping ratio. The water lubricates the radial bearings to lift the test rotor again as the motor accelerates the rotor to 5 krpm. During this operation, the rotor motion is synchronous and does not excite the first natural frequency. While operating at speeds up to 5 krpm, the system did not reach its first critical speed. Measurements show the thrust bearing <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> increases as the water supply pressure increases, max. 4. 14 bar(g), for operation with a constant axial load and at null or low rotor speed (3 krpm). As the imposed axial load increases, the operating clearance decreases exponentially. The decreasing operating clearance causes an increased flow resistance across the film lands, resulting in a reduced flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, there is a lower pressure drop across each orifice, resulting in an increase in recess pressure. The derived axial stiffness increases as the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> decreases or the water supply pressure increases. XLHydroThrust? uses the thrust bearing geometry to generate predictions of thrust bearing performance. The predictions accurately describe the influence of the load and supply pressure on the thrust bearing performance; however, there are discrepancies between the magnitudes of the predictions and the magnitudes of the measurements at a high axial load (low <b>axial</b> <b>clearance).</b> The average percent difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes of supply flow rate, flow rate through inner diameter, <b>axial</b> <b>clearance,</b> and recess pressure ratio change from 2 % to 47 %, 7 % to 73 %, 25 % to 53 %, and 7 % to 18 %, respectively, as the applied axial load increases from its minimum to maximum magnitude.

The Newton-Euler approach is applied here for these procedures.

40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A hydraulic shaker applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high speed coupling with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with feed orifices located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing <b>axial</b> <b>clearances.</b> In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger operating clearances and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates. For most applications, a compromise of bearing performance parameters will be desired. The test results and comparisons presented will aid in sizing orifice diameters for future hybrid thrust bearing designs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{article is}} devoted to the {{analysis}} of the influence of the joint clearances in a mechanism of a circuit breaker, which is a forty-two degrees of freedom mechanism made of seven links, seven revolute joints, and four unilateral contacts with friction. Spatial (3 D) revolute joints are modelled with both radial and <b>axial</b> <b>clearances</b> taking into account contact with flanges. Unilateral contact, Coulomb's friction and Newton impact laws are modeled within the framework of nonsmooth mechanics without resorting to some regularizations or compliance/damping at contact. The nonsmooth contact dynamics method based on an event-capturing time–stepping scheme with a second order cone complementarity solver is used to perform the numerical integration. Futhermore, the stabilization of the constraints at the position level is made thanks to the stabilized combined projected Moreau–Jean scheme. The nonsmooth modeling approach together with an event–capturing time–stepping scheme allows us to simulate, in an efficient and robust way, the contact and impacts phenomena that occur in joints with clearances. In particular, comparing with the event–detecting time–stepping schemes, the event–capturing scheme enables to perform the time–integration with large number of events (impacts, sliding/sticking transitions, changes in the direction of sliding) and possibly with finite time accumulations with a reasonable time –step length. Comparing with compliant contact models, we avoid stiff problems related with high stiffnesses at contact which generate some issues in contact stabilization and spurious oscillations during persistent contact periods. In the studied mechanisms of the circuit breakers, the numerical methods deals more than seventy contact points without any problems. Furthermore, the number of contact parameters is small : one coefficient of restitution and one coefficient of friction. Though they are sometimes difficult to measure accurately, the sensitivity of the simulation result with respect to contact parameters is low in the mechanism of the circuit breaker. It is demonstrated that this method, thanks to its robustness and efficiency allows to perform a sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo method.

In these circumstances circumferential pressure {{variations in the}} external flow and the pumping action of the disc may draw fluid into the cavity. Gas concentration measurements, showing this effect, have been obtained from a model experiment with a simple <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> seal. In the experiment, guide vanes, fitted upstream of the rim seal, generate an asymmetric external flow. The measurements are shown to be in reasonable agreement with three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations and are also compared with more elementary models.

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an <b>axial</b> <b>clearance</b> which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the <b>axial</b> <b>clearance.</b> Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the tip seal in a tip seal groove, the sealing mechanism of the tip seal is clarified and a design guideline of the tip seal groove is obtained...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a testing machine on which 35 millimeter bearings (bore) can be run at speeds {{of the order}} of 21, 000 rpm, while the following factors are recorded: 1) oil circulation through bearing and oil temperature. 2) maximum temperature of outer bearing ring, 3) radial and axial load on bearing, 4) radial, <b>axial,</b> and angular <b>clearance</b> of bearing, 5) power consumption of bearing. The experiments show that the lubrication was most reliable and oil consumption lowest when the oil was introduced {{through a hole in the}} outer or inner ring of the bearing...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} various design {{parameters}} on broadband noise generation by centrifugal fans has been studied. The parameters varied included: blade type, radial and <b>axial</b> inlet <b>clearance,</b> scroll development angle, scroll development length and cutoff clearance. Scaling laws for pressure, flow and noise {{were applied to}} allow the A-weighted sound power levels of different fans to be compared at the same operating points. That approach has allowed an optimum low noise fan design to be identified. To extend the usefulness of that design, a semi-empirical procedure for predicting the broadband sound power spectrum of any member {{of a family of}} geometrically similar centrifugal fans has also been developed. The prediction procedure allows the calculation of 1 / 3 -octave band sound power levels based on a measurement of the sound power radiated by a single member of the fan family. By the use of the prediction procedure, it is straightforward to identify optimally quiet fans that satisfy a range of pumping requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{power plant}} from a Mark 25 aerial torpedo was {{investigated}} {{both as a}} two-stage turbine and as a single-stage modified turbine {{to determine the effect}} on overall performance of nozzle size and shape, first-stage rotor-blade configuration, and <b>axial</b> nozzle-rotor running <b>clearance.</b> Performance was evaluated in terms of brake, rotor, and blade efficiencies. All the performance data were obtained for inlet total to outlet static pressure ratios of 8, 15 (design), and 20 with inlet conditions maintained constant at 95 pounds per square inch gage and 1000 F for rotor speeds from approximately 6000 to 18, 000 rpm...|$|R
