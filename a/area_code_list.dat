5000|$|In 1996, Canadian {{telephone}} companies began promoting 555-1313 as [...] "name that number", a pay-per-use reverse lookup {{which would give}} a subscriber name if the user entered an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> and a <b>listed</b> telephone number. The fifty-cent information number was initially heavily advertised in <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> +1-604 (BCTel), +1-416 (Bell Canada), +1-506 (NBTel), +1-902 (Maritime T&T) and +1-709 (Newfoundland Tel), but was soon forgotten once Internet sites began providing free reverse lookup tools.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{used for}} forty smaller towns where some {{subscriber}} numbers within the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> have only five digits and is known as 4+5 format. The numbers therefore have only nine digits after the initial zero trunk <b>code.</b> These <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were changed by adding a [...] "1" [...] directly after the initial zero {{as a part of}} PhONEday in 1995. These towns always have a mixture of six and five digit local numbers, each type allocated in specific DE blocks; e.g. in the 01647 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> numbers beginning 24xxx and 61xxx have five digits whereas all other DE blocks within that <b>area</b> <b>code</b> are allocated as six digit numbers. The number of places with five digit subscriber numbers and an 01xxx <b>area</b> <b>code</b> has declined rapidly in recent decades. There were 511 ranges allocated across 56 different <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in January 1998. The Big Number Change removed many, especially in Northern Ireland, and by July 2005 there were only 329 ranges in 42 codes.

30|$|A {{subset of}} {{diaspora}} records {{provided by the}} ESRS Ministry of Diaspora in 2016 lists 595 diaspora returnees who registered in 2014 – 2015.6 Returnees from Canada make up the fourth-largest group of registered returnees in this data. Of 595 cases (50 from Canada), telephone country codes were available for 339, and of these sub-country telephone <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were <b>listed</b> for 237 (27 from Canada). Canada’s phone system has a combination of location-specific <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> and newer (mostly mobile phone) <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> that cover broader regions. The largest number of Canadian telephone <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> registered were Alberta numbers (12 unique numbers, including two identifiably from Edmonton). Alberta is followed by Ontario (8 unique, including three from Toronto), and <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> for Winnipeg (Manitoba), British Columbia, Sasketchewan, and Ottowa each had one corresponding registered returnee. People move, and it cannot be assumed that cell phone <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> correspond to the present residence of Ethiopian Somalis in Canada. Nevertheless, the phone numbers suggest where these individuals may have lived previously, and the match of these locations with census data showing populations reporting Somali multiple ethnicity and Ethiopian multiple ethnicity supports the thesis that Ethiopian Somalis are identifiable by multiple ethnicity data from Canadian censuses. Even if the adoption of an Ethiopian-Somali identity is not widespread across the whole population, {{a significant number of}} individuals, especially in Edmonton and Toronto, do appear to be both engaging with ESRS—including making return visits and limited investment—and identifying themselves as Ethiopian Somalis. The question remains as to whether these trends are the beginning of a wider shift.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study is to conduct a {{descriptive}} analysis of the election of Black males to public office and the role they played in {{improving the quality of}} Black life in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. The study has analyzed and examined the impact that education, housing, income, and health care demographic factors have contributed to the election of these males to various committees, boards and commissions in the city of Atlanta and Fulton County Georgia. The study has also examined the political activity of college fraternities, urban voluntary associations, and community based organizations that {{played a role in the}} city council race of 1992 in electing a Black as mayor and member of the city council. To measure how effective these males were in improving the quality of Black life the following indicators will be utilized in this study, namely: (a) the improvement of the neighborhoods in Atlanta 2 ̆ 7 s Black community, (b) the distribution of goods and services to the Black community, (c) the sponsorship of bills and neighborhood economic development related projects through its candidates, in an attempt to exercise political influence, within the state legislature and the city council in Atlanta, Georgia, (d) the improvement of the quality of health care, housing, income, and(e) education. The principal method of analysis employed for explaining Black male political activity in the city of Atlanta, Georgia has been through the use of a research study conducted by the Clark Atlanta University Political Science Department in Atlanta, Georgia. The study was conducted by undergraduate and graduate students and several members of the faculty. The survey comprises telephone interviews with 100 respondents in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. The data are a unique resource that now makes possible an in-depth investigation of the urban issues, attitudes, and political beliefs and activity of a representative local sample of adult Black Atlanta residents. Each respondent was of voting age, but was not necessarily registered to vote. The sample for the Atlanta survey was drawn using a random-digit-dial design that selected participants disproportionately from different geographic areas within the city of Atlanta representing varying densities of Black population. The survey was inclusive of only those residents living within the (404) <b>area</b> <b>code</b> <b>listing.</b> The racial composition of the household was determined by including a direct question about race in the screening instrument. Members of eligible households found in the screening were eligible for the study if they were Black Americans and were at least 18 years of age...|$|R

5000|$|In California and New York, {{because of}} the {{existence}} of both overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (where an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> must be dialed for every call) and non-overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (where an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is dialed only for calls outside the subscriber's home <b>area</b> <b>code),</b> [...] "permissive home <b>area</b> <b>code</b> dialing" [...] of 1 + the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> within the same <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> even if no <b>area</b> <b>code</b> is required, has been permitted since the mid-2000s (decade). For example, in the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (a non-overlay <b>area</b> <b>code),</b> calls may be dialed as 7 digits (XXX-XXXX) or 1-213 + 7 digits. The manner in which a call is dialed does not affect the billing of the call. This [...] "permissive home <b>area</b> <b>code</b> dialing" [...] helps maintain uniformity and eliminates confusion given the different types of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> relief that has made California the nation's most [...] "area code" [...] intensive State. Unlike other states with overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> (Texas, Maryland, Florida and Pennsylvania and others), the California Public Utilities Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission maintain two different dial plans: Landlines must dial 1 + <b>area</b> <b>code</b> whenever an <b>Area</b> <b>Code</b> is part of the dialed digits while cellphone users can omit the [...] "1" [...] and just dial 10 digits.|$|R

The <b>area</b> <b>code</b> has been split twice since it went into service, forming <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> 209 and 530. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 279 was approved as an overlay for <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 916 effective March 10, 2018.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{original}} 1947 plan, <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> containing [...] "0" [...] (zero) as a middle digit were only assigned to states that were entirely {{covered by a}} single <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 507, along with <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 606 in Kentucky and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 607 in New York, were the first <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> with a middle digit of [...] "0" [...] to be assigned to states that were covered {{by more than one}} <b>area</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
2500|$|To {{meet the}} {{increased}} demand for phone numbers, two overlay <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were introduced in 2001. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 647 (supplementing the 416 <b>area</b> <b>code)</b> was introduced in March 2001 and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 289 (supplementing the 905 <b>area</b> <b>code)</b> was introduced in July 2001. Some individuals within the 905 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> region may have to dial long distance to reach each other; although residents of Mississauga and Hamilton share the same <b>area</b> <b>code</b> (905), an individual from Toronto, for example, would have to dial [...] "1" [...] to reach Hamilton, but not to reach Mississauga. Ten-digit telephone dialling, including the <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for local calls, is required throughout the GTA. In March 2013, two additional <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> {{were introduced to the}} GTA: <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 437 in Toronto and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 365 in the area served by 905 and 289.|$|R
50|$|After the {{standardization}} of American telephone <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in 1947, {{almost all of}} Los Angeles County used the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> Because the population and phone usage of the Los Angeles metropolitan area greatly increased during the 1980s and 1990s, the 213 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> was split into several new <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> including the 818 and 310 <b>area</b> <b>codes.</b> The 818 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> entered service on January 7, 1984. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 626 was split from it on June 14, 1997.|$|R
50|$|The Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control, in August 1999, {{proposed}} an <b>area</b> <b>code</b> overlay for the 203 <b>area</b> <b>code.</b> <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 475 {{went into effect}} on December 12, 2009. Even though <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 475 overlays only 203, all callers in Connecticut (including those in <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 860) had to dial all calls with ten digits, effective November 14, 2009; this is because when needed, an overlay of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 959 on <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 860 will be implemented.|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 902 and overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 782 are the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

50|$|Telephone <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 708 covers {{western and}} {{southern}} Cook County and {{eastern and southern}} Will County {{in the state of}} Illinois, USA. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 708 was split off from <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 312 on November 11, 1989, and once covered almost all of the suburbs of Chicago. In 1996, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 847 and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 630 were broken off from 708. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 464 is being reserved as an overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for 708 to provide additional numbering options for this area.|$|R
50|$|The new network design, {{completed}} in 1947, provided for 152 <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> {{each with a}} capacity to serve 540 central offices. Originally only 86 <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> were assigned. New Jersey received the first <b>area</b> <b>code</b> in the new system, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 201. The second <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> 202 {{was assigned to the}} District of Columbia. The allocation of <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas. For example, Indiana <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 317 was split to provide a larger number pool in the Indiana suburbs of Chicago (<b>area</b> <b>code</b> 219).|$|R
50|$|<b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 312 is the {{telephone}} <b>area</b> <b>code</b> for downtown Chicago, {{which includes the}} Chicago Loop and its immediate environs. The plan area is completely surrounded by <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 773, which serves the rest of Chicago, along with overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 872. 312 is an enclave <b>area</b> <b>code,</b> similar to <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 213 in Los Angeles, <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 514 in Montreal and <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 210 in San Antonio. It is roughly bounded by North Avenue on the north, Western Avenue on the west, and 35th Street on the south, with Lake Michigan to the east. In terms of geographic area covered, 312 {{is one of the}} smallest <b>area</b> <b>codes</b> in the nation, encompassing only a few square miles.|$|R
25|$|In 2000, it was {{anticipated}} that the available phone numbers in <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330 would be exhausted, and an overlay <b>area</b> <b>code</b> was introduced. <b>Area</b> <b>code</b> 234 was assigned to overlap existing <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330. With the creation of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234, any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered by <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 330 could be assigned a phone number in either the 234 or 330 <b>area</b> <b>codes,</b> with no change in local or long distance toll status. This made necessary the use of ten-digit dialing within the 330/234 <b>area</b> <b>code</b> region. After the introduction of <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234, assignments of new telephone numbers in the area did not continue at an accelerated pace, and new phone numbers for <b>area</b> <b>code</b> 234 were not assigned until 2003.|$|R
