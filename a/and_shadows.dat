5|$|Metalcore, {{a hybrid}} of extreme metal and {{hardcore}} punk, emerged as a commercial force in the mid-2000s decade. Through the 1980s and 1990s, metalcore was mostly an underground phenomenon; pioneering bands include Earth Crisis, other prominent bands include Converge, Hatebreed and Shai Hulud. By 2004, melodic metalcore—influenced as well by melodic death metal—was popular enough that Killswitch Engage's The End of Heartache <b>and</b> <b>Shadows</b> Fall's The War Within debuted at numbers 21 and 20, respectively, on the Billboard album chart.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to empirically {{investigate}} the relationships between corruption <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> economy among the European Union countries, over the period 2005 - 2014. Moreover, since one would expect corruption <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> economy to be more common in poorer countries, this study was therefore carried out to determine how corruption <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> economy affect economic development. The empirical {{findings of this study}} confirm a high and positive relationship between corruption <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> economy, therefore a higher level of corruption involves a higher level of shadow economy. Regarding the influence of corruption <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> economy on economic growth, a high and negative relationship was found.

5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting <b>and</b> <b>shadows</b> to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus uses a proprietary, {{in-house}} engine {{referred to}} as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, Daxter (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The camera system was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for God of War gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222megahertz (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the clock speed of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released a firmware upgrade that allowed games to use the full 333MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, <b>and</b> <b>shadows</b> as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.|$|E

40|$|A Fashion Story of Light and Shadow” {{is a book}} {{recorded}} {{my thesis}} artwork and its research background. The main topic of my thesis work is light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> {{as well as its}} related handicraft— traditional Chinese shadow puppet opera. Based on my observations and own perspectives about light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> art <b>and</b> design works, and personal experiences of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow,</b> I {{came up with the idea}} for my thesis. The purpose is to discover the creative possibilities of approaching light <b>and</b> <b>shadow,</b> <b>and</b> to think about the meanings of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> behind a piece of artworks or designs which are from successful artists and designers who use light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> to create art and design. Furthermore, absorb the knowledge from the research and try to find my own visual language to interpret light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> by combining them in my own design of fashion. The outcomes include the book <b>and</b> a <b>shadow</b> art fashion collection. The book consists two parts, the first part is the observations about light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> in different angles. The second part shows the behind story, principle, theories and working process of my thesis work. The full content of my thesis started with my personal perspectives of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> as the starting point of the research. Then continued researching the fundamental and historical knowledge of light <b>and</b> <b>shadow.</b> After that I studied and analyzed contemporary light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> artworks including light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> related design works. These works are from different artists and designers including artists such as Tim Noble & Sue Webster, as well as James Turrell, designers such as Tord Boontje and Hussein Chalayan. Their principle of handling light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> helped me develop my own idea more fruitful. After that, I moved to the research of traditional Chinese shadow puppet opera. This part helped me understand light <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> related folk art widely in diversity of aspects including cultural value, technical point of view and deep relationship between it and my own collection. In the end is the practical part which recorded the experimenting and developing process of my works. Also, the final part includes the description of the process how I developed the idea; how I executed the works; how I solved the problems and finally, how I drew the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Conformal totally {{symmetric}} arbitrary spin currents <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> {{fields in}} flat space-time of dimension {{greater than or}} equal to four are studied. Gauge invariant formulation for such currents <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> fields is developed. Gauge symmetries are realized by involving the Stueckelberg fields.

AdS/CFT correspondence for currents <b>and</b> <b>shadow</b> fields <b>and</b> the respective normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of massless totally symmetric arbitrary spin AdS fields is studied. The bulk fields are considered in modified de Donder gauge that leads to decoupled equations of motion.

5|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{built an}} eight-foot foam {{model of the}} Zeppelin to {{complement}} shots of Ford and Connery climbing into the biplane. A biplane model with a two-foot wingspan {{was used for the}} shot of the biplane detaching. Stop motion animation was used for the shot of the German fighter's wings breaking off as it crashes through the tunnel. The tunnel was a 210 feet model that occupied 14 of ILM's parking spaces for two months. It was built in eight-foot sections, with hinges allowing each section to be opened to film through. Ford and Connery were filmed against bluescreen; the sequence required their car to have a dirty windscreen, but to make the integration easier this was removed and later composited into the shot. Dust <b>and</b> <b>shadows</b> were animated onto shots of the plane miniature to make it appear as if it disturbed rocks and dirt before it exploded. Several hundred tim-birds were used in the background shots of the seagulls striking the other plane; for the closer shots, ILM dropped feather-coated crosses onto the camera. These only looked convincing because the scene's quick cuts merely required shapes that suggested gulls. ILM's Wes Takahashi supervised the film's effects sequences.|$|E
