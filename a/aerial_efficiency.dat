50|$|Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi {{military}} were dealt a heavy blow when Iranian Air Force vulnerabilities {{failed to}} materialize. All Iraqi Air Bases near Iran {{were out of}} order for months and, according to Iran, Iraq's <b>aerial</b> <b>efficiency</b> was reduced by 55%. This allowed Iranians to regroup and prepare for the upcoming Iraqi invasion. However, Iraqis would advance deep into Khuzestan {{and it would take}} the Iranians up to 2 years before they would finally expel the Iraqis from their territory and eventually enter Iraq. The War endured another 6 years, becoming the longest conventional war of the 20th century in which perhaps close to one million were maimed and killed.|$|E

40|$|The Darwin coastal {{wetlands}} provide suitable breeding conditions for Culex annulirostris, which is abundant between December and August each year. This species {{is the principal}} vector for arboviruses, including Ross River virus and Murray Valley encephalitis, and is an appreciable pest species. Aerial control is conducted when routine larval surveys for this species predict high numbers of emergent adults. We sought to determine the most productive vegetation categories and seasonal aspects associated with Cx. annulirostris breeding and control operations in these wetlands. By applying a generalized linear model to compare larval densities and aerial control efforts for each vegetation category, we found that Schoenoplectus reeds were the most productive vegetation type in May and June and {{were associated with the}} greatest amount of control required. Other vegetation categories associated with tidal mangroves and lower topographic elevation were also productive during these months for extended periods, while rain-affected reticulate areas and grassland floodplains were most productive in January and April. In addition, areas associated with nutrient rich organic matter appeared to initiate Cx. annulirostris breeding and were highly productive seasonally. This study has highlighted the vegetation categories most significantly associated with Cx. annulirostris breeding in a Darwin wetland. This knowledge can be applied to current control efforts to improve <b>aerial</b> control <b>efficiency</b> for this species and could be applicable in other areas of northern Australia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{advantages}} {{associated to}} Vertical Short-Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) {{have been demonstrated}} {{since the early days}} of aviation, with the initial technolology being based on airships and later on helicopters and planes. Its operational advantages are enormous, being it in the field of military, humanitarian and rescue operations, or even in general aviation. Helicopters have limits in their maximum horizontal speed and classic V/STOL airplanes have problems associated with their large weight, due to the implementation of moving elements, when based on tilting rotors or turbojet vector mechanical oriented nozzles. A new alternative is proposed within the European Union Project ACHEON (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting-jet Nozzle). The project introduces a novel scheme to orient the jet that is free of moving elements. This is based on a Coanda effect nozzle supported in two fluid streams, also incorporating boundary layer plasma actuators to achieve larger deflection angles. Herein we introduce a state-of-the-art review of the concepts that have been proposed in the framework of jet orienting propulsion systems. This review allows to demonstrate the advantages of the new concept in comparison to competing technologies in use at present day, or of competing technologies under development worldwide...|$|R
40|$|In {{perennial}} crops, post-wintering reserves play a {{key role}} on regrowth rate and productivity of the crops. The present study aimed at assessing the impact of Miscanthus x giganteus management (harvest date and nitrogen fertilisation) on the subsequent regrowth of the crop via their effects on the nitrogen stocks of belowground organs. The crop growth analysis was conducted by studying radiation use efficiency of the crop and kinetics of leaf area index expansion. Data showed that decreasing nitrogen stocks via early harvest of the crop and no fertilisation had a negative effect on subsequent regrowth. A linear relationship was observed between the leaf area index and the aboveground nitrogen accumulation in the crop, similarly to other crops. The growth rate of the leaf area index depended on the belowground nitrogen stocks before regrowth. A linear relationship followed by a plateau was found between the <b>aerial</b> radiation use <b>efficiency</b> of M. giganteus and the belowground nitrogen stocks before regrowth, as observed in other perennial crops. Finally, it appeared that low nitrogen availability affects more resource conversion than resource capture of M. giganteus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|As a new {{alternative}} to tilting rotors or turbojet vector mechanical oriented nozzles, ACHEON (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting-jet Nozzle) has enormous advantages {{because it is}} free of moving elements and highly effective for Vertical/Short-Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) aircraft. In this paper, an integrated flight/ thrust vectoring control scheme for a jet powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an ACHEON nozzle is proposed to assess its suitability in jet aircraft flight applications. Firstly, a simplified Thrust-Vectoring (TV) population model {{is built based on}} CFD simulation data and parameter identification. Secondly, this TV propulsion model is embedded as a jet actuator for a benchmark fixed-wing ‘Aerosonde’ UAV, and then a four “cascaded-loop” controller, based on nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI), is designed to individually control the angular rates (in the body frame), attitude angles (in the wind frame), track angles (in the navigation frame), and position (in the earth-centered frame). Unlike previous research on fixed-wing UAV flight controls or TV controls, our proposed four-cascaded NDI control law can not only coordinate surface control and TV control as well as an optimization controller, but can also implement an absolute self-position control for the autopilot flight control. Finally, flight simulations in a high-fidelity aerodynamic environment are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed control scheme...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analyses and}} discusses a promising propulsive architecture {{based on an}} innovative nozzle, which allows realizing the selective adhesion of two impinging streams to two facing jets to two facing Coanda surfaces. This propulsion system is known with the acronym ACHEON (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting Nozzle). This paper investigates how the application of an all-electric ACHEONs propulsion system to a very traditional commuter aircraft can improve its relevant performances. This paper considers the constraints imposed by current state-of-the-art electric motors, drives, storage and conversion systems {{in terms of both}} power/energy density and performance and considers two different aircraft configurations: one using battery only and one adopting a more sophisticated hybrid cogeneration. The necessity of producing a very solid analysis has forced to limit the deflection of the jet in a very conservative range (± 15 °) with respect to the horizontal. This range can be surely produced also by not optimal configurations and allow minimizing the use of DBD. From the study of general flight dynamics equations of the aircraft in two-dimensional form it has been possible to determine {{with a high level of}} accuracy the advantages that ACHEON brings in terms of reduced stall speed and of reduced take-off and landing distances. Additionally, it includes an effective energy analysis focusing on the efficiency and environmental advantages of the electric ACHEON based propulsion by assuming the today industrial grade high capacity batteries with a power density of 207 Wh/kg.|$|R
40|$|The serials {{applied by}} the {{listeners}} for decametric broadcasting reception inside urban buildings were investigated: rod and equal. The {{aim is to}} determine directional characteristics of these <b>aerials</b> and their <b>efficiency</b> at reception of the spatial waves in town and to develop firstly on base of these investigations the recommendations for design of the broadcasting lines for remoted territories with presence of the cities. The efficiency decrease of the investigated aerials owing to the field intensity weakening stipulated with different elements of the up-to-date town buildings has been investigated theoretically. The field intensity weakening dependence on the arrival angle in the shadow field formed by the town buildings has been shown. The weakening stipulated with the external reinforced concrete walls constituted 30 - 50 dB, but in shadow field - 20 - 40 dB. The experimental investigations were performed by an aeroplane flying around town on different heights with mounted transmitter and aerial of the vertical polarization. The signal reception was performed with the investigated aerials arranged inside the buildings arranged in the different town districts. The aerial radiation pattern form of the receiving aerials in town and also the statistical regulation of the spatial field intensity distribution in town (logariphmic-standard one with deviation 7, 3 dB) have been determined, the median weakening of the field in town up to 11, 3 dB has been determinedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Coanda effect (adhesion of jet flow over curved surface) is {{fundamental}} characteristics of jet flow. In the present paper, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate Coanda flow over a curved surface and its application {{in a newly}} proposed Propulsive system "A. C. H. E. O. N" (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting jet Nozzle) which supports thrust vectoring. The ACHEON system is presently being proposed for propelling a new V/STOL airplane in European Union. This system is based on cumulative effects of three physical effects such as (1) High speed jet mixing speeds (2) Coanda effect control by electrostatic fields (3) Coanda effect adhesion of an high speed jet to a convex surface. The performance of this nozzle can be enhanced by increasing the jet deflection angle of synthetic jet over the Coanda surface. This newly proposed nozzle has wide range of applications. It {{can be used in}} industrial sector such as plasma spray gun and for direct injection in combustion chamber to enhance the efficiency of the combustion chamber. Also, we studied the effect of Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators on A. C. H. E. O. N system. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators are active control devices for controlling boundary layer and to delay the flow separation over any convex surfaces. Computations were performed under subsonic condition. Two dimensional CFD calculations were carried out using Reynolds averaged Navier stokes equations (RANS). A numerical method based on finite volume formulation (FVM) was used. SST k-ω model was considered to model turbulent flow inside nozzle. DBD model was used to model the plasma. Moreover, a body force treatment was devised to model the effect of plasma and its coupling with the fluid. This preliminary result shows that, the presence of plasma near Coanda surface accelerates the flow and delays the separation and enhances the efficiency of the nozzle...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel UAS (Unmanned Aerial System) designed for excellent low speed operations and VTOL performance. This aerial vehicle concept {{has been designed}} for maximizing the advantages by of the ACHEON (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting-jet Nozzle) propulsion system, which has been studied in a European commission under 7 th framework programme. This UAS concept has been named MURALS (acronym of Multifunctional Unmanned Reconnaissance Aircraft for Low-speed and STOL operation). It has been studied as a joint activity {{of the members of}} the project as an evolution of a former concept, which has been developed during 80 s and 90 s by Aeritalia and Capuani. It has been adapted to host an ACHEON based propulsion system. In a first embodiment, the aircraft according to the invention has a not conventional shape with a single fuselage and its primary objective is to minimize the variation of the pitching moment allowing low speed operations. The shape with convex wings has been specifically defined to allow a future possibility of enabling stealth operations. Main objective of the design activity has been focused on low speed flight, very short take off and landing, and a control possibility by mean of two mobile surfaces in the front canard, which allow changing the pitch angle, and allows an almost complete plane control in combination with an ACHEON variable angle of thrust propulsion system. The design considers has been specifically to allow flying at a speed which is lower than 12 m/s with an high angle of attach (over 7 °), without losses in terms of manoeuvrability and agility. These features allow innovative uses such as road monitoring, and police support and are characterized by a breakthrough performance level. A complete optimal sizing of the aircraft has been performed, together with an effective performance analysis, which allows identifying the strong points and the potential problems of the project. An effective energy analysis has been performed also. An effective prototyping is expected in about one year...|$|R
40|$|Aeronautic {{transport}} has {{an effective}} necessity of reducing fuel consumption and emissions to deliver efficiency and competitiveness driven by today commercial and legislative requirements. Actual aircraft configurations scenario allows envisaging {{the signs of}} a diffused technological maturity and they seem very near their limits. This scenario clearly shows the necessity of radical innovations with particular reference to propulsion systems and to aircraftarchitecture consequently. Methods This paper presents analyses and discusses a promising propulsive architecture based on an innovative nozzle, which allows realizing the selective adhesion of two impinging streams to two facing jets to two facing Coanda surfaces. This propulsion system is known with the acronym ACHEON (<b>Aerial</b> Coanda High <b>Efficiency</b> Orienting Nozzle). This paper investigates how the application of an all-electric ACHEONs propulsion system to a very traditional commuter aircraft can improve its relevant performances.

The necessity of producing a very solid analysis has forced to limit the deflection of the jet in a very conservative range (± 15 °) with respect to the horizontal.

Additionally, it includes an effective energy analysis focusing on the efficiency and environmental advantages of the electric ACHEON based propulsion by assuming the today industrial grade high capacity batteries with a power density of 207 Wh/kg. Results It has been clearly demonstrated that a short flight could be possible adopting battery energy storage, and longer duration could be possible by adopting a more sophisticated cogeneration system, which is based on cogeneration from a well-known turboprop, which is mostly used in helicopter propulsion. This electric generation system can be empowered by recovering the heat and using it to increase the temperature of the jet. It is possible to transfer this considerable amount of heat to the jet by convection and direct fluid mixing. In this way, it is possible to increase the energy of the jets of an amount that allows more than recover the pressure losses in the straitening section. In this case, it is then possible to demonstrate an adequate autonomy of flight and operative range of the aircraft. The proposed architecture, which is within the limits of the most conservative results obtained, demonstrates significant additional benefits for aircraft manoeuvrability. In conclusion, this paper has presented the implantation of ACHEON on well-known traditional aircraft, verifying the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed system both in terms of endurance with a cogeneration architecture and in terms of manoeuvrability. It has demonstrated the potential of the system in terms of both takeoff and landing space requirements. Conclusions This innovation opens interesting perspectives for the future implementation of this new vector and thrust propulsion system, especially in the area of greening the aeronautic sector. It has also demonstrated that ACHEON has the potential of renovating completely a classic old aircraft configuration such as the one of Cessna 402...|$|R
