50|$|The {{mountain}} plover {{is one of}} three species protected by the Endangered Species Act present in the Red Desert. The bald eagle and the black-footed ferret are also listed. However, the bald eagle is seldom seen in the desert {{because of the lack of}} streams or lakes with <b>accompanying</b> <b>fish.</b> Black-footed ferrets, which feed upon prairie dogs, are also rare.|$|E
5000|$|While the Costa Chica is {{generally}} unknown to tourists, {{the state government}} has worked to promote it. It has sunk cement blocks designed to allow the growth of coral to form artificial reefs and <b>accompanying</b> <b>fish</b> and shellfish. The reefs are intended to attract recreational divers. They also serve as breeding areas for the huauchinango fish, which {{is important for the}} Costa Chica. The artificial reefs have been placed off various points of the state: in the Costa Chica, about 300 have been placed in Marquelia and Copala. At Playa Ventura, the blocks also serve to break waves making the surf here gentler for swimmers. In the past the beaches of this area were considered dangerous for tourists but this is no longer the case.|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Ensembles {{to explore the}} ecology of freshwater fish species was tested by applying the technique to redfin barbel (Barbus haasi Mertens, 1925), an endemic and montane species that inhabits the North-East quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula. Two different MLP Ensembles were developed. The physical habitat model considered only abiotic variables, whereas the biotic model also included {{the density of the}} <b>accompanying</b> <b>fish</b> species and several invertebrate predictors. The results showed that MLP Ensembles may outperform single MLPs. Moreover, active selection of MLP candidates to create an optimal subset of MLPs can further improve model performance. The physical habitat model confirmed the redfin barbel preference for middle-to-upper river segments whereas the importance of depth confirms that redfin barbel prefers pool-type habitats. Although the biotic model showed higher uncertainty, it suggested that redfin barbel, European eel and the considered cyprinid species have similar habitat requirements. Due to its high predictive performance and its ability to deal with model uncertainty, the MLP Ensemble is a promising tool for ecological modelling or habitat suitability prediction in environmental flow assessment...|$|E

50|$|Vegetables {{were kept}} to a minimum when {{preparing}} ukha, and in fact, in classic Belarusian cuisine, ukha was simply a rich <b>fish</b> broth that <b>accompanied</b> <b>fish</b> pies (rasstegai, kuliebiaka, and other pirogi or pirozhki). These days it is more often a fish soup, cooked with potatoes and other vegetables. A wide variety of freshwater fish can be used, and some aficionados opine that one cannot make a good ukha from saltwater fish species. Fresh fish lends the dish the best flavor, and so if frozen fish is used, it is better not to defrost it. Preference is given to smaller, younger fish, with the tail parts of bigger fish discarded.|$|R

40|$|Habitat use of {{introduced}} pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus {{in small}} European streams has received little study despite the species' potential associations to native fauna of conservation and angling amenity, e. g. brook lamprey Lampetra planeri, European bullhead Cottus gobio, brown trout Salmo trutta. We examined body size, relative body condition, habitat use and species-species associations of pumpkinseed with <b>accompanying</b> <b>fishes</b> in two small streams in southern England during August 2001. Pumpkinseed body condition decreased with pumpkinseed density; the latter correlated with % clay and % riparian grasses in fish 63 mm FL, with % riparian shrubs in fish 83 - 92 mm FL and with water depth in fish > 92 mm FL. Most pumpkinseed size classes occurred {{more often than}} expected in stretches with conspecifics and with brown trout > 300 mm FL; densities of the latter did not correlate with any habitat variables. Indeed, correlations between trout densities and habitat variables were observed mainly in smaller size classes. Habitat associations in other species corresponded to known levels of rheophily; substratum, channel slope, channel width and riparian trees were also important habitat variables. Pumpkinseed dispersal and establishment under conditions of climatic change, which could have ecological and management ramifications, are discussed...|$|R
