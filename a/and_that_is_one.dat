500|$|... "Much Apu About Nothing" [...] {{was written}} by David S. Cohen and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode as Fat Tony. Much of {{the inspiration for the}} episode came from news reports of bears roaming streets in Southern California around the time when the episode was in production. Cohen said that when a bear swims in somebody's pool or goes in somebody's garbage can, it becomes a popular news item in California. The show runner of The Simpsons at the time, Bill Oakley, commented that the news reports often create an anti-bear hysteria, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of the inspirations for the episode.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{wanted to}} play in the Capablanca Memorial Tournament, Havana in August and September 1965. Since the State Department refused to endorse Fischer's {{passport}} as valid for visiting Cuba, he proposed, and the tournament officials and players accepted, a unique arrangement: Fischer played his moves from a room at the Marshall Chess Club, which were then transmitted by teleprinter to Cuba. Luděk Pachman observed that Fischer [...] "was handicapped by the longer playing session resulting from the time wasted in transmitting the moves, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> reason why he lost to three of his chief rivals." [...] The tournament was an [...] "ordeal" [...] for Fischer, who had to endure eight-hour and sometimes even twelve-hour playing sessions. Despite the handicap, Fischer tied for second through fourth places, with 15/21 (+12−3=6), behind former World Champion Vasily Smyslov, whom Fischer defeated in their individual game. The tournament received extensive media coverage.|$|E

50|$|I {{was very}} {{inspired}} by Tarkovsky. I won't make any bones about that. I saw {{an excerpt from}} The Mirror (Zerkalo) on Swedish television once, just a travelling shot around <b>that</b> house, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of those 'I'll be damned' experiences.|$|R
50|$|Although {{released}} {{after a little}} more than four months, Ziegenbalg still had a difficult relationship with Hassius <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> reason for Ziegenbalg's return to Europe in 1714-1716. Ziegenbalg was also married in 1716. He was also active in cooperation with the Anglican Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, making his work one of the first ecumenical ventures in the history of Protestant missionary work.|$|R
2500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the name}} was written in various ways: Egipcian, Egypcian, [...] 'gypcian. The word gipsy/gypsy comes from the spellings which had lost the initial capital E, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> reason that it is often spelled with the initial g in lowercase. As time elapsed, the notion of 'the gipsy/gypsy' altered to include other {{associated}} stereotypes such as nomadism and exoticism. John Matthews in The World Atlas of Divination refer to gypsies as [...] "Wise Women." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Bale played {{serial killer}} Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, {{director}} Mary Harron's adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' controversial novel. Bale was briefly {{dropped from the}} project in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio, but DiCaprio eventually dropped out to star in The Beach, and Bale was cast once again. He researched his character by studying the novel and prepared himself physically for the role by spending months tanning and exercising {{in order to achieve}} the [...] "Olympian physique" [...] of the character as described in the original novel. He {{went so far as to}} distance himself from the cast and crew to maintain the darker side of Bateman's character. American Psycho premiered at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival to much controversy. Roger Ebert condemned the film at first, calling it pornography and [...] "the most loathed film at Sundance," [...] but gave it a favourable review, writing that Harron had [...] "transformed a novel about bloodlust into a film about men's vanity." [...] Of Bale's performance, he wrote, [...] "Christian Bale is heroic in the way he allows the character to leap joyfully into despicability; there is no instinct for self-preservation here, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> mark of a good actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{reception}} {{for the movie}} was mostly mixed. The Times of India gave 3 out of 5 stars saying that,"Emraan Hashmi & Kangana bring the Gangster magic again....they have {{done a good job}} whereas Adhyayan Suman shows promise." [...] Bollywood Hungama gave a good review saying [...] "On the whole, Raaz – The Mystery Continues is rich in the horror quotient <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> of its major USPs, besides the highly competent performances by its principal cast and a lilting musical score. At the box-office, this one will continue the winning streak of Mahesh Bhatt and Mukesh Bhatt's Vishesh Films. The 4-day weekend [...] will only cement its status further. Go for it!". The lead actors were praised for their performance. In the review, [...] "On the acting front, both Emraan and Kangana vie for top honours. Emraan is excellent. He conveys a lot through facial expressions and that's the sign of a proficient actor. He's just getting better and better with every film. Kangana is top notch. After Fashion, this one's another power-packed performance from the actress. Adhyayan Suman is super-confident and registers a strong impact, especially towards the climax. He shows promise. Jackie Shroff is quite okay in a brief role." [...] NDTV gave negative reviews for the movie saying [...] "The first Raaz, which married the Hollywood film What Lies Beneath with the myth of Savitri who pursued Yamraj until her husband came back to life, had a cheesy appeal. This Raaz is a big bore. The scares are tired and Suri doesn't know how to pace them out. So, every minute, something awful is happening, from a bull attack to mutilation and murder. Was I scared? Not once. This mystery was better left discontinued." [...] AOL reviewer Noyon Jyoti Parasara too rated the film low. He gave the film a mere 2 out of 5 and said, [...] "Raaz – The Mystery Continues, which with all its hype was supposed scare the lights out of you, could not make me bat an eyelid out of fear. So there go all expectations!." ...|$|E
