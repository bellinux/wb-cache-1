40|$|In the lattice QCD formalism, we derive a gauge-invariant <b>analytical</b> <b>relation</b> {{connecting}} the Polyakov loop and the Dirac modes on a temporally odd-number lattice, where the temporal lattice size is odd, with the normal (nontwisted) periodic boundary condition. This <b>analytical</b> <b>relation</b> indicates that low-lying Dirac modes have little {{contribution to the}} Polyakov loop. Using lattice QCD simulations, we numerically confirm the <b>analytical</b> <b>relation</b> and the negligible contribution of low-lying Dirac modes to the Polyakov loop at the quenched level, i. e., the Polyakov loop is almost unchanged by removing low-lying Dirac-mode contribution from the QCD vacuum generated by lattice QCD in both confinement and deconfinement phases. Thus, we conclude {{that there is no}} one-to-one correspondence between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. As a new method, modifying the Kogut-Susskind formalism, we develop a method for spin-diagonalizing the Dirac operator on the temporally odd-number lattice.

By {{means of}} {{numerical}} methods, we solve the equa-tions of motion for {{the collapse of}} a shell of baryonic matter, made of galaxies and substructure falling into the central re-gions of a cluster of galaxies, taking into account effect of the dynamical friction. The parameters onwhich the dynamical fric-tion mainly depends are: the peaks ’ height, the number of peaks inside a protocluster multiplied by the correlation function eval-uated at the origin, the filtering radius and the nucleus radius of the protocluster of galaxies. We show how the collapse time of the shell depends on these parameters.

40|$|Abstract: The Brillouin fiber {{amplifier}} (BFA) {{has been}} used in Brillouin optical time (frequency) domain analyzer based sensors. The performance of this sensor depends on pump depletion which occurs when the threshold is reached and when the Brillouin gain is saturated. Although threshold definitions are common for Brillouin fiber generators (BFG), there is no explicit threshold definition for BFA. More importantly we find the maximum gain point corresponds to the optimized distributed sensing system where the depletion effect remains small to moderate. We find that only the method based on the determination of the power for which the pump becomes depleted, and hence, the Stokes gain saturated (i. e. inflexion method), remains valid for BFA. We also derive an <b>analytical</b> <b>relation</b> accounting for the various sensor key parameters such as fiber type and length as well as input Stokes power. The thresholds obtained with the <b>analytical</b> <b>relation</b> are within 10 % of experimental and numerical values, which is maximum power that can be launched for a given optimum sensing configuration...|$|E

In the confinement phase, we find a new "positive/negative symmetry" of the Dirac-mode matrix element of the link-variable operator, and this symmetry leads to the zero value of the Polyakov loop. In the deconfinement phase, {{there is no such}} symmetry and the Polyakov loop is nonzero.
