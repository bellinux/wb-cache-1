5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen.

5|$|During the 1990s, bulkers were {{involved}} in an alarming number of shipwrecks.

Crews on better-maintained ships performed better, as did crews on ships where fewer languages were spoken.|$|E

On basset horns <b>and</b> <b>larger</b> clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E
