40|$|Based on {{the fact}} that both {{hardness}} and vibrational Raman spectrum depend on the intrinsic property of chemical bonds, we propose a new theoretical model for predicting hardness of a covalent crystal. The quantitative relationship between hardness and vibrational Raman frequencies deduced from the typical zincblende covalent crystals is validated to be also applicable for the complex multicomponent crystals.

5000|$|Buoyed by {{the success}} of the Tournament, it was decided that it would be held every two years. After two more trial matches between various hopefuls, the Olympic team (including Chand as center-forward) was {{announced}} and assembled in Bombay. Center-half Broome Eric Pinniger was selected as the captain. The IHF was initially low on funds since the provinces of Bombay, Madras and Burma had turned a deaf ear to their financial appeal, but they managed to scrape enough money. The Olympic team then played a match against the Bombay XI, and amazingly lost 3-2, even though Singh scored both his team's goals. With a quiet send-off, the team left for England on 10 March, to play 11 matches against local sides as well in the London Folkestone Festival in 1927, winning all. It was also said that the Great Britain did not send a team in 1928 Amsterdam Olympics after their national team was defeated by the Indian team at Folkestone.This is best cited in Kapur's book [...] "Romance of Hockey" [...] where a despatch of H. Sutherland Stark, London representative of [...] "Sports", a magazine of Lahore, tells the story better than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>comment</b> : [...] "For reasons it is difficult to understand the English Hockey Association have taken up a very stiff attitude towards Indian Hockey in recent years and have repeatedly been twitted about it by even their own supporters. The Editor of a leading sports newspaper described them to me as an intensely conservative body, but there seems to be something more than conservative behind their unwillingness apparently ever to meet India ina full international encounter" [...] Finally, on 24 April, the team arrived in Amsterdam to embark {{on a tour of the}} Low Countries. In all the pre-Olympic matches against local Dutch, German and Belgian teams, the Indian team won by large margins.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the rate of}} convergence, in the so-called large coupling limit, for Schrödinger type operators on bounded domains. The Schrödinger we deal with have "interaction potentials" supported in a compact inclusion. We show that if the boundary of the inclusion is sufficiently smooth, one essentially recovers the "free Hamiltonian" in the exterior domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. In addition, we obtain a convergence rate, in L^ 2, that is O(λ^- 1 / 4) where λ is the coupling parameter. Our methods include energy estimates, trace estimates, interpolation and duality.

40|$|Gaussian Quadrature is a {{well known}} {{technique}} for numerical integration. Recently Gaussian quadrature with respect to discrete measures corresponding to finite sums have found some new interest. In this paper we apply these ideas to infinite sums in general and give an explicit construction for the weights and abscissae of GAUSSIAN SUMMATION formulas. The abscissae of the Gaussian summation have a very interesting asymptotic distribution function with a (cusp) singularity. We apply the Gaussian summation technique to two problems which have been discussed in the literature. We find that the Gaussian summation has an extremely rapid convergence rate for the Hardy-Littlewood sum for a large range of parameters. For functions which are smooth but have a large scale, a, the error of Gaussian Summation shows exponential convergence {{as a function of}} summation points. The Gaussian summation achieves a given accuracy with a number of points proportional to the sqrt of the large scale whereas other summation schemes require at least a number of function evaluations proportional to the scale.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new hash {{function}} based on RC 4 and {{we call it}} RC 4 -Hash. This proposed hash function produces variable length hash output from 16 bytes to 64 bytes. Our RC 4 -Hash has several advantages over many popularly known hash functions. Its efficiency is comparable with widely used known hash function (e. g., SHA- 1). Seen {{in the light of}} recent attacks on MD 4, MD 5, SHA- 0, SHA- 1 and on RIPEMD, there is a serious need to consider other hash function design strategies. We present a concrete hash function design with completely new internal structure. The security analysis of RC 4 -Hash can be made {{in the view of the}} security analysis of RC 4 (which is well studied) as well as the attacks on different hash functions. Our hash function is very simple and rules out all possible generic attacks. To the best of our knowledge, the design criteria of our hash function is different from all previously known hash functions.

30|$|Facebook users {{interact}} with posts in several ways. The {{most popular and}} easiest to use is the “like” button, introduced in 2009 (Kincaid, 2009). Anyone who can see the post can see how many likes a post receives and who liked the post. In addition to liking, users can make comments to posts and can reply to <b>other</b> <b>comments,</b> potentially including images and web links. Comments also have like buttons, independent of the post’s likes. Often, when a user likes or comments on posts and <b>other</b> <b>comments</b> in their feed, Facebook shares this activity with friends in their network. Finally, when users wish to share a post in their feed, they can press the share button, sending it to their timeline and their friends’ newsfeeds. Like <b>any</b> <b>other</b> post, a shared post can receive likes and comments as a shared event.

The applicator is then withdrawn. Repeat suction aspiration of the cavity with the 7 -mm Cory curette was undertaken to remove the coagulated debris.

AIM: To determine general practitioners' (GPs') and their patients' satisfaction with hospital and community services for stroke patients in Grampian Region, Scotland. METHOD: A questionnaire survey of 138 stroke patients and their GPs was carried out six weeks after each patient was discharged home between June 1995 and January 1996. Outcomes measured were GP and patient satisfaction with services, Barthel Index, Hospital Anxiety and Depression scores, London Handicap Score, and Homsat and Hospsat scores (satisfaction with stroke services). RESULTS: Response rates of 95 % (131) for GPs and 91 % (125) for patients were obtained. GPs and patients were generally satisfied with services. Stroke patients {{were more likely to have}} had contact with their GP than with <b>any</b> <b>other</b> service. Adverse <b>comments</b> from GPs focused on problems with hospital discharge letters. At six weeks, patients received an average of 2. 5 community services and 1. 5 hospital services, but there was wide variation across disability groups. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of satisfaction were high, but the wide range and variation in services used by patients emphasized the complexity of the primary care of stroke patients; the need for coordination, review and effective links with hospital; and the key role of the GP...|$|R
