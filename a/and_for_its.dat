5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under {{criticism}} for both its perceived racist colonial {{attitude toward the}} Congolese <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> glorification of big-game hunting.

5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. The species is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. The species is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. The species is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E

IMAX contributed $6.1 million to the opening gross, with premium large format screens comprising $6.4 million and Cinemark XD comprising $1.3 million, respectively. Though the film fell below its $60 million estimate, Disney nonetheless said it was content with the results, which continued Marvel's streak of number one opening films, giving the studio its twelfth consecutive win. Disney also reported that the film drew the largest share of families (28%) and women (32%) of any Marvel superhero title. It was also the biggest live-action opening ever for Rudd (breaking Knocked Ups record of $30.7 million) and a record opening for Douglas.

5|$|Because of its slow {{reproductive}} rate, the {{dusky shark}} is very vulnerable to human-caused population depletion. This species is highly valued by commercial fisheries for its fins, used in shark fin soup, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> meat, skin, and liver oil. It is also esteemed by recreational fishers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened worldwide and Vulnerable off the eastern United States, where populations have dropped to 1520% of 1970s levels. The dusky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans due to its large size, but there are few attacks attributable to it.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the climate}} and land of Palestine, {{where most of the}} Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes, and the wine that the {{vineyards}} produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> value in trade. Trade with Egypt was quite extensive. Jews were a wine-drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome. Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis. Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb. Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned watchtowers.|$|E
