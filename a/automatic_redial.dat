50|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>redial</b> is {{essentially}} {{exactly the same}} thing, but for modems, and included in most telecommunications programs that use modems, including all variants of Dial-up networking ever included in the Windows operating system.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, an <b>automatic</b> <b>redial</b> is {{a service}} feature {{that allows the}} user to dial, by {{depressing}} a single key or a few keys, the most recent telephone number dialed at that instrument.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the impact that}} new session retrials have {{on the performance of}} a mobile cellular network which deploys a fractional number of guard channels, a queue for handover sessions and an exponential deadline for serving those requests, modeling in this way the overlapping area between cells. To solve the Markov model we introduced an approximate methodology which is substantially more accurate than previous ones, while increasing the computation cost only marginally. Results show that deploying a handover queue and a fractional number of guard channels help to improve system capacity while guaranteeing a given QoS objective. Finally, we {{evaluated the}} magnitude of the over-dimensioning that takes place when retrials are perceived as an increment in the arrival rate of new sessions, showing that it can be severe when the terminals retry persistently as occurs when equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>redialing...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Codecs {{usually come}} in two types of units: rackmount for the studio and [...] for the remote. Audio can be sent in either direction, and most can also pass {{low-speed}} non-audio data, allowing the remote DJ to control broadcast automation or other studio equipment via RS-232. Many have an <b>automatic</b> <b>redial</b> if the line should become disconnected. The remote unit usually has some basic mixer functions, while the studio unit usually {{has some kind of}} digital output.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 97) This project {{presents the}} design concept and construct ion {{of a unique}} Telephone Dialer System. This design provides the user with voice feedback for system status, storage and retrieval of 119 telephone numbers up to 28 digits long, voice announcement of stored telephone numbers at a telephone booth or another telephone location, and <b>automatic</b> <b>redial.</b> The design is centered around a 6809 microprocessor and a Texas Instruments TMS 5220 speech synthesizer. This project report discusses the basic concepts of design and presents functional and circuit descriptions in detail. Detail schematics and component data sheets {{are included in the}} appendixes. The Telephone Dialer System has been built and its concepts tested...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 123) In {{this project}} {{the design and}} implementation of an 8085 microprocessor based telephone controller is presented. The system consists of an automatic telephone dialing system, a digital timer and a remote control system. The automatic dialing section allows dialing of up to 30 prestored phone numbers. All the long distance calls made with their duration are stored in the memory as a record. Dial tone, back ring tone and busy telephone line indication and an <b>automatic</b> <b>redial</b> mode are featured. The remote control system allows execution of commands entered through the telephone lines {{in the form of}} tones. In this design all requirements set by the telephone company for providing electrical isolation between the system and the telephone lines are me...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 118) In {{this project}} a low cost microprocessor based home control system is presented. The {{system is designed}} around an 8085 microprocessor. The system consists of an automatic telephone dialing system, a seven day real time clock, three general purpose input/output port system and a delay timer. The automatic dialing section allows dialing of up to 25 prestored phone numbers, calculation of the duration and overall charge of the phone call. Dial tone and busy telephone line indication and an <b>automatic</b> <b>redial</b> mode are featured. Three programmable output ports can be activated independently in a 24 hours interval, the active state being programmable up to 99 minutes. Visual and audible indication of the ports state is implemented. A twelve hours delay timer is implemented with audible time out indicator. A seven days real time clock with power failure indication is also implemented...|$|E
