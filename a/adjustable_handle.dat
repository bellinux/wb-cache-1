However, little is known about such customer expectations, and hence this study aimed to examine the views of Hong Kong adults on shopping trolleys. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a sample of 140 Chinese adults aged 40 or over with no cognitive or communication impairments. These adults were approached in markets, supermarkets, and public parks in Hong Kong. Individual face-to-face interviews using a questionnaire were used to collect the data. Fifty-six (40 %) of the participants were current users, 32 (23 %) were ex-users, and 52 (37 %) were non-users of shopping trolleys. More of the user and ex-user participants perceived shopping trolleys to be energy saving and protective of the joints. Lightness and easy storage, a pulling and pushing motion, suitability for use on stairs, and <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle</b> height were the trolley features most frequently expected by the participants. The user and ex-user participants rated lightness, a pushing motion and changeable trolley bags to be comparatively more important than the non-user participants. The findings have implications for the development of an evidence-based shopping trolley design. Close cooperation is needed between ergonomists and design and engineer experts to develop an ergonomically designed shopping trolley that prioritizes the health and safety of its users...|$|E

40|$|Background: Laparoscopy is a {{well-established}} alternative to open surgery for treating many diseases. Although laparoscopy has many advantages, {{it is also}} associated with disadvantages, such as slow learning curves and prolonged operation time. Fresh frozen cadavers may be an interesting resource for laparoscopic training, and many institutions have access to cadavers. One of the main obstacles for the use of cadavers as a training model is the difficulty in introducing a sufficient pneumoperitoneum to distend the abdominal wall and provide a proper working space. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe a fresh human cadaver model for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum. Materials and Methods and Results: A fake abdominal wall device was developed to allow for laparoscopic training without requiring a pneumoperitoneum in cadavers. The device consists of a table-mounted retractor, two rail clamps, two independent frame arms, two <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle</b> and rotating features, and two frames of the abdominal wall. A handycam is fixed over a frame arm, positioned and connected through a USB connection to a television and dissector; scissors and other laparoscopic materials are positioned inside trocars. The laparoscopic procedure is thus simulated. Conclusion: Cadavers offer a very promising and useful model for laparoscopic training. We developed a fake abdominal wall device that solves the limitation of space when performing surgery on cadavers and removes the need to acquire more costly laparoscopic equipment. This model is easily accessible at institutions in developing countries, making it one of the most promising tools for teaching laparoscopy...|$|E

40|$|A {{computerized}} igital dynamometer {{was used}} to assess the contribution of individual fingers to total grip strength in 100 hands from 50 randomly selected healthy subjects. The dynamometer simultaneously recorded force data from each digit (index, long, ring, and small) and cumulative grip directly to a laptop computer. The percentage contribution of each finger force to total grip force was calculated at three successive handle sizes for dominant and non-dominant hands. Individual digital contributions to total grip strength were approximately 25 %, 35 %, 26 % and 15 % for the index, long, ring, and small fingers respectively. This pattern was consistent irrespective of handle size, hand dominance, and grip strength. Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1998) 23 B: 2. " 162 - 166 Grip strength isan objective measurement of function in the upper extremity. Physicians and hand therapists mea-sure grip strength to establish a baseline to assess patient progress and to evaluate outcome after surgical proce-dures and other therapeutic nterventions. Therefore, the device used to measure grip strength must be reliable, valid, and accurate. Many investigators egard the Jamar dynamometer (Preston, Jackson, MI, USA) as the most accurate instrument for measuring rip (Mathiowetz et al, 1984). The five level <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle,</b> the availability of normative data, and the final reading in kilograms-force are all desirable features of this device (Crosby and Wehb 6, 1994). However, frequent calibration and use of the same device at each visit are necessary to maintain reliability of the Jamar dynamometer and only the global force applied by all the fingers is recorded without consideration of individual digital contribution. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the individual digi-tal contribution to total grip strength at multiple handle sizes using a computerized digital dynamometer...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{investigate}} {{if there}} is any significant difference in volume between dominant and non-dominant limbs in young adults measured by volumeter and circumference measurement method. (2) To investigate {{if there is}} any significant difference in grip strength between dominant and non-dominant limbs in young adults measured by the dynamometer. (3) o investigate {{if there is any}} correlation between the volume differences between bilateral upper limbs measured by volumetry compared with circumference measurement method, and between the volume difference and the grip strength difference of bilateral upper limbs. Design: A quasi-experimental research design with blinded researchers. Participants: Twenty-seven healthy young adults (18 females, 9 males) Instrumentations: Upper limb volume is measured by a newly constructed volumeter, and through circumferential measurements calculated using frustum sign method. Grip strength is measured by a standard <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle</b> dynamometer. Results: The mean absolute percentage differences for all participants are 8. 27 % (SD= 4. 16 %), 4. 99 % (SD= 3. 29 %), 8. 18 % (SD= 5. 36 %) for volume obtained by volumetry, volume obtained by circumference measurements method and grip strength respectively. The dominant upper limbs had a higher volume of 163 ± 97. 0 ml (95 %CI 125 to 202) and 87. 7 ± 94. 8 ml (95 %CI 50. 2 to 125) measured by the volumetry and circumferential measurements respectively, and higher grip strength of 2. 54 ± 2. 92 kg (95 % CI 1. 39 to 3. 70). Paired sample two-tailed T-test showed that the differences in the volume and grip strength between dominant and non-dominant upper limbs were statistically significant.

40|$|In Sweden {{there are}} 560 000 {{disabled}} {{people over the}} age of 16, half of those are in use of some kind of mobility device. Living with a disability means that due to injury or illness you are having trouble functioning without devices or assistance in your daily life and has a big impact on the independence of the disabled user. The everyday life for disabled parents with young children are different {{depending on the type of}} disability and mobility device. Today there is no alternative to the stroller for the disabled user who use mobility advises. This causes problems when the disabled person on there own have/want to move the child. The following statement have been the cornerstone for this project: How to make it possible for a wheelchair user to move a child, in the 0 - 2 year, for longer distances with a focus on independence and safety for both adult children? Due the process, of industrial design, this question and problem have been solved during 10 weeks. The process have contained parts as meeting with users, analyzing, concept development, evaluations, mock-up making, testing, shape & color development etc. This in the end have resulted in a full scale model of the appearance of a proposed product. The result is a stroller witch can be connected to the users specific wheelchair due two one time adjustments. The solution gives the user capability to move and steer the wheelchair and stroller at the same time. It also gives the user free space in the lap and avoid labor on the users body. The solution is mainly solving the problems of moving an infant, but is working as good for moving children up to two years old. The stroller and wheelchair creates a tandem witch have a breaking point in between the products. This makes it possible to move over smaller curbs by pulling the <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle</b> on stroller. The stroller can also be used separately due two extendible rear wheels. This makes it possible for a walking partner to use the same stroller and fits better for a indoor use for the disabled user. A product like this would give the chance to the wheelchair users to be more involved in there childs first years. It would be one step further to an independent life and hopefully bring a scoop of confidence. I see this product as one of many that could be developed and help in a disabled persons everyday life. By bringing this subject to the table I hope that more people become aware of this users situation and may also see the opportunities developing product and devices in this subject...|$|E

40|$|The Cal Poly Prototype Vehicles Team (PROVE) is {{designing}} a solar powered vehicle to break an international land speed record. The space within the driver’s cockpit allotted for the steering mechanism {{was too small}} for a conventional steering wheel. This report describes the process that was followed to design, manufacture, and test a compact and lightweight steering apparatus for the PROVE solar vehicle. A lateral lever steering system, the final design selected for PROVE’s solar car, was designed to withstand the maximum expected loads applied by the driver during the three-minute run of the competition. The lateral lever steering apparatus is controlled by two <b>adjustable</b> <b>handles.</b> The rotation of the handles is limited to either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction relative to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, thus turning the vehicle’s wheels right or left, respectively.

40|$|Though {{now seen}} {{everywhere}} {{in the hospital and}} operating theater, {{there was a time when}} surgeons used no hand protection. In the late 19 th century, however, as the science of bacteriology became more advanced, surgical glove usage spurred. Today, gloves serve an extremely important role, helping to maintain the sterile field and protect hospital staff from the transfer of bloodborne pathogens. Since they are so valuable, it is equally important that gloves fit properly as to not be detrimental to the surgeon. Gloves that are too tight increase fatigue rate and decrease fine finger dexterity. Gloves that are too loose can reduce tactile sensitivity caused by bunching of material at the fingers. Traditionally, the larger of measurement of hand circumference and hand length are used to determine glove size, but most select a size based on comfort of fit. 	To assist manufacturers with creating certain sizes, anthropometry is often used. Anthropometry is the study of the physical measures of the human body. Human-factors engineering is the science of applying anthropometric information to the design of devices intended for human use. In this study, two anthropometric databases, studies by Greiner and Pheasant, were utilized to obtain hand measurements representative of the general population, due to the population studied. 	For this study, 59 general surgeons (51 male, 8 female) were invited on separate dates to the Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies Group in North Haven, CT for Voice of Customer laboratories. While there, they completed surveys where they listed their preferred glove size, double gloving sizes, dominant hand, etc. In addition, the following six measurements were taken: hand circumference, maximum grip diameter, Digit 1 (D 1) length, Digit 2 (D 2) link length, Distance from D 2 Metacarpo-phalangeal (MCP) to Distal Interphalangeal (DIP) joint, and D 2 distal phalanx length (extrapolated). These measurements were averaged and compared to the numbers reported in the Greiner and Pheasant studies for analysis using a novel Microsoft Excel tool. Commonly used laparoscopic staplers were also measured to assess ergonomic usability amongst the surgeon population. 	Male surgeons had statistically significantly larger hands than female surgeons with respect to all measurements taken. Compared to men of the general population, male surgeons had significantly smaller grip diameter, D 2 link length, yet a greater D 1 Length. Compared to women of the general population, female surgeons had a greater hand circumference, yet smaller D 2 link length. All other measurements recorded were statistically equivalent. In general, surgeons seem to select a preferred glove size based on their hand circumference (Pearson’s Correlation 0. 799, R 2 63. 9 %), followed by D 2 Link Length (Pearson’s Correlation 0. 631, R 2 39. 9 %). The median glove size for male surgeons was 7. 5 (0. 50) and 6. 0 (0. 25) for female surgeons (p > 0. 001). 	To evaluate the ergonomic usability of laparoscopic staplers, the measurement “Distance from D 2 MCP to DIP joint” was developed internally to roughly assess effective trigger distance, where larger lengths would force the user to adjust their hand position. The handles of two commonly used laparoscopic staplers were measured to determine what proportion of the surgeon population could use them effectively. Based on these measurements, for the Medtronic Endo GIA™ Ultra Stapler, nearly all male surgeons and 99. 8 % of female surgeons could use it ergonomically. For the Ethicon ECHELON FLEX™ ENDOPATH® Stapler, only 78. 2 % of male surgeons and 30. 9 % of female surgeons could use it ergonomically. 	This study demonstrated that there exists a large amount of variability between each part of the hand based on the different measurements. Therefore, to best assure proper fitting gloves for the majority of users, a two metric system involving hand circumference and finger length would be useful to accommodate the inherent variability of the hand. With respect to laparoscopic stapling platforms, this study demonstrated that the instruments are simply too large to be used ergonomically by a large portion of the intended audience. Medical device manufacturers should look to create an <b>adjustable</b> <b>handle</b> such that the trigger distance can be manipulated to fit the needs of those surgeons with smaller hands...|$|E

40|$|Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray) stores its rubber {{primarily}} {{within the}} cells of its bark, which constitutes only 30 % of the dry weight of the whole shrub. Debarking guayule soon after harvesting at the crop site would substantially improve the efficiency of latex extraction technology by reducing transport costs to the processing plant and increasing the processing capacity of the latex extraction plant. The objective {{of this study was}} to design, fabricate and evaluate an efficient debarking machine for guayule. The bark removal unit consists of a pair of grooved rubber rollers rotating in opposite directions at different speeds, drawing and crushing the cut stems without chipping the core. The clearance between the rollers is <b>adjustable</b> and can <b>handle</b> different stem sizes ranging from 6 to 45. mm. The speed difference between the rollers creates a shearing action, required for peeling the bark. The separation unit consists of a fan attached to metal tubing, a discrimination chamber for grading processed material and a water trough where lighter material is removed by flotation. The debarking system was tested to determine bark removal performance as well as separation of bark from other processed plant material. A debarking efficiency of up to 95 % and maximum separation efficiency of 75 % were found from the evaluation. The prototype debarking machine produced a throughput capacity of up to 450. kg/h which can be increased by converting it to a full-size field machine...|$|R
30|$|Nanotechnology as an {{emerging}} technology {{may be a}} reasonable choice and an effective strategy for solving the above problem. According to the report from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in USA, nanotechnology seeks to exploit distinct technological advances towards cancer prevention and treatment [12]. Electrospinning is a versatile technique to fabricate two-dimensional nanofibers. Electrospun nanofibers have recently received significant attentions in biomedical applications because they possess large surface area-to-volume ratio, high interfiber porosity with tunable pore size, low hindrance for mass transfer, flexible <b>handling,</b> <b>adjustable</b> morphology, and well mechanical strength, which would make nanofibers use as therapeutic patch for drug delivery [13, 14]. The controlled drug release from drug-loaded nanofibrous mat at a rate according to the need could be realized by properly designed architecture, porosity, fiber diameter, drug incorporation manner, and composition of nanofibers [15]. In addition, the medicated nanofibrous products can be easily set to the targeted site by adjusting their morphology [15]. Thus, the drug-loaded nanofibers can be targeted delivery to the desired target tissues with controlled release where drug is released {{in a certain way}} for preventing local tumor recurrence after surgery. Aliphatic biodegradable polyester, such as poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), is widely used to form electrospun nanofibers in various clinic and xsimplebiomedical research applications because it has excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability [10, 16]. However, the simple introduction of drug into polymer matrix always leads to inevitable burst drug release, since the drug molecules might migrate on or near the fiber surfaces because of the high ionic strength in drug/polymer solution and the rapid evaporation of the solvent during electrospinning. To address this limitation, it is highly desirable to develop efficient nanocarrier-mediated nanofibrous delivery systems which may serve as barrier for improving the safety of anticancer drugs and avoid drug premature burst release under physiological conditions [7, 17 – 21]. In fact, several nanoscale carriers such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles [22], hydroxyapatite [10], and liposome [23] have recently been incorporated into electrospun nanofibers for potential anticancer therapy, from which the prolonged drug release with tunable drug release kinetics could be achieved. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are rolled-up seamless cylinder of graphene sheets, have gained extensive attention in the past decade [24]. CNTs are classified as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), which depend on the number of graphene layer which a single nanotubes is composed [24]. In recent years, efforts have also been devoted to explore the potential biomedical application of CNTs. Benefitting from their superior heir distinct properties, especially, the biocompatibility in the physiological condition, CNTs {{have been one of the}} most promising inorganic nano-sized vectors for anticancer drugs, proteins, genetic therapeutics, and biological imaging agent delivery [8, 24, 25]. Up to now, the development of CNTs-doped PLGA nanofibers for cancer therapy has not been reported to the best of our knowledge. The objective of this work, therefore, was to examine the hypothesis of preparing a sustained anticancer drug release system by doping drug-loaded CNTs into PLGA nanofibers.|$|R
