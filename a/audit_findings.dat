Although the risk assessment is performed by the auditor based on his/her judgment, the OMB Circular A-133 does have two requirements for a program to be considered low risk. First, the program must have been audited at least once in the last two years, and second, the program must have no <b>audit</b> <b>findings</b> when it was last audited. If the program does not comply with either of these two requirements, it is automatically considered as high risk.|$|E

2500|$|The {{evaluation}} {{concludes with}} the auditor determining, {{based on the}} evaluation, whether the recipient is a high-risk auditee or a low-risk auditee. A high-risk auditee is a recipient which has {{a high risk of}} not complying with federal laws and regulations, while a low-risk auditee is the exact opposite. For example, an auditor may judge a recipient to be a high-risk auditee because the audit reports {{of the past few years}} have numerous <b>audit</b> <b>findings</b> (e.g. specific situations of non-compliance with laws and regulations, serious deficiencies in internal controls and/or acts of fraud), or because the auditor receives news from various sources that the recipient is engaged in illegal activities, such as money laundering.
