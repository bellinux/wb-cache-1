500|$|The series {{sought out}} {{a bowling alley}} for the opening scenes, but many were {{reluctant}} to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen. The series was allowed to film at the location {{under the condition that}} the bowling surfaces were preserved. Due to this, the production staff was forced to either wear bowling shoes or wear makeshift [...] "paper booties" [...] on their feet. In between camera set ups, Duchovny and director Charleston bowled several games. Duchovny later joked that after the episode, he [...] "realized how old" [...] he was because he felt sore from all the bowling. He joked, [...] "when you get sore from bowling, it's time to start thinking <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and where it's going." ...|$|E
500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the lyrics}} were {{composed}} by Batmanglij and Koenig in Batmanglij's apartment (a former factory building in Brooklyn) and at a rented cottage on Martha's Vineyard. The lyrics explore more mature, world-weary themes such as growing old and disillusionment with American foreign policy. The album eschewed the theme of privileged youth from their first two albums in favor of characters with adult responsibilities and reflections on the passage of time. Faith and mortality are recurring themes on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", [...] "Worship You", and [...] "Everlasting Arms". Koenig likened their first three albums to Brideshead Revisited: [...] "The naïve joyous school days in the beginning. Then {{the expansion of the}} world, travel, seeing other places, learning {{a little bit more about}} how people live. And then the end is a little bit of growing up, starting to think more seriously <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> and your faith. If people could look at our three albums as a bildungsroman, I’d be O.K. with that." [...] According to Brice Ezell from PopMatters, Modern Vampires of the City is [...] "very much an indie rock record" [...] because of Koenig's voice and diction, which reveals [...] "the youth that he and his bandmates so often strive to shrug off." [...] Ezell asserts that, on songs such as [...] "Unbelievers", the [...] "reckless abandon" [...] expressed by the lyrics reveals [...] "the group's grasp on the genuine rebellion that indie rock ought to strive for." ...|$|E

To tell you the truth, Mr. Langbourne, we got so interested we couldn't bear to stop them. You wrote so much <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> in New York, that it was like a visit there every week; and it's pretty quiet at Upper Ashton in the winter time." ...|$|E

Now," [...] he added, dropping his voice and glancing quickly across the room, [...] "you {{will have an opportunity}} to put into force your new and magnificent principles of misogyny. Our little sandy-headed friend has been summoned from the room. I saw the commissionaire come up and whisper in his ear. Mademoiselle is writing a note. A hundred to one it is to you!" ...|$|E

I have been {{constantly}} thinking about you--crying, too, sometimes-- imagining {{all sorts of}} painful things--that you were destitute and friendless, perhaps, in this cruel London. And now here you are, I don't know how, like {{a vision of the}} West End, with that subtle perfume about you, and looking more beautiful than I have ever seen you, except on that one occasion; do you remember?--on that first evening in the orchard at dear old Eyethorne. Look at my dress, Fan, my second best! But how much more did it astound me to hear Harold--I call Mr. Northcott by his Christian name now--addressing you as Miss Eden when he left. What does it all mean? If he had called you Mrs. Eden I might have guessed what wonderful things had happened to you." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{wondered}} if you could {{tell me a little}} bit <b>about</b> <b>your</b> early <b>life,</b> <b>your</b> education and how you became a socialist. Yes. Well my early life was a petty bourgeoise life. My father was an astronomer, my mother was the daughter of a wealthy wholesale butcher—and I grew up in this bourgeoise atmosphere. I went to kindergarten with Dick Cassidy. I went to Melbourne Grammar School when Stanley Bruce was the captain of the school and I was at Melbourne University when Menzies was in full flight there...|$|R

What do I care <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> in his absence? Of what earthly consequence are his remembrance and his gratitude to Me!' She spoke of him, with such fury and such contempt, that she roused me at last. I said to her, 'You abominable woman, there is but one excuse for you--you're mad!' I left the room--and didn't I bang the door! We have not met since. Let me hear your opinion, Teresa. I was in a passion when I {{told her she was}} mad; but was I altogether wrong?

6000|$|For the sea {{which each}} of us is sailing over is this world, and the ship in which {{each of us}} sails, is our own nature and character; what St Paul, like a truly {{scientific}} man, calls our flesh; and what modern scientific men, and rightly, call our organisation. And the land to which we are sailing is eternal Life. Shall we make a prosperous voyage? Shall we fail, or shall we succeed? Shall we founder and drown at sea, and sink to eternal death? Or shall we, as the clergyman prayed for us when we were baptized, so pass through the waves of this troublesome world, that finally we may come to the land of everlasting life? Which shall it be, my friends? Shall we sink, or shall we swim? Certain is one thing--that we shall sink, and not swim, if we do not learn and keep the law, and commandments, and testimonies, and judgments of God, concerning this our mortal life. If we do not, then we shall go through life, without knowing how to go through life, ignorantly and blindly; and the end of that will be failure, and ruin, and death to our souls. If we do not know and keep the Laws of God, the Laws of God will keep themselves, in spite of us, and grind us to powder. Do not fancy that you may do wrong without being punished; and break God's Law, because you are not under the law, but under grace. You are only under grace, as long as you keep clear of God's Law. The moment you do wrong you put yourself under the Law, and the Law will punish you. Suppose that you went into a mill; and that the owner of that mill was your best friend, even your father. Would that prevent your being crushed by the machinery, if you got entangled in it through ignorance or heedlessness? I think not. Even so, though God be your best of friends, ay, your Father in heaven, that will not prevent your being injured, it may be ruined, not only by wilful sins, but by mere folly and ignorance. Therefore your only chance for safety in this life and for ever, is to learn God's laws and statutes <b>about</b> <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> that you may pass through it justly, honourably, virtuously, successfully. And the man who wrote the 119th Psalm knew that, and said, [...] "Oh that my ways were made so direct, that I might keep thy statutes." ...|$|E
