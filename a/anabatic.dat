Down- and up-slope flows are generated via cooling and heating 20 degrees inclined plates. The urban heat island is simulated by an electric heater centred in the valley. In {{order to understand the}} main features of the circulation established by thermal effects in an initially stably-stratified environment, an advanced Lagrangian particle tracking technique (Hybrid Lagrangian Particle Tracking) is employed. This allows one to obtain the velocity and acceleration of passive tracer particles as the first and second derivatives of a moving spline function that filters the particle trajectory coordinates. Experiments show the dependence of mean quantities and turbulent statistics on different slope heating. Furthermore, the effects of the slope flows on the circulation in a large city located in a narrow valley appear significant. During day-time simulations the urban heat island circulation is opposed by <b>anabatic</b> winds, creating critical situations for pollutant dispersion.

40|$|Thermally-driven upslope {{winds are}} one of the many {{different}} wind patterns unique to mountainous terrain. While the general mechanics of these winds have been widely studied, {{there is a lack of}} information on how transitions in land cover influence these wind systems. Questions also remain about how these wind systems affect the biological functioning of mountain ecosystems. This two year measurement program indentified the upslope flow regimes common to the southeast face of Niwot Ridge, an east-west running ridge directly east of the Continental Divide in the Colorado Front Range. The study focused on the role that alpine treeline played in the generation of upslope winds, as well as whether the airmass composition of upslope versus downslope winds influenced the spatial distribution of alpine vegetation. Observations showed that thermally-driven upslope winds were most common in summer daytime hours. Differentiation between two different types of thermally-driven upslope winds, land cover-induced flow and <b>anabatic</b> flow, was done through an investigation of surface pressure and sensible heat flux at sites in the subalpine forest and alpine tundra. It was found that <b>anabatic</b> forces, not transitions in land cover from forest to tundra, were responsible for the generation of upslope winds on Niwot Ridge. Analyses on the composition of airmasses showed that upslope winds were generally cooler, more humid, and weaker in strength than downslope, westerly winds.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study about two-dimensional upslope and downslope flows in a stably stratified environment and about their interaction with an urban heat island {{placed in a}} valley is presented. Two different configurations are reconstructed in a laboratory model: an open valley {{at the bottom of}} a slope and a valley closed between two symmetric slopes. The slope flows are generated heating or cooling the slopes by Peltier cells. The urban heat island is simulated by an electric resistance placed within the valley. The main features of the circulation driven by the thermal exchanges are studied using an image analysis technique, named Feature Tracking, that allows a Lagrangian reconstruction of the motion. The distributions of the velocity and of its second order statistics along some profiles are displayed; the temperature profiles are obtained from measurements with thermocouples. The experimental tests display that the slope flows affect strongly the urban heat islands in both configurations: in the open valley the urban heat island is strongly deformed and nearly destroyed by the slope flow and a recirculating zone takes place; in the closed valley the urban heat island circulation is weakened by the <b>anabatic</b> flows and it is enhanced by the katabatic flows.

30|$|During the pre-monsoon season, the {{low-level}} large-scale wind over Cambodia is southerly with {{a slight}} easterly component (Fig.  3 b). During the daytime at station C 1, both the sea breeze from the Gulf of Thailand and the <b>anabatic</b> wind to the Cardamom Mountains are southwesterly, so that no clear low-level winds converging to a large-scale southerly are expected. In this situation, the orographic lifting of moist air from the sea caused by the Cardamom Mountains may determine the observed afternoon rainfall. As pointed out by Xie et al. (2006) regarding the abundant rainfall under the ASM over the Indochina Peninsula, moist air is forced to rise over the mountains and thereby initiate intense convection on the windward side of the orographic lifting. The increased atmospheric instability by sensible heat from the drier ground in this season and also by the low-level intrusion of moist air from the sea contributes to the afternoon rainfall maxima and the abundant rainfall on the coast and over the Cardamom Mountains.|$|E

The simulated flows achieve quasi-steady periodic regimes at large times, with turbulent fluctuations being modified by persistent low-frequency oscillatory motions with frequency equal to the product of the ambient buoyancy frequency and the sine of the slope angle. These oscillatory wave-type motions result from interactions between turbulence and ambient stable stratification despite the temporal constancy of the surface buoyant forcing. The structure of the mean-flow fields and turbulence statistics in simulated slope flows is analyzed.

These effects are generated by regional heating or cooling effects over land and water and are controlled in position seasonally by the apparent migration of the sun.

The data were collected around the Santa Catalina Mountains in Arizona, 20 – 30 km in diameter, during the North American monsoon, on days with weak winds and cumulus congestus to cumulonimbus development over the mountain. Flights in the boundary layer around the mountain and surface station data indicate that mountain-scale <b>anabatic</b> surface wind generally develops shortly after sunrise, peaking at 1 m s 1 in strength close to solar noon. There is some evidence for a toroidal heat island circulation, with divergence in the upper boundary layer. The aircraft data and mainly the diurnal surface temperature and pressure patterns confirm that this circulation is driven by surface heating over the mountain. Three case studies suggest that growth spurts of orographic cumulus and cumulonimbus are not preceded by enhanced mountain-scale mass convergence near the surface, and that the decay of orographic deep convection is associated with divergence around the mountain. 1...|$|E

An unusual wet spell allows separation of the two-month campaign in a wet and a dry soil period.

The wet soil period is also characterized by higher humidity and moist static energy in the BL, implying a lower cu-mulus cloud base and higher convective available potential energy.

40|$|Philosophical {{interpretations of}} {{theories}} generally presuppose that a theory can be {{presented as a}} consistent mathematical formulation that is interpreted through models. Algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) can fit this interpretative model. However, standard Lagrangian quantum field theory (LQFT), as well as quantum electrodynamics and nuclear physics, resists recasting along such formal lines. The difference has a distinct bearing on ontological issues. AQFT does not treat particle interactions or the standard model. This paper develops a framework and methodology for interpreting such informal theories as LQFT and the standard model. We begin by summarizing two minimal epistemological interpretation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics (NRQM) : Bohrian semantics, which focuses on communicables; and quantum information theory, which focuses on the algebra of local observables. Schwinger's development of quantum field theory supplies a unique path from NRQM to QFT, where each step is conceptually anchored in local measurements.
