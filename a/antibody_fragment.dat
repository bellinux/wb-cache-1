40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} the binding and biochemical properties of two human <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> directed against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT). These fragments were isolated from a synthetic combinatorial library of human Fab <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> displayed {{on the surface of}} filamentous phage. The <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> were selected by using recombinant heterodimeric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RT purified from insect cells as a solid-phase selector. This procedure led to the isolation of two <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> that completely neutralize the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of RT at nanomolar concentrations. Both <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> bind only to the enzymatically active form of the RT. The inhibitory activity of the anti-RT <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> is competitive with respect to the template primer. The <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> also neutralize the activities of RTs from avian and murine retroviruses and of DNA polymerases of prokaryotic origin as well as human DNA polymerase alpha. Thus, the <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> selected and characterized in this study appear to recognize a structural fold that is common to the different DNA polymerases and necessary for their activity.

40|$|The {{successful}} clinical {{application of}} targeted-radiopharmaceuticals {{depends on the}} development of molecules that optimize tumor specific radionuclide deposition and minimize non-specific organ irradiation. To this end, this proposal outlines a research effort to identify and evaluate novel <b>antibodies</b> and <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> that bind breast tumors. The tumor-avid antibodies will be investigated for as imaging and therapeutic agents and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of radiolabeled tumor-avid <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> through the use of site-specifically labeled molecules. <b>Antibodies</b> or <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments,</b> that bind breast carcinoma carbohydrate antigens, will be obtained from hybridoma or bacteriophage library screening. More specifically, <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> that bind the carcinoma-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) antigen will be radiolabeled with {sup 99 m}Tc and {sup 188 }Re at a natural amino acid chelation site and will be investigated in vivo for their abilities to target human breast tumors. In addition, site-specific radiolabeled <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> will be biosynthesized using misacylated suppressor tRNAs. Homogeneously radiolabeled populations of <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> will be used to investigate the effects of radionuclide location and chelation chemistries on their biodistribution and metabolism. It is hypothesized that site-specifically radiolabeled <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> will possess enhanced tumor imaging and therapeutic properties due to optimal label location and conjugation chemistries. New insights into the factors that govern antibody metabolism in vivo are also expected from this work. Results from these studies should enhance our ability to design and synthesize radiolabeled <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> that have improved pharmacokinetic properties. The studies in this proposal involve basic research into the development of antibody-based radiopharmaceuticals, with the ultimate goal of application in humans.

This library displays the variable domains of the heavy-chain antibody subclass, found in these animals. Phage display selection with six recombinant HIF- 1 a proteins yielded five different <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments.</b> By epitope-mapping, we show that all five <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> bind within the functionally important oxygen-dependent degradation domain of the HIF- 1 a protein.

The present study evaluates the anticoccidial activity of some anti-Eimeria tenella <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> expressed in pea plants. Both in vitro and in vivo infection assays including indirect immunofluorescence, in vivo evaluation of antibody neutralization and cell culture invasion-inhibition assays were used to study the inhibitory effect of these <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> on E. tenella sporozoites. Seven of nine <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> (Ab 1, Ab 4, Ab 5, Ab 6, Ab 7, Ab 8 and Ab 9) showed binding to sporozoites of E. tenella in an indirect immunofluorescence test. Only two antibodies (Ab 4 and Ab 5) cross reacted with sporozoites of E. maxima, E. acervulina and E. brunetti. The localization of specific fluorescence differed between species. Ab binding with sporozoites {{was seen in the}} area of both anterior and posterior refractile bodies in case of E. tenella, E. brunetti, and E. maxima but was only observed in the posterior refractile body in case of E. acervulina. No antibody binding was observed on merozoites. The suitability of <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> to alter the infectivity of E. tenella sporozoites to Madin Darby Bovine Kidney cells (MDBK) was examined in vitro and the invasion-inhibition rates were quantified by flow cytometry. To assess the inhibitory effect on parasite reproduction, the in vivo antibody neutralization assay was done by retrograde infection of chicken with sporozoites previously incubated with <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments.</b> In vitro invasion rates were reduced by incubation with <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> by approximately 24 to 45 %, with Ab 6 and Ab 7 showing the most distinct effect. However, proliferation rates (PR) of the respective MDBK cultures were also clearly reduced by 15 to 26 %. PR of MDBK cells treated with 1 : 1000, 1 : 100, 1 : 10 and undiluted mixed <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> were reduced by 1 %, 10 %, 16 %, and 26 % with a reduction of invasion rates by 0 %, 9 %, 15 % and 18 %, respectively. Immune sera reduced the invasion rates by 16 % to 70 % and increased PR of the host cells. It appeared that the preparations of the <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> contained compounds cytotoxic to MDBK cells and thus invasion inhibition could not be unequivocally evaluated in vitro. However, after incubation with <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> sporozoites displayed a reduced ability to reproduce after intracloacal application to chicken (especially Ab 1, Ab 3, Ab 5 and Ab 9). Other <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> (Ab 2, Ab 4, Ab 6, Ab 7 and Ab 8) were less capable to reduce sporozoite infectivity and reproduction. More investigations are still required to study the possible use of <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> and their application to infected chicken exposed to coccidiosis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEndotoxins are {{frequent}} contaminants of recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. Due to their adverse effects, endotoxins {{have to be}} removed from recombinant proteins prior their use in cell-based assays or parenteral application. Reduction of endotoxin to less than 10 EU mg(- 1) is, however, one of the most problematic steps during protein purification from E. coli and often associated with substantial loss of biological materials. The present paper describes the use of a single step procedure enabling metal chelate affinity purification and endotoxin clearance from <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> produced in E. coli using a non-ionic detergent. Endotoxin content was as low as 5 to 9 EU mg(- 1) with a recovery of <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> of over 90 %.

40|$|AbstractImproper {{protein folding}} or {{aggregation}} can frequently {{be responsible for}} low expression and poor functional activity of <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> secreted into the Escherichia coli periplasm. Expression issues also can affect selection of antibody candidates from phage libraries, since <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> displayed on phage also are secreted into the E. coli periplasm. To improve secretion of properly folded <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> into the periplasm, we have developed a novel approach that involves co-expressing the <b>antibody</b> <b>fragments</b> with the peptidyl prolyl cis-trans isomerase, FkpA, lacking its signal sequence (cytFkpA) which consequently is expressed in the E. coli cytosol. Cytoplasmic expression of cytFkpA improved secretion of functional Fab fragments into the periplasm, exceeding even the benefits from co-expressing Fab fragments with native, FkpA localized in the periplasm. In addition, panning and subsequent screening of large Fab and scFv naïve phage libraries {{in the presence of}} cytFkpA significantly increased the number of unique clones selected, as well as their functional expression levels and diversity...|$|R
