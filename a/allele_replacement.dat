5000|$|Original genetic {{studies by}} gel {{electrophoresis}} {{led to the}} finding of the genome size, ca. 35 megabases, with 7 chromosomes and 1 mitochondrial chromosome. In the 1980s the mitochondrial chromosome was sequenced. Then in 2003 a pilot study was initiated to sequence regions bordering chromosome V`s centromere using BAC clones and direct sequencing. In 2008, a 10x whole genome draft sequence was published. The genome size is now estimated to be 35-36 megabases. Genetic manipulation in fungi is difficult due to low homologous recombination efficiency and ectopic integrations (insertion of gene at undesirable location) and thus a hindrance in genetic studies (<b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> and knockouts). [...] Although in 2005, a method for gene deletion (knock-outs) was developed based on a model for Aspergillus nidulans that involved cosmid plasmid transformation, a better system for Podospora was developed in 2008 by using a strain that lacked nonhomologous end joining proteins (Ku (protein), known in Podospora as PaKu70). This method claimed to have 100% of transformants undergo desired homologous recombination leading to allelic replacement (after the transformation, the PaKu70 deletion can be restored by crossing over with a wild-type strain to yield progeny with only the targeted gene deletion or allelic exchange (e.g. point mutation)).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Targeted {{mutagenesis}} of the herpesvirus genomes {{has been}} {{facilitated by the}} use of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology. Such modified genomes have potential uses in understanding viral pathogenesis, gene identification and characterization, and the development of new viral vectors and vaccines. We have previously described the construction of a herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV- 2) BAC and the use of an <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> strategy to construct HSV- 2 recombinants. While the BAC mutagenesis procedure is a powerful method to generate HSV- 2 recombinants, particularly in the absence of selective marker in eukaryotic culture, the mutagenesis procedure is still difficult and cumbersome. Results Here we describe the incorporation of a phage lambda recombination system into an <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> vector. This strategy enables any DNA fragment containing the phage att L recombination sites to be efficiently inserted into the att R sites of the <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> vector using phage lambda clonase. We also describe how the incorporation of EGFP into the <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> vector can facilitate the selection of the desired cross-over recombinant BACs when the <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> reaction is a viral gene deletion. Finally, we incorporate the lambda phage recombination sites directly into an HSV- 2 BAC vector for direct recombination of gene cassettes using the phage lambda clonase-driven recombination reaction. Conclusion Together, these improvements to the techniques of HSV BAC mutagenesis will facilitate the construction of recombinant herpes simplex viruses and viral vectors. </p...|$|E
40|$|How {{adaptation}} appears and {{is later}} refined {{by natural selection}} has been the object of intense theoretical work. However, the testing of these theories is limited by our ability to estimate the strength of natural selection in nature. Using a long-term cline series, we estimate the selection coefficients acting on different alleles at the same locus to analyze the <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> observed in the insecticide resistance gene Ester in the mosquito Culex pipiens in the Montpellier area, southern France. Our method allows us to accurately account for the resistance <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> observed in this area since 1986. A first resistance allele appeared early, which {{was replaced by a}} second resistance allele providing the same advantage but at a lower cost, itself being replaced by a third resistance allele with both higher advantage and cost. It shows that amelioration of the adaptation (here resistance to insecticide) through <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> was successively achieved by selection of first a generalist allele (i. e., with a low fitness variance across environments) and later a specialist allele (i. e., with a large fitness variance across environments). More generally, we discuss how precise estimates of the strength of selection obtained from field data help us understand the process of amelioration of adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Sex {{is thought}} to {{facilitate}} accumulation of initially rare beneficial mutations by allowing simultaneous <b>allele</b> <b>replacements</b> at many loci. However, this advantage of sex depends on a restrictive assumption that the fitness of a genotype is determined by fitness potential, a single intermediate variable to which all loci contribute additively, so that new alleles can accumulate in any order. Individual-based simulations of sexual and asexual populations reveal that under generic selection, sex often retards adaptive evolution. When new alleles are beneficial only if they accumulate in a prescribed order, a sexual population may evolve two or more times slower than an asexual population because only asexual reproduction allows some overlap of successive <b>allele</b> <b>replacements.</b> Many other fitness surfaces lead to an even greater disadvantage of sex. Thus, either sex exists {{in spite of its}} impact on the rate of adaptive <b>allele</b> <b>replacements,</b> or natural fitness surfaces have rather specific properties, at least at the scale of intrapopulation genetic variability...|$|R
40|$|In nature, {{microbes}} {{often need}} to "decide" which of several available nutrients to utilize, {{a choice that}} depends on a cell's inherent preference and external nutrient levels. While natural environments can have mixtures of different nutrients, phenotypic variation in microbes' decisions of which nutrient to utilize is poorly studied. Here, we quantified differences in the concentration of glucose and galactose required to induce galactose-responsive (GAL) genes across 36 wild S. cerevisiae strains. Using bulk segregant analysis, we found that a locus containing the galactose sensor GAL 3 was associated with differences in GAL signaling in eight different crosses. Using <b>allele</b> <b>replacements,</b> we confirmed that GAL 3 is the major driver of GAL induction variation, and that GAL 3 allelic variation alone can explain as much as 90 % {{of the variation in}} GAL induction in a cross. The GAL 3 variants we found modulate the diauxic lag, a selectable trait. These results suggest that ecological constraints on the galactose pathway may have led to variation in a single protein, allowing cells to quantitatively tune their response to nutrient changes in the environment...|$|R

In a recently performed proteomic study, a thymidine kinase (TK) {{was found to}} be preferentially expressed in amastigotes. Western blot analysis showing a marked increase in TK protein synthesis during stage differentiation from promastigotes to amastigotes confirmed this result. After comparison of the amino acid sequence of Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major thymidine kinases with thymidine kinases of other organisms the Leishmania protein has to be classified as a type II TK. Therefore, in accordance with the nomenclature of other thymidine kinases we named the Leishmania enzymes LdTK 1 and LmTK 1, respectively. The LdTK 1 is localised within the cytoplasm of promastigotes. In amastigotes, increased expression and a clustered distribution of the protein can be observed. Lmtk 1 single <b>allele</b> gene <b>replacement</b> mutants have significantly elongated flagellum. In contrast, lmtk 1 double <b>allele</b> gene <b>replacement</b> mutants show a remarkably reduced flagellar length, diminished overall size and a deformed body shape.

40|$|In {{the moss}} Physcomitrella patens, {{transforming}} DNA containing homologous sequences integrates pre-dominantly by homologous recombination with its 10 genomic target. A systematic {{investigation of the}} parameters that determine gene targeting efficiency shows a direct relationship between homology length and targeting frequency for replacement vectors (a selectable marker flanked by homologous DNA). 15 Overall homology of only 1 kb is sufficient to achieve a 50 % yield of targeted transformants. Targeting may occur through homologous recombination in one arm, accompanied by non-homologous end-joining by the other arm of the vector, or by <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> 20 following two homologous recombination events. <b>Allele</b> <b>replacement</b> frequency depends on the sym-metry of the targeting vector, being proportional {{to the length of}} the shorter arm. <b>Allele</b> <b>replacement</b> may involve insertion of multiple copies of the trans- 25 forming DNA, accompanied by ectopic insertions at non-homologous sites. Single-copy and single inser-tions at targeted loci (targeted gene replacements, ‘TGR’) occur with a frequency of 7 – 20 % of all trans-formants when the minimum requirements for allele 30 replacement are met. Homologous recombination in Physcomitrella is substantially more efficient than in any multicellular eukaryote, recommending it as the outstanding model for the study of homologous recombination in plants. 3...|$|E

40|$|Fixation of {{adaptive}} mutations in populations is often constrained by pleiotropic fitness costs. The evolutionary pathways that compensate such fitness disadvantages are either {{the occurrence of}} modifier genes or replacement of the adaptive allele by less costly ones. In this context, 23 years of evolution of insecticide resistance genes in the mosquito Culex pipiens from southern France are analyzed. The {{aim of this study}} is to answer the following points. Is there a fitness cost associated with these resistance genes in natural populations? Does evolution proceed through <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> or through selection of modifiers? And finally, how do environmental changes affect the evolution of resistance genes? Samples from the same transect, crossing the boundary between an insecticide-treated and a nontreated area, are analyzed. Clinal analyses indicate a variable fitness cost among the resistance genes and show that <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> has been the primary mechanism of resistance evolution in this area. It is also shown that replacement was probably due to environmental changes corresponding to modification in pesticide-treatment intensity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Divergence of two {{independently}} evolving sequences {{that originated}} {{from a common}} ancestor can be described by two parameters, the asymptotic level of divergence E and the rate r at which this level of divergence is approached. Constant negative selection impedes <b>allele</b> <b>replacements</b> and, therefore, is routinely assumed to decelerate sequence divergence. However, its impact on E and on r has not been formally investigated. RESULTS: Strong selection that favors only one allele can make E arbitrarily small and r arbitrarily large. In contrast, {{in the case of}} 4 possible alleles and equal mutation rates, the lowest value of r, attained when two alleles confer equal fitnesses and the other two are strongly deleterious, is only two times lower than its value under selective neutrality. CONCLUSIONS: Constant selection can strongly constrain the level of sequence divergence, but cannot reduce substantially the rate at which this level is approached.

40|$|Cell-cell {{recognition}} {{is a fundamental}} process that allows cells to coordinate multicellular behaviors. Some microbes, such as myxobacteria, build multicellular fruiting bodies from free-living cells. However, how bacterial cells recognize each other by contact is poorly understood. Here we show that myxobacteria engage in recognition through interactions between TraA cell surface receptors, {{which leads to the}} fusion and exchange of outer membrane (OM) components. OM exchange is shown to be selective among 17 environmental isolates, as exchange partners parsed into five major recognition groups. TraA is the determinant of molecular specificity because: (i) exchange partners correlated with sequence conservation within its polymorphic PA 14 -like domain and (ii) traA <b>allele</b> <b>replacements</b> predictably changed partner specificity. Swapping traA alleles also reprogrammed social interactions among strains, including the regulation of motility and conferred immunity from inter-strain killing. We suggest that TraA helps guide the transition of single cells into a coherent bacterial community, by a proposed mechanism that is analogous to mitochondrial fusion and fission cycling that mixes contents to establish a homogenous population. In evolutionary terms, traA functions as a rare greenbeard gene that recognizes others that bear the same allele to confer beneficial treatment...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{traits are}} {{conditioned}} by several genetic determinants. Since such genes influence many important complex traits in various organisms, {{the identification of}} quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is of major interest, but still encounters serious difficulties. We detected four linked genes within one QTL, which participate in controlling sporulation efficiency in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Following the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms by comparing the sequences of 145 genes between the parental strains SK 1 and S 288 c, we analyzed the segregating progeny of the cross between them. Through reciprocal hemizygosity analysis, four genes, RAS 2, PMS 1, SWS 2, and FKH 2, located in a region of 60 kilobases on Chromosome 14, {{were found to be}} associated with sporulation efficiency. Three of the four "high" sporulation alleles are derived from the "low" sporulating strain. Two of these sporulation-related genes were verified through <b>allele</b> <b>replacements.</b> For RAS 2, the causative variation was suggested to be a single nucleotide difference in the upstream region of the gene. This quantitative trait nucleotide accounts for sporulation variability among a set of ten closely related winery yeast strains. Our results provide a detailed view of genetic complexity in one "QTL region" that controls a quantitative trait and reports a single nucleotide polymorphism-trait association in wild strains. Moreover, these findings have implications on QTL identification in higher eukaryotes...|$|R

In particular, interposon mutagenesis using selectable gene cartridges is frequently employed for construction {{of a variety of}} chromosomal knockout mutants. However, as the gene cartridges are often derived from antibiotic resistance-conferring genes, their numbers are limited, which restricts the construction of multiple knockout mutants. In this report, sacB— 5 -fluoroorotic acid (5 FOA) —pyrE-based bidirectional selection that facilitates construction of unmarked chromosomal knockout mutations is described. The R. capsulatus pyrE gene encoding orotate phosphoribosyl transferase, a key enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway, was used as an interposon in a genetic background that is auxotrophic for uracil (Ura−) and hence resistant to 5 FOA (5 FOAr). Although Ura+ selection readily yielded chromosomal <b>allele</b> <b>replacements</b> via homologous recombination, selection for 5 FOAr to replace pyrE with unmarked alleles was inefficient. To improve the latter step, 5 FOAr selection was combined with sucrose tolerance selection using a suicide plasmid carrying the Bacillus subtilis sacB gene encoding levansucrase that induces lethality upon exposure to 5 % (wt/vol) sucrose in the growth medium. Sucrose-tolerant, 5 FOAr colonies that were obtained carried chromosomal unmarked mutant alleles of the target gene via double crossovers between the resident pyrE-marked and incoming unmarked alleles. The effectiveness of this double selection was proven by seeking insertion and deletion alleles of helC involved in R. capsulatus cytochrome c biogenesis, which illustrated the usefulness of this system as a genetic means for facile construction of R. capsulatus unmarked chromosomal mutants...|$|R

Prior work with Campylobacter temperate bacteriophages, as well as evidence from prophages in other enteric bacteria, suggests these prophages might {{have a role in}} the biology and virulence of the organism. However, very {{little is known about the}} genetic variability of Campylobacter prophages which, if present, could lead to differential phenotypes in isolates carrying the phages versus those that do not. As a first step in the characterization of C. jejuni prophages, we investigated the distribution of prophage DNA within a C. jejuni population assessed the DNA and protein sequence variability within a subset of the putative prophages found. Results Southern blotting of C. jejuni DNA using probes from genes within the three putative prophages of the C. jejuni sequenced strain RM 1221 demonstrated the presence of at least one prophage gene in a large proportion (27 / 35) of isolates tested. Of these, 15 were positive for 5 or more of the 7 Campylobacter Mu-like phage 1 (CMLP 1, also designated Campylobacter jejuni integrated element 1, or CJIE 1) genes tested. Twelve of these putative prophages were chosen for further analysis. DNA sequencing of a 9, 000 to 11, 000 nucleotide region of each prophage demonstrated a close homology with CMLP 1 in both gene order and nucleotide sequence. Structural and sequence variability, including short insertions, deletions, and <b>allele</b> <b>replacements,</b> were found within the prophage genomes, some of which would alter the protein products of the ORFs involved. No insertions of novel genes were detected within the sequenced regions. The 12 prophages and RM 1221 had a % G+C very similar to C. jejuni sequenced strains, as well as promoter regions characteristic of C. jejuni. None of the putative prophages were successfully induced and propagated, so it is not known if they were functional or if they represented remnant prophage DNA in the bacterial chromosomes. Conclusion These putative prophages form a family of phages with conserved sequences, and appear to be adapted to Campylobacter. There was evidence for recombination among groups of prophages, suggesting that the prophages had a mosaic structure. In many of these properties, the Mu-like CMLP 1 homologs characterized in this study resemble temperate bacteriophages of enteric bacteria that are responsible for contributions to virulence and host adaptation. </p...|$|R

The island contains 21 open reading frames specifying hypothetical proteins longer than 60 amino acids including an integrase-like gene. The element is bordered by 74 -bp direct repeats at the left and right junctions, and the integration site lies adjacent to the 3 ′ end of the GMP synthase gene (gmps) in the S. aureus chromosome. SaPIbov contains a central region of sequence identity with the previously characterized tst pathogenicity island SaPI 1 (J. A. Lindsay et al., Mol. Microbiol. 29 : 527 – 543, 1998).

40|$|In iron-rich conditions, Pseudomonas aureofaciens PA 147 - 2 {{produces}} an antibiotic-like compound that inhibits {{the growth of}} a plant fungal pathogen, Aphanomyces euteiches. To contribute to the potential use of PA 147 - 2 as a biocontrol organism, we report the identification of a genetic locus important for antibiotic biosynthesis. Mutants defective for fungal inhibition (Af-) were generated by Tn 5 mutagenesis. Southern hybridization of total DNAs from three Af- mutants indicated that loss of fungal inhibition was due to a single Tn 5 insertion in each mutant. Restriction mapping of the mutation points showed that in two mutants the Tn 5 insertions were in the same 16. 0 -kb EcoRI fragment and were separated by 2. 1 kb. A genomic library of PA 147 - 2 was constructed and screened by using a region of DNA flanking the Tn 5 insertion in one mutant (PA 109) as a probe to recover complementing cosmids. Three cosmids containing a 16. 0 -kb EcoRI fragment complementary to the two mutants were recovered. <b>Allele</b> <b>replacement</b> by homologous recombination with putative complementing cosmids restored one mutant to antifungal activity against A. euteiches. Southern analysis of the complemented mutants confirmed that <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> had occurred between cosmid DNA and Tn 5. The wild-type 16. 0 -kb EcoRI fragment was cloned from the cosmid and complemented the two mutants to antifungal activity. An antifungal compound was isolated from PA 147 - 2 grown on solid medium. Antifungal activity correlated to a peak on high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Under the same growth and extraction conditions, the antifungal activity seen in PA 147 - 2 was absent in two Af- mutants. Furthermore, absence of an antifungal compound in each mutant correlated to the absence of the wild-type “antifungal” peak on high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePopulation {{surveys of}} Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus {{carried out in}} 1991 and 1999 were {{compared}} with data collected in 1990 {{before the beginning of}} the control program against this mosquito. Larval samples collected in 1999 displayed resistance to the four tested insecticides: permethrin, propoxur, temephos, and chlorpyrifos. Temepbos resistance ratio at LC 50 (RR 50) ranged between 8. 1 - and 42 -fold compared with 2. 9 - and 4. 6 -fold in 1990, and chlorpyrifos RR 50 ranged between 8. 6 - and 123 -fold compared with 6. 4 - and 19 -fold in 1990. This increased resistance to organophosphorus insecticides was associated with a sharp decrease of susceptible genotypes at two loci (Ester and ace- 1), as well as to an <b>allele</b> <b>replacement</b> at the Ester locus...|$|E
40|$|Plasmids {{with the}} aadA gene from plasmid R 100, which confers {{resistance}} to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin in Escherchia coli, can be introduced into wild-type Myxococcus xanthus, strain DK 1622, by electroporation. Recombinant M. xanthus strains with integrated plasmids carrying the aadA gene acquire resistance {{to high levels of}} these antibiotics. Selection for aadA in M. xanthus can be carried out independently of, or simultaneously with, selection for resistance to kanamycin. The kinds and frequencies of recombination events observed between integrative plasmids with aadA and the M. xanthus chromosome are similar to those observed after the transformation of yeast. Cleavage of integrative plasmid DNA at a site adjacent to a region of homology between the plasmid and the M. xanthus genome favors the targeted disruption of M. xanthus genes by <b>allele</b> <b>replacement...</b>|$|E
40|$|Replacement of Escherichia coli’s RecBCD {{function}} with phage l’s Red function generates a strain whose chromosome recombines with short linear DNA fragments at a greatly elevated rate. The rate {{is at least}} 70 -fold higher than that exhibited by a recBC sbcBC or recD strain. The value {{of the system is}} highlighted by gene replacement with a PCR-generated DNA fragment. The DrecBCD::Plac-red kan <b>replacement</b> <b>allele</b> can be P 1 transduced to other E. coli strains, making the hyper-Rec phenotype easily transferable. Gene replacement in bacteria can be achieved by a variety of techniques. One of the easiest procedures for gene manipula-tion in Escherichia coli is to place a drug resistance marker near, within, or in place of a cloned gene of interest. Linear DNA, containing the mutated or deleted gene flanked by ho-mologous regions of the chromosome, is then transformed or electroporated into recombination-proficient strains (i. e., recBC sbcBC or recD). Recombination between the bacterial chromosome and both ends of the linear DNA fragment re-sults in gene replacement (13, 19, 34, 46). The recombinant...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{carrying}} {{either a}} deletion of the murine alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lac) gene (null <b>allele)</b> or its <b>replacement</b> {{by the human}} alpha-lac gene (humanized allele) have been generated by gene targeting. Homozygous null females are alpha-lac-deficient, produce reduced amounts of thickened milk containing little or no lactose, and cannot sustain their offspring. This provides definitive evidence that alpha-lac is required for lactose synthesis and that lactose is important for milk production. Females homozygous for the humanized allele lactate normally, indicating that human alpha-lac can replace murine alpha-lac. Mouse and human alpha-lac expression was compared in mice heterozygous for the humanized allele. The human gene expressed approximately 15 -fold greater mRNA and approximately 14 -fold greater protein than the mouse, indicating that the major determinants of human alpha-lac expression are close to, or within, the human gene and that the mouse locus does not exert a negative influence on alpha-lac expression. Variations in alpha-lac expression levels in nondeficient mice did not affect milk lactose concentration, but the volume of milk increased slightly in mice homozygous for the humanized allele. These variations demonstrated that alpha-lac expression in mice is gene dosage dependent...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNeural crest {{cells and}} oligodendrocytes as the myelinating glia {{of the central}} nervous system exist only in vertebrates. Their {{development}} is regulated by complex regulatory networks, of which the SoxE-type high-mobility-group domain transcription factors Sox 8, Sox 9 and Sox 10 are essential components. Here we analyzed by in ovo electroporation in chicken and by gene replacement in the mouse whether the Drosophila ortholog Sox 100 B can functionally substitute for vertebrate SoxE proteins. Sox 100 B overexpression in the chicken neural tube led to the induction of neural crest cells as previously observed for vertebrate SoxE proteins. Furthermore, many aspects of neural crest and oligodendrocyte development were surprisingly normal in mice in which the Sox 10 coding information was replaced by Sox 100 B arguing that Sox 100 B integrates well into the gene-regulatory networks that drive these processes. Our results therefore provide strong evidence for a model in which SoxE proteins were co-opted to these gene-regulatory networks mainly through the acquisition of novel expression patterns. However, later developmental defects in several neural crest derived lineages in mice homozygous for the Sox 100 B <b>replacement</b> <b>allele</b> indicate that some degree of functional specialization and adaptation of SoxE protein properties have taken place in addition to the co-option event...|$|R
