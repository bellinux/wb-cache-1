5000|$|Tail biting is {{considered}} one of the major animal welfare problems affecting the fattening of pigs in the swine industry. This is because of the costs to treat and costs due to slower fattening to slaughter weight. There are factors to be taken into account when evaluating how tail biting affects production since they have to do with growth, feed intake, leanness and other production traits. Some of those factors are genetics, breed, gender. A study was done to determine the effects of tail biting during the entire finishing period (also known as [...] "fattening" [...] period).

A literature review pertaining to the subject, three feeding trials involving 104 swine, and a laboratory investigation {{were used in the}} study. The effects of pelleting with a new modified pellet die that produces a dense pellet; supplementation with 5 percent stabilized beef tallow or with a cellulase preparation¹; adding water to the ration at the time of feeding; soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding; the use of temperature control with mash rations, and several interactions of these methods have been evaluated. Pelleting barley rations significantly (P . 10) effect on daily feed consumption or <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains.</b> Meal rations were 7 percent bulkier than pellets, and it is suggested that the increased density of pellets is responsible for the improvement in feed conversion due to pelleting. Fat supplementation was additive with pelleting when the modified pellet die was used; together the two significantly (P . 05) changes in <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains,</b> feed consumption, or feed conversion. However, fat supplementation tended {{to improve the}} utilization of barley rations more than pelleting or cellulase supplementation. Fat additions apparently lowered cellulase activity as determined in vitro, but fat apparently was not detrimental to cellulase activity in vivo except in pelleted rations. Cellulase 4000 did not bring about any significant (P >. 10) changes in <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains,</b> feed consumption or feed efficiency although there was a slight but consistently favorable trend to do so. Carcass shrinkage was significantly (P <. 05) lower following cellulase feeding, whether the ration was soaked or dry. Backfat was significantly (P <. 05) thicker on soaked rations, but not on dry rations, when Cellulase 4000 was supplemented. The use of this enzyme apparently increases the <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> but not the feed efficiency of soaked rations, at least in the absence of temperature control. Soaking the ration 9 to 15 hours prior to feeding or simply wetting the ration at the time of feeding tended to increase the <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> and feed consumption, but lowered the efficiency of feed utilization. When temperature control was applied to the mash rations, <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> were significantly (P <. 05) improved over the controls, shrinkage losses apparently increased (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group), but the feed efficiency tended to decrease as did the backfat thickness and the iodine numbers of the backfat (P <. 05 with the "soaked" group). The laboratory study provided some evidence that Cellulase 4000 brought about reduction in cellulose, but that the pH of barley rations was not optimum for cellulase activity.

Early-weaned calves were placed on a grower ration at an average age of 134 days and on a finishing ration at 182 days of age. Normal-weaned calves were placed on a finishing ration at 242 days of age. Weight, feed intake, and ultrasound measurements were recorded during the feeding period. Three early-weaned cattle were removed due to chronic bloat, and four early-weaned cattle died in the feedlot. The feedlot period was terminated at either 358 or 387 days of age. Early-weaned cattle had greater <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> early in the feedlot period, but normal-weaned cattle had greater gains later in the feedlot period.

Nitrogen concentrations in faeces were directly related to <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> of heifers, but protein supplementation {{did not have a}} significantly positive effect on <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain.</b> The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|Scabby wheat, {{infected}} with the fungus, Fusarium graminearum and grading No. 4, replaced varying percentages of grain in a typical sorghum grain-soybean meal growing-finishing ration. Four pigs eating the control ration made an <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> of 1. 91 pounds per day and a feed efficiency of 3. 44. When 25 % of the sorghum grain was replaced by scabby wheat, <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> dropped to 1. 71 pounds per day and feed efficiency was 3. 29. Replacing 50 % of the sorghum grain with scabby wheat reduced <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> to 1. 56 pounds with a feed efficiency of 2. 99. Higher percentages of scabby wheat reduced feed intake drastically. The 25 % scabby wheat ration contained 0. 75 ppm of vomitoxin and the 50 % ration contained 2. 07 ppm (ration analysis values). All pigs eating rations containing scabby wheat appeared to drink excessive amounts of water...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} recently described MspI and VspI SNPs in interleukin- 18 gene and {{their association with}} selected performance traits (backfat thickness; lean meat content, <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> from birth, <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain</b> in test, breeding value for <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gain,</b> for lean meat content, for reproduction and total breeding value) in a population of 344 Czech Large White sows. Both SNPs were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. In this work, these polymorphisms were associated with backfat thickness and lean meat content. Animals with genotype AA (MspI SNP) had significantly (P GA (0. 83 ± 0. 02 and 61. 40 ± 0. 18, resp.). Animals with genotype AA (VspI SNP) had significantly (P GA (62. 02 ± 0. 16 and 0. 77 ± 0. 02, resp.). No association between IL- 18 polymorphisms and other performance traits was found. Our study revealed that IL- 18 could be candidate gene for backfat thickness and lean meat content in pigs...|$|E
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effect}} of lactose on performance, bone integrity and certain blood constituents in post-weaning rats and swine. The effect of lactose on calcium and phosphorus and percentage ash content of the small intestine was also determined. In both trials, <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> were not influenced by the feeding of diets containing 30 % lactose. Feed conversion was depressed in both rats and pigs when 30 % lactose was fed...|$|R
40|$|We studied how {{implanting}} {{with various}} dosages of Ralgro® during the suckling period affected {{gains in the}} growing period. Preweaning performance {{was reported in the}} 1985 Cattlemen's Day Report. All calves, regardless of suckling period treatment, received 36 mg Ralgro® {{at the start of the}} growing period. <b>Average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> during the growing period were similar for all treatments. Consequently, the added weight obtained from the suckling-period implants was still present at the end of the growing period...|$|R
40|$|Using 128 {{crossbred}} pigs with {{an average}} initial weight of 18. 3 Kg, we determined the effect that insect- and fungal-damaged sorghum {{would have on the}} pigs' performance. No differences were found in daily feed consumption for any treatment during a 28 -day feeding trial. <b>Average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> and feed efficiencies were {{similar to those of the}} control for pigs fed grain sorghum that had been damaged by lesser grain borer; red beetle; a mixture of lesser grain borer, flat grain beetle, and indian meal moth, or Aspergilas Candidus. Pigs fed grain sorghum damaged by rice weevil showed lower <b>average</b> <b>daily</b> <b>gains</b> and a higher feed-to-gain ratio than did the controls. Aspergilas Glaucus-damaged grain showed similar ADG, but a significantly poorer F/G during the first 14 days, but not during the second half of the study. Even though insect damaged grain appears to be nutritionally adequate rather significant losses of dry matter and energy are sustained when grain sorghum is allowed to go out of condition. Up to 6 % of the gross energy and approximately 5 % of the crude protein content was lost to infestation or fungal invasion...|$|R
