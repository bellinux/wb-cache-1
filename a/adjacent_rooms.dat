5|$|The game world {{consists}} {{of a number of}} rooms and passages with background scenery including a machine which stretches four conjoined babies and men being torn apart on racks. The game's rooms are filled with enemies and traps such as spiked ceilings, falling anvils and airborne spinning blades. The player character is armed with a laser gun and a jet pack which is used to fly around the game world. The laser can overheat and become inoperable for a time if not used sparingly. Scenery and surfaces can be degraded then destroyed by repeated laser fire, allowing access to <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> which would otherwise be unreachable or require a detour. The player starts each game with three lives; the game's display features a heart strength indicator which is reduced each time the player is injured. If the player loses all their heart strength, their heart stops, resulting in a lost life. Players can render themselves invisible and invincible for a limited period three times on a single life. When the player character is invisible, he can fire the laser in order to determine his current location.|$|E

25|$|René {{justified}} {{his actions}} {{by noting that}} Duchamp's theory of artists having the authority of claiming found objects as art — acknowledged by the art world via inclusion in museum collections (some on display in <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms)</b> — gave him the right to claim the ventilation grill.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{research}} with ravens {{provides an example}} of evidence for theory of mind in a non-human species. Ravens are members of the corvidae family, which is widely regarded as having high cognitive abilities. These birds have been observed to hide their food when dominant ravens are visible and audible at the same time. Based on this observation, ravens were tested for their understanding of [...] "seeing" [...] as a mental state. In a first step, the birds protected their cache when dominants were visible but not when they could only be heard from an <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b> In the next step, they had access to a small peephole which allowed them to see into the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b> With the peephole open, the ravens guarded their caches against discovery when they could hear dominants in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room,</b> even when the dominant's sounds were playbacks of recordings.|$|R

25|$|After Casolaro's {{death was}} {{reported}} by several mainstream news organizations, police re-examined Room 517. The <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> to 517 had been rented the evening of Casolaro's death— one by Mike Looney, the other by an unnamed family. No one reported hearing anything unusual either {{on the night of}} August 9 or the morning of August 10.|$|E
25|$|In United Kingdom usage, a {{building}} providing sleeping and residential quarters for {{large numbers of}} people is called a hall of residence (university students), house (members of a religious community or pupils at a boarding school), hostel (students, workers or travellers) or barracks (military personnel). In the United Kingdom, Halls of Residence almost entirely have single occupancy rooms. In the United Kingdom, halls of residence are almost always mixed sex, with residents being allocated to <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> regardless of sex.|$|E
25|$|They {{may also}} evince a more {{narrative}} character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful Bonampak murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending {{over the walls}} and vaults of three <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms,</b> show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, {{as well as a}} group of ritual impersonators {{in the midst of a}} file of musicians. At San Bartolo, murals dating from 100 BC relate to the myths of the Maya maize god and the hero twin Hunahpu, and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul. Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican Cacaxtla, murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by the Maya merchant deity.|$|E
60|$|Royal Thatcher {{glanced around}} the room, took in all its dreary {{suggestions}} in a half-weary, half-indifferent sort of way, and dropped into the lawyer's own revolving chair as that gentleman entered from the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{player can}} {{move into a}}n <b>adjacent</b> <b>room</b> or move into a new, unfurnished room. If the latter, the player enters the room number into the {{electronic}} organizer, and it then lists the furniture to put in it.|$|R

500|$|There is a sharp {{contrast}} between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the movie. [...] "We wanted an art deco stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, [...] "and {{a place that was}} falling into ruin after having seen better days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a [...] "ghost ship floating adrift, where you notice signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms.</b> Joel said: [...] "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms".|$|E
2500|$|The salon de l’œil de bœuf or [...] Antechamber of the Œil-de-Bœuf {{was formed}} in 1701 by {{combining}} two <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms,</b> the deuxième antichambre and chambre du roi. The salon de l’œil de bœuf became the main antechamber to the King’s Bedroom, which was also created that year (see next section).|$|E
2500|$|Hill met Elizabeth Pierce {{when she}} was Pierce's {{professor}} at Vassar in 1906. [...] The two women formed an intimate student/mentor relationship that developed into an intimate personal relationship which continued after Pierce left for graduate work at Columbia University.

40|$|Some {{publications}} {{describe an}} effect, produced during a physical model experiment, when an <b>adjacent</b> gas-free <b>room</b> influences the gas explosion pressure {{in a room}} with a window. The explosion pressure in this case significantly exceeds (2. 5 times) the explosion pressure in a <b>room</b> without an <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b> This result has been confirmed by our studies. Based on other available information about the influence of the ignition point location on the explosion pressure in one room, it was suggested that this could be true for an explosion in two rooms. In our studies we used a test unit with two connected chambers, each having a volume of 1. 125 m 3. It turned out that this influence of the adjacent volume was not so unambiguous as it was described in those publications. It was found out that the maximum effect of explosion pressure amplification by the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room</b> is achieved, when the igniter is located in the chamber filled with a gas-air mixture in the area between the center of the chamber and the window (maximum amplification by more than 3 times). This effect is lower directly by the window (1. 8 times) and is practically absent in case of ignition within the area near the passage connecting the chamber with the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b> This suggests that the effect discovered earlier is a special case of the general dependence of the gas explosion pressure in two chambers on the igniter location...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time as this show, two <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> were given over to 63 {{drawings}} of Venice by Donald-Smith, whose reputation had previously been for her oil paintings, particularly her portraits. Venice was a subject in vogue at the time. Donald-Smith’s work was reviewed as [...] "Without any great distinction they are very accurate and very agreeable, and any lover of Venice may spend a most pleasant half-hour amongst these pictures of the beloved city." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her first}} year at Vassar, Blegen met Ida Hill who {{was to have a}} {{profound}} influence on her life and work. Hill was a Professor in the Department of Greek and Roman Studies. The two women formed an intimate student/mentor relationship that developed into an intimate personal relationship which continued after Blegen left for graduate work at Columbia University.

2500|$|Anthony Edward Sowell {{was raised}} in East Cleveland, one of seven {{children}} born to single mother Claudia [...] "Gertude" [...] Garrison. Seven other children belonging to Sowell's sister also lived in the household, having moved in {{after the death of}} their chronically ill mother. According to Sowell's niece, Garrison subjected the siblings to physical abuse while her own children watched from <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms.</b> In one incident, Garrison forced her to strip naked {{in front of the other}} children, then whipped her with electrical cords until she bled. Sowell himself began raping his niece on an almost daily basis for two years, starting when she was eleven.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 1860s the {{predominant}} subject of instruction was classics, {{and there was}} one main schoolroom used as both the classroom and the place of preparation, under extremely noisy conditions: there were <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> used for French and mathematics.

2500|$|The Hofburg was {{enlarged}} {{and expanded}} {{in the late}} Gothic style under Emperor Maximilian I (1459–1519), and soon gained the reputation as [...] "the most beautiful building of the late Gothic period". In 1495, the palace was extended {{to the north of}} the building complex and was used as the residence of Maximilian's second wife Bianca Maria Sforza, whose dowry may have financed the work. During this phase of construction, the imperial apartments and the banquet hall were moved from the first upper floor to the second upper floor—the present location of the Giants' Hall (Riesensaal) and <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms.</b> The entrance hall was also added to the north by the drawbridge. Maximilian's court master builder at the time was Nikolaus Thüring the Elder, who also built the Goldenes Dachl. Thüring was responsible for all planning and building construction. In 1499, the remnants of the Rumer Gate, which was destroyed by fire in 1494, were converted into the Heraldic Tower by Jörg Kölderer. The Hofburg inner courtyard is depicted in two watercolor paintings by Albrecht Dürer from 1495 and 1496.|$|E
2500|$|The temple {{consisted}} of twelve rooms, {{each with a}} specific theme (e.g., the Throne Room, the King's Storeroom, the Observatory, the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, the Heart Room, etc.). The rooms connected to <b>adjacent</b> <b>rooms</b> by doorways, although some doors were locked, blocking a contestant's progress into the adjacent room; the pattern of locked and unlocked doors changed from episode to episode depending both on the temple layout and the artifact's location. The unlocked doors were closed {{at the start of}} the round, but they could be opened by completing a specific task or puzzle within each room. One room in the temple contained the themed artifact (as stated by Olmec prior to the Steps of Knowledge round). Three other designated rooms held temple guards (spotters in Lavish Mayan sentinel costumes). If the winning team had exactly [...] pendants, the remaining half pendant was also placed in a room for the contestant with the half pendant to collect to make a full pendant. The extra half pendant, if needed, would either be hanging on the wall near a door or placed inside an object in a room (e.g., hidden inside a pot in the King's Storeroom). If the first player dropped their pendant, the second player was allowed to pick it up and either throw it back to their partner or use it if needed.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{simulation}} {{programs are}} commonly {{used to calculate the}} climate and energy requirements in glazed spaces and adjacent buildings. However, these programs have usually been developed to study buildings with ordinary window sizes. Comparisons of four simulation programs were carried out for a sunspace with an <b>adjacent</b> <b>room.</b> The distribution of solar radiation between the glazed space and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>room</b> as well as the portion of short wave radiation lost to the outside were studied. The programs show very large differences. The more simple calculation methods overestimate the utilization of solar radiation. This means that the temperature in the glazed space and also cooling requirements will be overestimated. In addition, heating requirements will be underestimated. The investigation shows that simulations of glazed spaces must be based on a geometrical description of the buildings, taking into account transmission through windows, reflection and absorption...|$|R
