5000|$|In a 1960 {{article in}} American Antiquity, Rouse breaks {{classification}} of artifacts down into two forms, analytic and taxonomic, and discusses {{the goals of}} each form. The end product of <b>analytic</b> <b>classification</b> is the [...] "mode", which is produced by creating a series of classes representing different features of the artifact. Each class represents a procedure or custom followed by the maker {{during the process of}} formation. This custom or concept is the mode. Taxonomic classification is done by creating a set of classes which differentiate the artifacts in a collection by type (type being the end product of Taxonomic classification). These classes are constituted of two or more modes. Therefore, a [...] "type" [...] is made up of selected modes. Rouse notes that while modes are [...] "inherent" [...] in a collection, types are created by the archaeologist by selecting the modes which he determines to be relevant. Modes, then, are a natural unit of cultural study, whereas types are an artificial unit created by the individual archaeologist. Rouse developed his mode-attribute analysis technique, which looks at clusters of traits independently of type, as an alternate to type-variety analysis because he felt it was more sensitive to change through time.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} to autonomous learning of a multi-model system from streaming data, named ALMMo, is proposed. The proposed approach is generic and can easily be applied also to probabilistic or other types of local models forming multi-model systems. It is fully data-driven and its structure is decided by the nonparametric data clouds extracted from the empirically observed data without making any prior assumptions concerning data distribution and other data properties. All meta-parameters of the proposed system are obtained directly from the data and can be updated recursively, which improves memory- and calculation-efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The structural evolution mechanism and online data cloud quality monitoring mechanism of the ALMMo system largely enhance the ability of handling shifts and/or drifts in the streaming data pattern. Numerical examples {{of the use of}} ALMMo system for streaming data <b>analytics,</b> <b>classification</b> and prediction are presented as a proof of the proposed concept...|$|R

30|$|In {{predictive}} <b>analytics,</b> the <b>classification</b> (or discrimination) problem {{refers to}} the assignment of observations (objects, alternatives) into predefined unordered homogeneous classes (Zopounidis and Doumpos 2000; Carrizosa and Morales 2013). Supervised classification implies that the function of mapping objects described by the data into categories is constructed based on so called training instances—data with respective class labels or rules. This is realized in a two-step process of, first, building a prediction model from either known class labels or using a set of rules, and then automatically classifying new data based on this model.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAutomating {{the process}} of model {{building}} from experimental data is a very desirable goal to palliate the lack of modellers for many applications. However, despite the spectacular progress of machine learning techniques in data <b>analytics,</b> <b>classification,</b> clustering and prediction making, learning dynamical models from data time-series is still challenging. In this paper we investigate {{the use of the}} Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework of Leslie Valiant as a method for the automated discovery of influence models of biochemical processes from Boolean and stochastic traces. We show that Thomas' Boolean influence systems can be naturally represented by k-CNF formulae, and learned from time-series data with a number of Boolean activation samples per species quasi-linear in the precision of the learned model, and that positive Boolean influence systems can be represented by monotone DNF formulae and learned actively with both activation samples and oracle calls. We consider Boolean traces and Boolean abstractions of stochastic simulation traces, and study the space-time tradeoff there is between the diversity of initial states and the length of the time horizon, {{and its impact on the}} error bounds provided by the PAC learning algorithms. We evaluate the performance of this approach on a model of T-lymphocyte differentiation, with and without prior knowledge, and discuss its merits as well as its limitations with respect to realistic experiments...|$|R

40|$|The linear {{discriminant}} analysis (LDA) method is a classical and commonly utilized technique for dimensionality reduction and classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Being a first-order discriminator, LDA is usually preceded by the feature extraction of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, as multi-density EEG data are of second order. In this study, an <b>analytic</b> bilinear <b>classification</b> method which inherits and extends LDA is proposed. This method considers 2 -dimentional EEG signals as the feature input and performs classification using the optimized complex-valued bilinear projections. Without being transformed into frequency domain, the complex-valued bilinear projections essentially spatially and temporally modulate the phases and magnitudes of slow event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by distinct brain states {{in the sense that}} they become more separable. The results show that the proposed method has demonstrated its discriminating capability in the development of a rapid image triage (RIT) system, which is a challenging variant of BCIs due to the fast presentation speed and consequently overlapping of ERPs...|$|R

40|$|For {{a generic}} {{deformation}} of a two-dimensional holomorphic vector field with an elementary degenerate singular point (saddle-node) we express the Martinet- Ramis orbital <b>analytic</b> <b>classification</b> invariants of the nonperturbed field {{in terms of}} the limit transitions between the linearizing charts of singularities of the perturbed field.

We prove a generalization of this statement for higher multiplicity singularities. For a generic deformation of higher-dimensional holomorphic vector field with saddle-node singularity we show that appropriate sectorial central manifolds of the nonperturbed vector field are limits of appropriate separatrices of singularities of the perturbed field.
