50|$|The {{second example}} {{involves}} eye-specific delivery of betaxoxime, the oxime derivative of betaxolol. The administered, inactive β-amino-ketoxime {{is converted to}} the corresponding ketone via oxime hydrolase, an enzyme recently identified with preferential activity in the eye, and then stereospecifically reduced to its alcohol form. IOP-lowering activity is demonstrated without producing the active β-blockers systemically, making them void of any cardiovascular activity, a major drawback of classical <b>antiglaucoma</b> agents. Because of the advantages provided by this unique eye-targeting profile, oxime-based eye-targeting CDSs could replace the β-blockers currently used for ophthalmic applications.|$|E
40|$|Background: Long-term use of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs induces adverse {{changes on}} the conjunctival surface. Aim: To {{evaluate}} the cytological changes in the conjunctival scrape smears of patients receiving long-term <b>antiglaucoma</b> medication and their histopathological correlation. Materials and Methods: Conjunctival scrape smears {{were taken from the}} eyes of patients on long-term <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapy for over three months (n = 75), patients taking <b>antiglaucoma</b> medication for less than three months (n = 100) and from glaucomatous patients in whom trabeculectomy was done as a primary procedure. Inflammatory cell counts, fibroblasts, and the degree of metaplasia were then evaluated both cytologically and histologically. The t -test was used to determine the predictive values of these parameters for the surgical outcome of trabeculectomies. Results: Long-term use of <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapy leads to a higher stage of metaplasia with {{an increase in the number}} of fibroblasts, subepithelial collagen deposition, and inflammatory infiltrate within the substantia propria of the conjunctiva.

40|$|Purpose. The {{study was}} aimed at {{comparing}} {{the long-term effects of}} different <b>antiglaucoma</b> eye drops on conjunctival structures using laser scanning confocal microscopy. Methods. Eighty patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma and twenty healthy volunteers were included in this study. The participants were divided into 5 groups according to the different medications. The lachrymal film break-up time, Schirmer’s I test, and Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire were performed in all subjects. The confocal microscopy was used to observe the basal epithelial cell density (ECD), goblet cell density (GCD), dendritic cell density (DCD), and subepithelial collagen fiber diameter (SFD). Results. Statistically significant differences were found among the control group and the <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapy groups in the values of three clinical data (P< 0. 05). The GCD, DCD, and SFD showed significant differences in all glaucoma groups when compared to the control (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} with glaucoma have difficulty using <b>antiglaucoma</b> eye drops because of dry eye symptom. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated {{the effect of}} Korean Red Ginseng on dry eye syndrome in {{patients with}} glaucoma treated with <b>antiglaucoma</b> eye drops. Methods: Forty-nine participants were allocated to the Korean Red Ginseng (3  g/day; n =  24) or placebo (n =  25) groups for 8 weeks. Tear film stability, fluorescein corneal staining, conjunctival hyperemia, tear production, grade of meibomian gland dysfunction, and dry eye questionnaire (Ocular Surface Disease Index) were evaluated at baseline and on completion of the treatment. Results: Almost all patients displayed dry eye symptoms and signs at baseline. After the 8 -week intervention, Korean Red Ginseng supplementation significantly improved the tear film stability and total Ocular Surface Disease Index score, as compared to placebo (p <  0. 01).

A 57 -year-old woman undergoing LASIK complained of blurred vision in the right eye. After a successful trial of monovision with contact lenses, <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs (2. 5 % nipradilol) were administered topically to the right eye twice a day to establish monovision.

40|$|Based on {{the body}} of {{evidence}} implicating ocular blood flow disturbances in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, there is great interest in the investigation of the effects of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs and systemic medications on the various ocular vascular beds. The primary aim of this article was to review the current data available on the effects of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs and systemic medications on ocular blood flow. We performed a literature search in November 2002, which consisted of a textword search in MEDLINE for the years 1968 - 2002. The results of this review suggest that there is a severe lack of well-designed long-term studies investigating the effects of <b>antiglaucoma</b> and systemic medications on ocular blood flow in glaucomatous patients. However, among the 136 articles dealing with the effect of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs on ocular blood flow, only 36 (26. 5 %) investigated the effects of medications on glaucoma patients. Among these 36 articles, only 3 (8. 3 %) were long-term studies, and only 16 (44. 4 %) were double-masked, randomized, prospective trials. Among the 33 articles describing the effects of systemic medications on ocular blood flow, only 11 (33. 3 %) investigated glaucoma patients, of which only one (9. 1 %) was a double-masked, randomized, prospective trial. Based on this preliminary data, we would intimate that few <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications have the potential to directly improve ocular blood flow. Unoprostone appears to have a reproducible antiendothelin- 1 effect, betaxolol may exert a calcium-channel blocker action, apraclonidine consistently leads to anterior segment vasoconstriction, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors seem to accelerate the retinal circulation. Longitudinal, prospective, randomized trials are needed to investigate the effects of vasoactive substances with no hypotensive effect on the progression of glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Eye drops {{may contain}} {{phosphates}} {{as part of}} their buffer system. In the presence of epithelial keratopathy a high concentration of phosphate favours corneal calcification. To date European legislation does not require a quantitative declaration of the phosphates since buffers are regarded as additives. The knowledge of the phosphate concentration in medications helps to prevent corneal calcifications. Our study gives an overview on the amount of phosphate contained in <b>antiglaucoma</b> drops. METHODS: 21 samples of commercially available <b>antiglaucoma</b> drops were tested. The quantification of phosphate was performed using the molybdate method on a Modular P autoanalyzer. RESULTS: 10 of 21 (47 %) glaucoma drops had a phosphate concentration above physiological levels (> 1. 45 mmol/L). A concentration higher than 100 mmol/L was found in four preparations that contained timolol. CONCLUSIONS: Many <b>antiglaucoma</b> drops contain unphysiological levels of phosphate, very high concentrations are found in some beta-blockers. These preparations have the potential to favour the formation of insoluble crystalline calcium phosphate deposits when used on a damaged corneal surface, and should therefore be avoided...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of various <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs, including timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, dipivefrin, and pilocarpine, on cellular proliferation in cultured human corneal keratocytes. Human corneal keratocytes were cultured with RPMI- 1640 medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum. <b>Antiglaucoma</b> drugs were prepared from original concentrations to dilutions of 1 / 10, 1 / 100, and 1 / 1, 000. After exposure to drugs for 100 minutes, cellular proliferation was estimated by [3 H] thymidine uptake methodology. It was found that cellular proliferation in corneal keratocytes was inhibited by only a 1 / 10 dilution of various drugs including timolol, betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, dipivefrin, and pilocarpine. The [3 H]thymidine uptake values were significantly inhibited to 63 %, 18 %, 87 %, 68 %, 55 %, and 67 % by a 1 / 10 dilution of the above drugs.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the long-term results and complications of deep sclerectomy with collagen implant in exfoliative glaucoma (EXG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 22 eyes of 22 patients with medically uncontrolled EXG were consecutively {{included in this}} study and were followed-up prospectively. Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications, visual acuity, and slit-lamp examination were performed before and after surgery, at day 1, week 1, and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 54. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and managed accordingly. Complete success was defined as IOP ≤ 18 mm Hg without <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications and qualified success as IOP ≤ 18 mm Hg with or without <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up time of 48. 5 +/- 12. 2 months (range, 12 to 54), mean IOP was significantly reduced from 29. 9 +/- 8. 1 mm Hg preoperatively to 13. 2 +/- 3. 2 mm Hg (P< 0. 0001). Complete and qualified success rates were 54. 5 % and 90. 9 %, respectively. The mean number of <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications per patient was significantly reduced from 2. 4 +/- 0. 67 to 0. 59 +/- 0. 85 (P< 0. 0001).

Our {{aim is to}} evaluate the {{toxicity of}} <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications to CECs using an in vitro toxicity assay. Methods: Primary cultures of human (H) CECs derived from eye bank specimens were established. Following exposure of HCECs to test solutions for 10, 30, or 60 minutes, or 48 hours, we measured cell viability using a WST- 1 assay. Test solutions were diluted in culture media and included 0. 5 % Timoptol&reg;, preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 1 % Trusopt&reg;, preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, Travatan&reg;, Travatan Z&reg;, Xalatan&reg;, and benzalkonium chloride (BAK). To assess cell viability, {{the value of the}} test culture well after treatment was expressed as a percentage of that of the control well. Toxicity of each solution was compared using the cell viability score (CVS). Results: After exposure to 10 -fold dilutions of test solutions for 48 hours, HCEC viabilities were 48. 5 % for 0. 5 % Timoptol, 80. 9 % for preservative-free 0. 5 % timolol maleate, 47. 0 % for 1 % Trusopt, 71. 7 % for preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, 55. 5 % for Travatan, 88. 5 % for Travatan Z, and 52. 5 % for Xalatan. Exposure to test solutions diluted 100 -fold or more resulted in HCEC viabilities &gt; 80 %, with the exception of preservative-free 1 % dorzolamide, which resulted in a viability of 72. 0 % at a dilution of 100 -fold. Based on CVS, the order of cell viability was Travatan Z&nbsp;&ge; preservative-free timolol maleate = preservative-free dorzolamide &gt; 0. 5 % Timoptol = 1 % Trusopt &gt; Travatan&nbsp;&ge; Xalatan. Assessment of the combined effect of drug and BAK revealed that latanoprost reduced the toxicity of BAK.

40|$|Forskolin is {{the first}} {{pharmaceutical}} drug and product derived from a plant to be approved in India by the DCGI in 2006. Forskolin (7 beta-acetoxy- 8, 13 -epoxy- 1 a, 6 β, 9 a-trihydroxy-labd- 14 -en- 11 -one) is a diterpenoid isolated from plant Coleus forskohlii (Lamiaceae). It is a lipid-soluble compound that can penetrate cell membranes and stimulates the enzyme adenylate cyclase which, in turn, stimulates ciliary epithelium to activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) by reducing aqueous humor inflow. The topical application of forskolin is capable of reducing IOP in rabbits, monkeys, and humans. In its drug interactions, forskolin may act synergistically with epinephrine, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Whereas the effects of anti-clotting medications like warfarin, clopidogre, aspirin, anoxaparin, etc., may be enhanced by forskolin.

Patients and methods: In a cross-sectional study, 749 eyes from 427 patients who had used one or more <b>antiglaucoma</b> eye drops were examined at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital or related facilities. The incidence and severity of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), patient gender and age, type of glaucoma, and type of eye drops were recorded. SPK was graded according to the AD (A, area; D, density) classification. The severity score (SS) was calculated from A &times; D. Results: SPK was observed in 382 (51. 0 %) of 749 eyes that had received any type of <b>antiglaucoma</b> eye drops. While 254 eyes (33. 9 %) were classified as A 1 D 1 (SS 1), 34 eyes (4. 6 %) had severe SPK with SS 4 or more. The number of eye drops and the total dosing frequency per day were significantly greater in SPK-positive eyes than in eyes without SPK. The number of eye drops was proportional to the frequency and severity of SPK. Among eyes that were treated with three or more eye drops, SPK was more severe and more frequent in older patients (&ge; 71 years).

The study was conducted on the basis of data received from outpatients diagnosed "primary open-angle glaucoma". 49 different variants of medicine combinations, consisting of one to three <b>antiglaucoma</b> medicines in the pharmaceutical form of eye drops were prescribed to patients from the subject group. Results of the study. The eight most commonly prescribed regimens consisted primarily of first-line medicines for glaucoma pharmacotherapy. Five of eight subject regimens consisted in monotherapy and only three regimens consisted of two medicines. Also, we calculated a degree of IOP decrease in patients received the above treatment regimens compared with baseline IOP indicators, established at diagnosis stage. It was found that the most effective regimens were the ones containing Arutimol 0. 5 %, or Azopt in combination with Taflotan. The study of distribution of regimens containing <b>antiglaucoma</b> medicines, depending on the POAG stage, demonstrated that patients with a stage I disease were administered monotherapy, whilst combined regimens were used mainly for treatment of patients with stage III POAG. Conclusion. The results of the analysis allowed us to determine the most commonly prescribed regimens of <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapy, effective in reaching the target IOP, which consequently would be used for pharmacoeconomic analysi...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{evidence}} that perfusion abnormalities of the optic nerve head {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of glaucoma. There is therefore considerable interest in the effects of topical <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs on ocular blood flow. A study was undertaken to compare the ocular haemodynamic effects of dorzolamide and timolol in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Metal {{complexes}} of heterocyclic sulfonamides possessing carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitory properties {{were recently}} {{shown to be}} useful as intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering agents in experimental animals, and might be developed as a novel class of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs. Here we report the synthesis of a heterocyclic sulfonamide CA inhibitor and of the metal complexes containing main group metal ions, such a...|$|E
40|$|Biphenylic ester derivatives, {{designed}} {{by using a}} 'soft-drug' approach, proved to possess good binding properties toward cannabinoid CB(1) and CB(2) receptors and, at the same time, their metabolically labile ester portion would promote a rapid systemic inactivation.

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation(AGVI) combined with different anti-vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) agent injected before surgeries for neovascular glaucoma(NVG). METHODS:This was a retrospective case controlled study on patients with NVG in whom AGVI was performed between September 2009 and November 2013. The sample was {{divided into two groups}} according to the pretreatment:the intravitreal injection of bevacizumab or lucentis. The success rate of surgeries, intraocular pressure(IOP), the number of <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications used after surgeries, best correct visual acuity(BCVA), postoperative complications, regression and recurrence of iris neovascularization were analyzed between the groups. RESULTS:Compared with preoperative, IOP, the number of <b>antiglaucoma</b> medications used of the two groups decreased significantly at every follow-up(P P = 0. 896). There was no significant difference on the complete success rates between the two groups(P = 0. 753). CONCLUSION:Preoperative intravitreal injection of bevacizumab/ lucentis may be an effective and safe combined with AGVI on managing NVG. However, the two drugs have the similar efficacy and safety...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the various}} <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs {{including}} betaxolol, timolol, levobunolol, carteolol, brimonidine, dipivefrin, dorzolamide, brinzolamide, latanoprost, unoprostone, and pilocarpine {{were used to}} investigate the effects of cellular cytotoxicity in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells. After exposure to the drugs in three dilutions, 1 / 100, 1 / 1, 000, and 1 / 10, 000, for 100 minutes, cells were estimated based on the release assay of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme. It was found that cellular LDH was significantly released in the medium only at 1 / 100 th dilution of betaxolol, brimonidine, dorzolamide, dipivefrin, latanoprost and unoprostone to 130 %, 123 %, 145 %, 157 %, 128 % and 237 %, respectively, compared with controls upon exposure to drugs for 100 minutes. Moreover, benzalkonium chloride preservative at the concentrations ranging from 0. 001 to 0. 00001 mg/mL did not affect cellular LDH release in bovine corneal endothelial cells. These results indicate that high concentrations of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs may induce cytotoxicity in corneal endothelial cells...|$|E
40|$|Glaucoma is a {{major cause}} of {{blindness}} worldwide. Glaucomatous eyes are subjected to an accelerated aging process due to an overproduction of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) as well as its cognate receptor RAGE. Several topical <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs and relative conservative molecules, including -blockers, prostaglandin derivatives and benzalkonium chloride as preservative, are frequently used in the treatment of glaucoma. However, no data focusing on the effects of topical <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapies on the levels of AGEs exists. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether the AGEs production in the conjunctival sac fluid was influenced by topical <b>antiglaucoma</b> therapies. AGEs were measured by direct spectrofluorimetric detection in the conjunctival sac fluid of glaucoma patients, treated with different topical therapies, and controls. The fluorescent intensity was expressed in AGE Units (AGE U). The levels of AGE were higher in patients treated with -blockers with respect to both control and the prostaglandin groups (for both comparisons, P< 0. 05). Patients treated with prostaglandin had comparable levels to the controls. None difference was observed between -blockers and -blockers in association with other drugs nor between the different kinds of prostaglandin analogues. Previously, it has been observed that prostaglandins have antioxidative properties reducing the ROS production. Since the ROS and AGEs are strictly interconnected, the effect we observed here might be due to a lower ROS production which in turn affects the levels of AGEs. In conclusion, the treatment with prostaglandins can have two positive effects: lowering of the IOP and decrease the AGEs production in the conjunctival sac...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Avaliar o custo diário de colírios antiglaucomatosos e o impacto econômico relacionado com o salário mínimo; comparar o custo de associações de drogas em apresentação única em relação às mesmas em apresentações separadas; analisar o percentual adicional do custo de drogas antiglaucomatosas relacionadas à terapia padrão (maleato de timolol genérico). MÉTODOS: Utilizaram-se 15 frascos de colírios de cada um dos 20 produtos. Mediu-se o número e volume médio das gotas por frasco de colírio e calculou-se a duração e o custo diário do tratamento. RESULTADOS: Observou-se ampla variação no custo médio diário: R$ 0, 077 para o maleato de timolol genérico (mais barato) e R$ 1, 910 para o Xalacom® (mais caro). Destaca-se como produto de menor impacto econômico, em relação ao salário mínimo, o colírio padrão, representando 1, 2 % a 1, 6 % do mesmo, ao passo que a associação de Xalatan® e Timoptol XE® representou variação de 21, 7 % a 30, 0 %. O custo do Cosopt® e Xalacom® foi maior que as associações de: Trusopt® + padrão e Xalatan® + padrão (p PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the daily cost of <b>antiglaucoma</b> eyedrops {{and the economic}} impact related to the minimal wage; to compare the cost of drug association in the single presentation in relation to separate presentations; to analyze the additional percent <b>antiglaucoma</b> drug cost related to standard therapy (generic timolol maleate). METHODS: Fifteen eyedrop bottles of {{each one of the}} twenty <b>antiglaucoma</b> products were used. The number and mean eyedrop size per bottle of drug were measured and the duration and treatment costs calculated. RESULTS: A large variation in the mean daily cost, respectively: R$ 0. 077 for generic timolol maleate (cheapest) and R$ 1. 910 for Xalacom® (most expensive), was observed. It {{should be noted that the}} product of minimal economic impact, as related to the minimal wage, was the standard eyedrop therapy with 1. 2 % to 1. 6 %, while the association of Xalatan® with Timoptol XE® showed a variation of 21. 7 % to 30. 0 %. The cost of Cosopt® and Xalacom® was greater than the associations of, respectively: Trusopt® + standard eyedrop and Xalatan® + standard eyedrop (p< 0. 001). Xalacom® represented an additional cost to standard therapy of 1. 698. 2 % to 1. 765. 1 %. CONCLUSIONS: The variation of <b>antiglaucoma</b> eyedrop cost was almost 30 times between the cheapest and the most expensive, which represented an economic monthly impact of 29. 1 % on the value of the minimal wage. The combined therapy in the separate presentations presented a lower cost than drug association in a single presentation. The use of <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs represents a high percent additional cost related to standard therapy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Many ophthalmologists {{believe that}} {{long-term}} use of topically applied glaucoma medications can adversely affect results of fistulizing surgery. This presentation critically analyzes the published studies most often cited {{in support of}} this view to determine whether this conclusion is justified. Methods: Morphologic effects of long-term treatment with <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs on the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule in glaucomatous patients have been studied. The results of these studies encouraged investigators to examine the influ-ence of prior therapy on the success of trabeculectomy performed in patients with open-angle glaucoma. From this work, many have concluded that long-term use of topically applied glaucoma medications can adversely affect the results of fistulizing surgery. These results and conclusions are summarized and critically analyzed to determine whether this conclusion is justified. Results: Morphologic studies describe increased numbers of macrophages, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and mast cells in conjunctival and Tenon’s capsule specimens taken from patients receiving long-term <b>antiglaucoma</b> drugs. These findings suggest a potential for more inflammation and subsequent scarring following trabeculectomies in these patients. Efforts to confirm the clinical relevance of these histologic findings in open-angle glaucoma patients with a history of long-term <b>antiglaucoma</b> medication prior to surgery have been published. These retrospective, nonrandomized, unmasked studies of open-angle glaucoma patients include treatment groups and surgeries that are not comparable. In addition, the medical treatments within these studies do not reflect our current approaches to the medical management of open-angle glaucoma. Conclusions: At present, there is no convincing clinical evidence that long-term medical treatments influence the success of contemporary trabeculectomy surgery performed on open-angle glaucoma patients.
