5|$|Gameplay {{remained}} largely similar to Press Your Luck, with contestants accumulating cash and prizes {{and attempting to}} avoid landing on a Whammy, who took away the winnings of any contestant who landed on it. At {{the start of the}} game, each of the three contestants was spotted $1,000 and took turns taking one spin at a time on the board. After each cycle of spins, additional Whammies were added to the board replacing cash values or prizes, and contestants chose to spin <b>again</b> <b>or</b> freeze with their score at that point. Landing on a Whammy in round one reduced that contestant's score to $0 and eliminated that contestant from further play in the round. Play continued until all three contestants froze or hit a Whammy. Cash values ranged from $100–$1,500 in round one, and prizes of similar values also appeared.|$|E
5|$|In games {{subject to}} time control, a chess clock is used, {{consisting}} of two adjacent clocks and buttons to stop one clock while starting the other, such that the two component clocks never run simultaneously. The clock can be analog or digital though a digital clock is highly preferred under both USCF and FIDE rulesets. This is since most tournaments now include either a time delay (a countdown to when a clock starts <b>again)</b> <b>or</b> add (extra time being added prior or after the move) to their time controls. Before {{the start of the}} game, either the arbiter decides, or whomever is playing Black, where the chess clock is placed.|$|E
5|$|Rainie first {{appears at}} Tanya's house {{claiming}} {{that she is}} no longer using drugs but Tanya catches her attempting to inject heroin and gives her a choice—take £500 and never see Tanya or her children <b>again,</b> <b>or</b> stay the night and get help with her problems. Rainie leaves with the money without Tanya noticing but ignores the ultimatum, returning the following year. Tanya is in an emotional state, having recently split from her husband Max Branning (Jake Wood). Rainie returns the money to Tanya and says she is not using drugs, so Tanya allows her to stay but she tests positive for cannabis so Tanya asks her to leave.|$|E

5|$|She {{was badly}} damaged by a German air attack on 11 March, but {{was able to}} {{continue}} under her own power. She was damaged again in Novorossiysk by I. Gruppe, Kampfgeschwader 76 on 2 July 1942 and moved to Poti shortly afterwards. She was so severely damaged <b>again,</b> <b>or</b> sunk, by another German air attack on 16 July 1942 at Poti that she was deemed non-repairable. She was disarmed in August—September 1942, her guns forming coast defense batteries at Tuapse, and hulked. If she was sunk, she was refloated at some point and on 10 October she was towed {{to the mouth of}} the Khobi river, just north of Poti, and sunk as a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the player}} take severe damage, the screen will turn red {{and the sound}} of the character's {{heartbeat}} will increase in volume; this indicates the player's health is low. The player must find a way to stay out of fire to recover before entering battle <b>again</b> <b>or</b> else will die and restart from the last checkpoint. Health is only restored through automatic recharging when the player is not taking fire. Some attacks, such as explosions from grenades or shells, will kill the player instantly if the player is too close.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Isabella {{misses a}} meeting {{she set up}} with Rook, and does {{not return to the}} class. Through Amie texts and wall posts, the other {{students}} insinuate that she committed suicide, while the school is unable to provide Rook with any contact information for her. Class continues without her, and a little while later Arianna, if the player rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to accept or reject her again. Through Amie, Rook learns that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try <b>again</b> <b>or</b> not, which changes whether or not they get back together. Taylor jealously and unsuccessfully tries to drive a wedge between Nolan and Akira.|$|E

5|$|While Homer {{longs for}} his wife, Moe comes by the Simpsons' house to declare his {{interest}} in Marge, who turns him down. When Homer comes into the house with flowers he picked for Marge, Moe sees him and jumps out the window. Standing before her in rags, Homer professes his total and utter dependency on Marge, and she tells him {{that that is not}} a good thing, but Homer then makes his winning argument: he loves her, he needs her to love him, and can not afford to ever lose her trust <b>again</b> <b>or</b> he will end up dead. Marge is won over and allows Homer to return to the house. The family is glad that he has returned, although Moe is less than thrilled.|$|E

Mercedes is later kidnapped by Freddie and he forces her to leave the village <b>again,</b> <b>or</b> he will {{actually}} kill her.

Their happiness doesn't last however, when during a heated argument Mercedes reveals that Joe is not the father of her baby.|$|E

25|$|The Shamen were {{preceded by}} Alone <b>Again</b> <b>Or,</b> the Love-inspired name {{under which they}} {{recorded}} their first psychedelic electronic pop singles. After their name change, further singles picked up airplay from John Peel. Released in June 1987, the Shamen's first album, Drop demonstrated their love of 1960s psychedelia, with influences such as Love, Syd Barrett and the 13th Floor Elevators.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{because the}} trafficked victims {{may be in}} the U.S. illegally, they fear {{deportation}} back to their home countries. Deportation can often leave trafficked victims at the mercy of their traffickers once <b>again</b> <b>or</b> it may cause harm to their families through either punishment by the traffickers or a loss of remittances that the traffickers had been sending to the family.|$|E

25|$|Reliability {{refers to}} whether the scores are reproducible. Not all of the {{different}} types of reliability apply to the way that the CAGE is typically used. Internal consistency (whether all of the items measure the same construct) is not usually reported in studies of the CAGE; nor is inter-rater reliability (which would measure how similar peoples' responses were if the interviews were repeated <b>again,</b> <b>or</b> different raters listened to the same interview).|$|E
25|$|The opera was {{unfinished}} at {{the time}} of Puccini's death in 1924, and was completed by Franco Alfano in 1926. The first performance was held at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 25 April 1926 and conducted by Arturo Toscanini. This performance included only Puccini's music and not Alfano's additions. The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was the following night, 26 April, although it is disputed whether this was conducted by Toscanini <b>again</b> <b>or</b> by Ettore Panizza.|$|E

25|$|Lambic {{is usually}} a blend {{of at least two}} {{different}} beers; many producers are blenders who buy beer from other brewers and blend them together to create the desired result. A gueuze may have occupied space in several different cellars over six years or more. While those outside Belgium are likely to find bottled gueuze and fruited versions, a wider variety of styles is available to local drinkers. Beers are often blended <b>again</b> <b>or</b> sweetened with sugar or flavoured syrups before drinking as some can be extremely tart.|$|E
