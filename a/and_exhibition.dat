40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{displays}} <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions</b> in university libraries. It was conducted by questionnaire survey on six theses: Frequency and purpose, Staffing, Funding, Space and safeguards, Subjects, materials and sources, and Marketing. The results reveal that most libraries held displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions</b> <b>and</b> thought displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions</b> as marketing <b>and</b> educational ser-vices to patrons. But supporting resources such as staffing, funding, space, security, and facilities were informal and scant. To improve the displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> this paper suggests that libraries should pay more resources and concerns on displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions</b> to achieve the marketing and educational goal. Besides, librarians play important roles in displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions.</b> To plan a professional and successful displays <b>and</b> <b>exhibitions,</b> librarians need more support on training, display knowledge and credits...|$|R

5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA <b>and</b> <b>Exhibition</b> Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA <b>and</b> <b>Exhibition</b> Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he would not comment on its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E
