5|$|Immediately {{following}} their {{declaration of war}} on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the British War Cabinet began to consider the future of Palestine. By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached <b>a</b> <b>stalemate,</b> with two of Britain's Allies and Associated Powers not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were distracted by internal upheaval. <b>A</b> <b>stalemate</b> in southern Palestine was broken by the Battle of Beersheba on 31 October 1917.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the next}} two decades, the western reaches of Mysore {{remained}} vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>stalemated</b> player thereby at once wins.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>stalemated</b> king {{can take}} one of the enemy pieces that would check the king if the king moves.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stalemate</b> was <b>a</b> win for <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> player. This rule {{appeared}} {{again in}} some medieval chess variations in England c. 1600. According to some sources, {{there was no}} stalemate, though this is improbable.|$|R
5|$|If {{the player}} to move has no legal move, {{the game is}} over; it is either a checkmate (a loss for the player with no legal moves) if the king is under attack, or <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> (a draw) if the king is not.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{flanking}} maneuver {{was successfully}} deflected and the Battle of Chantilly was fought to <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b> But the 21st had suffered severely with 35 percent casualties (38 killed, 76 wounded, 26 missing).|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1982, Ford {{offered an}} {{endorsement}} of President Reagan's economic policies while also stating the possibility of Reagan being met with <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> by Congress if not willing to compromise while in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Reshevsky also {{fell into}} <b>a</b> <b>stalemating</b> trap against [...] in the Zürich 1953 Candidates Tournament. After 53... Rf3+! (diagram) 54.Kxf3 would be stalemate. If 54.Kg2, then 54...Rxg3+! winning a crucial pawn; again, White {{could not take}} the rook without {{resulting}} in stalemate.|$|R

25|$|Two knights and <b>a</b> king can <b>stalemate</b> <b>a</b> lone king , so that ending {{would no}} longer be a draw (see Two knights endgame).|$|R
5|$|The Frankish {{invasion}} of Croatia, {{the destruction of}} Tarsatica, the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor, and negotiations from 802–815 between the Franks and Byzantines led to <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b> The Dalmatian Croatia consequently peacefully accepted a limited Frankish overlordship.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflicts}} in Georgia remained at <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> until 2004, when Mikheil Saakashvili {{came to power}} after Georgia's Rose Revolution, which ousted president Eduard Shevardnadze. Restoring South Ossetia and Abkhazia to Georgian control was a top-priority of Saakashvili's.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{automatically}} a draw if the player to move {{is not in}} check but has no legal move. This situation is called <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b> An {{example of such a}} position is shown in the adjacent diagram.|$|E
25|$|A curious {{ending of}} two rooks against three rooks {{occurred}} in a game between Paul Lamford and Gile Andruet from a match Wales versus France in 1980. This proved an easy win for the three rooks. Andruet had earlier been forced to underpromote to a rook to avoid <b>a</b> <b>stalemating</b> defence for Lamford.|$|R
50|$|During Truman's last year, the Council and the Senior Staff met less {{frequently}} and NSC activity abated. Much interdepartmental planning on the NSC books was never {{completed by the}} end of the Truman administration. During this period, the NSC reflected Truman's sense of frustration as a lame-duck President caught in <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> war.|$|R

5|$|In June 1717, Cosimo {{declared}} his {{wish that the}} House of Este should succeed the Electress. Charles VI had previously offered the Grand Duke territorial compensation—in {{the form of the}} State of Presidi—if he chose quickly, but reneged. In 1718, Charles VI repudiated Cosimo's decision, declaring a union of Tuscany and Modena (the Este lands) unacceptable. Hereafter, <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> existed between them.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, Philadelphia {{traveled}} to MLS side FC Dallas for the semifinal. Amobi Okugo scored a {{goal in the}} first half before Dallas equalized. The match went to kicks as regulation and extra time resulted in <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b> Goalkeeper Zac MacMath made diving saves of two Dallas attempts in the shoot-out to clinch the Union's place in the final—the closest the team had been to winning a trophy in its five-year history.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained <b>a</b> <b>stalemate,</b> and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.|$|E
2500|$|In Losing chess, {{stalemate}} is {{not necessarily}} a draw [...] Depending on the variant, <b>stalemate</b> can be <b>a</b> draw, or a win for either the player with fewer pieces (a draw results if the players have the same number of pieces) or for the stalemated player. In xiangqi and shogi, <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> player loses, although in shogi stalemate essentially does not occur.|$|R
2500|$|Under some circumstances, two knights and a king {{can force}} checkmate against a king and pawn (or rarely more pawns). The winning plan, quite {{difficult}} to execute in practice, is to blockade the enemy pawn(s) {{with one of}} the knights, maneuver the enemy king into <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> position, then bring the other knight over to checkmate. (See two knights endgame.) ...|$|R

5|$|At about 04:30 on May 18, the Syrian 1st Brigade, now {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Husni al-Za'im and consisting of about 30 vehicles, including tanks, advanced west towards Samakh (Tzemah) in two columns—one across the coast, and another flanking from the south. A contingent was allocated further south, {{in order to}} secure the safety of the main force by flanking Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada from the west. It entered <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> with a new Israeli position northwest of the two villages.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{violence}} {{had broken}} out between the two sides; {{less than three months}} after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted. The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b> The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry III as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{implies that}} this {{occurred}} {{more or less}} directly after Labraunda, {{but it has also}} been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created <b>a</b> <b>stalemate</b> in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E

25|$|A bishop pawn {{may also}} draw, {{but for a}} {{different}} reason (<b>a</b> different <b>stalemate</b> position).|$|R
5000|$|Really Bad Chess {{is played}} using a normal chess board, but with each player given one king and 15 other pieces {{selected}} at random {{based on the}} player's skill level. The pieces, moves, and goal are {{identical to the original}} game. Because of the rearranged pieces, players cannot use typical chess opening moves. Unlike in chess, in Really Bad Chess <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> player is considered to have lost the game.|$|R
5|$|In early 1861, Norfolk voters {{instructed}} their {{delegate to}} vote for secession. Virginia voted to secede from the Union. In the spring of 1862, the Battle of Hampton Roads took place off the northwest shore of the city's Sewell's Point Peninsula, marking the first fight between two ironclads, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia. The battle ended in <b>a</b> <b>stalemate,</b> but {{changed the course of}} naval warfare; from then on, warships were fortified with metal.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those that had lost lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. Backed by the pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a drawn-out struggle, and the war soon entered <b>a</b> <b>stalemate.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, {{and then the}} 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, {{as part of the}} Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into <b>a</b> <b>stalemate,</b> with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become stuck in the sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944.|$|E
50|$|On 24 February 1917, the German army made a {{strategic}} scorched-earth {{withdrawal from the}} Somme battlefield to the prepared fortifications of the Hindenburg Line, thereby shortening the front line they had to occupy. Since a scorched-earth campaign requires {{that there be a}} war of movement, World War I provided little opportunity in general for this policy as it was <b>a</b> <b>stalemated</b> war fought mostly in the same concentrated area for its entire duration.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>stalemate</b> set in, Weir {{continued}} to command his battalion throughout {{the early stages}} of the campaign until 25 August, when he was appointed acting brigadier general and placed in command of the 3rd Brigade. On 11 September, he became ill and was evacuated to Malta, where he was admitted to hospital. He was subsequently evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he convalesced until January 1916, when he was appointed commandant of the Australian reinforcement camp at Weymouth, Dorset.|$|R
5000|$|I'd say Poulsen's biggest accomplishment, though, was the Legislature's {{bipartisan}} deal in 2006 {{to rework}} how water disputes are handled on the Columbia and lower Snake rivers. The Legislature {{had been unable}} to deal with water legislation {{for more than a decade}} — with Democrats and Republicans lining up behind environmentalists and farmers in <b>a</b> long-standing <b>stalemate.</b> <b>As</b> Craig Welch reported last year: ...|$|R
