5|$|Discussions about patrols {{remained}} complicated. Britain and France {{offered to}} replace Germany <b>and</b> <b>Italy</b> in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols {{would be too}} partial. Germany <b>and</b> <b>Italy</b> requested that land controls be kept, and belligerent rights {{be given to the}} Nationalists, so that rights of search could be used by both the Republicans and Nationalists to replace naval patrols. The French considered abandoning border controls, or perhaps leaving non-intervention. However, the French were reliant on the British, who wished to continue with patrols. Britain and France thus continued to labour over non-intervention; whilst they judged it effective, some 42 ships were estimated to have escaped inspection between April and the end of July. The air route had not been covered. The Nationalists' debt to Germany reached 150 million Reichmarks. On 9 July, the Dutch Ambassador suggested that Britain draft a compromise. Lord Plymouth did, called the 'compromise plan for the control of non-intervention'. Naval patrols would be replaced by observers in ports and ships, land control measures would be resumed. Belligerent rights would only be granted when substantial progress was made on volunteer withdrawal. The French were furious, considering that Britain was moving towards Germany <b>and</b> <b>Italy.</b> Grandi demanded the discussion of belligerent rights before volunteer rights; Maisky insisted that volunteers be discussed first.|$|E
