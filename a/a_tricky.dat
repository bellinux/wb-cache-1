5|$|Benny was <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> {{one because}} he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
5|$|Purebred rough collie Lad and his owners, Stephen (Peter Breck) and Elizabeth Tremayne (Peggy McCay), are {{visited by}} their wealthy {{neighbor}} Hamilcar Q. Glure (Carroll O'Connor) and his 8-year-old daughter Angela (Angela Cartwright), who is crippled from polio. While Lad befriends the girl, Glure invites the Tremaynes {{to show the}} prize-winning Lad at his upcoming dog show. However, Glure is jealous of Lad's success and has rigged one event to have such specialized rules that he believes only his recently purchased high-priced, English-trained collie can win. During the competition, which involves directing the dogs through <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> set of a maneuvers, Lad is able to complete the course, while Glure's champion does not recognize the hand signals Glure makes while holding a cigar.|$|E

50|$|The Basic Trainer first flew in May 1950. Testing {{showed it}} to be <b>a</b> <b>trickier</b> and less {{forgiving}} aircraft than the rival Percival P.56. Although Handley Page were confident that the H.P.R.2 could be improved, the Air Ministry elected to order the P.56 into production as the Provost. Two prototypes (WE496 c/n HPR.142 and WE505 c/n HPR.143) were built and flown but no orders resulted.|$|R

25|$|His son and grandson, {{both of whom}} {{carried the}} same name, were consuls, the son in 4 B.C. under Augustus, toward whom the father had {{demonstrated}} consistent loyalty. The grandson held the office under Tiberius and continued his political career as a Roman governor under Caligula, but maintaining loyalty had become <b>a</b> <b>trickier</b> matter: he and his wife, a Cornelia, were accused of conspiring against the emperor and committed suicide.|$|R

25|$|Democrats {{recognized}} the black {{majority in the}} state and realized that the only way for them to win the election was through violent suppression of black voters or intimidating black voters to vote Democratic. This was <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> problem for the party because they were known for upholding slavery and introducing the black codes. Furthermore, it angered many blacks that a former slave trader, Joe Crews, was elected as a Republican to the General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|However, South Africa were bowled out {{for just}} 247, and Michael Vaughan quickly {{enforced}} the follow on late on day 3.

In fact, Smith was almost dismissed by Pietersen twice during this spell, something {{he would have been}} very relieved to avoid, not just due to the match situation, but also {{as a result of the}} rivalry between the two players.|$|E

25|$|The queen was in <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> situation, because {{political}} discourse {{was dominated by}} {{the issue of the}} succession to the throne, just as her most illustrious military commanders were being frustrated by O'Neill {{in the middle of the}} Anglo-Spanish War. Tyronel continued to concert measures with the Irish leaders in Munster, and issued a manifesto to the Catholics of Ireland, summoning them to join his standard as he protested that the interests of religion were his first care. After a campaign in Munster in January 1600, during which the English Plantation of Munster was destroyed, he hastened north to Donegal, where he received supplies from Spain and a token of encouragement from Pope Clement VIII. At this point the controversial Jesuit, James Archer, was effectively operating as his representative at the Spanish court.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December, Arsenal {{played at}} home with <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> 1–0 win against Southampton, decided by a 89th minute Alexis Sánchez finish, his 13th goal in total for the club. Three days later, Arsenal played against Stoke City {{away from home and}} lost 3–2. Peter Crouch gave Stoke the lead after only 19 seconds of the match, Bojan doubled Stoke's lead and Jon Walters added a third before half time. Arsenal came back in the second half. Santi Cazorla scored from a penalty and Aaron Ramsey volleying in from a Santi Cazorla corner. Calum Chambers was sent off after getting a second yellow card and with ten men, Arsenal could not find an equalizer. Fans took their frustrations out on the team in a local subway, with several fans berating manager Arsene Wenger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} session of the final O'Sullivan won the first frame with a break of 86. The next two frames were shared, before O'Sullivan made a century, which he {{followed}} with a 72 in the frame after. The sixth frame had lasted 36 minutes, when O’Sullivan stroked in the pink to a distant balk pocket before clipping in <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> black for 5–1 lead. McCulloch won the next to bring the score to 5–2 in O'Sullivan's favour {{at the end of}} {{the first session}}. In the second session O'Sullivan took the first two with breaks of 66 and 104. O'Sullivan won two of the next three to bring the score to 8–4, before missing a relatively straightforward pot in the 13th, which allowed McCulloch to take the frame. A break of 71 in the next gave O'Sullivan the victory.|$|E

25|$|March {{started with}} the newly crowned League Cup winners visiting St Andrew's. It {{was not to be}} Tottenham's day, however, as the Blues emphatically won 4–1. A Forssell hat-trick and a free kick from Larsson saw the Blues lead 4–0 before a late Jermaine Jenas goal in second half injury time saw Maik Taylor fail to get his clean sheet. Next up for the Blues was <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> away tie to another team going well in a {{domestic}} cup. Portsmouth, who had just qualified for the semi-final of the FA Cup, went into an early two-goal lead thanks to Jermain Defoe, before goals from Fabrice Muamba and another Larsson free kick saw Blues complete a first-half comeback. Second-half goals from Hermann Hreiðarsson and Nwankwo Kanu saw the Blues fail to get anything from the south coast.|$|E
25|$|The {{fixtures}} postponed due to Piermario Morosini's death {{were played}} mid-week {{in the last}} full week of April and Parma were up against <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> trip to Sicily to play Palermo. Abel Hernández got the first goal with a header at the back post after he was found by Andrea Mantovani in the sixth minute. Palermo had the better {{of the first half}} and deserved their lead, but it was Parma who started the second half better and Giovinco's fine run and shot was parried into Stefano Okaka's path and the striker made no mistake to level with his head. With 20 minutes to go, Giovinco again did some good work and then found Jonathan Biabiany free in the area. The Frenchman steered the ball into the Palermo net to give the away side the lead. This left Parma 9 points clear of relegation with 4 games to go.|$|E
25|$|However, in sunny {{conditions}} {{and on a}} good batting track, India found the going very easy. Admittedly Dabengwa dropped a hard catch off Virender Sehwag on 5, and Sehwag made the Zimbabweans pay, pounding six fours and one six in a 44 before Mahwire found a way through his defences at the stroke of lunch. India had added 88 for the first wicket, however, and although Gautam Gambhir departed for 46 shortly after lunch, the foundation was laid down. Rahul Dravid was back to his form from before the one-day series, and VVS Laxman also survived <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> period to hit his eighth Test century. Mahwire added yet another wicket to his tally, as he lured Dravid into an edge that fell into Brendan Taylor's hands, but Laxman pounded Zimbabwe's bowlers in the evening session, giving them a relatively comfortable lead of 46 runs at stumps on day two.|$|E

25|$|On 26 March the 1/4th Northamptons {{were ordered}} to entrench a {{position}} on the Gaza road to cover the mounted troops during the First Battle of Gaza. However, at midnight they were informed that the action had been broken off and they were in danger of being cut off. After <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> withdrawal, the battalion rejoined the rest of 162nd Bde. For the Second Battle of Gaza on 17 April, the battalion supported 1/5th Bedfordshire Regiment and 1/11th London Regiment. Two days later the Northamptons took over the lead, advancing towards the Beersheba road against strongly entrenched Turkish troops. The battalion reached but could not enter the trenches, and by 16.30 about 80 per cent of the leading companies had been become casualties and they were pinned down. The survivors withdrew after nightfall, having suffered 10 officers and 366 other ranks killed, wounded and missing.|$|E
25|$|Jaffer and Dravid began India's innings by {{successfully}} negotiating <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> {{period of}} three overs prior to lunch. They did not score any runs in this period. Lee was controlled and bowled two short balls at Jaffer before trapping {{him with a}} low, swinging, yorker. Replays revealed that Lee had bowled a no ball by overstepping the bowling mark, but the umpire did not gave it a no ball so first Indian wicket fell to poor umpiring. India were now 1/8. Laxman and Dravid consolidated {{the fall of the}} early wicket and batted steadily, although Dravid survived a catch from another no ball, this time from Johnson. Dravid was defensive while Laxman wristily pushed the ball to the cover and midwicket boundaries. At the end of the 15th over, a Johnson over that went for 19 runs, India were 1/69 and Laxman was on 45 from only 31 balls.|$|E
25|$|Harmison and Collingwood {{continued}} {{in the style of}} the first innings, although this time it was the real pace bowler who took the most wicket. On the afternoon of the second day, he again took both openers - including England opener Marcus Trescothick, and when Ian Blackwell (87) and Andrew Caddick threatened to run away with it with their partnership of 78 for the last wicket, it was Harmison who got Blackwell out, caught by Liam Plunkett. Durham were set <b>a</b> <b>tricky</b> target of 243, but the Jamaican-born all-rounder Gareth Breese saw off the challenge of Caddick, who took yet another six-for - this time for 98 - to end with match figures of 12 for 104. However, he was the only bowler to dig in, and Michael Hussey (51), Dale Benkenstein (51) and the aforementioned Breese with 79 not out saw Durham reach the target to preserve their unbeaten run in the Championship.|$|E
