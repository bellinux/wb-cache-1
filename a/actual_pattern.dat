The original [...] "Scorpion" [...] pattern was developed at United States Army Soldier Systems Center by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan in 2010. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named [...] "Scorpion W2", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the <b>actual</b> <b>pattern</b> is [...] "not that relevant." [...] The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements. On 31 July 2014, the Army formally {{announced that}} the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015. The official name is intended to emphasize its use beyond Afghanistan to all combatant commands, with a family of versions including a dark jungle-woodland variant and a lighter pattern for deserts to follow. The UCP pattern is planned to be fully replaced by the OCP on the ACU by 1 October 2019.

40|$|This article {{reflects}} on and reinterprets South Africa’s documented human rights-inspired language policy and Zimbabwe’s assimilation�tolerance approach to language use.

The article spotlights the ceremonial ‘official language’ status of South Africa’s nine African languages and the ‘national language’ status of the Ndebele language in Zimbabwe.

Therefore, {{as well as being}} firmly located and resident in political statements of the ruling elites, language policy ideologies are also hidden in the fissures and faultlines of official documents.

Other ancient sources include Pliny (not from personal experience, but he collected other reports), Pausanias, Tacitus, Philostratus and Juvenal. In addition, the base of the statue is inscribed with about 90 surviving inscriptions of contemporary tourists reporting whether they had heard the sound or not.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, {{studies of}} human {{variation}} {{focused more on}} <b>actual</b> <b>patterns</b> of variation and evolutionary patterns among populations and less about classification.

40|$|In this Clinical Practice Development project {{we set out}} to {{identify}} and describe current approaches to the management and delivery of nursing care in an Australian Metropolitan Teaching Hospital. Using a simple descriptive design, data were collected to elicit patterns of care provided by nursing teams. We sought to demonstrate patterns described by nursing teams (interviews) and <b>actual</b> <b>patterns</b> of care (observation). As expected there was a degree of incongruence between the espoused and <b>actual</b> <b>patterns</b> of care. Interview data revealed that most study wards had a view of nursing that emphasizes meeting the total care needs of patients and their families through offering biopsychosocial and educative care. The observational data revealed that a relatively large proportion of time was expended on actitivies that were not regarded as important by staff when interviewed (eg documentation) while relatively small amounts of time were observed to be spent educating patients or communicating with relatives of patients. The identification of this type of gap creates a dissonance in clinicians {{that can be used to}} stimulate change through PD.

50|$|Certain cenotes {{contain a}} large number of human remains, {{including}} both males and females, and young children/infants. According to archaeologist Guillermo de Anda of the University of Yucatán, evidence from Mayan mythology suggests that many young victims (most aged 6 to 12) whose gender is indeterminate were male. While the classical images of a female Mayan sacrifice being flung alive to drown in a cenote are pervasive, Guillermo de Anda's writings on the subject suggest that most sacrificial victims — juveniles who were either purchased or captured while their parents were working in the fields, warriors captured in battle, or elites captured during conflicts with neighboring clans — were usually (though not always) killed prior to being thrown into the cenote, and in many cases, dozens of miles from the cenotes in which their bodies were eventually deposited. He also notes that only a certain set of cenotes was used in this way, while others were reserved for domestic purposes (de Anda 2007). This suggests that Mayan religious officiants believed that only certain cenotes led to the underworld, and sacrifices placed in others would serve no purpose. It also suggests that the status of the victim as alive or dead was unimportant. The occasional appearance of human remains in non-sacrificial cenotes can be attributed to rare errors in judgement {{on the part of the}} shaman. The <b>actual</b> <b>pattern</b> by which a particular victim's remains became interred in which cenotes remains an subject of conjecture.|$|E
