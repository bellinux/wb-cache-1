Though Kepler took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested {{in the work of}} many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

Rabbi Wasserman made an impression on many young Jews that he met while in the United States. Rabbi Wasserman returned to Poland although he knew his life was in danger by returning. This was partly because he did not want to abandon his students, and partly because he took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> American Jewry. In 1939, just before the Nazi invasion, he even forbade his students from accepting visas to the United States to study at Yeshiva University and what is now the Hebrew Theological College due to what he perceived as a spiritually dangerous atmosphere in these two institutions.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{policy of}} keeping anti-drug {{laws on the}} books while {{limiting}} enforcement of certain offenses is carefully designed to reduce harm while still complying with the letter of international drug control treaties. This is necessary in order to avoid criticism from the International Narcotics Board, which historically has taken <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> any moves to relax official drug policy. In their annual report, the Board has criticised many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis, Australia for providing injecting rooms and the United Kingdom for proposing to downgrade the classification of cannabis, which it has since done (although this change was reversed by the Home Secretary on 7 May 2008 against the advice of its own commissioned report).|$|E

A few months later, he followed the university as it was evacuated into Transylvania, involving himself in the recruitment of new staff, and being instrumental in the election of Vianu's pupil Alexandru Dima.

25|$|It {{was only}} in the early 20th century (post World War I) that slavery {{gradually}} became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France. Gordon describes the lack of homegrown Islamic abolition movements as owing much {{to the fact that it}} was deeply anchored in Islamic law. By legitimizing slavery and – by extension – traffic in slaves, Islam elevated those practices to an unassailable moral plane. As a result, in no part of the Muslim world was an ideological challenge ever mounted against slavery. The political and social system in Muslim society would have taken <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> such a challenge. Some Muslim leaders, like Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah did ban slavery, but they had little influence in the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|This was in {{part due}} to the German belief that the Soviets had {{insufficient}} fuel supplies, particularly oil, which would undermine Soviet armaments production. The energy resources (30 percent in the Ural-Volga region, 27 percent in Soviet Asia, and 43 percent in the Caucasus) were used to complete an enormous mechanisation program. The populations' use of fuels for lighting and general civilian needs, caused OKL to assume that the Red Army and VVS could only meet peacetime fuel allocations through restrictions. It was believed that this difficulty would continue for some time. German intelligence also had <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Soviet logistical capabilities. It viewed the Soviet road and rail networks as incomplete, thus the supply of aviation fuel to the VVS on the frontline would be poor and would curtail Soviet air operations. It was also thought that the bulk of Soviet industry lay west of the Urals, and was thus vulnerable to capture anyway. Although aware that the Soviet Union intended to move 40 to 50 percent of its industry east of the Urals to continue production, the Germans viewed this plan as impossible to carry out. The Luftwaffe also vastly underestimated the Soviet ability to improvise.|$|E

500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, [...] film soundtracks were often bootlegged; if the officially {{released}} soundtrack had been re-recorded with a house orchestra, {{there would be}} demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland performing Annie Get Your Gun, before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded. The Recording Industry Association of America took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production. The Wagern-Nichols Home Recordist Guild recorded numerous performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the American Broadcasting Company and Columbia Records (who held the official rights to the recordings), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record.|$|E

[...] As young adults in Paris they shared an apartment at 4, rue Chalgrin. Later they each had their own place in Neuilly. [...] Barney frequently solicited Palmer's help in her romantic pursuits of other women, namely Pauline Tarn.

5|$|In early 1903, Harding {{announced}} he would run for Governor of Ohio, prompted by {{the withdrawal of the}} leading candidate, Congressman Charles Dick. Hanna and George Cox felt that Harding was not electable due to his work with Foraker—as the Progressive Era commenced, the public was starting to take <b>a</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the trading of political favors and of bosses such as Cox. Accordingly, they persuaded Cleveland banker Myron T. Herrick, a friend of McKinley's, to run. Herrick was also better-placed to take votes away from the likely Democratic candidate, reforming Cleveland Mayor Tom L. Johnson. With little chance at the gubernatorial nomination, Harding sought nomination as lieutenant governor, and both Herrick and Harding were nominated by acclamation. Foraker and Hanna (who died of typhoid fever in February 1904) both campaigned for what was dubbed the Four-H ticket. Herrick and Harding won by overwhelming margins.|$|R

[...] The A was held to a figure of less than 1% for both, and even this requirement was met in an unusual manner: Clarke brought his personal account into overdraft to issue a $50,000 cheque to the company, thereby allowing the latter to meet its capital requirements and commence operations. [...] The company then authorized a payment of the same amount to Clarke on account of expenses incurred by him {{on behalf of the}} company; he used this payment to clear his overdraft.|$|E
500|$|Jerome {{otherwise}} had <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Arabs. His prejudices {{were those}} of a native Roman. Born in Strido (in modern Croatia or Slovenia), near Aquileia, and educated in Rome, Jerome was a lover of Latin, Italy, {{and the city of}} Rome. In about 374, he found himself accused in a dream while in Antioch on the way to Palestine: [...] "Ciceronianus es, non Christianus", [...] "you are a Ciceronian, not a Christian". In one of his letters, written while he was staying in the desert of Chalcis, he tells of the joy he had when he discovered that his correspondents had written a letter to him in Latin. All he had to hear during the day were the [...] "barbarous" [...] languages of the natives (that is, Syriac and Arabic). From this evidence, Shahîd concludes that Jerome would not honor the memory of an Arab emperor without a strong rationale.|$|E
500|$|Over 13,000 men {{marched into}} Northern Virginia on the 24th, {{bringing}} with them [...] "a long train of wagons filled with wheelbarrows, shovels, [...] " [...] These implements {{were put to}} work even as thousands of men marched further into Virginia.

By sunrise on the morning of the 24th, ground had already been broken on the first two forts comprising the Civil War defenses of Washington— Fort Runyon and Fort Corcoran. Fort Corcoran was named after Colonel Michael Corcoran, commander of the 69th New York Volunteer Regiment, one of the units that constructed the fort. The 69th New York, part of the famed Irish Brigade, went about its work with high spirits, exemplified by the actions of Father Thomas Mooney, the 69th's chaplain. After the fort's cannon were emplaced, Mooney baptized them and was promptly recalled by New York's bishop, who took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the sacrilegious action.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} Forbes {{was faced with}} a choice of routes. He could cut a new road {{directly}} across western Pennsylvania, or he could go south and pick up Braddock's route. Washington extensively lobbied Forbes and other British officers to use Braddock's route, which would have been more advantageous to Virginia interests. [...] Forbes and others took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> this activity, suspecting personal and provincial financial motivation. In response to a letter in which Washington bemoaned [...] "our Enterprize [...] Ruind", and blamed Colonel Henry Bouquet for his advocacy of the Pennsylvania route, Forbes angrily wrote, [...] "I am now at the bottom, of their Scheme against this new road" [...] and chastized Washington, writing that his heavy-handed advocacy [...] "was a shame for any officer to be Concerned in." [...] Forbes ultimately chose the Pennsylvania route for pragmatic military reasons: the army, was expected to occupy and hold Fort Duquesne, and would require a reliable supply route, and the Pennsylvania route was superior for this purpose. [...] However, as the expedition pushed west and Forbes learned that the last ridge to cross would prove particularly difficult, he granted that Washington and other advocates of the Virginia route may have been correct in their assessment of the chosen route's problems.|$|E
500|$|A {{majority}} of the ice hockey matches took place at Jordal Amfi, a new hockey stadium built for the Olympics. [...] Nine teams played in the tournament and Canada again won the gold medal. [...] Canada had won all but one Olympic hockey tournament thus far, but in 1956 the Soviet team began to compete and ended Canadian dominance. Canada was represented by the Edmonton Mercurys, an amateur hockey team sponsored by {{the owner of a}} Mercury automobile dealership. Canada played the United States to a three all tie on the final day to clinch the Gold, and assure the Americans of Silver. [...] Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet criticized the result, calling the game, [...] "fixed in advance."

500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E
