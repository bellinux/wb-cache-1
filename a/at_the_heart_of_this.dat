25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger {{that is at the}} heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E
500|$|The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a [...] "fantaisie lyrique" [...] to a {{libretto}} by Colette. She and Ravel {{had planned}} {{the story as}} a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole, and the jazz elements and bitonality {{of much of the}} work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds [...] "profoundly serious feeling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> vivid and entertaining work". The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, [...] "extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout".|$|E

500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There {{is simply too}} much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't keep you in the club unless someone else is paying for the drinks." ...|$|E
500|$|Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said {{he enjoyed}} the episode, and {{although}} it does not contain the [...] "usual amount" [...] of The Simpsons humor, the [...] "rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings. However, anyone allergic to country music should give this one a pass!" [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured [...] "one of the best" [...] parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: [...] "While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone , with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven. Homer's sheepish response to Lurlene's advances shows just what a decent, family loving man he is." [...] A reviewer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the episode [...] "heartwarming", and commented that The Simpsons [...] "once again shows that <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> crazy family there is an abiding love." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said [...] "it's a pretty impossible question for a die-hard fan, but if I were forced at gunpoint to name my favorite episode ever, 'Colonel Homer' {{would probably be the}} first to leap to mind, if only for the pure joy that is 'Bagged Me a Homer'." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{scene is}} Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes {{the sources of}} his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, {{or at least that}} Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

Eventually, Jersey City had one patrolman for every 3,000 residents, causing a marked decline in the city's once-astronomical crime rate.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike pre-Islamic Arabian society, the Qur'anic idea of {{economic}} circulation as {{a return of}} goods and obligations was for everyone, whether donors and recipients know each other or not, in which goods move, and society does what {{it is supposed to}} do. The Qur'an's distinctive set {{of economic}} and social arrangements, in which poverty and the poor have important roles, show signs of newness. The Qur'an told that the guidance comes to a community that regulates its flow of money and goods in the right direction (from top down) and practices generosity as reciprocation for God's bounty. In a broad sense, the narrative underlying the Qur'an is that of a tribal society becoming urbanized. Many scholars, such as Charles C. Torrey and Andrew Rippin, have characterized both the Qur'an and Islam as highly favorable to commerce and to the highly mobile type of society that emerged in the medieval Near East. Muslim tradition (both hadith and historiography) maintains that Muhammad did not permit the construction of any buildings in the market of Medina other than mere tents; nor did he permit any tax or rent to be taken there. This expression of a [...] "free market"—involving the circulation of goods within a single space without payment of fees, taxes, or rent, without the construction of permanent buildings, and without any profiting {{on the part of the}} caliphal authority (indeed, of the Caliph himself)—was rooted in the term sadaqa, [...] "voluntary alms". This coherent and highly appealing view of the economic universe had much to do with Islam's early and lasting success. Since the poor were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> economic universe, the teachings of the Qur'an on poverty had a considerable, even a transforming effect in Arabia, the Near East, and beyond.|$|E
2500|$|The British press {{were very}} {{positive}} about the film: Screen Daily labelled the film [...] "an anxious, tantalising creature which returns the Spanish director to the exclusive world of women" [...] and stated that Almodóvar's [...] "distinctive voice [...] in texture and depth with each new production". Empire also responded very positively, calling the film [...] "a celebration of elegance and good living as well as motherly love and romance". Time Out singled out the cinematography, design, costumes and Iglesia's score as [...] "typically exquisite", concluding that: [...] "It might be familiar territory for Almodóvar, but only a master of his art could make it look so easy". The Daily Telegraph called the film a [...] "guilt-soaked pleasure" [...] and also highlighted its score and cinematography {{as well as the}} performances of Suárez and Ugarte. London Evening Standard labelled the film [...] "a harrowing examination of broken maternity and ever-present mortality", stating that the film is [...] "excellently acted, brightly filmed [...] seriously good". Gay Star News highlighted the [...] "visually resplendent" [...] cinematography and [...] "sensitive" [...] acting performances, concluding that [...] "all the Almodóvar trademarks are here, and he's as flamboyant and fun as ever – but there's a seriousness to this familial drama that's as compelling as it is deeply satisfying". The Guardian thought the film was a [...] "fluent and engaging work", stating that [...] "the colours – and the women – pop in the Spanish auteur's adaptation of three Alice Munro stories, but there's something intentionally unsatisfying <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> minor work". Sight & Sound felt Almodóvar had [...] "play it straighter than usual" [...] and felt a disconnect between the visual and the emotional elements, which undermined the [...] "nuanced realism" [...] of the two lead performances, calling the film [...] "a surprisingly flat offering from Spain's most vibrant auteur". The Spectator also felt that [...] "the gloss ends up cramping the story" [...] and concluded that [...] "the film could have used more of the classic Almodóvar weirdness".|$|E
