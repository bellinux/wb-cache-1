5|$|The 300 pages {{removed from}} the A Game of Thrones {{manuscript}} served as {{the opening of the}} second book, entitled <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings. It was released in February 1999 in the United States, with a manuscript length (without appendices) of 1184 pages. <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings was the first book of the Ice and Fire series to make the best-seller lists, reaching 13 on The New York Times Best Seller list in 1999. After the success of The Lord of the Rings films, Martin received his first inquiries to the rights of the Ice and Fire series from various producers and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|After A Game of Thrones, <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that the new book should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E

After Isis {{had taken a}} three-quarter-length lead, <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> blades {{resulted}} in irreparable damage to the Cambridge boat and a red flag from umpire John Garrett. Cambridge won the 45th Women's Boat Race by three-and-a-quarter lengths {{in a time of}} 7 minutes and 17 seconds, their third victory in four years.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} years of war saw {{conflict}} in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by battlecruisers at the Battle of Heligoland Bight and Battle of Dogger Bank, and raids on the English coast. In May 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> the battlefleets on 31 May to 1 June in the indecisive Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Higginbotham played {{six games}} for United during the 1999–2000 season, {{including}} {{appearances in the}} UEFA Champions League and at the Maracanã Stadium in the FIFA Club World Championship. He made his full debut in a 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa at Villa Park on 13 October 1999, in what {{was described as a}} blow to the credibility of the League Cup as United had fielded a number of young players. He suffered with concussion during the match after <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> heads with Dion Dublin. He failed to break into the first team on a regular basis as Denis Irwin, Phil Neville and Mikaël Silvestre were all preferred ahead of him at left-back.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in A Game of Thrones (1996), Tyrion is a dwarf {{and member}} of House Lannister, {{one of the wealthiest}} and most {{powerful}} families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in Martin's <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in A Feast for Crows (2005) but returned in the next novel A Dance with Dragons (2011). The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter. The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels, in 2013.|$|E

5|$|Seasons 1 and 2 (2011–12) {{follow the}} events of A Game of Thrones and <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings, respectively. The plot of A Storm of Swords was split into seasons 3 and 4 (2013–14). Both season 5 and season 6 adapt {{material}} from A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons, novels whose plots run concurrently and each contain different characters. Though the HBO series has alternately extended, abbreviated, conflated and diverged from the novels' plot lines, Tyrion's character and story arc have remained mostly consistent with Martin's writing.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Miljevci Plateau was <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV) {{and forces}} of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), fought on 21–23 June 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence. The battle {{represented}} {{the culmination of a}} series of skirmishes between the HV and the RSK forces in Northern Dalmatia, after the implementation of the Vance plan and deployment of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) began. The skirmishes occurred in the pink zones—areas under control of the RSK, but outside the UN Protected Areas established by the Vance plan.|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders {{finished}} as runner-ups in the 2004 Super 12 season, {{losing the}} final to the Brumbies. Following the World Cup, John Mitchell was dropped as All Black coach {{and replaced by}} Graham Henry. McCaw was selected as first choice openside flanker and made vice captain. In the first test against England he was escorted off the field after suffering concussion following <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> heads with fellow All Black Xavier Rush. He was a late withdrawal from the second England test and then played 70 minutes against Argentina before again leaving the field due to dizziness.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{producers}} David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, based on the original work of George R. R. Martin. As the second season covers mostly <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings, the second book of the series, the first episode adapts the material from the first chapters of the book including the Prologue, Sansa I, Tyrion I, Bran I, Catelyn I, Davos I, {{the first half of}} Daenerys I and Jon III (chapters 1, 3–5, 7, 10, 12, and 23). Two chapters {{from the beginning of the}} book had already been included in season 1's finale, while Jon Snow's story is being pushed forward.|$|E
5|$|The merger led to <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, {{open communication}} among its workforce and {{a spirit of}} togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5|$|The next day, September 16, {{there was}} further {{fighting}} when <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> outposts escalated into a running battle below Washington's lines on Harlem Heights. After several hours exchange of musketry, the forces engaged {{returned to their}} start lines, and {{the position of the}} two armies on Manhattan remained relatively unchanged for the next two months. Having held their own against picked British troops, the American army received a much needed boost to their morale after the debâcle of the previous day, while the British acquired a renewed respect for the American ability to stand and fight.|$|E

5|$|Tyrion {{arrives at}} King's Landing in <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings (1998) and {{immediately}} recognizes the chaos created by Joffrey and Cersei. Seeking to consolidate power and preserve {{order in the}} capital, Tyrion methodically removes Cersei's supporters from positions of power. Disgusted by Joffrey's behavior and Cersei's failure to control him, Tyrion openly opposes the young king and tries to keep royal captive Sansa Stark out of harm's way. Tyrion masterminds the defense of King's Landing against Stannis Baratheon, even leading a sortie that drives Stannis from the gates. Afterwards, Tyrion is attacked and is grievously injured {{by one of the}} Kingsguard on orders to kill him. Tyrion suspects Joffrey or Cersei, but is unable to get revenge on either.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} entered its closing stages, the referee allotted {{a minimum of}} threeminutes of injury time. The first of these saw Van der Sar make a poor pass after the ball was played back to him by Ferdinand, {{allowing}} Iniesta to steal in and play the ball towards Messi in the United penalty area, only for Vidić to get there ahead of the Argentine and knock the ball out for a corner. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola brought Pedro Rodríguez on for Iniesta in the secondminute of added time, before Vidić was immediately shown a yellow card for <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> heads with Messi when going for a header. That {{was to be the}} final act of the match, as referee Massimo Busacca blew for full-time as soon as Xavi took the free kick.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{was born}} in the Small Heath area of Birmingham, in the shadow of St Andrew's, the home stadium of Birmingham City. Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s. In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the Post Office. He played {{football}} for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for Moor Green, one of the strongest amateur teams in the area. His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in the evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts. Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.|$|E
50|$|During {{observations}} in Germany, dingoes were heard {{to produce a}} sound that observers have called Schrappen.

5|$|Gomez proved {{his critics}} wrong {{when he arrived}} at the fight in prime {{condition}} and with aggression, determination and desire. The first two rounds started at a furious pace, with Arthur keeping Gomez at bay with stiff jabs and Gomez working inside with hooks and body punches. The match was turning into <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> opposing styles, Arthur displaying control and boxing technique and Gomez storming forward with wild ferocity. From the third round the fight began to turn Gomez's way. Gomez cut Arthur in the third and silenced the home crowd, who were not used to seeing the home-town hero being battered in this manner. Gomez dominated the fourth round and was in full control of the fight—he exposed Arthur's weak defence and at one stage landed 28 punches without reply.|$|E
5|$|In 1998's <b>A</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> Kings, Mormont leads a {{party of}} Night's Watch rangers beyond the Wall to {{investigate}} the disappearance of Jon's uncle Benjen, assess {{the intentions of the}} wildling leader Mance Rayder and learn more of the threat posed by the Others. Jon is sent out with a scouting party led by Qhorin Halfhand. On the journey, Jon comes upon a wildling lookout and takes the warrior girl Ygritte captive; though told to kill her, Jon lets her escape. Jon and Qhorin are subsequently captured by the wildlings. Qhorin, who faces certain execution at Mance's hands, commands Jon to infiltrate the wildlings and learn their plans, at any cost. Jon pretends to disavow the Night's Watch, and the wildlings force him to fight Qhorin to the death to earn their trust. With Qhorin's silent consent, Jon kills him with the aid of Ghost.|$|E
5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. The principals argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished to be free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were <b>a</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate the principals, most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E
