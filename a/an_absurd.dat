5|$|Treadgold's {{estimates}} {{are based on}} figures for Constantine's army provided by Zosimus, who is notorious among scholars as an unreliable chronicler, both in general and as regards figures in particular: e.g. he reports that 60,000 Alamanni were killed at the Battle of Strasbourg in 357, <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> inflation of the 6,000 reported by the contemporary and reliable Ammianus Marcellinus.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2009, Randazza {{was interviewed}} {{about the case}} on the WPRR radio program, Declaring Independence. He {{explained}} why Beck did not file a libel lawsuit in the United States. He pointed out that because Beck was a public figure he had to prove a legal standard referred to as actual malice, and show that Eiland-Hall knew his assertions were inaccurate. He explained that this {{did not apply to}} Eiland-Hall's website even if it was knowingly inaccurate, because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell that no proof is needed for <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> statement made in the context of satire.|$|E
5|$|On the {{one hand}} there are very many people who, if they read any poetry at all, try to take all its {{statements}} seriously – and find them silly... This may seem <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> mistake but, alas! it is none the less common. On the other hand {{there are those who}} succeed too well, who swallow 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty...,' as the quintessence of an aesthetic philosophy, not as the expression of a certain blend of feelings, and proceed into a complete stalemate of muddle-mindedness {{as a result of their}} linguistic naivety.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making fun of the character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E
5|$|A {{more serious}} crisis {{occurred}} in May, when Dada organized a mock trial of Maurice Barrès, whose early {{affiliation with the}} Symbolists had been shadowed by his antisemitism and reactionary stance: Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes was the prosecutor, Aragon and Soupault the defense attorneys, with Tzara, Ungaretti, Benjamin Péret and others as witnesses (a mannequin stood in for Barrès). Péret immediately upset Picabia and Tzara by refusing to make the trial <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> one, and by introducing a political subtext with which Breton nevertheless agreed. In June, Tzara and Picabia clashed with each other, after Tzara expressed an opinion that his former mentor was becoming too radical. During the same season, Breton, Arp, Ernst, Maja Kruschek and Tzara were in Austria, at Imst, where they published their last manifesto as a group, Dada au grand air ("Dada in the Open Air") or Der Sängerkrieg in Tirol ("The Battle of the Singers in Tyrol"). Tzara also visited Czechoslovakia, where he reportedly hoped to gain adherents to his cause.|$|E
5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people who were still alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> extent was discouraged.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Heller (May 1, 1923 – December 12, 1999) was an American {{author of}} novels, short stories, plays and screenplays. His best-known {{work is the}} novel Catch-22, a satire on war and bureaucracy, whose title has become a synonym for <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> or {{contradictory}} choice.|$|E
25|$|Society of American Archivists {{say they}} are not aware that the anti-trafficking {{provisions}} of section 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) have had any impact in deterring copyright infringement. They do know, however, that the provisions have created <b>an</b> <b>absurd,</b> Catch-22 situation for any archives that sought to adhere to the letter of the law.|$|E

60|$|He {{ran through}} his life {{insurance}} policies, verifying the permitted suicide clause in each one; signed the tray of letters that had waited his signature since the previous morning; and dictated a letter into the phonograph to {{the publisher of}} his books. His desk cleaned, he scrawled a quick summary of income and expense, with all earnings from the Harvest mines deducted. He transposed the summary into a second summary, increasing the expense margins, and cutting down the income items to <b>an</b> <b>absurdest</b> least possible. Still the result was satisfactory.|$|R

25|$|The common motif {{in those}} {{different}} parallels {{is that the}} wise judge announces <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> procedure, which is reasonable in some perverse way: Splitting the baby, according {{to the principle of}} compromise; Or a tug war, in which one can possibly assume that the true mother will be motivated to pull harder. But this procedure is actually a concealed emotional test, designed to force each woman to decide whether her compassion to the baby overpowers her will to win.|$|E
25|$|Headquarters of the WAA was {{initially}} {{established in the}} Socialist Party bastion of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Immediately after the group's formation clearly inflated membership figures {{began to appear in}} the press, including <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> and grandiose March 1935 claim that the fledgling organization was backed by a membership of 450,000 people in 28 states. David Lesser was named President of the organization, with Paul Rasmussen of Milwaukee in charge of day-to-day operations as the group's National Secretary.|$|E
25|$|The grand-ducal {{government}} of the Seekreis was dissolved, and Hecker gradually gained reinforcements. But friendly advisers also joined him, pointing out the risks of his undertaking. Hecker, however, {{was not at all}} ready to listen to them. On the contrary, he added to violence <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> defiance, and offered an amnesty to the German princes on condition of their retiring within fourteen days into private life. The troops of Baden and Hesse marched against him, under the command of General Friedrich von Gagern, and on April 20 they met near Kandern, where, although Gagern was killed, Hecker was completely defeated.|$|E

25|$|Lynch {{designed}} {{his personal}} website, a site exclusive to paying members, where he posts short videos and his absurdist series Dumbland, plus interviews and other items. The site also featured a daily weather report, where Lynch gives {{a brief description}} of the weather in Los Angeles, where he resides. Until June 2010, this weather report (usually no longer than 30seconds) was also being broadcast on his personal YouTube channel, David Lynch – Daily Weather Report. <b>An</b> <b>absurd</b> ringtone ("I like to kill deer") from the website was a common sound bite on The Howard Stern Show in early 2006.|$|E
25|$|He was persecuted by {{communist}} {{authorities for}} having {{been a member of}} the AK and was refused employment for many years. Initially he worked as a free lance writer for various newspapers. However, in 1951 he lost his job due to his past membership in the Home Army. His wife was given a choice of either divorcing him, or also losing her job. She refused, and they both became unemployed. As a result, Iringh tried to support his family, even though by this time he was quite ill, by taking photographs and selling them on the street to passers-by. In 1956 he started to work for the Association of Czechs and Slovaks in Poland although he was soon once again fired on the basis of <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> accusation that he was plotting to separate the Orava and Polish Spisz regions from Poland and join them to Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Wilde managed both {{to engage}} with and to mock the genre, while {{providing}} social commentary and offering reform. The men follow traditional matrimonial rites, whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides, but the foibles they excuse are ridiculous, and the farce is built on <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> confusion of a book and a baby.

5000|$|Birth and After Birth is <b>an</b> <b>absurdest</b> play {{written by}} Tina Howe. It {{was written in}} 1972 but it wasn’t {{produced}} until 2006. Howe was originally met with backlash and was quoted saying [...] "The absurdists can shake up our preconceptions about power and identity but {{for a woman to}} take on the sanctity of motherhood, even my agent at the time dismissed me.” Its first performance was with the Atlantic Theatre Company and it was directed by Christian Parker. Howe has been compared to many of the great absurdest writers of the 20th century due to her loose structure and nonsense plot.|$|R

500|$|Criticism to {{the episode}} {{was done by}} Finley who said, [...] "So much of this show is {{dependent}} on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> degree {{as he tries to}} impress the actor who's playing him." [...] Similarly, Werts said [...] "Shalhoub pushes a tad too far with the compulsions." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its [...] "excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness." [...] Although praised Shalhoub–Tucci dynamic, Rich Heldenfels of Akron Beacon Journal criticized it as [...] "the actor-imitating-life thing has been done before on TV and in the movies, and the gag well is pretty dry." ...|$|E
500|$|In fact, {{the tunnels}} {{were to be}} {{excavated}} {{at a depth of}} more than [...] below the surface, the deepest of any on the London Underground. In his presentation to the joint committee, the CCE's counsel disparagingly refuted the objections: [...] "Just see what <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> thing! Disturbance of the water when we are 240feet down in the London clay – about the most impervious thing you can possibly find; almost more impervious than granite rock! And the vibration on this railway is to shake down timber trees! Could anything be more ludicrous than to waste the time of the Committee in discussing such things presented by such a body!" ...|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with <b>an</b> <b>absurd</b> universe, such as the following entry from his diary: ...|$|E
