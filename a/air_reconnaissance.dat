5|$|Rudel {{was born}} on 2 July 1916 in Konradswaldau, in Prussia. He was the third child of Lutheran {{minister}} Johannes Rudel. As a boy, Rudel was a poor scholar, but a very keen sportsman. Rudel attended the humanities oriented Gymnasium, in Lauban. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1933. After graduating with Abitur in 1936, he participated in the compulsory Reich Labour Service (RAD). Following the labour service, Rudel joined the Luftwaffe where he began his military career as an <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> pilot.|$|E
5|$|The XLVI Motorised Corps {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating, and all aircraft of the 4th <b>Air</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Group had been destroyed. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to suspicions {{that he was an}} Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th <b>Air</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's {{chief of}} staff and {{commander}} of the bombardment force during the return trip to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser on bad <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{damaging}} {{air attacks}} to their ships and landing forces, the Japanese proceeded {{with the construction}} of the naval seaplane base at Tulagi and Gavutu, receiving more shipments of troops and construction workers over the next several months. The base was soon operational with aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group which conducted <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> patrols throughout the surrounding area beginning on 6 May. On 27 May, the Japanese inspected the Lunga Point area on Guadalcanal as a possible location to build a large airfield. On 13 June, the Naval General Staff approved the construction of an airfield at that location and on 19 June, Admiral Inoue toured the site in anticipation of the airfield construction effort. The next day, Japanese troops began clearing the area of brush, and on 6 July, a 12-ship convoy delivered 2,000 Korean and Japanese construction workers plus 500 Japanese naval combat troops to conduct the airfield construction effort in earnest. The coastwatchers on Guadalcanal and Allied <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> observed the Japanese airfield construction efforts. Allied Catalinas and B-17s based at Port Moresby, Efate, Noumea, and Espiritu Santo frequently bombed the Japanese bases on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Gavutu over the next several months, but without causing significant damage. Several Japanese float fighters and one Allied bomber were destroyed in aerial combat during the missions.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 April, Pukovnik Franjo Nikolić, {{the head}} of the {{operations}} staff with the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader Slavko Kvaternik in Zagreb. He then returned to headquarters and redirected 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to innocuous positions. These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance. On the same day, the 14th Panzer Division, supported by dive bombers, crossed the Drava and drove southwest towards Zagreb on snow-covered roads in extremely cold conditions. Initial <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> indicated large concentrations of Yugoslav troops on the divisional axis of advance, but these troops proved to be withdrawing towards Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the Air Force was {{tasked with}} {{gathering}} intelligence, <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance,</b> and air transport. Support of ground troops, both doctrinally {{and as a}} practical matter, became marginal. These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability, since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only, its anti-aircraft artillery was obsolete, and the FLORIDA radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness. The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994ended its ground support capability, and a cut of one-third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F/A-18s and supporting air-to-ground weapons (the reason the multi-capable Hornet was selected) had to be canceled, leaving both it and the F-5s in a strictly air-to-air role.|$|E
5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. A few Breguet 19s of the 4th <b>Air</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day, mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, who had suffered significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support, and remained in the town during the night. The bridge at Zákány was destroyed later that day by sabotage units. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 Marcinkus was {{transferred}} to the <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> department, there he started improving his expertise in independent flying, mapping, photography, and weapon systems. 1934 proved to be a challenging year for Marcinkus. Antanas Gustaitis, a prominent Lithuanian aircraft constructor and commander of Lithuanian Military Aviation, invited Marcinkus to participate in a trans-European flight, along with Jonas Liorentas, Juozas Namikas, Jonas Mikėnas, and Kazys Rimkevičius. After detailed planning and preparation, the trans-European flight was begun in the same year. During the 25 days of their flight, the pilots flew three of Gustaitis' designed aircraft, the ANBO IVs, over 10,000 kilometers and visited 12 European capitals. The Lithuanian pilots were warmly welcomed in the countries they visited. They were received by the British Royal Family and the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, German aircraft caught the <b>air</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> assets of the 4th Army {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them. The continuing mobilisation and concentration of the 4th Army was hampered by escalating fifth column activities and propaganda fomented by the Ustaše. Some units stopped mobilising, or began returning to their mobilisation centres from their concentration areas. During the day, Yugoslav sabotage units attempted to destroy bridges over the Mura at Letenye, Mursko Središće and Kotoriba, and over the Drava at Gyékényes. These attempts were only partially successful, due to the influence of Ustaše propaganda and the countermanding of demolition orders by the {{chief of staff of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska. The Yugoslav radio network in the 4th Army area was sabotaged by the Ustaše on 6 April, and radio communications within the 4th Army remained poor throughout the fighting.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle-mounted {{detachment}} of the 183rd Infantry Division captured Murska Sobota without encountering resistance. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and {{troops on the}} march. By the afternoon, German troops had captured Dolnja Lendava, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Mura at Mursko Središće and Letinja, and over the Drava at Gyékényes and Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent within the largely Croat 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period. In the afternoon, German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of Sturzkampfgeschwader 77 escorted by Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters caught the Breguet 19s of the 4th <b>Air</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Group {{on the ground at}} Velika Gorica, destroying most of them.|$|E
