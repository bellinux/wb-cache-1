40|$|Animal belling traditions {{began in}} Africa more than 5, 000 years ago. Ever since then, bells {{have been used}} on various animals {{throughout}} the world from goats to chickens to sheep to camels. Bells: Connecting Animals, People and Land interprets how both handmade and industrial bells create relationships with cultures, landscapes and livestock. This digital collection {{is based on the}} exhibit and lecture of the same name held at Utah State University Merrill-Cazier Library during fall 2009. Focusing on the significant <b>animal</b> <b>bell</b> collection of Thad Box, retired dean of Utah State University’s College of Natural Resources, the colorful and informative interpretive panels explore animal bells on four continents: Africa, North America, Australia and Europe. Bell images, exhibit artifacts, the recorded exhibit-opening images and lecture by Thad Box, additional interviews, and an annotated bibliography are all included.

On 21 November 1826, he proposed Charles Darwin for membership of the Plinian Society. On the same evening, Browne announced a paper which he presented in December 1826, contesting Charles Bell's Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression.

In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his veganism and his feeling of disgust towards people that eat meat. Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to <b>animals.</b> <b>Bell</b> responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his emotional detachment toward his mother {{and the rest of his}} family.|$|R

Often these rhopalium numbers are fixed in the medusa phase of its life cycle and vary among different species of jellyfish. Rhopalium development was documented in developing Cassiopea sp. jellyfish. These ephyrae were observed on a weekly basis until rhopalium numbers remained constant. It was observed that developing rhopalia can occur with natural structural precursors or de novo. Further results showed that there is high variation between clonal ephyrae in regards to the final rhopalium numbers. These observations support the research performed on clonal Aurelia ephyrae...|$|R

5000|$|The Willowz {{released}} {{their second}} album “Talk in circles” in 2005 on Sympathy for the Record Industry. The album {{was a massive}} undertaking of 20 songs recorded in Follin’s studio garage in Anaheim. The album features {{a wide array of}} music styles. It extends on the energetic garage rock sounds of the first album while blending a more labored over dream punk sound. This album saw Paul Kostabi and Richie James Follin teaming up again to produce. They introduced more instruments into the band’s sound including a prominently featured Fender rhodes piano, organ, horns, and woodwinds. It also contains audio samples of <b>animals,</b> church <b>bells,</b> and public chatter. The band was quoted as saying they were trying to make their own little suburban “Pet Sounds”. Sympathy also at the same time rereleased their debut album with a few extra songs and retitled it “Are Coming”. “Talk in circles” was met with critical acclaim. Rolling Stone named it one of the “best albums of 2005”.  The song “Equation #6” was featured in an another Michel Gondry film and soundtrack for “The Science of Sleep”. Gondry is quoted as saying he wants “to be the Warhol to their Velvet Underground”. The band released an accompanying DVD of 20 music videos for “Talk in circles” entitled “See in squares”. The band was featured in a documentary about the founder of Sympathy for the Record Industry entitled [...] "The Treasures of Long Gone John".|$|R
5000|$|One {{polarizing}} {{figure in}} the anti-vivisection movement was François Magendie. Magendie was a physiologist at the Académie Royale de Médecine in France, established {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. Magendie made several groundbreaking medical discoveries, but was far more aggressive than some of his other contemporaries with his use of animal experimentation. For example, the discovery of the different functionalities of dorsal and ventral spinal nerve roots was achieved by both Magendie, as well as a Scottish anatomist named Charles Bell. Bell used an unconscious rabbit because of [...] "the protracted cruelty of the dissection", which caused him to miss that the dorsal roots were also responsible for sensory information. Magendie, on the other hand, used conscious, six-week-old puppies for his own experiments.  While Magendie's approach was more infringement on what we would now call today <b>animal</b> rights, both <b>Bell</b> and Magendie used the same justification for vivisection: the cost of animal lives and experimentation was well worth it for the benefit of humanity.|$|R

On {{entering}} the town they were met by a crowd of at least five thousand people, for the most part warriors, who fired their guns, shouted, and yelled. Horns, drums, rattles, and gongs added to the appalling noise. Men with flags performed wild dances, in which the warriors joined. The dress of the captains consisted of war caps with gilded rams' horns projecting in front, and immense plumes of eagles' feathers on each side. Their vest was of red cloth, covered with fetishes and charms in cases of gold, silver, and embroidery. These were interspersed with the horns and tails of <b>animals,</b> small brass <b>bells,</b> and shells. They wore loose cotton trousers, with great boots of dull red leather coming halfway up to the thigh, and fastened by small chains to their waist belts, also ornamented with bells, horse tails, strings of amulets, and strips of colored leather. Long leopards' tails hung down their backs.|$|R

Pepper fruits characteristics cultivated in soil supplemented with manure were generally better than those from plants grown in soil only. Addition of <b>animal</b> manure increased <b>bell</b> pepper fruit content of soluble solids, ascorbic acid, total phenols, crude fibre and intensity of red color as compare with conventional agriculture that produced fruits with higher titratable acidity, water content, lycopene and bigger fruit size. In most cases of animal manure treatments, best results were obtained by the sheep manure treatment that produced the highest TSS, while the worst results were obtained by the poultry manure treatment that produced the smallest fruit and lowest fruit lycopene content...|$|R
6000|$|When a {{child is}} five or six months old it will have got a certain use and grip with its hands, and it will want to handle and examine and test the {{properties}} of as many objects as it can. Gifts begin. There seems scope for a wiser selection in these early gifts. At present it is chiefly woolly <b>animals</b> with <b>bells</b> inside them, woolly balls, and so forth, that reach the baby's hands. There is {{no reason at all}} why a child's attention should be so predominantly fixed on wool. These toys are coloured very tastefully, but as Preyer has advanced strong reasons for supposing that the child's discrimination of colours is extremely rudimentary until the second year has begun, these tasteful arrangements are simply an appeal to the parent. Light, dark, yellow, perhaps red and [...] "other colours" [...] seem to constitute the colour system of a very young infant. It is to the parent, too, that the humorous and realistic quality of the animal forms appeal. The parent does the shopping and has to be amused. The parent who ought to have a doll instead of {{a child is}} sufficiently abundant in our world to dominate the shops, and there is a vast traffic in facetious baby toys, facetious nursery furniture, [...] "art" [...] cushions and [...] "quaint" [...] baby clothing, all amazingly delightful things for grown-up people. These things are bought and grouped about the child, the child is taught tricks to complete the picture, and parentage becomes a very amusing afternoon employment. So long as convenience is not sacrificed to the æsthetic needs of the nursery, and so long as common may compete with [...] "art" [...] toys, there is no great harm done, but it is well to understand how irrelevant these things are to the real needs of a child's development.|$|R
40|$|The {{onset of}} tetany, when dairy cattle have {{insufficient}} magnesium, {{has a huge}} impact both economically and on animal welfare. We have previously adapted a model of magnesium dynamics in sheep (Robson et al. 1997) for use with dairy cattle {{as an aid to}} understanding aspects of magnesium metabolism which influence the risk of <b>animals</b> contracting tetany (<b>Bell</b> et al. 2005). To estimate this risk in a dairy herd, we carried out Monte-Carlo simulations in which model parameters for individual animals in the herd were varied randomly according to their statistical distributions (McKinnon et al. 2003). In this approach the choice of parameter distributions can significantly influence the risk estimates. In some cases the distributions are available from the literature, but in other cases they must be obtained using some sort of parameter refinement process to estimate the parameter distributions from measured data corresponding to a model output. In this paper we present an overview of a generalised algorithm which was developed to improve the accuracy of a priori parameter distribution estimates obtained from literature data using an iterative refinement process. At each iteration a response distribution for the current parameter distribution estimate is evaluated using the Monte-Carlo method and compared with a corresponding experimental sample response distribution. A parameter filter is constructed using the iterative parameter estimates and response distributions so that the filter entries form an approximate solution space of the desired refined state. This permits estimates of the parameter distributions to be calculated from the parameter filter...|$|R
6000|$|Mules.--Mules require men {{who know}} their habits; they are {{powerful}} beats, {{and can only}} be mastered with skill and address. A savage will not assist in packing them, for he fears their heels: the Swiss say mules have always an arriere-pensee. They have odd secret ways, strange fancies, and lurking vice. When they stray, they go immense distances; and it is almost beyond {{the power of a}} man on foot to tend them in a wild country: he can neither overtake them easily, nor, when overtaken, catch them. The female is, in most breeds, much the more docile. They suffer from African distemper, but in a less degree than horses. The following descriptions of mule caravans are exceedingly graphic and instructive:--"The madrina (or godmother) is a most important personage. She is an old steady mare, with a little bell round her neck, and wheresoever she goes the mules, like good children, follow her. If several large troops are turned into one field to graze in the morning, the muleteer has only to lead the madrinas a little apart and tinkle their bells, and, although there may be 200 or 300 mules together, each immediately knows its own bell, and separates itself from the rest. The affection of these animals for their madrina saves infinite trouble. It is nearly impossible to lose an old mule: for, if detained several hours by force, she will, by the power of smell, like a dog, track out her companions, or rather the madrina; for, according to the muleteer, she is the chief object of affection. The feeling, however, is not of an individual nature; for I believe I am right in saying that any <b>animal</b> with a <b>bell</b> will serve as a madrina." [...] (Charles Darwin.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} of contraction {{of the bell}} of Gonionemus was studied in relation to temperature, with intact animals and also where different operations were made on the nervous system. A number of values of µ are found for intact animals namely 8, 100 ±, 10, 500 ±, 32, 000 ± and 22, 500 ±, with critical temperatures at 9. 6 °, 12. 3 °, and 14. 0 °. Four different classes of operations were used: (1) Animals where the nerve ring was cut on two {{opposite sides of the}} bell; the µ values found are 10, 500 ± and 21, 300 ±, with a critical temperature at 13. 4 °. (2) Animals with four cuts through the nerve ring gave µ = 10, 600 ± and µ = 21, 000, with a critical temperature at 13. 1 °. (3) In <b>animals</b> where the <b>bell</b> was cut in half the temperature characteristic was found to be 16, 900. And finally (4) in the animals where the nerve ring was totally removed µ values of 8, 100, 16, 000 ±, and 29, 000 were found, with critical temperatures at 15. 0 ° and 9. 4 °. These results are discussed {{from the standpoint of the}} theory which supposes that definite "temperature characteristics" may be associated with the functional activity of particular elements in a complex functional unit, and that these elements may be separately studied and identified by suitable experimental procedures involving the magnitudes of the respective temperature characteristics and the locations of associated critical temperatures. The swimming bell of medusæ with its marginal sense organs permits a fairly direct approach to such questions. It is found that even slight injuries to the marginal nerve ring, for example, produce specific modifications in the temperature relations which are different from those appearing when the organism is cut in half...|$|R
