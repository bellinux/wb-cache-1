25|$|The Socialist Party, however, {{refused to}} condemn the McNamara brothers, arguing that their actions were {{justified}} {{in view of the}} supposed employer- and state-sponsored terror their union had faced for the last 25 years. Haywood and Debs echoed that sentiment. Wrote Debs:It is easy enough for a gentleman of education and refinement to sit at his typewriter and point out the crimes of the workers. But let him be one of them himself, reared in hard poverty, denied education, thrown into the brute struggle for existence from childhood, oppressed, exploited, forced to strike, clubbed by the police, jailed while his family is evicted, and his wife and children are hungry, and he will hesitate {{to condemn the}}se as criminals who fight against the crimes of which they <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of such savage methods as have been forced upon them by their masters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first trial}} {{specifically}} {{dealing with the}} Stalag Luft III murders began on 1 July 1947, against 18 defendants. The trial was held before No. 1 War Crimes Court at the Curio Haus in Hamburg. The accused all pleaded Not Guilty to the counts indicated on the table below; names in the final column <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> that they were accused of murdering. The verdicts and sentences were handed down after a full fifty days on September 3 of that year. Max Wielen {{was found guilty of}} conspiracy and sentenced to life imprisonment. The others were found not guilty of the first two charges, but guilty of the individual charges of murder. Breithaupt received life imprisonment, Denkmann and Struve ten years imprisonment each, and Boschert eventually received life imprisonment. The other 13 condemned prisoners were hanged at Hamelin Jail in February 1948 by British executioner Albert Pierrepoint.|$|E

The sex trade is a recurring theme throughout the entire series, and early season premieres and finales center around high numbers of homicides where prostitutes <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims,</b> which often {{turn out to be}} the work of a serial killer. Relationships between characters (such as Da Vinci's many romantic flings and that between Mick Leary and Sunny Ramen) are left in the background of or take place between episodes.|$|E
500|$|The Wrongs of Woman is what in {{the late}} eighteenth century was called a Jacobin novel, [...] a {{philosophical}} novel that advocated the ideals of the French Revolution. Wollstonecraft's novel argues along with others, such as Mary Hays's Memoirs of Emma Courtney (1796), that women <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of constant and systematic injustice. Wollstonecraft uses the philosophical dialogues in her novel to demonstrate women's powerlessness.|$|E
500|$|There are however {{instances}} where people <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of civil-rights violations {{that occur in}} circumstances involving both government officials and private actors. In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action {{opening the door to}} wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors (i.e., acts done or otherwise [...] "sanctioned in some way" [...] by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.|$|E

500|$|Makeba {{has also}} been {{associated}} with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement. She called for unity between black people of African descent across the world: [...] "Africans who live everywhere should fight everywhere. The struggle is no different in South Africa, the streets of Chicago, Trinidad or Canada. The Black people <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of capitalism, racism and oppression, period". After marrying Carmichael she often appeared with him during his speeches; Carmichael later described her presence at these events as an asset, and Feldstein wrote that Makeba enhanced Carmichael's message that [...] "black is beautiful". Along with performers such as Simone, Lena Horne, and Abbey Lincoln, she used her position as a prominent musician to advocate for civil rights. Their activism has been described as simultaneously calling attention to racial and gender disparities, and highlighting [...] "that the liberation they desired could not separate race from sex". Makeba's critique of second-wave feminism as being the product of luxury led to observers being unwilling to call her a feminist. Scholar Ruth Feldstein stated that Makeba and others influenced both black feminism and second-wave feminism through their advocacy, and the historian Jacqueline Castledine referred to her as one of the [...] "most steadfast voices for social justice".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to the Aldershot and North Hants Conservative Association on 4 February 1983, Powell {{blamed the}} United Nations for the Falklands War by the General Assembly {{resolution}} of December 1967 that stated [...] "its {{gratitude for the}} continuous efforts made by the Government of Argentina to facilitate the process of decolonisation" [...] and further called on Britain and Argentina to negotiate. Powell said that [...] "it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cynically wicked or criminally absurd or insultingly provocative action". As 102 had voted for this resolution, with only Britain voting against it (with 32 abstentions), he claimed it was not surprising that Argentina had continually threatened Britain until this threatening turned into aggression: [...] "It is with the United Nations that the guilt lies for the breach of the peace and the bloodshed". The UN knew that no international forum had ruled against British possession of the Falklands but had voted its gratitude to Argentina who wanted to annexe the Islands from their rightful owners. It was therefore [...] "disgraceful" [...] for Britain to belong to such a body that engaged in [...] "pure spite for spite's sake against the United Kingdom": [...] "We were, and <b>are,</b> <b>the</b> <b>victims</b> of our own insincerity. For over thirty years we have sanctimoniously and dishonestly pretended respect, if not awe, for an organisation which all the time we knew was a monstrous and farcical humbug....
