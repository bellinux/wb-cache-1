It is estimated that there are more IV drug users in North-Central per capita than in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Although crime rates in the area remain relatively high, they have fallen in recent years due to efforts by the Regina Police Service and several agencies, including a stolen vehicle program, an <b>anti-drug</b> <b>strategy,</b> and an increase in the number of police officers in the area. This has been a national trend for some time. As of November 2006, nearly 18% of the crime in Regina occurred in this neighbourhood, which has less than 6% of the population, or a 153-block area containing approximately (by another estimate) 10,500 people.|$|E

US funding for the military component of Plan Colombia was on average US$540 million per year between 2000 and 2008, while the Colombian government invested approximately US$812 million per year. Following the September 11 attacks, Plan Colombia resources began to be used for anti-guerrilla operations. Over 80% of US aid to Colombia between 2000 and 2007 was military assistance, which came to reinforce the modernization of the Colombian armed forces under the Pastrana and Uribe administrations.|$|E

This paper focuses on the US-Mexico {{cooperation}} to combat this threat with the objective to evaluate its effectiveness. First, a theoretical base is set for a constructivist analysis of the cooperation by identifying changes that have resulted from the new post-international environment. An explanation of the rise of transnational threats and the ways they are constructed is given according to constructivism and the securitization theory as used by the Copenhagen school of security studies. This leads to an examination of how the threat posed by drug trafficking is perceived by Mexico and by the US and identifies why drug trafficking is indeed a transnational threat. To answer the question of the US-Mexico's effectiveness in this cooperation, a constructivist approach is used to identify the main flaws of their relation. Finally, an analysis of how these flaws have affected the forming and enforcement of specific <b>anti-drug</b> <b>strategies</b> is used to assess its impac...|$|R

Although work has been addressing these gaps {{for a number of}} years now, it has proven challenging to establish the dynamics of emerging drug tendencies within local areas. Some work of this nature has been carried out within the UK, but these studies have been beset by problems. With this in mind the Drugs Analysis and Research Programme and Market and Opinion Research International (MORI) embarked on developmental work to assess whether a national project, involving progressive sweeps of interviews with key professionals and drug users, in ten areas of England and Wales, would help fill these gaps still further. Findings suggested that the overall process worked very well. Not only did the project prove feasible, but interviews were felt to have produced real time, policy relevant information.

Its central thesis is that the Washington/Bogota-backed war on drugs in Colombia over the decade did not merely fail to curb the growth of the Colombian drug trade and attendant corruption, but actually proved counterproductive. Among the most important unintended consequences were the explosion of drug cultivation and production activities, the dispersion and proliferation of organized crime, and the expansion and intensification of political violence and guerrilla warfare in the country. As a result, Colombia at the outset of 2000 faced more serious threats to its national security and political stability than it had in 1990. ... the massive escalation of the flawed <b>anti-drug</b> <b>strategies</b> of the past decade proposed by the Clinton administration in January 2000 is more likely to worsen Colombia’s ongoing problems of spiraling violence and insecurity than to resolve them.|$|R

Drug abuse is a disease that must be treated {{on the basis of}} evidence (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2007; World Health Organisation 2004). In order to reduce the damage caused by drug abuse to the nation, society and people, the government not only developed two <b>anti-drug</b> <b>strategies</b> - that of supply eradication and demand reduction - but since May 1994, has mobilised relevant government departments to take assertive action. Some of the actions include law enforcement enhancement, anti-drug enforcement and drug rehabilitation utilisation. In 2005, new anti-drug programs, such as the sterile needle exchange program and substitution therapy program, were also introduced. The cities implementing the Harm Reduction Program (HR Program) showed lower HIV infection rates in comparison to others without the HR Program. The income and employment conditions of drug addicted patients receiving Methadone Maintenance Treatment have been improved. The future drug policies in Taiwan will focus on drug rehabilitation (treatment), anti-drug actions (prevention) and law enforcement (punishment).

Not only did Washington enhance the domestic anti-drug policy, but it also strengthened the foreign anti-drug policy and launched an extensive campaign in Latin America, one of the major producers of drugs in the world. Chemical eradication and interdiction of drug-trafficking routes in Mexico, Peru and Bolivia led to a relocation of the cultivation of illegal crops to Colombia, closer to the laboratories. Thus, Bogota became the centre of attention for Washington. This bachelor thesis describes U.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{to what extent}} the development of cooperation between Russia and the European Union (EU) to respond to the common threat of increasing drug trafficking in Central Asia is desirable and feasible. First, it considers the growing overlap between Russian and EU security interests in Central Asia and provides an understanding of the two sides’ mutual perceptions in this strategic region. Even though the current mind-set is one of general mistrust, for instance in fields such as energy or human rights, both actors now recognise the imperative of regional and international cooperation to tackle terrorist threats and increasing drug flows. Second, the relevance of a joint Russia-EU involvement is analysed by considering the evolving trends in drug trafficking since the US-led coalition intervened in Afghanistan. The paper demonstrates the shortcomings and inadequacy of the current counter-narcotics policies as well as their responsibility in hampering regional cooperation and international efforts. Third, the respective Russian and EU <b>anti-drug</b> <b>strategies</b> and instruments are analysed in order to better assess the possibilities of developing synergies on the ground instead of maintaining competing and detrimental standalone visions. Although the feasibility of setting up a pragmatic and de-politicised cooperation between the EU and Russia is challenging in many regards, this paper shows that it is highly desirable as it would contribute to diminish strong risks of instability in the region and would address the security concerns of both actors. On the basis of the findings, policy recommendations are formulated for the EU...|$|R
