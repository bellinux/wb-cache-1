40|$|Market orientation, viewed {{mostly as}} an {{implementation}} of the marketing concept, {{is probably one of}} the most studied areas of marketing. Some <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a philosophy, or way of being, while others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a set of business practices to be implemented. Others <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a combination of these two, aligned with the strategic mandate of the firm.

5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} {{the validity of}} the species as early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open the line to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents. Oslo Sporveier, the operator, turned down the proposals, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would cost about 3billion NOK to lay the tracks and put up overhead line equipment, {{and that it would}} not attract enough passengers.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of {{drinking}} in public <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not itself cause problems and rather <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is social problems that cause overconsumption and violence, pointing to countries that allow drinking in public but have {{low levels of}} associated overconsumption and violence. Proponents further <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> drinking in public helps normalize attitudes towards drinking and build a healthier drinking culture. Many <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a right to drink in public.|$|R
5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged victims {{were not being}} fully cooperative, whereas former members were suspicious of the Mexican legal system, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> favored the church.

5|$|Friedman {{rejected}} {{the use of}} fiscal policy {{as a tool of}} demand management; and he held that the government's role in the guidance of the economy should be restricted severely. Friedman wrote extensively on the Great Depression, which he termed the Great Contraction, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been caused by an ordinary financial shock whose duration and seriousness were greatly increased by the subsequent contraction of the money supply caused by the misguided policies of the directors of the Federal Reserve.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a physics}} {{professor}} at the University of Central Florida wrote a paper <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on geometric progression. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within {{two and a half}} years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.|$|E

The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's {{interests}} ranged widely. In 1781, {{he had a}} paper {{published in}} the Philosophical Transactions {{on the origins of}} the turkey, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a North American bird and not an Old World species. Another paper, published at the instigation of Sir Joseph Banks, was on earthquakes, several of which he had experienced in Flintshire. In the same year he was made an honorary member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and in 1783, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and separately, a member of the Swedish Royal Physiographic Society in Lund.|$|E
5|$|The Ramayana further adds: Kabandha {{spent his}} days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest. There, he spent his time scaring sages. Once, Kabandha {{attacked}} the sage Stulashira, who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity. Upon Kabandha's pleading, the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form, once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms. So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama's arrival. Growse suspected the tale to be a later interpolation <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{does not appear in}} all versions/translations of the original Ramayana.|$|E

50|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in Past & Present in 2009, van Bavel and Oscar Gelderblom disagreed with British historian Simon Schama on the origins of historic Dutch cleanliness. While Schama <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was founded in Calvinism and patriotism, van Bavel and Gelderblom <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated for economic reasons, hygiene being necessary for the production of cheese and butter.|$|R

5|$|The {{book was}} hailed as an {{important}} addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy. Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends. Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne {{on a number of}} points.|$|E
5|$|This {{entrance}} {{was expected}} to replace the need for Elisenberg Station, and was located {{in the middle of}} the Oslo Tunnel, between Nationaltheatret and Skøyen. Oslo Byes Vel and the Conservative, Red and Centre parties opposed the construction of the entrance, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would ruin the south-western corner of the Palace Park. The Conservative Party proposed building it further south, across Henrik Ibsens gate, either in Hansteens gate or in Parkveien near Oslo Commerce School, while the others wanted to open Elisenberg Station for traffic.|$|E
5|$|Wills held no {{positions}} of power at the South Melbourne Cricket Club and only occasionally appeared in local team lists. He nonetheless convinced the club to open its ground to football in winter by <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would make the turf firm and durable. Other clubs soon followed South Melbourne's example and football adapted to an oval-shaped field. By now, the sport had spread throughout Australasia with Melbourne matches attracting the world's largest football crowds yet seen.|$|E

5|$|A {{parliamentary}} {{inquiry and}} media reports {{indicated that the}} Indigenous traditional owners of Muckaty Station were divided over whether it should host a radioactive waste facility. Some members of the Ngapa clan supported hosting the facility, while other traditional owners of Muckaty opposed it. There were also claims that {{some members of the}} Ngapa clan were among those who had signed a petition opposing the facility. Political scientist Rebecca Stringer criticised the federal government's approach to the siting of the waste facility, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> undermined the Indigenous owners' sovereignty and control of their own lands. Environmental organisations and the Australian Greens are opposed to using the site for a dump.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, Congress {{had passed}} {{legislation}} to deny financial aid grants to Yugoslavia, {{to withdraw the}} sale of spare parts for Yugoslav warplanes, and to revoke the country's most favored nation status. Kennan strongly protested the legislation, <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would only result in a straining of relations between Yugoslavia and the U.S. Kennan came to Washington {{during the summer of}} 1962 to lobby against the legislation but was unable to elicit a change from Congress. President Kennedy endorsed Kennan privately but remained noncommittal publicly, as {{he did not want to}} jeopardize his slim majority support in Congress on a potentially contentious issue. With U.S.–Yugoslav relations getting progressively worse, Kennan tendered his resignation as ambassador during late July 1963.|$|E
