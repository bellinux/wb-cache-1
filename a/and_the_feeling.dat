5|$|Emilio del Guercio {{said that}} the toy arrow {{represents}} absurdity and the teardrop sentimentality and melancholy. According to Argentine graphic artist Rep, the artwork conveys a grotesque, dramatic flavor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the album should be taken seriously but not too seriously.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{sense of}} values <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of devotion to a cause, which became so {{characteristic}} {{of him in}} later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} the band members' experiences {{growing up in}} Belleville. Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the start-stop musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J. Hamilton, reminiscent of the albums released on Folkways Records.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> is mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran anyway because of his frustration with what he claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E

25|$|Pittsburgh {{entered the}} game as seven-point {{favorites}} over Arizona. Major factors for this included {{the view that the}} Steelers' defense was better than that of the Cardinals <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that the AFC was an overall better conference than the NFC.|$|E
25|$|Gay travel {{destinations}} {{are popular}} among practitioners of gay tourism because they usually have permissive or liberal attitudes towards gays, feature a prominent gay infrastructure (bars, businesses, restaurants, hotels, nightlife, entertainment, media, organisations, etc.), {{the opportunity to}} socialize with other gays, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that one can relax safely among other gay people.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladeshi liberation {{struggle}} against Pakistan {{was led by}} secular leaders. With this reality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of Islamic solidarity in the background, Islamists in East Pakistan viewed Bengali nationalism as unacceptable and instead sided with the Pakistani Army's efforts to crush the Bengali independence movement. Secularists hailed the Bangladeshi victory as the triumph of secular Bengali nationalism over religion-centred Pakistani nationalism.|$|E

25|$|Away from Hollywood and {{the culture}} of celebrity, Monroe's life became more normal; she began cooking, keeping house and giving Miller more {{attention}} and affection than he had been used to. His children, aged twelve and nine, adored her and were reluctant to return to their mother when the weekend was over. As she was also fond of older people, she got along well with his parents, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> was mutual.|$|E
25|$|By far, the {{two most}} common {{symptoms}} described are pain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that teeth no longer correctly meet (traumatic malocclusion, or disocclusion). The teeth {{are very sensitive to}} pressure (proprioception), so even a small change in the location of the teeth will generate this sensation. People will also be very sensitive to touching the area of the jaw that is broken, {{or in the case of}} condylar fracture the area just in front of the tragus of the ear.|$|E

25|$|A common {{reason for}} the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain {{pleasure}} from the restrained partner's submission <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of the temporary transfer of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used {{as a means to}} an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a growing}} number of social network users who decide to quit their user account by {{committing}} a so-called virtual identity suicide or Web 2.0 suicide. A 2013 study in the journal Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking investigated this phenomenon from the perspective of Facebook users. The number one reason for these users was privacy concerns (48%), being followed by a general dissatisfaction with the social networking website (14%), negative aspects regarding social network friends (13%) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of getting addicted to the social networking website (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious.|$|E
25|$|Cato the Elder {{was born}} in Tusculum, a {{municipal}} town of Latium, like some generations of his ancestors. His father had {{earned a reputation as}} a brave soldier, and his great-grandfather had received a reward from the state for having had five horses killed under him in battle. However, the Tusculan Porcii had never obtained the privileges of the Roman magistracy. Cato the Elder, their famous descendant, {{at the beginning of his}} career in Rome, was regarded as a novus homo (new man), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of his unsatisfactory position, working along with the belief of his inherent superiority, aggravated and drove his ambition. Early in life, he so far exceeded the previous deeds of his predecessors that he is frequently spoken of not only as the leader, but as the founder of the Porcia Gens.|$|E
