Through simplification we mean that the thread or the tooth profile is trapezoidal in cross section and tooth's flanks angles are symmetrical, in this case 20 °. It is highlight the way haw are generated the tooth flanks of the worm face gear by the method of generating kinematics, where is considered that the worm face gears can be replaced, in terms of kinematics, by a gear composed by rack and a worm wheel. The method was exemplified for a worm face gear with Archimedean worm heaving following characteristics: i 12 = 47, A = 56 mm, <b>axial</b> <b>module</b> 2. 5.

40|$|AbstractThe axial {{arrangement}} of long scintillation crystals is a promising concept in PET instrumentation {{to address the}} need for optimized resolution and sensitivity. Individual crystal readout and arrays of wavelength shifter strips placed orthogonally to the crystals lead to a 3 D-detection of the annihilations photons. A fully operational demonstrator scanner, developed by the AX-PET collaboration, proved the potential of this concept in terms of energy and spatial resolution as well as sensitivity. This paper describes a feasibility study, performed on <b>axial</b> prototype detector <b>modules</b> with 100 mm long LYSO crystals, read out by the novel digital Silicon Photomultipliers (dSiPM) from Philips. With their highly integrated readout electronics and excellent intrinsic time resolution, dSiPMs allow for compact, <b>axial</b> detector <b>modules</b> which may extend {{the potential of the}} axial PET concept by time of flight capabilities (TOF-PET). A coincidence time resolution of 211 ps (FWHM) was achieved in the coincidence of two <b>axial</b> <b>modules</b> read out by dSiPMs, fully maintaining the demonstrated performance of the AX-PET detector...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a fully operational PET demonstrator setup which allows true 3 D reconstruction of the 511 keV photons and therefore leads to practically parallax free images. The AX-PET concept is based on thin 100 mm long scintillation crystals (LYSO), axially oriented and arranged in layers around the held of view. Layers of wavelength shifting plastic strips mounted in between the crystal layers give the axial coordinate. Both crystals and WLS strips are individually read out by G-APD (SiPM) photodetectors. The Fully scalable concept overcomes the dilemma of sensitivity versus spatial resolution which is inherent to classical PET designs. A demonstrator set-up based on two <b>axial</b> <b>modules</b> was exhaustively characterized using point-like sources, phantoms filled with radiotracer and finally rats and a mouse. The results entirely meet the performance expectations (< 2 mm FWHM in all three coordinates over the complete held of view) and also demonstrated the ability to include Compton interactions (inter-crystal scatter) in the reconstruction without noticeable performance loss. Our recent studies focus on a TOF extension of the AX-PET concept making use of the novel digital SiPM detectors by Philips. After reproducing comparable energy and spatial resolution on a small digital AX-PET set-up with 100 mm long crystals, we demonstrated a coincidence resolving time of about 210 ps FWHM.

All known interesting examples of axial algebras {{fall into this}} setting, in particular the Griess algebra whose automorphism group is the Monster group. Our results become especially interesting for Matsuo algebras. We vitalize the connection between Matsuo algebras and 3 -transposition groups by relating modules over Matsuo algebras with representations of 3 -transposition groups.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel method {{to extract the}} axial coordinate from a matrix of long axially oriented crystals, {{which is based on}} wavelength shifting plastic strips. The method allows building compact 3 -D <b>axial</b> gamma detector <b>modules</b> for PET scanners with excellent 3 -dimensional spatial, timing and energy resolution while keeping the number of readout channels reasonably low. A voxel resolution of about 10 mm 3 is expected. We assess the performance of the method in two independent ways, using classical PMTs and G-APDs to read out the LYSO (LSO) scintillation crystals and the wavelength shifting strips. We observe yields in excess of 35 photoelectrons from the strips for a 511 keV gamma and reconstruct the axial coordinate with a precision of about 2. 5 mm (FWHM) ...|$|R

The development Team included Sandia, Chevron, Amoco, Conoco, Exxon, Raytheon, Pelton, and GRI. The seismic source that was developed is a vertically oriented, axial point force, swept frequency, clamped, reaction-mass vibrator design. It was based on an early Chevron prototype, but the new tool incorporates a number of improvements which make it far superior to the original prototype. The system consists of surface control electronics, a special heavy duty fiber optic wireline and draw works, a cablehead, hydraulic motor/pump module, electronics <b>module,</b> clamp, and <b>axial</b> vibrator <b>module.</b> The tool has a peak output of 7, 000 lbs force and a useful frequency range of 5 to 800 Hz. It can operate in fluid filled wells with 5. 5 -inch or larger casing to depths of 20, 000 ft and operating temperatures of 170 C. The tool includes fiber optic telemetry, force and phase control, provisions to add seismic receiver arrays below the source for single well imaging, and provisions for adding other vibrator modules to the tool in the future. The project yielded four important deliverables: a complete advanced borehole seismic source system with all associated field equipment; field demonstration surveys funded by industry showing the utility of the system; industrial sources for all of the hardware; and a new service company set up by their industrial partner to provide commercial surveys...|$|R
40|$|A {{new measure}} of the crystal-field strength, {{complementary}} to the conventional one, is defined. It {{is based on the}} rotational invariants |B_k 0 |_av or |∑_kB_k 0 |_av, k= 2, 4, 6, of the crystal-(ligand) -field (CF) Hamiltonian H_CF parametrizations, i. e. on the <b>axial</b> CF parameters <b>modules</b> averaged over all reference frame orientations. They turn out to be equal to |H_CF^(k) |_av and |H_CF|_av, respectively. While the traditional measure is established on the parametrization modules or on the second moment of the CF energy levels, the introduced scale employs rather the first moment of the energy modules and has better resolving power. The new scale is able to differentiate the strength of various iso-modular parametrizations according to the classes of rotationally equivalent parametrizations. Using both the compatible CF strength measures one may draw more accurate conclusions about the Stark levels arrays and particularly their total splitting magnitudes.

40|$|Complement receptor-type 1 (CR 1, CD 35) is the immune-adherence receptor, a {{complement}} regulator, and an erythroid receptor for Plasmodium falciparum during merozoite invasion and subsequent rosette formation involving parasitized and non-infected erythrocytes. The non-uniform geographical distribution of Knops blood group CR 1 alleles Sl 1 / 2 and McC(a/b) {{may result from}} selective pressures exerted by differential exposure to infectious hazards. Here, four variant short recombinant versions of CR 1 were produced and analyzed, focusing on complement control protein modules (CCPs) 15 - 25 of its ectodomain. These eleven modules encompass a region (CCPs 15 - 17) key to rosetting, opsonin recognition and complement regulation, {{as well as the}} Knops blood group polymorphisms in CCPs 24 - 25. All four CR 1 15 - 25 variants were monomeric and had similar <b>axial</b> ratios. <b>Modules</b> 21 and 22, despite their double-length inter-modular linker, did not lie side-by-side so as to stabilize a bent-back architecture that would facilitate cooperation between key functional modules and Knops blood group antigens. Indeed, the four CR 1 15 - 25 variants had virtually indistinguishable affinities for immobilized complement fragments C 3 b (K(D)  =  0. 8 - 1. 1 µM) and C 4 b (K(D)  =  5. 0 - 5. 3 µM). They were all equally good co-factors for factor I-catalysed cleavage of C 3 b and C 4 b, and they bound equally within a narrow affinity range, to immobilized C 1 q. No differences between the variants were observed in assays for inhibition of erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum or for rosette disruption. Neither differences in complement-regulatory functionality, nor interactions with P. falciparum proteins tested here, appear to have driven the non-uniform geographic distribution of these alleles...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} principle, a {{possible}} implementation and performance estimates {{of a novel}} geometrical concept for a high resolution positron emission tomograph. The concept, which can for example be implemented in a brain PET device, promisses to lead to an essentially parallax free 3 D image reconstruction with excellent spatial resolution and constrast, uniform over the complete eld of view. The key components are matrices of long axially oriented scintillator crystals which are read out at both extremities by segmented Hybrid Photon Detectors. We discuss the relevant design considerations for a 3 D <b>axial</b> PET camera <b>module,</b> motivate parameter and material choices, and estimate its performance in terms of spatial and energy resolution. We support these estimates by Monte Carlo simulations {{and in some cases}} by rst experimental results. From the performance of a camera module, we extrapolate to the reconstruction resolution of a 3 D axial PET scanner in a semi-analytical way and compare it to an existing state-of-the art brain PET device. We nally describe a dedicated data acquisition system, capable to fully exploit the advantages of the proposed concept. We conclude that the proposed 3 D Axial concept and the discussed implementation is a competitive approach for high resolution brain PET. Excellent energy resolution and Compton enhanced sensitivity are expected to lead to high quality reconstruction and reduced scanning times...|$|R
40|$|Background A long, {{slender body}} plan {{characterized}} by an elongate antorbital region and posterior displacement of the unpaired fins has evolved multiple times within ray-finned fishes, and is associated with ambush predation. The axial skeleton of ray-finned fishes is divided into abdominal and caudal regions, considered to be evolutionary modules. In this study, we test whether the convergent evolution of the ambush predator body plan is associated with predictable, regional changes in the axial skeleton, specifically whether the abdominal region is preferentially lengthened relative to the caudal region through the addition of vertebrae. We test this hypothesis in seven clades showing convergent evolution of this body plan, examining abdominal and caudal vertebral counts in over 300 living and fossil species. In four of these clades, we also {{examined the relationship between}} the fineness ratio and vertebral regionalization using phylogenetic independent contrasts. Results We report that in five of the clades surveyed, Lepisosteidae, Esocidae, Belonidae, Sphyraenidae and Fistulariidae, vertebrae are added preferentially to the abdominal region. In Lepisosteidae, Esocidae, and Belonidae, increasing abdominal vertebral count was also significantly related to increasing fineness ratio, a measure of elongation. Two clades did not preferentially add abdominal vertebrae: Saurichthyidae and Aulostomidae. Both of these groups show the development of a novel caudal region anterior to the insertion of the anal fin, morphologically differentiated from more posterior caudal vertebrae. Conclusions The preferential addition of abdominal vertebrae in fishes with an elongate body shape is consistent with the existence of a conservative positioning module formed by the boundary between the abdominal and caudal vertebral regions and the anterior insertion of the anal fin. Dissociation of this module is possible, although less probable than changes in the independently evolving abdominal region. Dissociation of the <b>axial</b> skeleton-median fin <b>module</b> leads to increased regionalization within the caudal vertebral column, something that has evolved several times in bony fishes, and may be homologous with the sacral region of tetrapods. These results suggest that modularity of the axial skeleton may result in somewhat predictable evolutionary outcomes in bony fishes...|$|R
