40|$|Background: In 1996 {{the number}} of deaths and <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> {{hospital}} in Canada that could be attributed to the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs were esti-mated from 1992 data. In this paper we update these estimates to the year 1995. Methods: On the basis of pooled estimates of relative risk, etiologic fractions were calculated by age, sex and province for 90 causes of disease or death attribut-able to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs; the etiologic fractions were then applied to national mortality and morbidity data for 1995 to estimate {{the number of}} deaths and <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> hospital attributable to substance abuse. Results: In 1995, 6507 deaths and 82 014 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> hospital were attributed to alcohol, 34 728 deaths and 194 072 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> hospital were attributed to tobacco, and 805 deaths and 6940 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> hospital were due to illicit drugs. Interpretation: The use and misuse of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs accounted for 20. 0 % of deaths, 22. 2 % of years of potential life lost and 9. 4 % of admission...|$|R
