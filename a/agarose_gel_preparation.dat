Preparation of such gels is as easy and rapid as <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> <b>preparation,</b> and polymerized polyacrylamide gels are used to fractionate proteins or small DNA fragments using a common horizontal electrophoretic tank.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the organization of}} fibers in an <b>agarose</b> <b>gel,</b> digitized electron micrographs are used here to determine the frequency distribution of interfiber distance (2 Pc) in thin sections of <b>agarose</b> <b>gels.</b> For a <b>preparation</b> of underivatized agarose, a 1. 5 % gel has a Pc distribution that is indistinguishable from the Pc distribution of a computer-generated, random-fiber gel; the log of the occurrence frequency (F) decreases linearly {{as a function of}} Pc. As the agarose concentration decreases below 1. 5 %, the semilogarithmic F versus Pc plot becomes progressively less linear. Two straight lines represent the data; the plot is steeper at the lower Pc values. As the percentage of agarose increases above 1. 5 %, the semilogarithmic F versus Pc plot becomes steeper at the higher Pc values. This change in the shape of semilogarithmic F versus Pc plots is possibly explained by the existence in <b>agarose</b> <b>gels</b> of two zones, one whose Pc distribution is more sensitive to the average agarose concentration than the other. To compare the structure of <b>agarose</b> <b>gels</b> to their sieving during electrophoresis, the root mean square value of Pc (Pc) is compared to the sieving-based radius of the effective pore (PE; Griess et. al. (16)) for both underivatized agarose and a derivatized agarose that has a smaller PE at any given agarose percentage. For 0. 8 - 2. 0 % gels of either underivatized or derivatized agarose, PE/Pc is a constant within experimental error. Deviations from this constant are observed at lower gel percentages. This relationship of PE to Pc constrains theoretical descriptions of the motion of spheres in fibrous networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Agarose</b> <b>gel</b> {{electrophoresis}} is {{the standard}} method {{that is used to}} separate, identify, and purify DNA fragments. However, this method is time-consuming and capable of separating limited range of fragments. A new technique of <b>gel</b> <b>preparation</b> was developed to improve the DNA fragment analysis via electrophoresis. Typically, <b>agarose</b> <b>gels</b> are used to separate larger fragments of DNA (greater than 200 bp) and polyacrylamide gels are used for small fragments (less than 200 bp). The distance between two DNA fragments of different sizes can be determined based on the concentration of the agarose matrix (Sambrook et al., 1989). The relative mobility of DNA depends primarily on the agarose concentration in the gel, strength of the applied current, the ionic strength o...|$|R
40|$|Stiffness is a {{fundamental}} indicator of the functional state of articular cartilage. Reported test modes include compressive incremental strain to determine the equilibrium modulus, and sinusoidal strain to determine the dynamic modulus and stress/strain loss angle. Here, initial development is described for a method recognizing that gait is pulsatile. <b>Agarose</b> <b>gels</b> {{have been used by}} others for validation or comparison of mechanical test methods and models for cartilage and proteoglycan aggregate. Accordingly, gels ranging from 0. 5 to 20 % agarose were prepared. Pulsatile stiffness in both indentation and unconfined compression were closely reproducible. Stiffness as a function of agarose concentration rose exponentially, as found using other methods. Indentation stiffness was higher than for unconfined compression and ranged from approximately 2. 0 kPa for 0. 5 % gel to approximately 3, 800 kPa for 20 % gel. Pulsatile dynamic stiffness appears to be a useful method, although further development is needed. <b>Agarose</b> <b>gel</b> stiffness values obtained by other methods were reviewed for comparison. Unfortunately, reported values for a given agarose concentration ranged widely (e. g. fourfold) even when test methods were similar. Causes appear to include differences in molecular weight and <b>gel</b> <b>preparation</b> time-temperature regimens. Also, agarose is hygroscopic, leading to unintended variations in <b>gel</b> composition. <b>Agarose</b> <b>gels</b> are problematic materials for validation or comparison of cartilage mechanical test methods and models...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concentration}} of gel affects {{the resolution of}} DNA separation. For a standard <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis, a 0.8% gives good separation or resolution of large 5-10kb DNA fragments, while 2% gel gives good resolution for small 0.2-1kb fragments. 1% gels is often used for a standard electrophoresis. [...] The concentration is measured in weight of agarose over volume of buffer used (g/ml). High percentage gels are often brittle and may not set evenly, while low percentage gels (0.1-0.2%) are fragile and not easy to handle.

A 317 -bp segment within the M. tuberculosis-specific insertion sequence IS 6110 was amplified. The detection limit of the PCR assay for cultured mycobacteria was 50 cells per reaction by ethidium bromide-stained <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> electrophoresis and 5 cells per reaction by hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe conjugated with either digoxigenin or alkaline phosphatase (AP).

The patients were between 35 and 70 years of age. Three patients were male, and 65 were female. A volume of 0. 5 - 1. 0 mL of <b>agarose</b> <b>gel</b> was sufficient for each lip.
