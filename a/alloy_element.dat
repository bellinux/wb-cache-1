Understanding of these effects may help to control and produce products with desired properties at lower cost. In the present work the effects of Al, Si and Mn on the recrystallization behavior, hardness and microstructural changes of an Fe- containing brass during annealing were studied. The results show that <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> strongly affect recrystallization kinetics and resulted finer microstructures. Hardness variations during annealing are consistent with microstructural observations {{and the presence of}} <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> All elements slow down recrystallization progress and increase resulted hardness values.

The total <b>alloy</b> <b>element</b> content is low, therefore it is low cost, but its hardenability is high. After carburizing and quenching, the carburized layer is martensite plus carbide, its hardness exceeds 58 HRC, so the surface wear resistance is good, and substrate is a thin lath martensite.
