These observations {{have been carried out}} at Abu-Simbel Site of Egypt in October 1975. The observational site (Φ= 22 o) lies too near to the Tropic Cancer, at which <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zodiacal <b>light</b> cone perpendiculars to the horizon. The results show that <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zodiacal <b>light</b> is inclined to the normal by 1. 59 o in blue color and 1. 18 o in yellow color. This means that there is a slight variation in Zodiacal light’s axis with wavelength, and the axis almost coincide with the ecliptic. The present results for blue color can be considered as the first one in the world near <b>the</b> Tropic <b>of</b> Cancer. 1.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{documented}} that several types of cephalopods, most notably squid and octopuses, and potentially cuttlefish, have eyes that can distinguish <b>the</b> orientation <b>of</b> polarized <b>light.</b> This sensitivity is due to <b>the</b> orthogonal organization <b>of</b> neighboring photoreceptors. (Cephalopods have receptor cells called rhabdoms {{similar to those of}} other molluscs.) To illustrate, the vertebrate eye is normally insensitive to polarization differences because visual pigment in rods and cones is arrayed semi-randomly, and is thereby equally sensitive to any orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> e-vector <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> Because <b>of</b> their orthogonal organization, the visual pigment molecules in cephalopod eyes have <b>the</b> highest <b>light</b> absorption when aligned properly with <b>the</b> <b>light</b> e-vector axis, allowing sensitivity to differences in polarization. [...] <b>The</b> precise function <b>of</b> this ability has not been proven, but is hypothesized to be for prey detection, navigation, and possibly communication among the color-changing cephalopods.|$|R

Although excitation using circularly-polarized light does not result in optical orientation of spins in graphene unless an additional magnetic field is present, we show that excitation with linearly-polarized light at normal incidence yields spin current injection without magnetic field. Spins are polarized within the graphene plane and are displaced in opposite directions, with no net charge displacement. <b>The</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spin current is determined by <b>the</b> linear polarization <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> and <b>the</b> injection rate {{is proportional to the}} intensity.

2500|$|<b>The</b> {{simplest}} type <b>of</b> birefringence {{is described}} as uniaxial, meaning {{that there is a}} single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior. This special direction is known as <b>the</b> optic <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material. <b>Light</b> whose polarization is perpendicular to the optic axis is governed by a refractive index no (for [...] "ordinary").

For any ray direction there is a linear polarization direction perpendicular to the optic axis, and this is called an ordinary ray.

50|$|Coma is an {{inherent}} property of telescopes using parabolic mirrors. Unlike a spherical mirror, {{a bundle of}} parallel rays parallel to the optical axis will be perfectly focused to a point (the mirror is free of spherical aberration), {{no matter where they}} strike the mirror. However, this is only true if the rays are parallel to <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parabola. When the incoming rays strike the mirror at an angle, individual rays are not reflected to the same point. When looking at a point that is not perfectly aligned with <b>the</b> optical <b>axis,</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incoming <b>light</b> from that point will strike the mirror at an angle. This results in an image that is not in <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field looking wedge-shaped. The further off-axis (or the greater the angle subtended by the point with the optical axis), the worse this effect is. This causes stars to appear to have a cometary coma, hence the name.|$|R
40|$|Photometric and {{kinematic}} {{data from}} the literature are combined with new dynamical models to derive <b>the</b> intrinsic shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'standard' elliptical galaxy NGC 3379. The parameters that are best constrained are the dynamical triaxiality T (essentially <b>the</b> triaxiality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total mass distribution) and the short-to long <b>axis</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> distribution c(sub L). The inferred shape is given by a Bayesian probability distribution in the (T, c(sub L) plane. Assuming a uniform prior, the most probable shape is oblate with a flattening of c(sub L) = 87. The distribution is strongly non-Gaussian, however, and the expectation values, (T) =. 31 (c(sub L) =. 75, imply a flatter and more triaxial figure. The 68 % highest posterior density region allows more triaxial shapes {{as long as they}} are fairly round, or flatter shapes {{as long as they are}} nearly oblate. These results are essentially unchanged if the galaxy is assumed to rotate about its short axis, or if it is modeled as an S 0 with a negligible-mass disk rather than as an elliptical. <b>The</b> suggestion <b>of</b> Capaccioli et al. (ApJ, 371, 535 (1991)) that NGC 3379 is a rather flat, triaxial S 0 galaxy is found to be improbable at the 98 % level; this conclusion is largely independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulge-to-disk ratio or the relative rotation speeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two components...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} kinematical data for 204 {{globular}} clusters in <b>the</b> halo <b>of</b> M 87. Beyond 3 r_eff along <b>the</b> major <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy <b>light,</b> these globular clusters exhibit substantial rotation (~ 300 +/- 70 km/s) {{that translates into}} an equally substantial spin (lambda ~ 0. 18). <b>The</b> present appearance <b>of</b> M 87 is most likely <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> a single major merger, since this event is best able to account for so sizable a spin. A rotation this large makes improbable any significant accretion of material after this merger, since that would have diluted the rotation signature. We see weak evidence for a difference between <b>the</b> kinematics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal-poor and metal-rich population, {{in the sense that}} the metal-poor globular clusters appear to dominate the rotation. If, as we suspect, the last major merger event of M 87 was mainly dissipationless and did not trigger <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a large number <b>of</b> globular clusters, <b>the</b> kinematic difference between the two could reflect their orbital properties in the progenitor galaxies; these differences would be compatible with these progenitors having formed in dissipational mergers.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which fully developed chloroplasts divide {{has been reported to}} consist of an initial constriction around the entire chloroplast, which is followed by a pinching into two daughter chloroplasts. Constriction is accompanied by fusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner and outer layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chloroplast membrane. Such a division has been documented by electron microscopy for the brown alga, Fucus (yon Wettstein, 1), and the red alga, Lomentaria (Bouck, 2). In Fucus <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> division is usually parallel to <b>the</b> longitudinal <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chloroplast lamellae. <b>Light</b> microscopic observations of mature chloroplasts dividing by constriction have been made in land plants ranging from bryophytes through the angiosperms (3, 4). Division of pro-plastids in higher plants (5) is similar to the con-dition reported for algal chloroplasts, in that pinching also is accompanied by fusion <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chloroplast membrane. A second method of mature chloroplast division is described in this paper. The mature chloroplast is divided by <b>the</b> centripetal invagination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner-limiting membrane.

The polarized FTIR reveals that the director rotates about the (y) axis normal to the original director (x axis) and field directions (z axis), and the nematic order remains unchanged in the plane where the director stays confined during rotation. <b>The</b> rotation angle <b>of</b> director (θ) is estimated {{as a function of}} imposed voltage amplitude on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absorbances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyano group which is aligned along <b>the</b> long <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mesogen for <b>light</b> linearly polarized in the x and y directions. The director-rotation drives a two-dimensional macroscopic deformation which is characterized by a contraction along the x axis, an extension in the z direction, and nonappreciable length change along the y axis. The strain in the x direction is linearly proportional to sin 2 [*]θ in agreement with <b>the</b> expectation <b>of</b> soft or semisoft elasticity theory for thin nematic elastomer films where the shear contribution becomes negligibly small...|$|R
