40|$|ABSTRACT Rat {{cerebral}} microvascular endothelial {{cells were}} infected with Schmidt-Ruppin Rous sarcoma virus-strain D (SR-RSV-D), an avian retrovirus. A single focus of transformed cells was isolated {{and the resultant}} cell line designated RCE-T 1. The specificity for SR-RSV-D transformation was determined by virus rescue assay and demonstration of virus-specific antigens. RCE-T 1 cells are virogenic when fused with chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) and do not produce infectious virus {{as demonstrated by the}} absence of detectable virus in culture fluid from these cells alone. Studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for avian retrovirus-coded internal proteins show that RSV-transformed endothelial cells contain mainly p 27 and react to some extent to p 19 and p 15 viral antigens. These data demonstrate conclusively that the transformation event was indeed due to SR-RSV-D. In addition, chromosome analysis confirmed these cells to be of rat origin. RSV-transformed endothelial cells express the typical array of transformation-related properties such as anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar, decreased cell <b>adhesiveness,</b> <b>ability</b> to grow in low serum, and capability of producing tumors in newborn rats. Demonstration of differentiated endothelial characteristics included positive immunofluorescent stainin...|$|E

Demonstration of differentiated endothelial characteristics included positive immunofluorescent staining for factor VIII antigen and angiotensin-converting enzyme and histochemical localization of gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase activity. This cell line should provide a useful model to study not only specialized biochemical and other functional characteristics of cerebrovascular endothelium but also the cellular mechanisms that involve the transition from normal to neoplastic expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) locomotion and the exocytosis of neutrophil cytoplasmic granules was studied by assessing these processes in cells migrating through micropore filters and {{by measuring the}} effects of degranulating stimuli on PMN chemotaxis, orientation, <b>adhesiveness,</b> and <b>ability</b> to bind the chemoattractant f-Met-Leu-[3 H]Phe. Studies of cells migrating through cellulose nitrate filters indicated that concentrations of f-Met-Leu-Phe optimal for exocytosis were greater than those optimal for chemotaxis and actually inhibited cell migration. In other studies incubation of PMNs with concentrations of secretagogues causing exocytosis of 30 % or greater PMN lysozyme increased cell adhesiveness and inhibited chemotaxis. PMNs that had secreted more than 30 % lysozyme appeared round, did not orient in a gradient of chemoattractant, and were capable of significantly less f-Met-Leu-[3 H]Phe binding than were control cells. The decreased binding of f-Met-Leu-Phe {{was not associated with}} hydrolysis of chemotactic peptide by washed cells, although peptide hydrolysis was caused by cell products secreted extracellularly after vigorous exocytosis. In contrast, when only 10 [...] 15 % cellular lysozyme was released f-Met-Leu-Phe binding was enhanced significantly and there was no depression of chemotaxis. The data indicate limited exocytosis of intracellular granule contents is associated with increased availability of PMN cehmotactic factor receptors. Vigorous exocytosis is associated with inactivation of chemotactic responsiveness related to increase cell adhesiveness, decreased PMN binding of chemotactic factors, and to hydrolysis of chemoattractants by factors secreted extracellularly...|$|R
40|$|The spinnbarkeit {{of saliva}} {{reflects}} {{the ability of}} saliva to adhere to surfaces within the mouth, thereby serving as a protective role and aiding in lubrication. Therefore, alterations in the extensional rheology of saliva may result in the loss in <b>adhesiveness</b> or the <b>ability</b> to bind onto surfaces. Mucin glycoproteins and their structures {{are known to be}} important factors for the extensional rheological properties of saliva. The conformation of mucin depends on factors such as pH and ionic strength. Chewing {{is one of the main}} stimuli for salivary secretion but creates significant sheer stress on the salivary film which could influence mouthfeel perceptions. The current study investigates the possible factors which affect the extensional rheological properties of saliva by comparing submandibular/sublingual saliva with different oral stimuli within the same group of subjects. Unstimulated and stimulated saliva (chew, smell and taste) salivas were collected primarily from submandibular/sublingual glands. The saliva samples were measured for Spinnbarkeit followed by the measuring mucin, total protein, total calcium and bicarbonate concentrations. The results indicated correlations between rheological properties and mucin/ion concentrations. However, chewing stimulated submandibular/sublingual saliva is shown to have significantly lower Spinnbarkeit, but factors such as mucin, protein and calcium concentrations did not account for this variation. Analysis of the concentration of bicarbonate and pH appears to suggest that it has a prominent effect on extensional rheology of saliva...|$|R
30|$|For {{the first}} time, RF {{magnetron}} sputtering {{was used to}} prepare calcium orthophosphate coatings in 1992 (Cooley et al. 1992). Since then, {{it has become a}} convenient method for deposition of biocompatible ceramic coatings, layers and films on various substrates (Yamashita et al. 1994; Jansen et al. 1993; Wolke et al. 1994, 1998, 2003; van Dijk et al. 1995, 1996; Nelea et al. 2003, 2004; Feddes et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ding 2003; Yamaguchi et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2007; Ozeki et al. 2007; Ueda et al. 2007; Snyders et al. 2008; Ievlev et al. 2008; Toque et al. 2009). The advantages of magnetron sputtering over other sputtering processes include a high deposition rate, an excellent <b>adhesiveness</b> and an <b>ability</b> to coat implants with difficult surface geometries (Table[*] 3). Still, several issues, such as the endurance and the Ca/P ratio, have to be solved before magnetron sputtering can be applied to deposit, on a routine basis, pure and crystalline calcium orthophosphates on implant surfaces. For example, both microstructure and mechanical properties of HA thin films, grown on Ti- 5 Al- 2.5 Fe alloys by RF magnetron sputtering, were investigated (Nelea et al. 2003). The deposition was performed from pure HA target in low pressure Ar or Ar-O 2 mixtures at substrate temperatures ranging from 70 °C to 550 °C. Smooth (an average roughness of approximately 50 [*]nm) and uniform calcium orthophosphate films were fabricated. It was observed that the films grown at the substrate temperatures below approximately 300 °C were prevalently amorphous (ACP) and contained a small amount of crystalline phases. On the contrary, the films obtained at a substrate temperature of 550 °C or the films grown at room temperature followed by annealing at 550 °C consisted of HA (Nelea et al. 2003).|$|R
