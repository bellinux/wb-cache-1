5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two eggs in <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported on a branch, stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share {{the tasks of}} incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as using}} holes for breeding, great spotted {{woodpeckers}} roost at night, and sometimes during the day, in old nest cavities, excavated by other woodpeckers. They will occasionally {{make a new}} roosting hole or use an artificial site such as <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> box.|$|E
5|$|At any size, a meat ant nest {{always has}} a {{possibility}} of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, {{as suggested by the}} antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of <b>a</b> <b>nest,</b> satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (<b>a</b> <b>nest</b> is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>nested</b> UTID {{is defined}} as the id {{component}} of a UTID is another UTID. Therefore, the id component of <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> UTID MUST contain dns component and follow the UTID syntax. On the contrary, a UTID in which id component contains dns component is not necessary to be <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> UTID. Whether <b>a</b> UTID is <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> UTID is determined both by the syntax and the usage context of the UTID.|$|R
40|$|Let h ≥ 1. For each {{admissible}} v, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> balanced path design H(v, 2 h + 1, 1). For each admissible odd v, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> balanced path design H(v, 2 h, 1). For every v ≡ 4 (mod 6), v ≥ 10, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> balanced path design H(v, 4, 1) except possibly if v ∈ { 16, 52, 70 }. For each v ≡ 0 (mod 4 h), v ≥ 4 h, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> path design P (v, 2 h+ 1, 1). For each v ≡ 0 (mod 4 h − 2), v ≥ 4 h − 2, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> path design P (v, 2 h, 1). For every v ≡ 3 (mod 6), v ≥ 9, we exhibit <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> path design P (v, 4, 1) except possibly if v = 39. ...|$|R
50|$|Individual {{elements}} can be inserted, updated, and deleted in <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> table. Since individual elements can {{be modified}} in <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> table, they are more flexible than an array because elements in an array can only be modified as a whole, not individually. <b>A</b> <b>nested</b> table doesn't have a maximum size, and an arbitrary number of elements {{can be stored in}} it.|$|R
5|$|In November 2007, {{a special}} edition of Time on Earth was {{released}} featuring a colour altered cover. The cover's main background area, which was previously a sandy-wheat colour, was converted into an aqua-teal colour, while the tree in the image had a bird in <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> added to it.|$|E
5|$|In Wasmannian mimicry, {{the mimic}} resembles {{a model that}} it lives along with in <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> or colony. Most of the models here are social insects such as ants, termites, bees and wasps.|$|E
5|$|Most other bees, {{including}} familiar insects such as carpenter bees, leafcutter {{bees and}} mason bees are solitary {{in the sense}} that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and worker bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor beeswax.|$|E
30|$|The {{formulated}} {{model in}} Section  2.2 is <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> two-stage robust optimization problem which {{is shown in}} Section  2.2. 3. We apply <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> Benders decomposition algorithm to solve this problem.|$|R
40|$|Network mobility, i. e. Internet access {{services}} for a moving network {{as a single}} unit brings about new challenging issues. <b>A</b> <b>nested</b> mobile network is a hierarchical form of multiple mobile networks. Nested mobile networks suffer from a pinball routing problem. This problem becomes more serious {{in the case of}} a communication between any two nodes in the same nested mobile network. To solve this sub-optimality, we propose <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> NEMO route optimization (NNRO) protocol to retain the mobility transparency as the NEMO basic support protocol and to reduce the communication cost of any two nodes in <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> mobile network. The results of simulation reveal that the proposed NNRO protocol efficiently supports communication within <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> mobile network...|$|R
30|$|In fact, {{some of the}} {{literature}} takes this into consideration by using <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> logit model (e.g., [23, 24, 25]). The extension of the demand model to <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> model is <b>an</b> interesting and important topic, which we leave for future research.|$|R
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> had been detected. A small video camera and infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>nest</b> box {{can also}} be {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
40|$|By using a recently-proposed quantum-like {{approach}} in semiclassical approximation, the equilibrium {{state of the}} particle distribution is given in a simple 1 -D model of <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> trap. This result is {{used to evaluate the}} antihydrogen recombination rate in <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> trap containing antiprotons and positrons...|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>nested</b> (or, hierarchical) {{metalanguage}} {{is similar}} to an ordered metalanguage in that each level represents {{a greater degree of}} abstraction. However, <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> metalanguage differs from an ordered one in that each level includes the one below. The paradigmatic example of <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> metalanguage comes from the Linnean taxonomic system in biology. Each level in the system incorporates the one below it. The language used to discuss genus is also used to discuss species; the one used to discuss orders is also used to discuss genera, etc., up to kingdoms.|$|R

5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating <b>a</b> <b>nest,</b> or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for <b>a</b> <b>nest,</b> and both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E
5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which {{in the darkness of the}} night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
50|$|The Vindelfjällen {{nature reserve}} is <b>a</b> <b>nesting</b> site for {{many species of}} birds, due to its wide variety of habitats, but {{especially}} its many wetlands, including in particular those around Lake Tärnasjön and in the Marsivagge Valley. The Marsivagge Valley alone is considered <b>a</b> <b>nesting</b> site for about 120 different species.|$|R

30|$|All four methods {{assume that}} all {{vertices}} belong to <b>a</b> single <b>nested</b> component but, in general, {{this is not necessarily}} true. Such <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> component might include solely a subset of vertices while the others (although included into the network dataset) may not be part of it. Therefore, devising a method that identifies the vertices that belong to <b>a</b> <b>nested</b> component is <b>an</b> important methodological advance, which previous methods have not addressed.|$|R
5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build <b>a</b> <b>nest)</b> sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species crosswise in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which is of no special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} found that rice rats {{assimilate}} 88% to 95% of the energy in their food. They lose weight when fed on Spartina, fiddler crabs, or sunflower seeds alone, but a diet consisting of several of those items or of mealworms is adequate to maintain weight. In an experiment, marsh rice rats did not show hoarding behavior, but wild rice rats have been observed carrying food to <b>a</b> <b>nest.</b> Even when they live in uplands, they mostly eat water plants and animals, although they consume some upland plants.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{breeding}} biology of the black catbird. Its breeding season appears to run from spring through summer; nest building was observed in Belize in early May, and small young were found in <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> in Mexico in mid-August. The nest, an open cup of twigs lined with rootlets and other fine material, is placed low in a dense bush or small tree. The female lays two greenish-blue eggs. However, details of nest-building, incubation times, parental care, fledging periods and number of broods are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those of honey bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in <b>a</b> <b>nest.</b> Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|Populations of the {{peregrine}} falcon have bounced back {{in most parts}} of the world. In Britain, there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s. This has been greatly assisted by conservation and protection work led by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. The RSPB has estimated that there are 1,402 breeding pairs in the UK. Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas, especially in the west and north, and nest in some urban areas, capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food. In Southampton, <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months, after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered <b>a</b> <b>nest</b> in the mast, and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, on pain of a possible prison sentence, from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged. In many parts of the world {{peregrine falcon}}s have adapted to urban habitats, nesting on cathedrals, skyscraper window ledges, tower blocks, and the towers of suspension bridges. Many of these nesting birds are encouraged, sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras.|$|E
