40|$|Abstract: Foreign <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> have {{increased}} considerably {{during the last}} decades targeting, apart from the economic development of recipients, several goals related to their democratization process. In this paper we investigate whether aggregate <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> affect the transition of recipient countries to democracy. To this end, we introduce a two-stage binary response model and we use annual data on Net Official Development Assistance covering the period 1967 - 1999 for 64 aid-recipients. We find robust evidence that <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> are negatively associated with the likelihood of democratization in the recipient country and that this adverse effect of aid is stronger in countries with bad economic and social conditions. We also find some evidence that the negative effect of aid on the political regime is moderated when <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> are accompanied by economic liberalization...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} foreign <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> on public sector behaviour in developing countries. It contributes to the fiscal response literature on two main fronts. Firstly, it provides a new fiscal response model.

The key findings of the paper can be summarised as follows. 1) Public investment is positively related to <b>aid</b> <b>flows.</b> 2) With regard to government consumption, the evidence shows that <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> do not increase non-developmental expenditure, whilst their impact on developmental expenditure is positive and significant. 3) Aid {{does not appear to}} reduce government revenue collection efforts.

We improve on earlier studies on this topic by addressing {{the problem of the}} endogenous aid allocation using GDP levels of donor countries as instruments. A more structural addition to the literature is that we efficiently control for unobserved country specific effects in typical conflict onset and conflict continuation models by first differencing. The literature often overlooks the dynamic nature of these types of models, thereby forcing unlikely i. i. d. structures on the error terms implicitly. 1 As a consequence, malfunctioning institutions, deep-rooted political grievances, or any other obvious, yet unobserved and time persistent determinants of war are simply assumed away. We find a statistically significant and economically important negative effect of foreign <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> on the probability of ongoing civil conflicts to continue (the continuation probability), such that increasing <b>aid</b> <b>flows</b> tends to decrease civil conflict duration.

5000|$|Whiley {{takes an}} unusual {{approach}} to type checking {{referred to as}} [...] "Flow Typing". In this scheme, variables can have different static types {{at different points in}} a function or method. Furthermore, on the true branch of a runtime type test, the variable being tested is retyped automatically (rather than requiring an explicit cast). Flow typing is similar to occurrence typing as found in Racket. [...] To <b>aid</b> <b>flow</b> typing, Whiley supports union, intersection and negation types. [...] Union types are comparable to sum types found in functional languages like Haskell but, in Whiley, they are not disjoint. Intersection and negation types are used in the context of flow typing to determine the type of a variable on the true and false branches of a runtime type test. For example, suppose a variable [...] of type [...] and a runtime type test [...] On the true branch, the type of [...] becomes [...] whilst, on the false branch, it becomes [...] Whiley is also unusual in employing a structural rather than nominal type system.
