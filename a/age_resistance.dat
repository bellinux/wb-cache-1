40|$|The {{development}} of <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> by mice {{has been reported}} {{for a number of}} viral infections including infection wth foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Skinner (1) and Graves and Poppensiek (2) found that mice are rather uniformly susceptible to FMDV until they are approximately 2 weeks old, after which they progressively become resistant. At 5 to 6 weeks of age very few remain susceptible. Although <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> has been demonstrated many times, the mechanism of this resistance is not clear (3). A number of possibilities have been investigated or suggested including blocking of virus pathways (4 - 7), production of inhibitory substances (8), production of more effective immunological responses with maturation (9, 10), and hormonal effects (11). There is also the possibility that <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> is related to the production during maturation of cells resistant to virus infection. The studies of Goodman and Koprowski (12) and Kantoch et al. (13) on the association of cell susceptibility to susceptibility of cell donors provide evidence for this hypothesis. Previous to these investigations, Sabin and Olitsky (5) found a relation between intramuscular multiplication of vesicular stomatitis virus and age of the animal, and recently Lerner et al. (14) reported a similar relationship with Coxsackie A 4 virus. Also working with Coxsackie viruses, Kunin (15) obtained evidence which indicated that the susceptibility of animals at various ages was related to the relative amount of receptor-like substances in the tissues. The experiments presented here were performed, therefore, to investigate the possibility of a cellular mechanism for the {{development of}} <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> to FMDV. Kidney cells from mice 1 through 5 weeks of age were exposed to virus, and virus growth curves were obtained by assay of samples removed at various intervals. These growth curves were then compared to determine if a relationship existed between virus production and age of the cell donors...|$|E

40|$|Declined vasorelaxation {{function}} in <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arteries {{is responsible for}} aging-related multiple organ dysfunctions. The aim {{of the present study}} is to explore the role of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arterial vasorelaxation dysfunction and the possible mechanism. In the present study, young (3 - 4 months olds) and aging (20 months olds) male SD rats were randomized to receive vehicle (Saline) or FeTMPyP (ONOO- scavenger) for 2 weeks. The vasorelaxation of resistance arteries was determined in vitro; NOx level was tested by a colorimetric assay; the expression of nitrotyrosine (NT), soluble Guanylate Cyclase (sGC), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphorylated VASP (P-VASP) and cGMP in resistance arteries were detected by immunohistochemical staining. In the present study, endothelium-dependent dilation in <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arteries was lower than in those from young rats (young vs. aging: 68. 0 % ± 4. 5 % vs. 50. 4 % ± 2. 9 %, P< 0. 01). And the endothelium-independent dilation remained constant. Compared with young rats, aging increased nitrative stress in resistance arteries, evidenced by elevated NOx production in serum (5. 3 ± 1. 0 nmol/ml vs. 3. 3 ± 1. 4 nmol/ml, P< 0. 05) and increased NT expression (P< 0. 05). ONOO- was responsible for the vasorelaxation dysfunction, evidenced by normalized vasorelaxation after inhibit ONOO- or its sources (P< 0. 05) and suppressed NT expression after FeTMPyP treatment (P< 0. 05). The expression of sGC was not significantly different between young and <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> arteries, but the cGMP level and P-VASP/VASP ratio (biochemical marker of NO-sGC-cGKs signaling) decreased, which was reversed by FeTMPyP treatment in vivo (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{has shown that}} <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> to R. cesticillus, {{manifested}} by worm destrobilization, occurred in male chickens. In females, <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> developed more rapidly than in males, until the birds were about 84 days old and from this age onwards the manifestations of resistance declined. The roles of immune responses, mucus secretion and host hormone balance {{in the development of}} <b>age</b> <b>resistance</b> to R. cesticillus were subsequently investigated. Host resistance to superinfection with R. cesticillus was demonstrated {{for the first time and}} this resistance was inhibited by the immunosuppressant dexamethasone. Further evidence for the immunogenicity of the cestode was provided by histological studies and by the demonstration of immunocytes and of ring precipitin and immunofluorescent antibodies. Experimental evidence suggested that these antibodies are not protective and it is probable the protective immune response is cellular. An in vitro culture system, described by Schiller (1970), kept young adult cestodes in an active condition for more than eight days, although growth was poor. Chicken intestinal mucus extracts were shown to be lethal to R. cesticillus in vitro and mucus from old birds appeared to have a greater effect than 'young' mucus. The effects of gonadal steroids on the course of infection of R. cesticillus were investigated by caponising male birds and implanting oestradiol or testosterone pellets. This procedure reproduced to some degree the patterns of infection of R. cesticillus observed in intact, untreated, mature birds. Scolex transplantation and the correlation of worm weights down the intestine with destrobilization strongly implicated intestinal environmental factors as being responsible for the phenomenon of worm destrobilization.

In order to evaluate whether GO (1 % and 3 % by weight of asphalt) can improve the <b>aging</b> <b>resistance</b> performance of the asphalt, 80 / 100 penetration grade asphalt (90 A) and styrene–butadiene–styrene modified asphalt (SBS MA) were used to prepare the GO modified asphalt by the melt blending method. The surface morphology of the GO was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The UV aging test was conducted to simulate the aging during the service period.

For each zirconia grade, samples were kept ‘as sintered’ (untreated) or were subjected {{to one of the}} three surface treatments: rough polished, sandblasted with Al 2 O 3, tribochemical silica sandblasted (n = 3 /group). The tetragonal to monoclinic transformation was evaluated by X-ray diffraction at several intervals during LTD testing up to 40 h in steam in an autoclave (134 °C, 2 bar). Results. The five yttria-stabilized TZP (Y-TZP: Aadva, In-CeramYZ, IPS e. max ZirCAD, LAVA Frame, LAVA Plus) zirconia showed a similar trend in LTD behavior. The Al 2 O 3 sandblasted zirconia showed the highest monoclinic volume fraction. The as sintered (untreated) zirconia degraded faster than the surface-treated zirconia. Although the surface-treated ceria-stabilized TZP/alumina (Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 : NANOZR) zirconia had a higher initial monoclinic volume fraction compared to the Y-TZP zirconia, it showed a stronger <b>aging</b> <b>resistance.</b> The as sintered (untreated) Y-TZP/alumina (Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 : ZirTough) zirconia showed a strong <b>aging</b> <b>resistance,</b> whereas the surface-treated Y-TZP/Al 2 O 3 zirconia degraded slightly.

The increased aging stability with increasing Sc 2 O 3 content and the optimum content of 0. 4 - 0. 6 mol% Nd 2 O 3 or 0. 2 - 0. 4 mol% La 2 O 3, resulting in the highest <b>aging</b> <b>resistance,</b> could be directly related to the constituent phases and the lattice parameters of the remaining tetragonal zirconia.

The resistance towards oxidation of the different copolyalkenamers was carried out using a viscosity measurement method. A critical time, corresponding to a brutal increase of the apparent viscosity, was related to degradation of the polymers and was shown {{to be dependent on}} the Csp(2) proportion in the structure. The absence of vinylic units and the decrease of the double bonds content within the copolymers were proved to enhance the stability of the copolyalkenamers towards <b>aging</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|R
