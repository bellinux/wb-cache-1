5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program {{instruction}} or data. In a program instruction, bits 0–12 represented the memory <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture {{meant that the}} second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (instruction address); program instructions specified only the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the data in memory.|$|E

30|$|Similar to Chord, to join SHAM, node u {{contacts}} a bootstrapping server {{that holds}} the IP <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> nodes already situated in the system. The bootstrapping server responds with a list containing the IP <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> nodes that had recently joined the system. Discovering and contacting a node in the system engages procedures outside of the overlay, i.e., contacting a web-server that is known to provide the <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> nodes in SHAM. This server is simply a Rendezvous host that is not attached in anyway to overlay [17]. Hence, it does not impinge on the functionality of the mechanism such as node and key handling since its role is limited to providing <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> available nodes.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution.

The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating the matter, and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E
