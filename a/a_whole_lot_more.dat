500|$|James Berardinelli {{enjoyed the}} film. [...] "It's lighter, brighter, funnier, faster-paced, and <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> {{colorful}} than before." [...] Scott Beatty felt [...] "Tommy Lee Jones played Harvey Dent as a Joker knock-off {{rather than a}} multi-layered rogue." [...] Lee Bermejo called Batman Forever [...] "unbearable". Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert both gave the film mixed reviews, but with the former giving it a thumbs up and the latter a thumbs down. In his written review, Ebert wrote: [...] "Is the movie better entertainment? Well, it's great bubblegum for the eyes. Younger children {{will be able to}} process it more easily; some kids were led bawling from Batman Returns where the PG-13 rating was a joke." [...] Mick LaSalle had a mixed reaction, concluding [...] "a shot of Kilmer's rubber buns at one point is guaranteed to bring squeals from the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes on {{what she wanted to}} write about. After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS! They live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don’t count), and they are much bigger animals, with <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> potential for fighting".|$|E
500|$|Gavin Martin from The Mirror gave a mixed response, as he said: [...] "Nothing dates {{as quickly}} as pop that dares to call itself futuristic". Martin awarded the song 3/5 and {{concluded}} with [...] "It's not that this new number from the forthcoming Greatest Hits set is bad – but it's <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> routine than it pretends to be." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented on the possibly outdated dance theme. Responding to the new additions of the record including [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better", he noted: [...] "Not exactly what one would call original, but if it's true the singer's next studio album will reprise this electro-pop sound, Aguilera deserves credit for refusing to play it safe." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com awarded the track three stars. He noted Aguilera's dance-inspired effort, {{at a time of}} dance dominance in the industry, negatively and stated that [...] "the catchy electro-pop vibe isn't enough to make it one of her more memorable efforts." [...] Rolling Stone noted that in the compilation, Aguilera's old singles are [...] "weighed down by four bland attempts at 2008's trendy, Lady Gaga-jacking electropop". Paul Thompson and Amy Phillips from Pitchfork Media said that the track was [...] "basically a ripoff" [...] of Goldfrapp's [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E
5000|$|Born to Fight has {{received}} mixed reviews. Beyond Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "90-odd minutes of random over-the-top action shot to a throbbing techno soundtrack. It’s not Ong Bak, {{although it does}} come dangerously close to being that other movie’s bastard love child." [...] Scott Weinberg of DVD Talk gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying, [...] "So it's a little quaint and corny when compared to the American action flicks, but it's also got <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> of energy, <b>more</b> than enough action, and some truly staggering stunt work. Fun, crazy stuff all the way." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{past two}} years have been {{two of the most}} {{difficult}} I have faced. My journey as a student has nearly ended on numerous occasions, and {{if it were not for}} a few close people in my life I am not sure this paper could have been written. First of all I need to give massive thanks to Brian Harper who stepped up after my admitted hiatus of the brain, helped me get back on track and agreed to be my Committee Chair within the first thirty minutes of meeting me. Plus? You are HILARIOUS. THANK YOU. Secondly, I would like to give thanks to Stephen Duffy who has, on several occasions, paid for my lunches, software, and travel, and cracked me up in response to things I probably was not supposed to be laughing at. I am pretty sure that without you, my graduate school experience would have been completely different and sucked <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> helluva <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b> And even though you’re not here (insert squinty, menacing eyes here), I want to thank my academic advisor and resident statistical genius, Dr. Joshua Bagaka’s.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> than we do".|$|E
500|$|Similarly to the Warriors series, Seekers {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins to Victoria Holmes to develop another series {{about a group of}} animals, but not cats. Dogs were considered, but {{rejected}} because they were too close to cats in their hierarchical social organization, pack and hunting lifestyles, and territoriality. This was expressed by Victoria Holmes later in an online chat, where she stated that she [...] "was reluctant to create stories that... would be quite similar to Warriors. Dogs live in packs, they hunt for their food, they have a strict hierarchy within their communities, they guard their territories". Horses, otters and dolphins were considered, but were dismissed: Holmes felt that horses tended to run away rather than stay and fight, and that dolphin battles would be slow without [...] "the all-action excitement that Erin loves so much". In the end, the company left the decision to Holmes and she opted for bears; in the later author chat she notes that bears [...] "live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don't count), and they are much bigger animals, with <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> potential for fighting". The series took inspiration from Inuit beliefs and Native American languages. Holmes found that Native Americans and bears are very closely linked to the natural environment. The names of the bears are taken from several different Native American languages. Lusa, for example, means [...] "black" [...] in Choctaw.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Thomas from suite101.com {{described}} it as [...] "a tale of one less fortunate than herself; one who needs the love, care and support {{of those who are}} more fortunate". Another reviewer said that [...] "On its surface, 'Albertine' is a song about a tall and beautiful girl who survived the Rwandan genocide. Really, though, it’s a song about <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b> Really, it’s a song about faith, it’s a song about hope, it’s a song about love… and it’s a song about deeds.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2016, O'Brien {{noted that}} only a few pages of the book {{revolved}} around Trump's net worth. O'Brien said that Trump's offense toward the net-worth claim was [...] "a measure of his deep insecurity. His wealth and the size of his wealth ... are integral to how he wants people to perceive him." [...] That month, Trump told The Washington Post, [...] "I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more.</b> I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about."

2500|$|At a young age, Kennedy began {{collecting}} Florida folklore material and wrote poetry about Florida nature. His views on {{race relations in}} the South were largely influenced by his family's black maid, known only as [...] "Flo", whom Kennedy considered [...] "almost like a mother". During his childhood in the 1920s, he witnessed local Klan members beating and raping Flo while she was tied to a tree for [...] "sassing whitefolks" [...] after she questioned a white bus driver who had given her incorrect change. Recalling this incident later in life, Kennedy said, [...] "At a very tender age, I became aware that grownups were lying about <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> than Santa Claus", {{in reference to the}} Klan's claims of being Christian patriots.|$|E

2500|$|Kenneth Turan of NPR {{criticized the}} film, arguing: [...] "It's been 50 years since Hollywood first started flirting with 3-D movies, {{and the special}} glasses {{required}} for viewing have gotten <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> substantial. The stories being filmed are just as flimsy. Of course Beowulf does have a more impressive literary pedigree than, say, Bwana Devil. But you'd never know that {{by looking at the}} movie. Beowulf's story of a hero who slays monsters has become a fanboy fantasy that panders with demonic energy to the young male demographic." [...] Manohla Dargis of the New York Times compared the poem with the film stating that, [...] "If you don't remember this evil babe from the poem, it's because she's almost entirely the invention of the screenwriters Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman and the director Robert Zemeckis, who together have plumped her up in words, deeds and curves. These creative interventions aren't especially surprising given the source material and the nature of big-studio adaptations. There's plenty of action in Beowulf, but even its more vigorous bloodletting pales next to its rich language, exotic setting and mythic grandeur." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{release the}} band began {{to promote the}} album by {{featuring}} in their own television series, Chasing The Saturdays, which the first episode brought in 914,000 viewers in the United States. The show got mostly positive reviews: The New York Daily News gave the show 3/5 stars: [...] "What seems to come easy is the frilly part of the girl group thing. They clearly work hard on looking stylish, the way their audiences would dream about. They also lead gossip-friendly lives. We don't learn <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> about them, but then, most fans aren’t looking for complex biography." [...] Although the band revealed {{that they would not}} continue the show for a second season. But were thinking about featuring in a Christmas special. The band released an EP in North America to introduce themselves to the American market, with the same title as the TV show, which was released on 27 January 2013. The TV show featured snipped versions of tracks which would later appear on the album, including [...] "Somebody Else's Life", which acted as the opening title to the show. The band began a promotional tour and appeared on a number of different talk shows in America, including: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Jeff Probst Show, Fashion Police, Chelsea Lately and The Today Show in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, they probably would be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E

5000|$|The song {{is built}} around a {{pounding}} riff that Clark later admitted was based on [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] by Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. The song's refrain of [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better when you're gone" [...] betrays Clark's uncertainty about ending the relationship and whether such an act would be the answer to his problems or not. Mark Deming {{has pointed out that}} {{the use of the word}} [...] "probably" [...] in this refrain is key and lends the track a depth of subtext that was unusual for a pop song in the mid-1960s. Jim Dickson, The Byrds' manager, has noted that this level of subtext was not unusual in Clark's songs of the period. Said Dickson, [...] "There was always something to unravel in those songs, the non-explanation of the complex feeling. For instance, if you remember I'll Feel <b>a</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>Lot</b> Better, it doesn't say: [...] "I'll feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better", but [...] "I'll probably feel <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> better." [...] For me, that makes the song. There's a statement followed by a hesitation."
