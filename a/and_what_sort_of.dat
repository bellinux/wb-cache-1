They analyzed how the issue of human genome research was portrayed between 1999 and 2001 in popular quality newspapers in both Germany and the United States in comparison to the way it appeared on search engines {{at the time of their}} research. Their intention was to analyze what actors <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> opinions the subject generated in both print and the Internet and verify whether the online space proved to be a more democratic public sphere, with a wider range of sources and views.|$|E

500|$|Kawada's primary {{producer}} was I've producer Tomoyuki Nakazawa, who produced [...] "Radiance" [...] {{as well as}} her first three albums. Nakazawa also came up with each album's concept and title. However, in 2010, Kawada began to cooperate more with other producers and also began working more in Tokyo. When producing Square the Circle, Nakazawa asked Kawada what sort of album <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> songs did she want. Kawada said that she wanted an album whose songs would be reminiscent of her visual image and stage persona, as opposed to her private self.|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} of what defines film noir, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> category it is, provoke continuing debate. [...] "We'd be oversimplifying things in calling film noir oneiric, strange, erotic, ambivalent, and cruel"—this set of attributes constitutes {{the first of}} many attempts to define film noir made by French critics Raymond Borde and Étienne Chaumeton in their 1955 book Panorama du film noir américain 1941–1953 (A Panorama of American Film Noir), the original and seminal extended treatment of the subject. They emphasize that not every film noir embodies all five attributes in equal measure—one might be more dreamlike; another, particularly brutal. The authors' caveats and repeated efforts at alternative definition have been echoed in subsequent scholarship: in the more than five decades since, there have been innumerable further attempts at definition, yet in the words of cinema historian Mark Bould, film noir remains an [...] "elusive phenomenon always just out of reach".|$|E

500|$|Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the Federation {{was looking}} ever more tenuous {{and the idea}} of [...] "no {{independence}} before majority rule" [...] was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and [...] "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of [...] "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead and the governing United Federal Party (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that [...] "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs [...] "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> legislation can {{the people of this country}} expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Kikuuiki album {{sessions}} {{were influenced by}} the commercial success of [...] "Aruku Around", where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than [...] "Aruku Around"-style ones. The band {{did not want to}} make an album full of songs identical to [...] "Aruku Around", and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together. Yamaguchi felt {{that it was important to}} not release a second similar song immediately after [...] "Aruku Around", as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own Mixi or Twitter accounts. For these people, he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band. He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band, to break the cycle of a musical act becoming popular, then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them. Even before the single's success, the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band. On the other hand, the band attempted to keep a commercial sound, the same goal of Shin-shiro, or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted. This led the band trying to create pop art music, blending art with commercialism.|$|E
500|$|Describing {{the tone}} of the season, Loeb said, [...] "When we first started talking about Daredevil, we promised that we were telling a story that was first a crime drama and then a superhero show. This is more of a {{psychological}} thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together, and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world, that’s a very powerful, emotional place to start from." [...] On approaching rape and trauma in the season, Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape, which she called [...] "lazy storytelling" [...] and often a way to [...] "spice up" [...] male characters, and preferred to just make the trauma a part of the characters' everyday lives rather than an [...] "issue" [...] for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season, including the use of sex, Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity {{and the use of the}} word 'fuck' in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered, such as [...] "issues of choice, interracial relationships, domestic violence, [...] issues of consent" [...] while also exploring [...] "feminism and being a woman in this world", Rosenberg said, [...] "It was never our intention going in , and I think the minute you intend to do that, you’re stepping up on a soap box. If you’re digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through, and as women we go through, you’re going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect, you’re also going to hit social issues." ...|$|E

The {{primary purpose of the}} engine is transporting firefighters to the scene, providing a limited supply of water with which to fight the fire, and carrying [...] tools, equipment, and hoses needed by the firefighters. The tools carried on the fire engine will vary greatly based on many factors including the size of the department <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> terrain the department must handle. For example, departments located near large bodies of water or rivers are likely {{to have some sort of}} water rescue equipment. Standard tools found on nearly all fire engines include ladders, hydraulic rescue tools (often referred to as the jaws of life), floodlights, fire hose, fire extinguishers, self-contained breathing apparatus, and thermal imaging cameras.|$|E

She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all.
