5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} Belgian {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and crews were put <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|Fisher formed {{his only}} {{minority}} {{government and the}} First Fisher Ministry. The government amended the Seat of Government Act providing for the new federal capital {{to be in the}} Yass-Canberra area, passed the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act to provide bounties for iron and steel manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages, ordered three torpedo boat destroyers, and assumed local naval defence responsibility and placed the Australian Navy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Navy in wartime.|$|E
5|$|Stretford Public Hall {{was built}} in 1878 by John Rylands. It was {{designed}} by N. Lofthouse {{and is on the}} western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford's first public lending library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{committees}} differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison {{to those of the}} United States Congress, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the whole Parliament when needed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, {{who were to}} {{bear the brunt of}} the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, {{and said it}} was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the emperors, and the rulers were equally {{at the mercy of the}} Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E
5|$|With {{the decline}} of the Caliphate and its obvious {{inability}} to defend its border provinces, a new local dynasty, the Hamdanids, emerged as the principal antagonists of Byzantium in northern Mesopotamia and Syria. They were led by al-Hasan, called Nasir al-Dawla ("Defender of the State"), and by his younger brother Ali, best known by his epithet, Sayf al-Dawla ("Sword of the State"). In ca. 935, the Arab tribe of Banu Habib, defeated by the rising Hamdanids, defected in its entirety to the Byzantines, converted to Christianity, and placed its 12,000horsemen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Empire. They were settled along the western bank of the Euphrates and assigned to guard five new themes created there: Melitene, Charpezikion, Asmosaton (Arsamosata), Derzene, and Chozanon.|$|E
5|$|Although operationally placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the British, the AIF was {{administered}} {{as a separate}} national force, with the Australian government reserving {{the responsibility for the}} promotion, pay, clothing, equipment and feeding of its personnel. The AIF {{was administered}} separately from the home-based army in Australia, and a parallel system was set up to deal with non-operational matters including record-keeping, finance, ordnance, personnel, quartermaster and other issues. The AIF also had separate conditions of service, rules regarding promotion and seniority, and graduation list for officers. This responsibility initially fell to Bridges, in addition to his duties as its commander; however, an Administrative Headquarters was later set up in Cairo in Egypt. Following the redeployment of the Australian infantry divisions to the Western Front it was relocated to London. Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury.|$|E
5000|$|As such {{they were}} {{directly}} {{in command of}} the local mobile field army of the comitatenses, composed mostly of cavalry, which acted as a rapid reaction force. Other magistri remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Emperors, and were termed in praesenti ("in the presence" [...] of the Emperor). By the late 4th century, the regional commanders were termed simply magister militum.|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in algorithm recognition quality K 0.8 obtained for records for August and July 2009 is {{likely due to}} the fact that it was easier to carry out manual data processing by eye having <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> the algorithm recognition (August data), rather than to analyze raw magnetograms “from scratch” (July data). Thus for July data the quality of manual recognition of spikes turned to be worse. This shows that the algorithm significantly helped the recognition by eye. It also provides some estimate of the amount of errors made when relying on manual spike detection.|$|R
50|$|Ferdinand II left John Frederick in office, against Leaguist resistance, for he {{had always}} kept loyalty to him. The Catholic League wished the Roman Catholic Count Francis William of Wartenberg, Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück (1625-1634 and again 1648-1661), onto the See. After all, <b>the</b> See {{included}} <b>at</b> those years an annual revenue of 60,000 rixdollars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> free <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> its holder, making up half the Prince-Archbishopric’s budget.|$|R

They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw something of the realities of the frontline.|$|E
5|$|The {{denial of}} the style Royal Highness to the Duchess of Windsor caused further conflict, as did the {{financial}} settlement. The Government declined to include the Duke or Duchess on the Civil List, and the Duke's allowance was paid personally by George VI. The Duke compromised his position with his brother by concealing {{the extent of his}} financial worth when they informally agreed on the amount of the allowance. Edward's wealth had accumulated from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall paid to him as Prince of Wales and ordinarily <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> an incoming king. George VI also paid Edward for Sandringham House and Balmoral Castle, which were Edward's personal property, inherited from his father, George V, and thus did not automatically pass to George VI on his accession. In the early days of George VI's reign the Duke telephoned daily, importuning for money and urging that the Duchess be granted the style of Royal Highness, until the harassed king ordered that the calls not be put through.|$|E

5000|$|A Freischütz ("freeshooter"), in German folklore, is a {{marksman}} who, by {{a contract}} with the devil, has obtained a certain number of bullets destined to hit without fail whatever object he wishes.

The main goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficiency of previously made recultivation which should decrease the volume concentration of radon in air...|$|R
5|$|With {{the rapidly}} deteriorating {{military}} {{situation for the}} German Army on the Eastern Front, it became increasingly important to interrupt the flow of supplies from the Western Allies to the Soviet Union. By December 1943, the German Army was forced into continuous retreat. The Luftwaffe had been seriously weakened by four long years of war, and increasing Allied anti-submarine capabilities were steadily degrading {{the effectiveness of the}} U-boats. The only effective weapon <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Germans in Norway was Scharnhorst—Tirpitz was badly damaged, and the four remaining heavy cruisers were committed to the Baltic. During a conference with Hitler on 19–20 December, Großadmiral Karl Dönitz decided to employ Scharnhorst against the next Allied convoy that presented itself. Erich Bey, by now promoted to Konteradmiral, was given command of the task force.|$|E

Additional responsibilities included liaison with the British War Office as well as the Australian Department of Defence in Melbourne, whilst also being tasked with the command of all Australian troops in Britain. A training headquarters was also established at Salisbury. The AIF Headquarters and its subordinate units were almost entirely independent from the British Army, which allowed the force to be self-sustaining in many fields. The AIF generally followed British administrative policy and procedures, including for the awarding of imperial honours and awards.|$|E
5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
