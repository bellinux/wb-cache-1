5|$|Among Western Europeans, {{there had}} long been rumors and {{expectations}} that a great Christian ally would come from the East. These rumors circulated {{as early as the}} First Crusade (1096–1099), and usually surged in popularity after the Crusaders lost a battle. A legend arose about a figure known as Prester John, who lived in far-off India, Central Asia, or perhaps even Ethiopia. This legend developed <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, and some individuals who came from the East were greeted with expectations that they might be forces sent by the long-awaited Prester John. In 1210, news reached the West of the battles of the Mongol Kuchlug (d. 1218), leader of the largely Christian tribe of the Naimans. Kuchlug's forces had been battling the powerful Khwarezmian Empire, whose leader was the Muslim Muhammad II of Khwarezm. Rumors circulated in Europe that Kuchlug was the mythical Prester John, again battling the Muslims in the East.|$|E
5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own rather than being a simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype. Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance.|$|E

5|$|Several {{thousand}} years ago, the planet Cybertron was consumed by {{a civil war}} between the two Transformer factions, the Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron. Optimus jettisoned the AllSpark, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed in the Arctic Circle and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses {{end up in the}} possession of his great-great-grandson Sam Witwicky. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting Chevrolet Camaro, but discovers it has <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{a section}} funded by MI6 {{was created for}} propaganda, headed by Sir Campbell Stuart. It was {{allocated}} premises at Electra House and was dubbed Department EH. On 25 September 1939 the unit was mobilised to Woburn Abbey where it joined a subversion team from MI6, known as Section D, and by July these teams {{became a part of}} the newly created Special Operations Executive (SOE). These SOE elements went on to form the core of the Political Warfare Executive in 1941. Their task was to spread false rumours and conduct psychological warfare. Inspired by a demonstration of petroleum warfare, one false rumour stated that the British had a new bomb: dropped from an aircraft, it caused a thin film of volatile liquid to spread over {{the surface of the water}} which it then ignited. Such rumours were credible and rapidly spread. American broadcaster William Shirer recorded large numbers of burns victims in Berlin; though it is not clear what he personally saw, it seems likely his reports were influenced by rumours. The interrogation of a Luftwaffe pilot revealed the existence of such weapons was common knowledge, and documents found after the war showed the German high command were deceived. The rumour seemed to take on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own on both sides leading to persistent stories of a thwarted German invasion, in spite of official British denials. On 15 December 1940, The New York Times ran a story claiming that tens of thousands of German troops had been 'consumed by fire' in two failed invasion attempts.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time the team of Dow Chemicals, Nova and Dome put {{together}} the Alberta Ethane Project. This plan was essentially a $1.5 billion blueprint {{for the creation of a}} petrochemicals business in Alberta based on natural gas liquids, especially ethane.

50|$|The Hand is a 1981 American {{psychological}} horror film {{written and}} directed by Oliver Stone, based on the novel The Lizard's Tail by Marc Brandell. The film stars Michael Caine and Andrea Marcovicci. Caine plays Jon Lansdale, a comic book artist who loses his hand, which in turn takes on <b>a</b> murderous <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own. The original film score is by James Horner, in one of his earliest projects. Warner Bros. released the movie on DVD on September 25, 2007.|$|R
25|$|Asturias {{was one of}} {{the first}} Latin American novelists to realize the {{enormous}} potential of language in literature. He had a very profound linguistic style that he employed to convey his literary vision. In his works, language is more than a form of expression or a means to an end and can be quite abstract. Language does not give life to his work, rather the organic language Asturias uses has <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own within his work ("El lenguage tiene vida propia").|$|E
25|$|The Asian {{countries}} of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii {{as part of}} the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.|$|E

50|$|In 1501 Pope Alexander VI united {{the nuns}} of Santa Fe, which Beatrice had founded, with the {{neighboring}} Benedictine Monastery of San Pedro de las Duenas, {{and put them}} all under the Rule of St. Clare. Through this, the Order became connected with the Franciscans. Pope Julius II gave the new Order <b>a</b> rule <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own in 1511, and in 1516 special Constitutions were drawn up for the new Order by the Franciscan Cardinal Francisco de Quiñones, who resolved some ongoing tensions between the nuns of Santa Fe and the former Benedictine nuns who had been fused into the Order, establishing the community as the Monastery of the Immaculate Conception.|$|R
50|$|Strange Paradise has had {{at least}} <b>a</b> small <b>life</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>its</b> 195 {{serialized}} episodes.

50|$|Church {{planting}} is {{a process}} that results in a new (local) Christian church being established. It should be distinguished from church development, where a new service, new worship center or fresh expression is created that is integrated into an already established congregation. For a local church to be planted, it must eventually have <b>a</b> separate <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and be able to function without its parent body, even if it continues to stay in relationship denominationally or through being part of a network.|$|R
25|$|Also in January 2001, Nupedia started Wikipedia as a side-project {{to allow}} {{collaboration}} on articles {{before entering the}} peer review process. This attracted interest from both sides, as it provided the less bureaucratic structure favored by advocates of the GNE encyclopedia. As a result, GNE never really developed, {{and the threat of}} competition between the projects was averted. As Wikipedia grew and attracted contributors, it quickly developed <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and began to function largely independently of Nupedia, although Sanger initially led activity on Wikipedia by virtue of his position as Nupedia's editor-in-chief.|$|E
25|$|One Franquin {{creation}} {{that went}} on to develop <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own was the Marsupilami, a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail. The Marsupilami appears {{in the majority of}} the Franquin stories, starting in 1952 with Spirou et les héritiers. In the series, it is adopted by the duo and follows them everywhere they go. Marsupilamis in the wild take centre stage briefly in Le nid des Marsupilamis (1957) which presents Seccotine's documentary featuring a family in their natural habitat, the jungles of the fictitious South American state Palombia.|$|E
25|$|We {{started off}} with no idea at all. We pretty much threw all the stuff in the pot and went on playing. It {{was a case of}} demand driving it. It took off like a rocket. We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own. The thing with the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E
50|$|The show's premise {{revolved}} around Haim living in Feldman's house with Feldman and Feldman's wife, {{while trying to}} get his career back on track. The dynamics of the threesome were conceived {{in the style of the}} film You, Me and Dupree. Footage showed the ravages of Haim's habit on his body, and his appearance was unrecognizable from his younger self. Although acknowledged as partially scripted, the show eventually took on <b>a</b> darker <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own after Haim relapsed and his prescription drug abuse became apparent.|$|R
50|$|Two other {{acronyms}} {{commonly used}} in the community are FIAWOL (Fandom Is <b>A</b> Way <b>Of</b> <b>Life)</b> and <b>its</b> opposite FIJAGH (Fandom Is Just A Goddamned Hobby) to describe two {{ways of looking at}} the place of fandom in one's life.|$|R
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the theory wars, the imaginative, formal, and moral features of literature have been substantially marginalized, downgraded, and neglected. Yet for many readers such elements will always be central to the experience of reading, just as for writers they are central to the experience of writing. This provocative study argues that literature has <b>an</b> abundant <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, and reconsiders that life in the contexts provided by three influential contemporary groups of critics: some North American philosophers; some psychoanalysts; and some theorists of history...|$|R
25|$|The {{argument}} {{was made in}} the nineteenth century by a scholar hostile to what the Malleus stood for that the approbation was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do with}} the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and the main argument is clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once the {{argument was}} put forward, it took on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this argument was vitiated from the start.|$|E
25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. This inquiry included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to know the facts behind the case, he was not enamored of {{the thought of the}} Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case had taken on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own, independent of Charles.|$|E
25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E
