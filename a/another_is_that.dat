5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient. A {{possible}} source of the name is the bright yellow male of the brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni); <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> butterflies were on the wing in meadows during {{the spring and summer}} butter season while the grass was growing.|$|E
5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. One is that they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E
5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. One {{is that she}} was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body was said to have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E

50|$|Valerius {{reports in}} Book 9 Chapter 5 under Foreign Stories that Alexander the Great had three stages of arrogance. One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he looked down}} on his father Philip II of Macedon and claimed <b>that</b> Jupiter Hammon <b>was</b> his real father. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he took up {{the ways of the}} Persian people by {{dressing}} and behaving their way. Still <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Alexander believed himself to be a god, not a human being.|$|R

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the scattered objects' greater distance from the Sun creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance from the Sun, its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which the sail could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that the sail may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. One is that these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E

5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. One is that NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{returned}} to England in 1147, {{when he was}} fourteen. Taking his immediate household and {{a small number of}} mercenaries, he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into Wiltshire. Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success, and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy. Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place. Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire gracefully. Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry. Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war. This time, Henry planned to form a northern alliance with King David I of Scotland, Henry's great-uncle, and Ranulf of Chester, a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England. Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, probably with help from the Scots. The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry {{returned to}} Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the many}} items that caused the mutiny <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{soldiers}} had not been paid in a timely fashion; some had received no pay for years. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they did not receive their share of plunder. Yet <b>another</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they <b>were</b> inadequately supplied with the necessities they needed to properly function. The soldiers were also unhappy about their long periods of inactivity, and wanted either to be sent into battle or back to Rome. They also {{felt that they had}} not received proper credit for their part in the campaign to expel the Carthaginians from Hispania. A major issue too <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they had <b>been</b> in service far beyond the term normally required of Roman soldiers.|$|R

25|$|However, {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{to the rule}} of necessity.

25|$|Insects {{were the}} first to evolve flight, {{approximately}} 350 million years ago. The developmental origin of the insect wing remains in dispute, as does the purpose prior to true flight. One suggestion is that wings initially were used to catch the wind for small insects that live {{on the surface of the}} water, while <b>another</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they functioned in parachuting, then gliding, then flight for originally arboreal insects.|$|E
25|$|Most textual {{critics of}} the New Testament favor the Alexandrian text-type as the closest {{representative}} of the autographs for many reasons.
