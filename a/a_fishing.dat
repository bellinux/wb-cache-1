2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>fish’s</b> hypoxia {{tolerance}} can {{be represented}} in different ways. A commonly used representation is the critical O2 tension (Pcrit), which is the lowest water O2 tension (PO2) at which <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> can maintain <b>a</b> stable O2 consumption rate (MO2). <b>A</b> <b>fish</b> with <b>a</b> lower Pcrit is therefore thought to be more hypoxia-tolerant than <b>a</b> <b>fish</b> with <b>a</b> higher Pcrit. But while Pcrit {{is often used to}} represent hypoxia tolerance, it more accurately represents the ability to take up environmental O2 [...] at hypoxic PO2s and does not incorporate the significant contributions of anaerobic glycolysis and metabolic suppression to hypoxia tolerance (see below). Pcrit is nevertheless closely tied to <b>a</b> <b>fish’s</b> hypoxia tolerance, in part because some fish prioritize their use of aerobic metabolism over anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression. It therefore remains a widely used hypoxia tolerance metric.|$|R

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during <b>a</b> <b>fishing</b> mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while seeming to make statements about himself.|$|E
