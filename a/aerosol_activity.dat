40|$|An {{understanding}} {{of the effect of}} aerosols on biologically- and photochemically-active UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is important for many ongoing climate, biophysical, and air pollution studies. In particular, estimates of the UV characteristics of the most common Australian aerosols will be valuable inputs to UV Index forecasts, air quality studies, and assessments of the impact of regional environmental changes. By analyzing climatological distributions of Australian aerosols we have identified sites where co-located ground-based UV-B and ozone measurements were available during episodes of relatively high <b>aerosol</b> <b>activity.</b> Since at least June 2003, surface UV global irradiance spectra (285 – 450 nm) have been measured routinely at Darwin and Alice Springs in Australia by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). Using co-located sunphotometer measurements at Darwin and Alice Springs, we identified several episodes of relatively high <b>aerosol</b> <b>activity.</b> Aerosol air mass types were analyzed from sunphotometer-derived angstrom parameter, MODIS fire maps and MISR aerosol property retrievals. To assess aerosol effects we compared the measured UV irradiances for aerosol-loaded and clear-sky conditions {{with each other and with}} irradiances simulated using the libRadtran radiative transfer model for aerosol-free conditions. We found that for otherwise similar atmospheric conditions, smoke aerosols over Darwin reduced the surface UV irradiance by as much as 40 – 50 % at 290 – 300 nm and 20 – 25 % at 320 – 400 nm near active fires (aerosol optical depth, AOD, at 500 nm ∼ 0. 6). Downwind of fires, the smoke aerosols over Darwin reduced the surface irradiance by 15 – 25 % at 290 – 300 nm and ∼ 10 % at 320 – 350 nm (AOD at 500 nm ∼ 0. 2). The effect of smoke increased with decrease of wavelength and is strongest in the UV-B.

40|$|Emissions of {{gases and}} {{particles}} from ocean-going ships {{may have a}} major impact on both photochemistry of the marine boundary layer and the biogeochemistry of the surface ocean. Throughout large regions of the ocean, ship emissions of SO 2 and sulfate aerosols greatly exceed the natural DMS-borne sulfur emissions. Ship emissions must, therefore, be taken into account in estimates of global climate forcing by sulfate <b>aerosols</b> (<b>Activity</b> 1. 3 of the SOLAS Science and Implementation Plan). Ship emissions are also a significant source of atmospheric nitrogen, and the deposition of this nitrogen into marine ecosystems might affect marine productivity (Activity 1. 5). Finally, ship emissions of gaseous hydrocarbons and carbonaceous aerosol particles may impact both gas phase photochemistry and aerosol radiative properties over the oceans. The effects of ship emissions on atmospheric photochemistry include the production of ozone in regions that are usually sinks for ozone and the pollution-induced release of reactive chlorine from sea salt (Activity 1. 2). The photochemical and radiative impacts of ship emissions may persist considerably longer than the lifetime of the ship plume itself. Ship traffic has increased significantly in recent years and is projected to keep increasing. In the Arctic Ocean, which is a particularly sensitive region, new routes are becoming available for international shipping due to decreasing sea ice cover in summer. Open ocean ship emissions are currently largely unregulated and shipping often relies on very dirty fuels that cannot be used for land-based transport.

The research also proved that <b>aerosol</b> <b>activity</b> of the sea can influence the sanitary condition of the air, especially at the seacoast areas. Surveys of air structure in coastal regions were performed on the Tricity beaches as well as in Sobieszewo and Komary. Atmospheric air sampling stations in the marine zone were located on the Gulf of Gdansk at the Vistula river mouth. Air samples were collected from the front platform on the ship R/V Baltica at 4 m above the sea surface. The air samples were collected by filtration method using Sartorius apparatus. Airborne microbes were deposited onto sterile gelatine Sartorius filters. All filters were exposed directly towards the oncoming wind. After sampling, the exposed filters were placed onto the agar media on Petri plates and incubated. All measurement results were depicted in (CFU/m 3) i. e. colony forming units in 1 m 3 of the examined air. Meteorological measurements included: temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. The obtained results revealed that statistically significant trends were observed between the total number of bacteria or moulds and a season of sampling. The greatest number of microorganisms was noted in spring and autumn. Correlation analysis showed that statistically significant relationship exists between microbial abundance and the wind direction or speed and location of sampling site. Large quantities of fungal spores was detected in the areas of Gdynia and Gdansk - Brzeêno when south-west winds were blowing from the land.

40|$|New {{particle}} formation (NPF) {{events and}} their impacts on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) were investigated using continuous measurements collected in urban Shanghai from 1 to 30 April 2012. During the campaign, NPF occurred in 8 {{out of the}} 30 days and enhanced CCN number concentration (N CCN) {{by a factor of}} 1. 2 – 1. 8, depending on supersaturation (SS). The NPF event on 3 April 2012 was chosen as an example to investigate the NPF influence on CCN activity. In this NPF event, secondary aerosols were produced continuously and increased PM 2. 5 mass concentration at a rate of 4. 33 μg cm − 3 h − 1, and the growth rate (GR) and formation rate (FR) were on average 5 nm h − 1 and 0. 36 cm − 3 s − 1, respectively. The newly formed particles grew quickly from nucleation mode (10 – 20 nm) into CCN size range. N CCN increased rapidly at SS of 0. 4 – 1. 0 % but weakly at SS of 0. 2 %. Correspondingly, <b>aerosol</b> CCN <b>activities</b> (fractions of activated aerosol particles in total aerosols, N CCN / N CN) were significantly enhanced from 0. 24 – 0. 60 to 0. 30 – 0. 91 at SS of 0. 2 – 1. 0 % due to the NPF. On the basis of the κ-Köhler theory, aerosol size distributions and chemical composition measured simultaneously were used to predict N CCN. There was a good agreement between the predicted and measured N CCN (R 2 = 0. 96, N predicted / N measured = 1. 04). This study reveals that NPF exerts large impacts on aerosol particle abundance and size spectra; thus, it significantly promotes N CCN and <b>aerosol</b> CCN <b>activity</b> in this urban environment. The GR of NPF is the key factor controlling the newly formed particles to become CCN at all SS levels, whereas the FR is an effective factor only under high SS (e. g., 1. 0 %) conditions...|$|R

Anthropogenic pollutants emitted from vehicles and unfavorable meteorological {{conditions such as}} low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height exerted a great influence on PM 2. 5 and black carbon (BC) loadings. N CCN at 0. 2 % supersaturation (SS) mostly fell {{in the range of}} 994 to 6268 cm − 3, and the corresponding N CCN /N CN varied between 0. 09 and 0. 57. N CCN and N CCN /N CN usually were usually higher in the hazy case due to increased aerosol concentration in the accumulation mode (100 – 500 nm), and lower in the foggy–hazy and clear cases. The BC mass concentration posed a strong positive effect on N CCN in the foggy–hazy and hazy cases, whereas it poorly correlated with N CCN in the clear case. N CCN /N CN was weakly related with BC in both foggy–hazy and hazy cases. By using a simplified particle hygroscopicity (κ), the calculated critical dry size (CDS) of activated aerosol did not exceed 130 nm at 0. 2 % SS in spite of diverse aerosol chemical compositions. The predicted N CCN at 0. 2 % SS was very successful compared with the observed N CCN in clear case (R 2 = 0. 96) and foggy–hazy/hazy cases (R 2 = 0. 91).

Siemens Decommissioning Projects (DP) in Hanau {{has been involved in}} this task since 1995 when the decision was taken to decommission and dismantle the Hanau Fuel Fabrication Plant. Due to the decommissioning, large amounts of contaminated steel scrap have to be managed. The contamination of this metal scrap can be found almost exclusively in the form of surface contamination. Various decontamination technologies are involved, as there are blasting and wiping. Often these methods are not sufficient to meet the free release limits. In these cases, SIEMENS has decided to melt the scrap at Siempelkamp's melting plant. The plant is licensed according to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance Section 7 (issue of 20. 07. 2001). The furnace is a medium frequency induction type with a load capacity of 3. 2 t and a throughput of 2 t/h for steel melting. For safety reasons, the furnace is widely operated by remote handling. A highly efficient filter system of cyclone, bag filter and HEPA-filter in two lines retains the dust and <b>aerosol</b> <b>activity</b> from the off-gas system.

Decontamination factors could be achieved between 80 and 100 by the high affinity of the uranium to the slag former. The activity is transferred to the slag up to nearly 100 %.

40|$|International audienceAir quality {{models that}} {{generate}} {{the concentrations of}} semi-volatile and other condensable organic compounds using an explicit reaction mechanism require estimates of the physical and thermodynamic properties of the compounds that affect gas/aerosol partitioning: vapour pressure (as a subcooled liquid), and activity coefficients in the aerosol phase. The model of Griffin, Kleeman and co-workers (e. g., Griffin et al., 1999; Kleeman et al., 1999) assumes that aerosol particles consist of an aqueous phase, containing inorganic electrolytes and soluble organic compounds, and a hydrophobic phase containing mainly primary hydrocarbon material. Thirty eight semi-volatile reaction products are grouped into ten surrogate species which partition between the gas phase and both phases in the <b>aerosol.</b> <b>Activity</b> coefficients of the organic compounds are calculated using UNIFAC. In a companion paper (Clegg et al., 2007) we examine the likely uncertainties in the vapour pressures of the semi-volatile compounds and their effects on partitioning over a range of atmospheric relative humidities. In this work a simulation for the South Coast Air Basin surrounding Los Angeles, using lower vapour pressures of the semi-volatile surrogate compounds consistent with estimated uncertainties in the boiling points on which they are based, yields a doubling of the predicted 24 -h average secondary organic aerosol concentrations. The dependency of organic compound partitioning on the treatment of inorganic electrolytes in the air quality model, {{and the performance of}} this component of the model, are determined by analysing the results of a trajectory calculation using an extended version of the Aerosol Inorganics Model of Wexler and Clegg (2002). Simplifications are identified where substantial efficiency gains can be made, principally: the omission of dissociation of the organic acid surrogates; restriction of aerosol organic compounds to one of the two phases (aqueous or hydrophobic) where equilibrium calculations suggest partitioning strongly in either direction; a single calculation of activity coefficients of the organic compounds for simulations where they are determined by the presence of one component at high concentration in either phase (i. e., water in the aqueous phase, or a hydrocarbon surrogate compound P 8 in the hydrophobic phase) and are therefore almost invariant.

Several dates during the dry season of 2006 were selected and classified into four different day types according to aerosol activity: standard, clean, mixture and dusty days. The diurnal evolution of DSSF and its direct and diffuse components were estimated for the selected dates by the current LSA-SAF algorithm and two other approaches using aerosol measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) as input. The first alternative approach took the diurnal evolution of the total aerosol optical depth (AOD) into account, assuming a default desert aerosol type. Experiments with this method showed a significant improvement in the estimated DSSF compared to the current LSA-SAF algorithm. For example, root mean square error (RMSE) improved from 170 W/m 2 to 50 W/m 2 for dusty days in Dakar and from 73 W/m 2 to 21 W/m 2 for mixture days in Niamey. This improvement resulted from the consideration of a time-varying AOD, which accounted for the rapidly changing aerosol load for these two day types. The second alternative approach tested included consideration of the diurnal variation of the aerosol load and composition. Again, this was done using AERONET data on the fine and coarse aerosol modes, which may be associated with different sized dust particles, sea salt, or soot from biomass burning (depending on the date). This enhanced consideration of the aerosol composition greatly improved the estimation of the diffuse component of the DSSF, further reducing the RMSE during mixture days from 50 W/m 2 to less than 10 W/m 2. This improvement mainly came from consideration of the right scattering properties of the aerosol particles, which may be significantly different for each aerosol type...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is the {{development}} of a simplified method to routinely calculate gas/aerosol partitioning of multicomponent aerosols and aerosol associated water within global atmospheric chemistry and climate models. Atmospheric aerosols are usually multicomponent mixtures, partly composed of acids (e. g. H 2 SO 4, HNO 3), their salts (e. g. (NH 4) 2 SO 4, NH 4 NO 3, respectively), and water. Because these acids and salts are highly hygroscopic, water, that is associated with aerosols in humid environments, often exceeds the total dry aerosol mass. Both the total dry aerosol mass and the aerosol associated water are important for the role of atmospheric aerosols in climate change simulations. Still, multicomponent aerosols are not yet routinely calculated within global atmospheric chemistry or climate models. The reason is that these particles, especially volatile aerosol compounds, require a complex and computationally expensive thermodynamical treatment. For instance, the aerosol associated water depends on the composition of the aerosol, which is determined by the gas/liquid/solid partitioning, in turn strongly dependent on temperature, relative humidity, and the presence of pre-existing aerosol particles. Based on thermodynamical relations such a simplified method has been derived. This method is based on the assumptions generally made by the modeling of multicomponent aerosols, but uses an alternative approach for the calculation of the <b>aerosol</b> <b>activity</b> and activity coefficients. This alternative approach relates activity coefficients to the ambient relative humidity, according to the vapor pressure reduction and the generalization of Raoult s law. This relationship, or simplification, is a consequence of the assumption that the aerosol composition and the aerosol associated water are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the ambient relative humidity, which determines the solute activity and, hence, activity coefficients of a multicomponent aerosol mixture. Thus, the necessary equilibrium equations can be solved analytically, so that numerical and therefore expensive iterative calculations are avoided. Subsequently, a new thermodynamic gas/aerosol partitioning model has been developed, called EQSAM (Equilibrium Simplified Aerosol Model). EQSAM has been compared with various other thermodynamical models presently in use, which shows that the results of EQSAM are well within the range produced by these more complex models. The application to global modeling further shows that EQSAM is indeed sufficiently fast and accurate. Especially the results of the global gas/aerosol partitioning calculations show that differences resulting from the thermodynamical treatment affect much less the aerosol composition compared to other, non-thermodynamical parameters, such as the model resolution or the boundary layer mixing scheme used. This indicates that the gas/aerosol partitioning calculations in atmospheric chemistry models are largely governed by transport processes, including meteorology, emission sources, as well as wet and dry deposition processes. Modeling results further indicate that gas/aerosol partitioning, especially at lower temperatures (during winter and nights), is of great importance for both the gas phase concentrations and the aerosol composition, including aerosol associated water. For instance, the mean surface gaseous nitric acid concentration is predicted to partition almost completely into the aerosol phase during winter and summer nights. This considerably increases the predicted aerosol load, compared to model calculations excluding gas/aerosol partitioning. This consequently affects the aerosol associated water (because the aerosol water is proportional to the amount of dissolved matter). Additionally, aerosol mass from gas/aerosol partitioning, such as ammonium nitrate, has a longer residence time than the precursor gases (NH 3 and HNO 3) and might, therefore, be subject to long-range transport from the sources. This is, for example, the case for ammonium nitrate originating from gas-to-particle conversion over northern India. Our model results indicate that these particles, through convective redistribution, can be transported at altitudes of 200 - 300 hPa as far as Europe during the Indian summer monsoon. Verification of these results, however, would require aircraft measurements, which are presently not available. Comparison with ground-based measurements indicates that the simplified aerosol module coupled to a global atmospheric chemistry model (TM 3), for the considered ammonium/sulfate/nitrate/water system, yields realistic results at locations where ammonium nitrate is important. For remote locations, the comparison also indicates {{that it is important to}} account for other aerosol species such as sea salt and mineral dust. Although these compounds have not (yet) been included in the global gas/aerosol partitioning calculations with TM 3, it seems to be possible to consider them with our simplified approach, as indicated by the results of box-model calculations...|$|E

The EPICA records from Dome C (75 ° S, 123 ° E, 3, 233 meters above sea level.) and Dronning Maud Land (75 ° S, 0 ° E, 2, 892 meters above sea level) allow us to extend these records from the Holocene back in time to Marine Isotope Stage 20 and to study their variability in higher resolution during the last glacial period. Latest results on these atmospheric ice core records are presented, extending the CO 2, CH 4, and mineral dust records back in time to approximately 800, 000 years before present and allow for studying their coupling to millennial climate variations in more detail. These long-term records enable us to estimate the changes in the radiative forcing of these parameters over glacial/interglacial cycles. In addition recent advances in the interpretation of those records in terms of glacial/interglacial changes in biogeochemical cycles and the bipolar coupling of climate variations are discussed...|$|R

Large uncertainties exist {{in how the}} difference in the types of terrestrial biogenic sources and the abundance of organics relative to sulfate affect CCN properties. For the submicron water-soluble aerosols collected for two years in a cool-temperate forest in northern Japan, we show that the hygroscopicity parameter κCCN (0. 44 [*]±[*] 0. 07) exhibited a distinct seasonal trend with a minimum in autumn (κCCN[*]=[*] 0. 32 – 0. 37); these κCCN values were generally larger than that of ambient particles, including water-insoluble fractions. The temporal variability of κCCN was controlled by the water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) -to-sulfate ratio (R 2 [*]>[*] 0. 60), where the significant reduction of κCCN in autumn was linked to the increased WSOM/sulfate ratio. Positive matrix factorization analysis indicates that α-pinene-derived secondary organic aerosol (SOA) substantially contributed to the WSOM mass (~ 75 %) in autumn, the majority of which was attributable to emissions from litter/soil microbial activity near the forest floor. These findings suggest that WSOM, most likely α-pinene SOA, originated from the forest floor can significantly suppress the <b>aerosol</b> CCN <b>activity</b> in cool-temperate forests, which have implications for predicting climate effects by changes in biogenic emissions in future...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the equivalent dose to the lung (lung dose) due to radon in an underground car park with four levels. Size distribution of <b>aerosols</b> and <b>activity</b> size distribution of radon progeny loaded aerosols from 9 nm to 10 μm were measured and their relations to car movement and emission were investigated. Unattached fraction, equilibrium factor and PAEC of radon progeny were monitored and were used to predict the lung dose by adopting the ICRP Human Respiratory Tract Model. The mean annual (i. e. 2000 h) lung doses at the four levels, B 1, B 2, B 3 and B 4 during daytime were 1. 5, 2. 4, 2. 0 and 2. 8 mSv respectively. The lung dose for each car park level at night were 2 times higher. Mitigation methods were investigated and {{it was found that}} increasing the ventilation rate only resulted in a few per cent reduction in the lung dose rate during daytime though a larger reduction in PAEC (50 % at B 1 and 38 % at B 4) was observed at night. Cleaning the fresh air filters and washing the car park floor with water also resulted in a 21 % and 12 % reduction in the lung dose rate respectively during daytime. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions: Although {{the present}} {{experiments}} {{have not been}} performed under stratospheric conditions, the results imply that HCl can be oxidized by O 3 in the dark to photochemically active Cl 2 {{in the presence of}} <b>aerosol</b> surfaces. The <b>activity</b> of various types of aerosol must be checked, before an estimate of the stratospheric relevance can be given. A strong influence of aerosols is expected for tropospheric chemistry with a source of atomic Cl exceeding the well-known source of the gas phase reaction of OH with HCl by far. Molecular chlorine is identified as the main photolytic precursor of atomic Cl in the absence of NOx. It appears that O 3 can oxidize surface-adsorbed HCl or Cl- more rapidly than known from the aqueous phase. Furthermore, HCl is oxidized extremely rapidly in the presence of semiconducting mineral aerosols by photocatalytic action to form Cl 2 and other photolytic precursors of atomic Cl.

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{multiple}} regressions {{of the leading}} mode of atmospheric variability at southern high latitudes: the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). It is regressed against indices with large interannual variability, and one of several trend indices {{in order to determine}} which trend term gives the optimum fit. We use SAM in sea-level pressure from station data in order to provide a long time series, from 1957 to 2005. The regression indices are stratospheric volcanic <b>aerosol,</b> solar <b>activity,</b> the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, together with either a linear trend, or the effective equivalent stratospheric chlorine (EESC) that depletes polar ozone, or ozone mass deficit (OMD) in the Antarctic vortex. We find a statistically significant signal for volcanic aerosol, and, when the solar and QBO indices are represented by their product, a highly significant response to the product. We find a significant linear trend in SAM, but there is a major increase in significance using EESC 2 and a further increase using OMD. We make no direct attempt to identify cause and effect, but if the trend is due to human influence then ozone loss is at least 9 times more likely the principle cause of the trend in SAM than greenhouse gases, although we do not exclude greenhouse gases making a smaller contribution. Monthly and seasonal regressions show a maximum correlation with OMD between December and May (summer and autumn), consistent with previous work on stratospheric change as a cause of change in the troposphere...|$|R
40|$|Clouds, a key {{component}} of the climate system, form when water vapor condenses upon atmospheric particulates termed Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN). Variations in CCN concentrations can profoundly impact cloud properties, with important effects on local and global climate. Organic matter (OM) constitutes a sig-nificant fraction of tropospheric aerosol mass, and can influence CCN activity by depressing surface tension, contributing solute, and influencing droplet activation kinetics by forming a barrier to water uptake. We present direct evidence that two ubiquitous atmospheric trace gases, methylglyoxal and acetaldehyde, known to be surface-active, can enhance <b>aerosol</b> CCN <b>activity</b> upon up-take. This effect is demonstrated by exposing acidified ammonium sulfate particles to 250 ppb or 8 ppb of gas-phase methylglyoxal and/or acetaldehyde in an aerosol reaction chamber for up to 5 h. For the more atmospherically relevant experiments, i. e. the 8 ppb organic precursor concentrations, significant enhancements in CCN activity, up to 7. 5 % reduction in critical dry diameter for activation, are observed over a timescale of hours, without any detectable limitation in activation kinetics. This reduction in critical diameter enhances the apparent particle hygroscopicity up to 26 %, which for ambient aerosol would lead to cloud droplet number concentration increases of 8 - 10 % on average. The observed en-hancements exceed what would be expected based on Köhler theory and bulk properties. Therefore, the effectmay be attributed to the adsorption of methylglyoxal and acetaldehyde to the gas-aerosol interface, leading to surface tension depression of the aerosol. We conclude that gas-phase surfactants may enhance CCN activity in the atmosphere. atmospheric chemistry j climate j cloud...|$|R
40|$|Decadal-scale climate {{variations}} {{over the}} Pacific Ocean and its surroundings are {{strongly related to}} the so-called Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) which is coherent with wintertime climate over North America and Asian monsoon, and have important impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries. In a near-term climate prediction covering the period up to 2030, we require knowledge of the future state of internal variations in the climate system such as the PDO {{as well as the}} global warming signal. We perform sets of ensemble hindcast and forecast experiments using a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model to examine the predictability of internal variations on decadal timescales, in addition to the response to external forcing due to changes in concentrations of greenhouse gases and <b>aerosols,</b> volcanic <b>activity,</b> and solar cycle variations. Our results highlight that an initialization of the upper-ocean state using historical observations is effective for successful hindcasts of the PDO and has a great impact on future predictions. Ensemble hindcasts for the 20 th century demonstrate a predictive skill in the upper-ocean temperature over almost a decade, particularly around the Kuroshio-Oyashio extension (KOE) and subtropical oceanic frontal regions where the PDO signals are observed strongest. A negative tendency of the predicted PDO phase in the coming decade will enhance the rising trend in surface air-temperature (SAT) over east Asia and over the KOE region, and suppress it along the west coasts of North and South America and over the equatorial Pacific. This suppression will contribute to a slowing down of the global-mean SAT rise...|$|R
40|$|Airborne {{particulate}} matter (PM) pollution significantly impacts human health, but the cellular mechanisms of PM-induced toxicity remain poorly understood. A leading hypothesis {{on the effects}} of inhaled PM involves the generation of cellular oxidative stress. To investigate PM-induced oxidative stress, analytical methods have been developed to study the chemical oxidation of dithiothreitol (DTT) in the presence of PM. Although DTT readily reacts with several forms of reactive oxygen species, this molecule is not endogenously produced in biological systems. Glutathione (GSH), on the other hand, is an endogenous antioxidant that is produced throughout the body and is directly involved in combating oxidative stress in the lungs and other tissues. We report here a new method for measuring <b>aerosol</b> oxidative <b>activity</b> that uses silver nanoparticle (AgNP) aggregation coupled to glutathione (GSH) oxidation in a paper-based analytical device. In this assay, the residual reduced GSH from the oxidation of reduced GSH to its disulfide induces the aggregation of AgNPs on a paper-based analytical device, which produces a reddish-brown product. Two methods for aerosol oxidative reactivity are presented: one based on change in color intensity using a traditional paper-based techniques and one based on the length of the color product formed using a distance-based device. These methods were validated against traditional spectroscopic assays for DTT and GSH that employ Elman's reagent. No significant difference was found between the levels measured by all three GSH methods (our two paper-based devices and the traditional method) at the 95 % confidence level. PM reactivity towards GSH was less than towards DTT most likely due to the difference in the oxidation potential between the two molecules.

40|$|A {{study on}} {{secondary}} organic aerosol (SOA) {{was conducted with}} a focus on correlating the chemical and physical characteristics with aerosol's ability acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The work focuses on three types of aerosol: beta-caryophyllene ozonolysis SOA, aliphatic amine SOA, and cigarette environmental tobacco smoke. The work on beta-caryophyllene ozonolysis SOA enhances our understanding of the CCN activity of SOA formed with and without the presence of isoprene, by probing the effects of a series of environmental parameters on the formation and properties of SOA with more ambient-relevant precursor concentrations. This study demonstrates that aerosol formed from ozonolysis of a mixture of low and high molecular weight terpenes can be hygroscopic and can contribute to the global biogenic SOA CCN budget. The aliphatic amine work explores the atmospheric behaviors of amines with typical atmospheric oxidants, e. g. nitrate radical, hydroxyl radical and ozone. This study shows that night time chemistry of aliphatic amines can produce secondary organic and inorganic aerosol mixtures, and the relative contribution of each component depends on the environment relative humidity. Thus, modelers need to include as much ambient data as possible in order to mimic the amine behavior in the real atmosphere. The hygroscopicity of aliphatic amine secondary aerosol is also investigated, focusing on the correlation between complex composition and <b>aerosol</b> CCN <b>activity.</b> Despite of measurement artifacts, primary aliphatic amine aerosol is composed of highly volatile components with high hygroscopicity. The third part of the work characterizes the environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) from research cigarettes, with an emphasis on enhanced condensational growth (ECG), represented by CCN activity and droplet formation properties. Changes in smoke particle size, chemistry, and volatility are correlated to changes in droplet behavior from offline and online chemical and physical measurements.

Toxic events in humans after inhalation or cutaneous contact have been reported during O. cf. ovata blooms and were attributed to palytoxin (PLTX) -like compounds produced by this microalga. Similar PCR efficiencies of plasmid and cellular environmental standard curves (98 and 100 %, respectively) allowed obtaining the rDNA copy number per cell. The analytical sensitivity was set at 2 × 100 rDNA copy number and 8 × 10 – 4 cell per reaction. Based on spiking experiments, we evaluated the <b>aerosol</b> filter inhibitory <b>activity</b> and recovery rate of cells from filters, then normalized the abundance data of toxic O. cf. ovata. The abundance in marine aerosol during the bloom varied {{in the range of}} 1 – 102 cells per filter. Analytical determinations were also applied to detect palytoxin in field samples.
