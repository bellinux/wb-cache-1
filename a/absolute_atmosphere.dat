40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on multiple organ failure induced by zymosan. Administration of zymosan (500 mg/kg) in the rat induced neutrophil infiltration in the lung, liver, and intestine as evaluated by increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Therefore, lipid peroxidation was significantly increased in zymosan-treated rats. This inflammatory process coincided with the damage of lung, liver, and small intestine. Immunohistochemical examination demonstrated a marked increase in the immunoreactivity to nitrotyrosine in the lung, liver, and small intestine of zymosan-shocked rats. HBO (2 <b>absolute</b> <b>Atmosphere)</b> exposure attenuates the increase in the tissue levels of MPO and malondialdehyde (MDA) caused by zymosan in the lung, liver, and intestine. In addition, HBO (2 <b>absolute</b> <b>Atmosphere)</b> was effective in preventing the development of lung, liver, and intestine injury. Taken together, the present results demonstrate that HBO may also be an efficacious treatment in multiple organ failure induced by zymosan...|$|E
40|$|Hyperbaric {{oxygen therapy}} (HBO) could be {{described}} as a short-term, high-dose oxygen inhalation and diffusion therapy, delivered systemically through airways and blood, achieved by having the patient breathing concentrated oxygen at a pressure higher than 1 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> In clinical practice, monoplace or multiplace hyperbaric chambers are used to achieve this. Treatment is usually given as daily 90 - to 120 -min-long HBO sessions at pressures between 2. 0 and 2. 5 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> aiming for 3040 treatment sessions. The use of HBO as treatment of diabetic foot ulcers has been founded on weak scientific ground, although the outcomes from previous studies are in concert with the conclusions from preclinical studies and supports the theoretical framework of HBO reversing hypoxia-induced pathology. Two well-designed randomized double-blind trials have put HBO on firmer ground and may justify adjunctive HBO treatment to a selected group of patients with nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers. Some health economic studies suggest potential cost effectiveness, but these studies are limited by deficient primary clinical data and should be interpreted with caution. Several issues remain to be addressed, such as developing robust criteria to improve treatment protocols, determining which patients are likely to benefit, and when to start and stop treatment.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on zymosan-induced shock in rats. Zymosan, a cell wall component of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, induces inflammation by causing the production of various cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators. The administration of zymosan to rats represents a new experimental shock model by inducing acute peritonitis, severe hypotension, and signs of systemic illness. However, it has been recently proposed that the zymosan-induced shock, like septic shock, may be mediated by overproduction of nitric oxide. Experimental study. Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2 nd University of Naples, Naples, Italy. Male rats were treated with zymosan (500 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal route, with HBO (2 <b>Absolute</b> <b>Atmosphere)</b> or with zymosan and HBO (2 <b>Absolute</b> <b>Atmosphere).</b> Peritoneal exudate, plasma, and peritoneal nitric oxide metabolites (NOx) and zymosan determined a time-dependent increase in peritoneal and plasma NOx concentrations, and peritoneal leukocytes were determined. Moreover, symptomatology was observed. The administration of zymosan caused {{the appearance of a}} severe illness in the rats characterized by ruffled fur, lethargy, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and a significant loss of body weight. All zymosan-treated rats developed an acute peritonitis, producing turbid exudate. Zymosan determined a time-dependent increase in peritoneal, plasma NOx, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha concentrations. Morbidity of zymosan shocked rats has been attenuated and no mortality was observed by treatment with HBO. These findings were associated with a significant reduction either of peritoneal leukocytes and exudate, or plasma and peritoneal NOx concentrations. Moreover, TNF-alpha levels were significantly reduced in animals shocked by zymosan and treated with HBO...|$|E

40|$|Distillation as a {{desalination}} technol-ogy is not {{commonly used}} in theUnited States for producing potable drinking water. Reverse osmosis (RO), which uses thin film membranes, has been the pre-ferred choice. Distillation has been labeled as more expensive because of the perceived higher usage of energy associated with heat-ing water and higher capital costs. Today’s distillation technologies, which include Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) and Mechanical Vapor Compression (MVC), can be cost-competitive, especially when they are collocated with a power plant or resource-recovery facility such as an incinerator or refinery, where a source of waste steam is avail-able. Thermal technologies can utilize this steam—which would otherwise {{be lost in the}} form of stack gases, cooling-water streams, or low-pressure exhaust steam—as a primary or supplemental source of heat for distillation. This is accomplished, in part, by the use of thermo-compressors and vacuum ejectors. The vacuum ejectors lower the effective tem-perature needed to achieve boiling from 100 º C (212 º F) at 1. 0 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to below 70 º C (158 º F) at 0. 34 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The EcoEléctrica Power Plant, located on Puerto Rico’s southern coast, is the first facility of its type combining a 507 -megawatt power plant, a liquid natural-gas terminal, and a seawater distillation desalination facili-ty—all financed in a single project. The power plant consists of two gas-combustion turbines and one steam turbine. Each pro-duces waste steam, a byproduct that is used by two 3, 785 m 3 /day (1 -mgd) MED units to distill seawater from the Caribbean Sea, pro-ducing cooling water for a nearby power plant and potable drinking water for EcoElectrica and the Puerto Rico Aqueduct Sewer Authority (PRASA) for distribution to surrounding communities.

40|$|Background: With {{the rise}} of the burden of ischemic heart disease, both {{clinical}} and economic evidence show a desperate need to protect the heart against myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury-related complications following cardiac surgery or per-cutaneous coronary intervention. However, there is no effective intervention for myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury as yet. Methods:We pretreated mice with 4 daily 2. 0 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (ATA) hyperbaric oxygen, then observed its effects on heart function parameters and infarct size following in situ ischemia-reperfusion. Multiple oxidative and inflammation products were measured in the myocardium. Next, we investigated the expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO- 1), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /serine/threonine protein kinase (Akt) pathway, and NF-E 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) in the presence of myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury, hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, and their inhibitors and their effects on heart function para-meters. Results: Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning ameliorated the cardiac function and histological alterations induced by myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury, decreased oxidative products and proinflammatory cytokine. Hyperbaric oxygen pre-conditioning increased expression of HO- 1, which was suppressed by PI 3 K inhibitor LY 294002, Nrf 2 knockout, and Akt inhibitor triciribine. The expression of Nrf 2 was enhanced by hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, but decreased by LY 294002 and tricir-ibine. The Akt was also activated by hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning but suppressed by LY 294002. The hemodynamic assays showed that cardiac function was suppressed by LY 294002, Nrf 2 knockout, and triciribine.

Due to national concerns of a possible 3 He shortage, significant effort has been put forth, {{in the form of}} 3 He alternative research, to push the community to develop more cost effective and higher intrinsic efficiency devices. The major focus of this thesis is on how a Si-based micro-structured neutron detector (MSND) assembly, of size and shape comparable to that of a commercially available high-pressure 3 He-based neutron detector, can yield higher neutron detection efficiencies than its 3 He-based counterpart. With careful consideration of MSND assembly geometry, along with clever utilization of neutron moderating high-density polyethylene (HDPE), a high-pressure 3 He replacement (HP-HeRep) device, consisting of eighty tightly packed 1 -cm 2 MSND’s, has been designed and will be compared with a high-performance 8. 3 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmosphere</b> 3 He-based neutron detector. The MSND, designed and developed by the S. M. A. R. T. Lab at Kansas State University, is a high purity Si-based, highly anisotropic pin structure diode (i. e., 350 -μm by 20 -μm trenches in a 525 -μm thick substrate). Given the novelty and complexity of the MSND, little is known in regard to its electric field character and resultant charge sweep-out properties. As a first step toward the development of a thorough understanding of these properties, this thesis also focuses on the equivalent circuit analysis and comparison of the MSND with a planar-type neutron detector, via impedance spectroscopy.

Results Mortality rates {{did not differ significantly}} between groups, whereas functional improvement was found for NBO, tPA and HBO+tPA. NBO and HBO tended to stabilize BBB and to reduce MMP- 2. tPA tended to increase BBB permeability with corresponding MMP and TIMP elevation. Co-administered HBO failed to attenuate these early deleterious effects, independent of functional improvement. Conclusions The long-term consequences of simultaneously applied tPA and both NBO and HBO need to be addressed by further studies to identify therapeutic potencies in acute stroke, and to avoid unfavorable courses following combined treatment...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effects of {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy (HBO) on the mechanical resistance of anastomosis performed in rats' distal colon presenting peritonitis induced by ligature and cecal punction using the Total Energy Rupture biomechanical test (ETR). METHODS: It was used 45 rats divided into three groups of 15 animals each. In Control Group (CG), it was performed anastomosis in distal colon without peritonitis. In Peritonitis Group (PG), it was performed anastomosis six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. In Hyperbaric Chamber Group (HCG), it was performed six hours after the induction of peritonitis by ligature and cecal punction. The animals on CG and PG were kept at place air while the animals on HCG were placed on an experimental hyperbaric chamber in order to inhale oxygen at 100 %, two <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> for 120 minutes, for four consecutive days. Euthanasia {{took place on the}} fifth day of the experiment. All the animals underwent to Total Energy Rupture Biomechanical Resistance test (ETR). Total Energy Rupture was defined as the necessary internal energy stored up to promote the colon rupture after an external traction force imposition. RESULTS: The Peritonitis Group presents smaller average ETR than Control Group. There was no statistical difference between Peritonitis Group and Hyberbaric Chamber Group. CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not alter the mechanical resistance of anastomosis performed in distal colon of rats under the presence of peritonitis induced by ligature and cecal puncture...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{acoustic}} trauma (AAT) is a sudden {{sensorineural hearing loss}} caused by exposure of the hearing organ to acoustic overstimulation, typically an intense sound impulse, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HOT), which favors repair of the microcirculation, can be potentially used to treat it. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effects of HOT on guinea pigs exposed to {{acoustic trauma}}. Fifteen guinea pigs were exposed to noise in the 4 -kHz range with intensity of 110 dB sound level pressure for 72 h. They were assessed by {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} (BAEP) and by distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) before and after exposure and after HOT at 2. 0 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres</b> for 1 h. The cochleae were then analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). There was a statistically significant difference in the signal-to-noise ratio of the DPOAE amplitudes for the 1 - to 4 -kHz frequencies and the SEM findings revealed damaged outer hair cells (OHC) after exposure to noise, with recovery after HOT (p = 0. 0159), which did not occur on thresholds and amplitudes to BAEP (p = 0. 1593). The electrophysiological BAEP data did not demonstrate effectiveness of HOT against AAT damage. However, there was improvement of the anatomical pattern of damage detected by SEM, with a significant reduction of the number of injured cochlear OHC and their functionality detected by DPOAE.

40|$|Abstract Background After {{promising}} {{results in}} experimental stroke, normobaric (NBO) or hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) {{have recently been}} discussed as co-medication with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for improving outcome. This study assessed the interactions of hyperoxia and tPA, focusing on survival, early functional outcome and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity following experimental stroke. Methods Rats (n = 109) underwent embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion or sham surgery. Animals were assigned to: Control, NBO (60 -minute pure oxygen), HBO (60 -minute pure oxygen at 2. 4 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres),</b> tPA, or HBO+tPA. Functional impairment was assessed at 4 and 24 hours using Menzies score, followed by intravenous application of FITC-albumin as a BBB permeability marker, which was allowed to circulate for 1 hour. Further, blood sampling was performed at 5 and 25 hours for MMP- 2, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 concentration. Results Mortality rates {{did not differ significantly}} between groups, whereas functional improvement was found for NBO, tPA and HBO+tPA.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess apoptosis and nuclear proliferation in rat small bowel submitted to hypothermic hyperbaric oxygenation for preservation. Methods. Twenty two-month-old, male Wistar rats, weighing 250 g were divided into two groups: group I (n = 10), in which the small bowel was preserved for 12 hours, and group 11 (n = 10) in which the small bowel was preserved for 24 hours. After vascular and intraluminal perfusion, 3 -cm segments were maintained in Ringer's solution at 2 degrees to 4 degrees C under normobaric conditions (groups Ia and IIa) or conditioned in a small hyperbaric metal chamber with 100 % oxygen at 5. 5 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres</b> (groups Ib and IIb). After 12 or 24 hours, apoptotic and mitotic indices were evaluated by immunohistochemical methods. Results. the apoptotic index was significantly higher in small bowel segments in groups Ia and IIa compared with groups Ib and IIb. the mitotic index was significantly higher among group IIb. Conclusion. Hypothermic hyperbaric oxygenation reduced intestinal epithelial apoptosis and increased nuclear proliferation during rat small bowel preservation.

5000|$|Once the diver has {{calculated}} the total required decompression time, they calculate the depth {{at which the}} deep stops commence. To do this, they calculate the <b>absolute</b> pressure (in <b>atmospheres</b> <b>absolute)</b> at their maximum depth, and multiplying this figure by either 6 (for feet) or 2 (for meters), and then deducting that figure from the maximum depth, and rounding up to the next shallower increment of 10 ft. [...] That is the depth at which the deep stops will commence, and is equivalent to a pressure of 80% of the pressure at maximum depth. The diver will then do standard deep stops at every 10 ft until they reach the depth for the appropriate gas switch to their decompression gas. The diver is expected to do at least 3 minutes at the gas switch stop to acclimatise to the higher partial pressure of oxygen (known as the [...] "oxygen window in technical diving"), and use this window to calculate the remaining stops.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effects of {{hyperbaric}} oxygen therapy on liver function in rats previously subjected to ischemia and reperfusion. METHODS: A randomly distribution of 23 Wistar rats was conducted into three groups: SHAM, animals subjected to surgical stress without restricting blood flow by clamping the hepatic pedicle, IR, rats underwent hepatic vascular occlusion intermittently for two complete cycles of 15 minutes of ischemia followed by 5 min of reperfusion, IR / HBO, rats underwent hepatic pedicle clamping and thereafter exposed to hyperbaric oxygen pressure of 2 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres</b> for 60 minutes. We evaluated liver function through mitochondrial function, determined by the stages 3 and 4 of respiration, respiratory control ratio (RCR) and mitochondrial permeability transition (Swelling). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also quantified. We analyzed the results using the Mann-Whitney test and were considered significant all results with p < 0. 05. RESULTS: There were {{significant differences between the}} results of stage 3 in SHAM vs IR group; of the stage 4 in the groups IR vs SHAM and SHAM vs IR /HBO; of the Respiratory Control Ratio (RCR) in the group IR vs IR / HBO; of alanine aminotransferase in the groups IR vs SHAM, SHAM vs IR/HBO and IR vs IR / HBO; aspartate aminotransferase in the groups SHAM vs IR and SHAM vs IR / HBO. CONCLUSION: The whole analysis of the mitochondiral function indicators permits us to conclude that the hyperbaric oxygen therapy acted as a protective agent of the mitochondrial function, minimizing the ischemia-reperfusion injury of the hepatic parenchyma...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD 2) expression pattern after the cortical stab injury (CSI). Methods CSI was performed on 88 male Wistar rats, divided into control, sham, lesioned, and HBO groups. HBOT protocol was the following: pressure applied was 2. 5 <b>absolute</b> <b>atmospheres,</b> for 60 minutes, once a day for consecutive 3 or 10 days. The pattern of SOD 2 expression and cellular localization was analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and double-label fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Neurons undergoing degeneration were visualized with Fluoro-Jade®B. Results CSI induced significant transient increase in SOD 2 protein levels at day 3 post injury, which {{was followed by a}} reduction toward control levels at post-injury day 10. At the same time points, mRNA levels for SOD 2 in the injured cortex were down-regulated. Exposure to HBO for 3 days considerably down-regulated SOD 2 protein levels in the injured cortex, while after 10 days of HBOT an up-regulation of SOD 2 was observed. HBOT significantly increased mRNA levels for SOD 2 at both time points compared to the corresponding L group, but they were still lower than in controls. Double immunofluorescence staining revealed that 3 days after CSI, up-regulation of SOD 2 was mostly due to an increased expression in reactive astrocytes surrounding the lesion site. HBOT attenuated SOD 2 expression both in neuronal and astroglial cells. Fluoro-Jade®B labeling showed that HBOT significantly decreased the number of degenerating neurons in the injured cortex. Conclusion HBOT alters SOD 2 protein and mRNA levels after brain injury in a time-dependent manner...|$|R
