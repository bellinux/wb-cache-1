5|$|The <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Kehl, and {{marched to the}} northeast. François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had {{appointed}} General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, {{this was the best}} Jourdan could do for him. Vandamme led the <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with {{its plan to}} attack. Paxton sent the regiment's <b>advance</b> <b>guard,</b> led by Major Powell, down the mountain to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain to the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|E

5|$|At 05:10 on August 22, an <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> of 4,000 British troops left Staten Island {{under the}} command of Clinton and Cornwallis to land on Long Island. At 08:00, all 4,000 troops landed unopposed on the shore of Gravesend Bay. Colonel Edward Hand's Pennsylvanian riflemen had been {{stationed}} on the shore, but they did not oppose the landings and fell back, killing cattle and burning farmhouses on the way. By noon, 15,000 troops had landed on shore along with 40 pieces of artillery, as hundreds of Loyalists came to greet the British troops. Cornwallis pushed on with the <b>advance</b> <b>guard,</b> advancing six miles onto the island and establishing a camp at the village of Flatbush. He was given orders to advance no further.|$|E

Dumouriez {{organized}} eight columns of attack. Valence on the right led three attack columns against Racour and Oberwinden, the Duke of Chartres directed two columns in the center via Laer and Miranda commanded three columns on the left along the main road to Halle. The French reserve formed a final column on the far left where it was to first capture Zoutleeuw (Leau) and then swing south against Halle. Lamarche's <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> operated with the Right Wing.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{fired his}} signal guns at 09:00 and the Hessians began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> {{to hold off}} the Hessians while he turned {{the rest of his}} force around to fight the British. Heavy {{casualties}} mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the Hessians had overrun the <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the Hessians. Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{began his}} reign by {{eliminating}} potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed.

When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was {{in command of the}} <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, the British {{began to}} land on the shore, Clinton's <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> of 4,000 British light {{infantry}} and Hessian jägers landing first. Inland, opposing them, was a brigade of some 750 men under the command of John Glover. Glover was atop a hill with a telescope when he noticed the British ships. (hill {{on the west side of}} the Hutchinson River Parkway and the Hutchinson River on East Sanford Blvd. in Mount Vernon, NY on the opposite side of the Hutchinson River Parkway and Pelham Memorial High School) Glover sent an officer, Major William Lee, to report to Charles Lee, Washington's second in command, and ask for orders. However, Lee did not give any orders, and in the absence of orders Glover chose to attack. Glover turned out his brigade, which consisted of the 14th, 13th, 3rd and the 26th Continental Regiments. Glover left the 150 men of the 14th Continentals behind in reserve. Glover had not closed half the distance when he ran into approximately 30 skirmishers. Glover ordered a Captain and his 40-man company forward as an <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> to hold the British in check, while Glover organized the rest of the force.|$|E

The British lost more than one quarter of their force in the battle, and American morale rose with the victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1796, Klenau {{commanded}} the <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> of Peter Quasdanovich's right column in northern Italy. As the column {{descended from the}} Alps at the city of Brescia, reconnaissance found the local French garrison unprepared. At midnight, Klenau led two squadrons of the 8th Hussar Regiment Wurmser (named for its Colonel-Proprietor Dagobert von Wurmser), a battalion of the 37th Infantry Regiment De Vins, and one company of the Mahony Jäger. With their approach masked by fog and darkness, the small force surprised the Brescia garrison {{on the morning of}} 30 July, capturing not only the 600–700 French soldiers stationed there, but also three officials of the French Directory: Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, and François Étienne de Kellermann. However, within two days, Klenau's force had to face Napoleon Bonaparte and 12,000 Frenchmen; his small <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> was quickly pushed out of Brescia on 1 August. At the subsequent Battle of Lonato of 2–3 August 1796, the French forced Quasdanovich's column to withdraw into the mountains. This isolated Quasdanovich's force from Wurmser's main army by Lake Garda, and freed the French to concentrate on the main force at Castiglione delle Stiviere, further south; Bonaparte's victory at the Battle of Castiglione forced Wurmser across the Mincio River, and allowed the French to return to the siege of Mantua.|$|E

Russian General Wittgenstein, who now commanded the Coalition allies in place of General Kutusov, hearing of his approach, had decided to attack the French <b>advanced</b> <b>guard,</b> which he took to be their whole force, on its right flank, and during the morning had drawn together the bulk of his forces on his right in the vicinity of Gross-Görschen and Kaya.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{establishment}} of the empire he was created a Marshal of France (1804), and commanded once more the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> of a great French army in the campaign of Austerlitz.

In the 1806-07 campaign he was at his best, commanding his corps with the greatest credit in the march through the Thuringian Forest, the action of Saalfeld (which is studied as a model today at the French Staff College) and the Battle of Jena.

5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the <b>advance</b> <b>guard,</b> decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them.

Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his brother did not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark.

Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E

[...] At Ostrach, his <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> sustained the immediate shock of contact, but the main force of the army {{was less than a}} day behind him, and Archduke Charles, the commander of the Austrian force, divided his army into three assault columns to make a simultaneous attack at three points on the French line; after a day of nasty fighting, the Austrians flanked the French at the north and south, and threatened to break through the line in the middle. [...] The French withdrew to Mösskirch, and then to Engen and Stockach, where, on 25March, the fighting renewed. At Stockach, Nauendorf again commanded the Austrian <b>advanced</b> <b>guard,</b> which was composed of troops seasoned, as he had been, in the Habsburg border wars.
