25|$|From the 18th century, donkey {{gradually}} replaced <b>ass,</b> <b>and</b> jenny replaced she-ass, {{which is}} now considered archaic. The change may have come about through a tendency to avoid pejorative terms in speech, and be comparable to the substitution in North American English of rooster for cock, or that of rabbit for coney, which was formerly homophonic with cunny. By {{the end of the}} 17th century, changes in pronunciation of both <b>ass</b> <b>and</b> arse had caused them to become homophones. Other words used for the ass in English from this time include cuddy in Scotland, neddy in southwest England and dicky in the southeast; moke is documented in the 19th century, and may be of Welsh or Gypsy origin.|$|E

25|$|Arginine is {{synthesized}} from citrulline in arginine and proline metabolism by the sequential {{action of}} the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase (<b>ASS)</b> <b>and</b> argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.|$|E

25|$|Devices {{found in}} Sanskrit {{literature}} such as frame stories and animal fables are {{seen by some}} scholars as lying {{at the root of}} the conception of the Nights. The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources. Indian folklore is represented in the Nights by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient Sanskrit fables. The influence of the Panchatantra and Baital Pachisi is particularly notable. The Jataka Tales are a collection of 547 Buddhist stories, which are for the most part moral stories with an ethical purpose. The Tale of the Bull and the <b>Ass</b> <b>and</b> the linked Tale of the Merchant and his Wife are found in the frame stories of both the Jataka and the Nights.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{produced}} {{a trio of}} albums for power pop group Badfinger on {{the tail end of}} their career, beginning with 1973's <b>Ass,</b> <b>and</b> 1974's Badfinger and Wish You Were Here albums. Ass was originally recorded with Badfinger producing, but the group later admitted they were incapable of producing themselves. Members Pete Ham and Tom Evans solicited Thomas' help in cleaning up existing recordings and laying down new tracks. Although the succeeding album Badfinger retained Thomas from the outset and was considered by critics to be an improvement in production, neither album was successful in the marketplace. For their third project together, Thomas held a meeting with the group and pleaded that they all concentrate on making the best record they could muster. It turned out that Wish You Were Here garnered the most positive critical response from periodicals, including Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Grecian works, donkeys were portrayed in Biblical works {{as symbols of}} service, suffering, peace and humility, most notably in their inclusion in the New Testament Nativity narrative. Donkeys are also associated with the theme of wisdom in the Old Testament story of Balaam's <b>ass,</b> <b>and</b> are seen {{in a positive light}} through the story of Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey. By the 19th century, the donkey was portrayed with more positive attributes by popular authors. William Wordsworth portrayed the donkey as loyal and patient in his 1819 poem , using the donkey as a Christian symbol. Robert Louis Stevenson in Travels with a Donkey (1879), portrays the animal as a stubborn beast of burden. Sympathetic portrayals return in Juan Ramon Jimenez's Platero and I. The melancholy Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (first published in 1926) is arguably the most famous donkey in Western literature.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Russia {{exchanged}} two captive Amur tigers for Persian leopards {{with the}} Iranian government, as conservation groups {{of both countries}} agreed on reintroducing these animals into the wild {{within the next five}} years. This issue is controversial since only 30% of such releases have been successful. In addition, as mentioned by Bahram Kiabi, a Professor of Ecology at Shahid Beheshti University, the Siberian tiger is not genetically identical to the Caspian tiger of Persia, but similar. Another difference between the Siberian and Persian tigers is climatic, with the latter's country having higher temperatures than that of its Siberian relative, and environmental expert Kambiz Bahram Soltani warned that introducing exotic species into a new habitat could inflict irreversible and unknown damage. In December 2010, one of the tigers exchanged died in Eram Zoo in Tehran. Nevertheless, the project has its defenders, and Iran has had successful reintroductions of the Persian wild <b>ass</b> <b>and</b> East Azerbaijan red deer.|$|E

500|$|Mayr {{notes that}} Buffon {{was not an}} [...] "evolutionist", but was {{certainly}} responsible for creating the great amount of interest in natural history in France. He agrees that Buffon's thought is hard to classify and even self-contradictory, and that the theologians forced him to avoid writing some of his opinions openly. Mayr argues however that Buffon was [...] "fully aware {{of the possibility of}} 'common descent', and was perhaps the first author ever to articulate it clearly", quoting Buffon at length, starting with [...] "Not only the <b>ass</b> <b>and</b> the horse, but also man, the apes, the quadrupeds, and all the animals might be regarded as constituting but a single family", and later [...] "that man and ape have a common origin", and that [...] "the power of nature...with sufficient time, she has been able from a single being to derive all the other organized beings". Mayr notes, however, that Buffon immediately rejects the suggestion and offers three arguments against it, namely that no new species have arisen in historical times; that hybrid infertility firmly separates species; and that animals intermediate between, say, the horse and the donkey are not seen (in the fossil record).|$|E
500|$|A donkey (or <b>ass)</b> <b>and</b> an ox {{typically}} {{appear in}} nativity scenes.
