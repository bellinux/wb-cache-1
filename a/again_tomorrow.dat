40|$|Prov 3 : 28 as {{it stands}} in the LX X, which {{includes}} a third stich absent from MT. shows a pallern of thought paralleled in ancient Egyptian wisdom. LX X Prov 3 : 28 c is probably original. Prov 3 : 27 - 28 in the MT reads: (27) Do not withhold a benefit [fob] from one who is eager for it, 1 when it is within your capacity to do (it). (28) Do not say to your fellow, "Go away and come <b>again,</b> and <b>tomorrow</b> 111 give (it to you) "-and all the while you have it. LXX (all witnesses) has an additional stich {{at the end of}} v. 28 : (28 c) ou yap o{om; i:i n'. ~Etat Ti £moucra For you do not know what the morrow will bring forth (lit., "give birth to"). This sentence can confidently be retroverted to ki lo 0 tedac mah teled yam. But the question remains whether this stich is a translator's addi-tion or if it stood in the LXX's Vorlage; and, if it did, whether it was original or a scribal addition in Hebrew. The few commentaries that mention v. 28 c are in agreement that it is an addition. Toy (1899, p. 78) calls this stich "a not very appropriate gloss, taken from 27 : I. " Mezzacasa, in his comprehensive study of LXX Proverbs, says only that the stich is taken from 27 : I with a change of I. Hebrew ha'd/iiyw: Clearly the usual sense of this word, "its owner, " is inappropriate. since the would-be recipient is not presently the possessor. LXX's "the poor " is too restricted. Delitzsch (pp. 99 f.) explains ha'dliiyw as meaning one worthy of a benefit, comparing Arabic 'ah/, but the worthiness of the beneficiary is not relevant here. The above translation follows (without certainty) Gordis (1983. pp. 90 - 92), who suggests that the biblical Hebrew noun he'iilim underwent the same semantic process as Yiddish hay/on. "eager", "avid", which he derives from Hebrew ha'al. He suggests that he'iilim developed a "voluntive nuance, " coming to mean "would be owner, " "one avid, eager for. " All such translations can be justified only by the needs of context...|$|R
