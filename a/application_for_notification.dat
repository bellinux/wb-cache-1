40|$|VTIS is {{a dynamic}} {{notification}} system that takes in a user’s route and calculates the time-delay imposed by disruptions to the normal traversal. The disruptions are calculated by using crowdsourced notifications. This is accomplished by {{the creation of a}} client side <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> display and a server infrastructure that will process and store the event information. We have devised a system that will generate personalized notifications for users based on a provided path, temporal range, and set of transportation modes. At a high level, the functionality of this system is to identify events that affect the user’s route and notify the user of these events. The VTIS will provide a multimodal no-tification system based on information mined from Twitter data and volunteered information from VTIS users. This in-formation will be stored to create a repository of transporta-tion events., This repository will be queried to notify affected users of events that may affect their route [...] Although this outlined problem has been solved previously, our approach is novel in several ways: (1) accounting for multiple modes, (2) combining user input with mined data, and the (3) mod-eling method used to calculate effects on the user’s route. Some of these methods have been implemented separately; however, a comprehensive system has not been constructed that includes all of these items...|$|E

40|$|A {{survey on}} the {{notification}} of information on dangerous preparations by companies to Poisons Information Centres shows that each EU Member State has made different arrangements. This {{is the result of}} missing guidelines in the Preparations Directive 1999 / 45 /EC. The implementation of the 'Globally Harmonised System of classification and labelling of chemicals' (GHS) in the EU will replace the Preparations Directive. This is a good opportunity to harmonize product notification at an EU level and have it legally enforced. The notified product information is used for medical purposes, particularly to provide information on poisonings with these preparations. This report shows that in six countries the Poisons Information Centre (PIC) directly receives the information on the dangerous preparations. In most other countries, a governmental authority is appointed that makes the information available to the PICs. Between EU Member States different requirements are set concerning the notification of the composition of the product and the concentrations of the ingredients. There are also different procedures <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> and a considerable variety in used forms and/or <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> electronic <b>notification.</b> Harmonisation of product notification can be achieved if the receiving authorities first reach consensus on the required product information. Next, an agreement on an acceptable format <b>for</b> <b>notification</b> must be reached...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of <b>application</b> <b>for</b> sending push <b>notifications</b> using the PHP Symfony framework. The text is logically divided into two main parts. The first part is theoretical and explains what push notifications are, what is their current use and what is their history. One of the chapters of this section is an introduction and overview of services used <b>for</b> sending push <b>notifications,</b> including an explanation how these services work. The second part is practical and deals with design and development of the application. At first there are requirements that are placed on the application, followed by designing by using a use case diagram, domain model and wireframes of user interface. The next chapter describes the most important tools and technologies used for development. The final chapter discusses the implementation itself and represents the final product. The output of this work is a web <b>application</b> used <b>for</b> sending push <b>notifications</b> that will be used for internal needs of software company...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of Requirements Engineering within software development {{has long been}} established and recognized by researchers and practitioners. Within Software Product Lines (SPL), this activity is even more critical because it needs to cope with common, variable, and product-specific requirements not only for a single product but for the whole set of products in the family. In this paper, we present a Feature-Driven Requirements Engineering approach (FeDRE) that provides support to the requirements specification of software product lines. The approach follows a strategy where features are realized into functional requirements considering the variability captured in a feature model. It also provides guidelines on how to associate chunks of features from a feature model and to consider them as the context for the Use Case specification. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated in a case study for developing an SPL of mobile <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> emergency <b>notification</b> s. Preliminary evaluations on the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of requirements analysts using the approach are also presented...|$|R
