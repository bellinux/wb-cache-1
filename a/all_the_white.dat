5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

50|$|In 1791, {{a man of}} Jamaican origin named Boukman {{became the}} leader of the enslaved Africans held on a large {{plantation}} in Cap-Français. In the wake of the revolution in France, he planned to massacre <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> living in Cap-Français. On 22 August 1791, the blacks descended to Le Cap, where they destroyed the plantations and executed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> who lived in the region. King Louis XVI was accused of indifference to the massacre, while the slaves seemed to think the king was on their side. In July 1793, <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> in Les Cayes were massacred.|$|R

25|$|With the {{disappearance}} of Tommy it was considered important to get Murnane to testify. His whereabouts could not be discovered and Wood assigned Inspector Condon and Detective Manning to find him. In March 1927 a tip was received and Murnane was subpoenaed to appear. Wood instructed Nairn {{that he could not}} speak to Murnane before he testified, an instruction Nairn ignored when he intercepted him {{on the way to the}} court and briefed him while Wood waited. When Murnane testified, he confirmed the main points of the evidence of the white participants but differed on two points. Jolly had said that Murnane had taken part in a raid on a large encampment, Murnane said that he had not been on that raid and that Jolly was mistaken. The other point of difference was cited by Wood; Regan's patrol (and Murnane) had originally stated they first joined St Jack's patrol north of Nulla Nulla while St Jack and Overheu said they met at the homestead (where they met had an important bearing on the alleged killings by St Jack and Overheu before Regan's party joined them). Testifying before the commission, with the exception of Murnane who repeated his earlier statement, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> members of the patrol now repeated St Jacks version. An angry Wood concluded this was due to Nairn only having 15 minutes to speak to Murnane before he testified and added him to the list of witnesses he believed were prepared to lie to the commission.|$|E

500|$|While hosting NBC's Saturday Night Live, Jamie Foxx {{joked about}} being excited [...] "to kill <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> {{people in the}} movie". Conservative {{columnist}} Jeff Kuhner wrote {{a reaction to the}} SNL skit for The Washington Times, saying: [...] "Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture.

500|$|The Fort Lauderdale {{area was}} known as the [...] "New River Settlement" [...] before the 20th century. In the 1830s there were {{approximately}} 70 settlers living along the New River. William Cooley, the local Justice of the Peace, was a farmer and wrecker, who traded with the Seminole Indians. On January 6, 1836, while Cooley was leading an attempt to salvage a wrecked ship, a band of Seminoles attacked his farm, killing his wife and children, and the children's tutor. The other farms in the settlement were not attacked, but <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> residents in the area abandoned the settlement, fleeing first to the Cape Florida Lighthouse on Key Biscayne, and then to Key West.|$|E
500|$|After whites {{endorsed}} the Internal Settlement by 85% in {{a referendum on}} 30 January 1979, Smith dissolved the Rhodesian parliament {{for the last time}} on 28 February. The RF won <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> seats in the April 1979 elections while Muzorewa and the UANC won a majority in the common roll seats with 67% of the popular vote; the PF rejected this, however, as did the UN, which passed a resolution branding it a [...] "sham". Sithole, astounded that his party had won only 12 seats to the UANC's 51, suddenly turned against the settlement and alleged that the polls had been stage-managed in Muzorewa's favour. Mugabe dismissed the bishop as a [...] "neocolonial puppet" [...] and pledged to continue ZANLA's campaign [...] "to the last man"; Nkomo similarly committed ZIPRA. On 1 June 1979, the day of the country's official reconstitution as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Muzorewa replaced Smith as Prime Minister, {{at the head of a}} UANC–RF coalition Cabinet made up of 12 blacks and five whites. Smith was included as Minister without portfolio; Nkomo promptly dubbed him the [...] "Minister with all the portfolios".|$|E

50|$|Before his {{departure}} from a city, Dessalines would proclaim an amnesty for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> who had survived in hiding during the massacre.

500|$|Bill Russell {{was born}} to Charles Russell and Katie Russell in West Monroe, Louisiana. Like almost all {{southern}} towns and cities of that time, West Monroe was a highly segregated place, and the Russells often struggled with racism in their daily lives. Once, Russell's father was refused service {{at a gas station}} until the staff had taken care of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> customers. When his father attempted to leave and find a different station, the attendant stuck a shotgun in his face and threatened to kill him if he didn't stay and wait his turn. At another time, Russell's mother was walking outside in a fancy dress when a policeman accosted her. He told her to go home and remove the dress, which he described as [...] "white woman's clothing". Because large numbers of blacks were moving to the West during World War II to look for work there, Russell's father moved the family out of Louisiana when Russell was eight years old and settled them in Oakland, California. While there the family fell into poverty, and Russell spent his childhood living in a series of public housing projects.|$|E
500|$|Jamestown has {{now been}} built and Walter tells his wife Alice about Powhatan’s victory over Miami. They then discuss a banquet hosted by Powhatan that Smith, Rolfe and Percy will attend. Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] She says she has come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he was wrong about her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster. [...] Grimosco is taken away, and Miami stabs himself in shame. [...] Everyone else has a happy ending: Pocahontas is with Rolfe, Walter is with Alice, Larry is with Kate, Percy is with Geraldine, and even Robin is with Nima. Smith forgives Powhatan, and gives the play's final speech, predicting a great future for the new country that will form in this land.|$|E
2500|$|Many found Wallace an {{entertaining}} campaigner. To [...] "hippies" [...] who {{called him a}} fascist, he replied, [...] "I was killing fascists when you punks were in diapers."

50|$|The {{story is}} that if the top boulder of the Lonehill Koppie were {{dislodged}}, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> in <b>the</b> country would leave.

NOFX's song [...] "Kill <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Man" [...] was played briefly in the action movie Crank in 2006, and was credited as such in the film's soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|As muskets and {{firearms}} were {{too difficult to}} collect and would gather unwanted attention, the rebels used knives, hatchets, axes, and blunt instruments instead of firearms. Historian Stephen B. Oates states that Turner called on his group to [...] "kill <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> people". A contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "Turner declared that 'indiscriminate slaughter was not their intention after they attained a foothold, and was resorted to {{in the first instance}} to strike terror and alarm.'" [...] The group spared a few homes [...] "because Turner believed the poor white inhabitants 'thought no better of themselves than they did of negroes.'" ...|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, John McDonald {{already had}} a trading post across the Chickamauga River.

2500|$|In 1993, Type O Negative {{released}} their breakthrough album Bloody Kisses. The album {{focused primarily}} on romance, love, sex, and death. The song [...] "Black No.1 (Little Miss Scare-All)" [...] pays tribute to gothic subculture and is an ode to a goth girl Steele had once dated. Steele attacked his detractors with the songs [...] "We Hate Everyone" [...] and [...] "Kill <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> People", which dealt directly with the band's rumored racist ideology and served to erode any such accusations. Bloody Kisses eventually achieved Platinum status and established Type O Negative as one of gothic metal's most influential bands.|$|E
2500|$|Turner had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} rebellion to begin on July 4, 1831, but had fallen ill, pushing the date back until August 22. Turner started with several trusted fellow slaves, and ultimately gathered more than 70 enslaved and free blacks, {{some of whom were}} mounted on horseback. [...] On August 13, 1831, an atmospheric disturbance made the sun appear bluish-green. [...] Turner took this as the final signal, and began the rebellion a week later on August 21.

2500|$|On April 2, 1885, at Frog Lake, Saskatchewan (now in Alberta) a Cree raiding party led by Wandering Spirit {{attacked}} the small town. [...] Angered by {{what seemed to}} be unfair treaties and the withholding of vital provisions by the Canadian government, and also by the dwindling buffalo population, their main source of food, Big Bear and his Cree decided to rebel after the successful Métis victory at Duck Lake. They gathered <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> settlers in the area into the local church. [...] They killed Thomas Quinn, the town's Indian agent, after a disagreement broke out. The Cree then {{attacked the}} settlers, killing eight more and taking three captive.|$|E
