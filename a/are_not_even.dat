5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} under a single cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many years apart. Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E
5|$|The player must explore solar systems, gather clues, {{and find}} special {{artifacts}} that grant {{access to the}} Crystal Planet, ultimately destroying it before the player's home system flares. Commander McConnell's last journal entry {{can be found on}} the surface of the Crystal Planet; in it, he shares his discovery that Endurium is actually a race of living, sentient beings who are being burned up as fuel for interstellar travel. Because their metabolism is extremely slow due to their crystalline makeup, they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> aware of outside life and have come to view other races as a virus. The game is won after the player successfully plants an artifact on the Crystal Planet's surface and retreats back into space, causing the planet to explode, though the game can still be played after the Crystal Planet is destroyed.|$|E

50|$|This latter {{statement}} can {{be proven}} as follows. Suppose x <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b> Then x <b>is</b> odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, hence x² = x·x is odd. Thus x² <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E

25|$|For invertebrates, {{standard}} {{application of}} locational terminology often becomes difficult or debatable at best when {{the differences in}} morphology are so radical that common concepts are not homologous and do not refer to common concepts.

25|$|Many {{of these}} customs are local or cultural, and some <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{especially}} religious, but form {{a part of}} the church's relationship with the people in the time and place where it exists.

The local church customs, especially liturgical ones, are referred to as differences in typica (Style).|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, if 0# {{holds in}} V, {{then there is}} a closed {{unbounded}} class of ordinals that are indiscernible in L. While some of these <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> initial ordinals in V, they have all the large cardinal properties weaker than 0# in L. Furthermore, any strictly increasing class function from the class of indiscernibles to itself can be extended in a unique way to an elementary embedding of L into L. This gives L a nice structure of repeating segments.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Punjab deteriorated into anarchy with {{a rise in}} government correuption and police brutality. By the early 1990s, {{after many years of}} violence across Punjab, the activists' struggle for Khalistan had lost much of the sympathy given after the assault on the Golden Temple due to mass Indian media propagating nationalism against the cause, and what little armed resistance remained was eliminated and forced underground. In the following years there was concern over the apparent human rights abuses conducted by the central and state government against Sikhs, many of them innocent civilians, and many human rights organisations were not allowed in the Punjab at the time, and some <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> allowed there to this day.|$|E
25|$|Plasma {{consists}} of a mixture of electrons, ions, radicals, neutrals and photons. Some of these species are in local thermodynamic equilibrium, while others <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Even</b> for simple gases like argon this mixture can be complex. For plasmas of organic monomers, the complexity can rapidly increase as some components of the plasma fragment, while others interact and form larger species. Glow discharge is a technique in polymerization which forms free electrons which gain energy from an electric field, and then lose energy through collisions with neutral molecules in the gas phase. This leads to many chemically reactive species, which then lead to a plasma polymerization reaction. The electric discharge process for plasma polymerization is the “low-temperature plasma” method, because higher temperatures cause degradation. These plasmas are formed by a direct current, alternating current or radio frequency generator.|$|E
