50|$|There {{has always}} been a strong {{influence}} from mathematical logic on the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the beginning of the field it was realized that technology to <b>automate</b> <b>logical</b> <b>inferences</b> could have great potential to solve problems and draw conclusions from facts. Ron Brachman has described first-order logic (FOL) as the metric by which all AI knowledge representation formalisms should be evaluated. There is no more general or powerful known method for describing and analyzing information than FOL. The reason FOL itself is simply not used as a computer language is that it is actually too expressive, in the sense that FOL can easily express statements that no computer, no matter how powerful, could ever solve. For this reason every form of knowledge representation is in some sense a trade off between expressivity and computability. The more expressive the language is, the closer it is to FOL, {{the more likely it is}} to be slower and prone to an infinite loop.|$|R

We propose an agent architecture which combines Logic Programs with First-order Dynamic Bayesian Networks for establishing the <b>logical</b> <b>inferences</b> under uncertainties. The interactions of the concurrent processes are modeled by a new class of LP, Shared Logic Program, which realizes the process communications by overlapping their Herbrand Bases. Stochastic communications between Shared Logic Programs are also defined by First-order Dynamic Bayesian Networks.

Keywords: Fuzzy logic; fuzzy control; Max-Min rule, fuzzy interpolation. 1 Introduction This is a synthesizing paper which returns to the question, what is the role of the Max-Min (Max-t-norm) rule in fuzzy logic from the viewpoint of <b>logical</b> <b>inference.</b> We aim at demonstrating that two basic, more or less complementary approaches in fuzzy logic and its applications can be distinguished, namely: fuzzy interpolation of a fuzzily specified precise function and <b>logical</b> <b>inference</b> in the presence of fuzzy information.
