5000|$|Most steels contain 0.15 to 0.8% manganese. High {{strength}} alloys often contain 1 to 1.8% manganese. At about 1.5% manganese content, {{the steel}} becomes brittle, and this trait increases until about 4 to 5% manganese content is reached. At this point, the steel will pulverize at the strike of a hammer. Further {{increase in the}} manganese content will increase both hardness and ductility. At around 10% manganese content the steel will remain in its austenite form at room temperature if cooled correctly. Both hardness and ductility reach their highest points around 12%, depending on other <b>alloying</b> <b>agents.</b> The primary of these <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> is carbon, because the addition of manganese to low-carbon steel has little effect, but increases dramatically with increasing carbon content. The original Hadfield steel contained about 1.0% carbon. Other <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> may include metals like nickel and chromium; added most often to austenitic steels as an austenite stabilizer; molybdenum and vanadium; used in non-austenitic steels as a ferrite stabilizer; or even non-metallic elements such as silicon.|$|R

Starting with {{the preparation of}} an almost oxide free surface (oxide thickness = 0. 1 nm), the relative abundance of <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> (Mg, Li and Si) at the surface are recorded at various stages of thermal annealing, from room temperature to melting (which is observed at 550 ◦C). Prior to annealing, the surface abundances are below the detection limit Lt 1 %, in agreement with their bulk concentrations of 0. 423 % Si, 0. 322 % Mg and 0. 101 % Li (atomic %). At elevated temperatures, all three <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> appear at drastically increased concentrations (13. 3 % Si, 19. 7 % Mg and 45. 3 % Li), but decrease again with further elevation of the annealing temperature or after melting. The temperature at which the migration occurs is species dependent, with Li migration occurring at significantly higher temperatures than Si and Mg. The mechanism of migration {{also appears to be}} species dependent with Li migration occurring all over the surface but Mg migration being restricted to grain boundaries...|$|R

Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an <b>alloying</b> <b>agent</b> in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes.

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an <b>alloying</b> <b>agent</b> in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{steelmaking}} processes can {{be divided}} into two categories: Primary and Secondary steelmaking. Primary steelmaking involves converting liquid iron from a blast furnace and steel scrap into steel via basic oxygen steelmaking or melting scrap steel and/or direct reduced iron (DRI) in an electric arc furnace. Secondary steelmaking involves refining of the crude steel before casting and the various operations are normally carried out in ladles. In secondary metallurgy, <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> are added, dissolved gases in the steel are lowered, and inclusions are removed or altered chemically to ensure that high-quality steel is produced after casting.|$|R
5000|$|One-step {{embrittlement}} usually {{occurs in}} carbon steel at temperatures between 230 C and 290 C, and was historically {{referred to as}} [...] "500 degree Fahrenheit embrittlement." [...] This embrittlement occurs due to the precipitation of Widmanstatten needles or plates, made of cementite, in the interlath boundaries of the martensite. Impurities such as phosphorus, or <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> like manganese, may increase the embrittlement, or alter the temperature at which it occurs. This type of embrittlement is permanent, and can only be relieved by heating above the upper critical temperature and then quenching again. However, these microstructures usually require {{an hour or more}} to form, so are usually not a problem in the blacksmith-method of tempering.|$|R

The melt-spun filaments are pulverized to fine particle sizes, and subsequently consolidated by hot extrusion or hot isostatic pressing. Rapid solidification process gives rise to very fine-grained microstructures.

5000|$|Tempering {{involves}} a three-step {{process in which}} unstable martensite decomposes into ferrite and unstable carbides, and finally into stable cementite, forming various stages of a microstructure called tempered martensite. The martensite typically consists of laths (strips) or plates, sometimes appearing acicular (needle-like) or lenticular (lens-shaped). Depending on the carbon content, it also contains {{a certain amount of}} [...] "retained austenite." [...] Retained austenite are crystals which are unable to transform into martensite, even after quenching below the martensite finish (Mf) temperature. An increase in <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> or carbon content causes an increase in retained austenite. Austenite has much higher stacking-fault energy than martensite or pearlite, lowering the wear resistance and increasing the chances of galling, although some or most of the retained austenite can be transformed into martensite by cold and cryogenic treatments prior to tempering.|$|R

50|$|The {{temperature}} {{required to}} forge weld is typically 50 to 90 {{percent of the}} melting temperature. Iron can be welded when it surpasses the critical temperature (the A4 temperature) where its allotrope changes from gamma iron (face-centered cubic) to delta iron (body-centered cubic). Since the critical temperatures are affected by <b>alloying</b> <b>agents</b> like carbon, steel welds at a lower temperature-range than iron. As the carbon content in the steel increases, the welding temperature-range decreases in a linear fashion. Iron, different steels, and even cast-iron can be welded to each other, provided that their carbon content is close enough that the welding ranges overlap. Pure iron can be welded when nearly white hot; between 2500 F and 2700 F. Steel with a carbon content of 2.0% can be welded when orangish-yellow, between 1700 F and 2000 F. Common steel, between 0.2 and 0.8% carbon, is typically welded at a bright yellow heat.|$|R
