5|$|Tallon had {{difficulty}} with the English conditions {{early in the season}} as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> morning during a tour match against Surrey at The Oval and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. As a result of the injury, Tallon was rested for the following three matches.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E

5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie is the last of the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E
25|$|A {{widespread}} belief concerning ghosts is {{that they}} are composed of <b>a</b> <b>misty,</b> airy, or subtle material. Anthropologists link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.|$|E

25|$|The {{signalling}} system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man wrote out the ticket {{even though the}} work train was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of walking up the platform with the ticket after the work train had cleared. It was <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.|$|E
25|$|In Leonardo's {{earliest}} paintings we see {{the remarkable}} attention given to the small landscapes of the background, with lakes and water, swathed in <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> light.

This characteristic can be observed in other paintings by Leonardo, and closely resembles the mountains around Lago di Garda and Lago d'Iseo in Northern Italy. It is a particular feature of both the paintings of The Virgin of the Rocks, which also include caverns of fractured, tumbled, and water-eroded limestone.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, Wood {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Shotgun Wedding, an exploitation film about hillbillies marrying child brides, and Wood's transitional film, once again combining two genres, horror and grindhouse skin-flick, was 1965's Orgy of the Dead, originally titled Nudie Ghoulies. Wood handled various production details while Stephen C. Apostolof directed under the pseudonym A. C. Stephen. The film {{begins with a}} re-creation of the opening scene from the then-unreleased Night of the Ghouls. Criswell, wearing one of Lugosi's old capes, rises from his coffin to deliver an introduction taken almost word-for-word from the previous film. Set in <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> graveyard, the Lord of the Dead (Criswell) and his sexy consort, the Black Ghoul (a Vampira look-alike), preside over a series of macabre performances by topless dancers from beyond the grave (recruited by Wood from local strip clubs). The film also features a Wolf Man and a Mummy. Together, Wood and Apostolof went on to make a string of sexploitation films up to 1977. Wood co-wrote the screenplays and occasionally acted. Venus Flytrap (1970), a US/Japan horror film, {{was based on an}} unproduced Wood screenplay from the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The two craft {{were brought}} down to Langstone Harbour for {{competitive}} trials. On its trials on <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> morning, {{the noise from}} the two 120hp Chryslers in the Birmabright alloy hull scared some mothers who hurried their children away from the Isle of Wight beaches as the craft came inshore. The conclusions of the trial left no one in doubt. A platoon of Royal Marines disembarked from the Fleming craft in {{a quarter of the}} time taken by the platoon in the Thornycroft, the silhouette of the Fleming craft was less, it created less disturbance when steaming, and it beached better. But, and this was later the deciding factor, the Birmabright craft was so noisy that it meant sacrificing tactical surprise, while it was impossible to mount armour on its sides. The failings of the Thornycroft craft on the other hand could all be overcome. A second prototype from Thornycroft had a double-diagonal mahogany hull with twin engines and those features ‚Äî low silhouette, quiet engines, little bow wave ‚Äî which appealed to the Centre's staff in their search for a craft that could make surprise landings. The craft beached satisfactorily, a quality retained in all LCA designs, but the troops took too long to disembark across this prototype's narrow ramp. Armour could easily take the place of the outer mahogany planking, the exit could be lowered, the silhouette could be cut down and the engines could be so silenced {{that they would not be}} heard at twenty-five yards. So although the Fleming boat won at the trial, it was the Thornycroft design, duly altered, that became the assault landing craft. A third prototype ‚Äî ALC No 2 ‚Äî was therefore built after the DNC had worked with Thornycroft on modifications to the design.|$|E

The song received further negative feedback from David Hutchison of Attitude magazine, during a retrospective review for the album. He theorized that Williams' random choice of cover version of songs gave it a feeling of being an old mixtape.

[...] In his review, Wright explained his love of crossover fiction and commended Davies for the direction he took Doctor Who into becoming what Wright {{considered to be a}} [...] "small television industry". Wright complimented the way the episode was keeping with tradition, specifically aspects such as; [...] "Daleks trundling around spaceships having shouty conversations with each other"; [...] "UNIT [...] as useless as ever at repelling alien marauders", and the visual appearance of Davros. He described Bleach's portrayal as a [...] "halfway house between the original version as played by Michael Wisher and the more exuberant...turn by Terry Molloy". He also thought positively of the final scenes; he commented that [...] "the most flint-hearted must have had <b>a</b> <b>misty</b> eye as Rose found her Time Lord again and they ran towards each other in candy box slow-mo" [...] and he cheered when the [...] "outpouring of romance was brought to an end, as it should be in Doctor Who, by a big Dalek gun".|$|E

500|$|Bono {{informed}} the fans waiting outside the venue {{that the show}} would be general admission, and told everyone to get {{as close to the}} stage as possible, regardless of the seating assignment on their tickets. Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the worst kind of weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come."
