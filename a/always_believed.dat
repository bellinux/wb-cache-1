5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> {{his health}} to be fragile, {{and by the}} time he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine {{personal}} tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died suddenly in 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E

5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the water. Based on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Maga made Houphouët-Boigny {{recognize}} the R.D.D. as the Dahomeyan wing of his African Democratic Rally (R.D.A.). Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> that the U.D.D. {{was the sole}} representative of the Rally. This had helped bring a new political philosophy to the R.D.D., which had, up to this point, done little more than express regionalism without much of a platform.|$|E
25|$|Loerzer was out {{of contact}} with Reichenau's command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon {{complaining}} to Löhr about the former's ignorance. Because he was impetuous {{and wanted to be}} in the thick of the action, Richthofen began flying around over the frontline in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, as air-ground liaison collapsed. His claims were not <b>always</b> <b>believed,</b> and these personal operations were a waste of time and needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his Storch on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of Fliegerführer z.b.V., giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six Gruppen (Groups).|$|E
25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

25|$|The cabinet {{committee}} (not including Asquith) that in 1911 {{planned the}} Third Home Rule Bill opposed any special status for Protestant Ulster within majority-Catholic Ireland. Asquith later (in 1913) wrote to Churchill, {{stating that the}} Prime Minister had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> and stated {{that the price of}} Home Rule should be a special status for Ulster. In spite of this, the bill as introduced in April 1912 contained no such provision, and was meant to apply to all Ireland. Neither partition nor a special status for Ulster was likely to satisfy either side. The self-government offered by the bill was very limited, but Irish Nationalists, expecting Home Rule to come by gradual parliamentary steps, favoured it. The Conservatives and Ulster Unionists opposed it. Both Nationalists and Unionists began preparing to get their way by force if necessary, and the Unionists were in general better financed and more organised.|$|E
25|$|The series 8 recommission {{press release}} stated {{there would be}} a twist in the final episode of series 7. In this episode, a nuclear bomb is set to explode, {{triggered}} by a Russian sleeper agent who is part of Operation Tiresias. As Parliament and the Royal Family are evacuated, the nuclear threat to London is eliminated when Ros and Lucas are able to turn Connie James and elude an FSB kill squad. While defusing the bomb, Connie is killed by its conventional explosives. Seconds before the bomb exploded, Connie revealed that it had not been Harry who sold Lucas North out to the Russians as Lucas had <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> but, rather, herself. The episode concludes with Harry, conscious but with his mouth taped shut, in the boot of a car being zipped up in a body bag by Viktor Sarkisian, head of the FSB's London station.|$|E
25|$|Marriott <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> Dee Anthony had syphoned off band {{earnings}} {{to promote his}} new project, Frampton and his album Frampton Comes Alive. After Marriott's death, second wife Pam Stephens claimed {{in an interview that}} while they were making the Marriott solo album they were warned off accusing Anthony of any financial misdealings and received threatening phone calls. Anthony was alleged to have links with the Genovese crime family (among others). She also claimed that after Marriott confronted Anthony about the missing money, she and Marriott were summoned to a meeting at the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street in New York's Little Italy district. Among those present were John Gotti, Frank Locascio and Paul Castellano, all members of the Gambino crime family. Marriott was informed {{that he would not be}} getting any money and was warned to drop the matter. Marriott took the threats seriously.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} dynamic games with almost perfect information, that is, at every stage some players (possibly one) make a choice simultaneously, and these choices become known to {{everyone}} before the next stage starts. We introduce the idea of common belief in future rationality, which states that a player <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> that his opponents will choose rationally {{in the present and}} in the future, that a player <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> that every opponent <b>always</b> <b>believes</b> that each of his opponents will choose rationally in the present and in the future, and so on. We present an easy elimination procedure, backwards dominance, that selects exactly those strategies that can rationally be chosen under common belief in future rationality. This procedure {{can be viewed as a}} combination of backwards induction and iterated strict dominance. We 8 ̆ 5 nally relate the concept to other rationality concepts in the literature. Key words and phrases: Epistemic game theory, dynamic games, belief in future ratio-nality, algorithms...|$|R

25|$|I've <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> {{that you}} play to {{highlight}} the song, not {{to highlight the}} player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E
25|$|Authors such as Jim Curran have {{suggested}} that Gilkey's death, while tragic, undoubtedly saved {{the lives of the}} rest of the team, who were now free to concentrate on their own survival. Houston has agreed with this assessment, but Pete Schoening <b>always</b> <b>believed,</b> based on his other experiences of mountain rescue, that the team could have successfully completed the rescue, albeit with more frostbite than they eventually suffered. There is also controversy over the manner of Gilkey's death. Tom Hornbein and others {{have suggested}} that, realising his rescue was endangering the lives of the others, Gilkey might have managed to work himself loose from the mountainside. Charles Houston initially thought that this would not have been possible, believing that Gilkey, who was sedated with morphine would have been too weak to have removed the anchors. However, reviewing events for a documentary in 2003 he became convinced that Gilkey had indeed ended his own life. Others however, such as Robert Bates, remained convinced that Gilkey died as a result of an accident rather than suicide.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which was why she didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has <b>always</b> <b>believed</b> that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E
