5|$|In February 2011, new {{packaging}} of Borjomi water {{presenting a}} new <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> modern look was introduced, accentuating relief {{of the deer}} image and sign of the manufacturer on the label. More than 40 countries, including Ukraine, Israel, the United States, Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Canada, Austria, Turkey, Japan, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and South Korea, will get Borjomi in newly designed bottles.|$|E
5|$|Malabi is {{a creamy}} pudding {{originating}} from Turkey prepared with milk or almond milk (for a kosher version) and cornstarch. It is {{sold as a}} street food from carts or stalls, in disposable cups with thick sweet syrup and various crunchy toppings such as chopped pistachios or coconut. Its popularity has resulted in supermarkets selling it in plastic packages and restaurants serving richer <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> versions using various toppings and garnishes such as berries and fruit. Sahlab is a similar dessert made from the powdered tubers of orchids and milk.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{the gang}} was rediscovered, now with weapons, drug {{connections}} <b>and</b> a <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> criminal organization.|$|R
50|$|AMX-10VFA: AMX-10P {{carrying}} the ATILA artillery fire control system. This spawned two sub-variants of its own, the <b>more</b> simplified AMX-10VLA, <b>and</b> the <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> AMX-10VFA.|$|R

5|$|Ward's {{thesis is}} {{based on the fact that}} the Thyssen panel, so named after its home at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, is {{overwhelmingly}} influenced by Campin, while the contemporaneous <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> Madonna Standing draws heavily from van Eyck. He finds such a sudden shift unlikely, while also pointing out that this work evidences some technical difficulties that Campin was never to resolve, especially in respect to foreshortening and the rendering of the body beneath the robes. He also points to the architectural similarities in Campin's Marriage of Mary, although this may be a matter of influence.|$|E
5|$|The IRA {{immediately}} began {{making plans to}} break Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon out of the prison. The first attempt involved explosives that had been smuggled into the prison, which were {{to be used to}} blow a hole in a door which would give the prisoners access to the exercise yard. From there, they would scale a rope ladder thrown over the exterior wall by members of the IRA's Dublin Brigade who would have a getaway car waiting to complete the escape. The plan failed when the prisoners could not gain access to the exercise yard and the rope ladder was spotted, so the IRA began making new escape plans. The idea of using a helicopter in an escape had been discussed before, an idea to break Gerry Adams out of Long Kesh internment camp had been ruled out because of faster <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> British Army helicopters being stationed at a nearby base. The IRA's GHQ staff approved the plan to break out Twomey, O'Hagan and Mallon, and arrangements were made to obtain a helicopter. A man with an American accent calling himself Mr. Leonard approached the manager of Irish Helicopters at Dublin Airport, with a view to hiring a helicopter for an aerial photographic shoot in County Laois. After being shown the company's fleet of helicopters, Leonard arranged to hire a five-seater Alouette II for 31 October.|$|E
25|$|Eliminating {{bleed air}} {{increases}} the electric load, as cabin pressurization, anti-ice/de-ice systems, and other functions {{need to be}} powered electrically instead. This necessitates an increased size of electrical generators as well as higher-power power distribution boards <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> backup and control systems.|$|E
25|$|By 1978 the luster {{had worn}} off the design, <b>and</b> as <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> {{competitors}} were introduced the press began criticizing {{the lack of}} power and performance.|$|R
50|$|Pope Leo XIII, {{seeing that}} popular {{democracy}} {{seemed to be}} on the ascendant, tried a new <b>and</b> somewhat <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> approach to political questions than his predecessor Pius IX.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{versions}} use rotary compressors <b>and</b> have <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> variable governors. The unit {{is usually}} {{mounted on a}} trailer and sometimes includes an electrical generator to supply lights or electric power tools.|$|R
25|$|The chief {{discoveries of}} {{molecular}} biology {{took place in}} a period of only about twenty-five years. Another fifteen years were required before new <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> technologies, united today under the name of genetic engineering, would permit the isolation and characterization of genes, in particular those of highly complex organisms.|$|E
25|$|PID tuning is a {{difficult}} problem, {{even though there are}} only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the limitations of PID control. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> techniques are the subject of patents; this section describes some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.|$|E
25|$|The {{rule of the}} Eóganachta in Munster {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as gentle <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> in comparison with the other provincial dynasties of Ireland. Not only was Munster the wealthiest of the provinces, but the Eóganachta were willing to concede other previously powerful kingdoms whom they had politically marginalized, such as the Corcu Loígde, considerable status and freedom from tribute, based on their former status as rulers of the province.|$|E
50|$|Typically, a jacal {{consisted}} of slim close-set poles tied together and filled out with mud, clay <b>and</b> grasses. <b>More</b> <b>sophisticated</b> structures, {{such as those}} constructed by the Anasazi, incorporated adobe bricks—sun-baked mud and sandstone.|$|R
50|$|Night {{operations}} {{have been subject}} to vast shifts in effectiveness and frequency throughout history, as tactics <b>and</b> technology became <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} built to minimal standards, but as {{construction}} was nearing completion, the North British Railway indicated a number of demands, including an intermediate crossing place on the line, <b>and</b> signalling <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> than one engine in steam.|$|R
25|$|Sam Blonger's {{participation}} in his brother's gang waned as bigger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> cons were developed, {{and he died}} in 1914. Meanwhile, Lou Blonger expanded the gang's home base from Denver, where it operated only during the warmest months, southward to Miami and Havana, Cuba. During the winter Blonger relaxed at Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he reportedly compared notes with his old friend William Pinkerton, president of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.|$|E
25|$|From 1983 to 1986, some Hawks were {{equipped}} as short-range interceptor aircraft. 88 T1s were {{modified to}} carry two AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles {{in addition to}} a 30mm ADEN cannon gun pod; these aircraft were redesignated as Hawk T1A. In a wartime scenario, they would have worked in collaboration with the RAF's Tornado F3 interceptors, which would use their Foxhunter search radars <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> navigation systems to vector the Hawks against enemy targets.|$|E
25|$|The design {{originated}} in 1935 from a requirement by United Air Lines. The {{goal was to}} develop a much larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> replacement for the DC-3 before the first DC-3 had even flown. There was enough interest from other airlines that American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, Pan American Airways and Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA) joined United, providing $100,000 each toward the cost of developing the new aircraft. As cost and complexity rose, Pan American and TWA withdrew their funds in favor of the Boeing 307, which was anticipated to be less costly.|$|E
50|$|Per Jonas Nordhagen {{does not}} reject the {{basilica}} theory, but suggests development along two paths {{and that the}} basilical was a development towards larger <b>and</b> technically <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> churches. The main, progressive path according to Nordhagen lead to Torpo and Borgund.|$|R
50|$|While the snaffle bridle is more common, {{the double}} bridle, {{in the hands}} of an {{experienced}} rider, is able to transmit <b>more</b> nuanced commands <b>and</b> obtain <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> responses from the horse. Thus, for advanced forms of riding, it is preferred.|$|R
50|$|The Court {{continued}} its trend towards a greater expansion of personal jurisdiction that {{falls within the}} Constitutional limits of due process. This decision reflected a growing <b>and</b> increasingly <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> economy, in which more commercial transactions were taking place across state lines.|$|R
25|$|Since then, {{considerable}} {{work has}} gone into creating more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> dummies. Hybrid II was introduced in 1972, with improved shoulder, spine, and knee responses, and more rigorous documentation. Hybrid II became the first dummy {{to comply with the}} American Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) for testing of automotive lap and shoulder belts. In 1973, a 50th percentile male dummy was released, and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) undertook an agreement with General Motors to produce a model exceeding Hybrid II's performance in a number of specific areas.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to criticisms that contemporaries such as Belisario Bulgarini leveled against his first effort, Mazzoni wrote the more extensive <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> On the Defense of the Comedy of Dante. In this work, before directly addressing Dante’s work, Mazzoni develops {{his theory of}} poetics, in which, drawing heavily from Plato and Aristotle, he discusses mimesis, the role of poetry, and the definition of poetry versus poetics (see Theory section, below). Though no complete English translation of Mazzoni’s text exists, excerpts from the Introduction and Summary have appeared in some anthologies, {{as well as in}} a partial translation by Robert L. Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 14th century, keep towers became larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> with rib {{vaulting}} {{roofs and}} facilities like fireplaces. Keep towers with improved residential characteristics {{can be found}} in the castles of Beja, Estremoz and Bragança, while some later castles (15th century) became real palaces, like those in Penedono, Ourém and Porto de Mós. The most significant case is the Castle of Leiria, turned into a royal palace by King John I. Some rooms of the palace are decorated with splendid Gothic loggias, from which the surrounding landscape could be appreciated by the King and Queen.|$|E
50|$|Primarily {{based in}} Samburu National Reserve in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, Save the Elephants carries out {{rigorous}} studies of elephants, including elephant collaring <b>and</b> <b>more</b> recently, <b>sophisticated</b> elephant tracking techniques.|$|R
50|$|From {{the early}} 1930s Kihle {{typically}} used earthen colors and a primitive painting style. Later his paintings became brighter <b>and</b> the style <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{says that}} with this basic rule, a game can be played but the scores will be unrealistically low (compared to real cricket). There {{are a number of}} rules, which are best introduced gradually, which make the game <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> realistic (<b>and</b> require <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> thinking from the players).|$|R
25|$|In {{southern}} Eritrea, the Aussa Sultanate (Afar Sultanate) succeeded {{the earlier}} Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity {{had come into}} existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Sultanate of Harar. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne. In 1734, the Afar leader Kedafu, head of the Mudaito clan, seized power and established the Mudaito Dynasty. This marked {{the start of a}} new <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> polity that would last into the colonial period.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 Matras most {{innovative}} feature {{was the use}} of aviation-inspired structural fuel tanks but the FIA decided to ban the technology for 1970. For 1969 Matra made the radical decision to withdraw its works team and build a new car using structural tanks for the Tyrrell team, even though it would be eligible for only a single season. The 1969 season started with cars using larger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> wings than the previous year. When both Lotus cars broke their wings' struts and crashed at the Spanish Grand Prix, the FIA banned wings for the next race at Monaco. They were reintroduced later in the season but were to be restricted in size and height, and attached directly to the chassis in a fixed position.|$|E
25|$|At that time, just a {{few years}} after the Russian Revolution, Russia was desperate to develop {{industry}} and earn foreign exchange, so their oil industry eventually did obtain much of their technology from foreign companies, largely American. At about that time however, fluid catalytic cracking was being explored and developed and soon replaced most of the purely thermal cracking processes in the fossil fuel processing industry. The replacement was however not complete; many types of cracking, including pure thermal cracking, still are in use, depending {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the products required to satisfy market demands. Thermal cracking remains important however, for example in producing naphtha, gas oil, and coke, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> forms of thermal cracking have been developed for various purposes. These include visbreaking, steam cracking, and coking.|$|E
50|$|Burrows is {{best known}} for his comic timing, complex {{blocking}} for actors, <b>and</b> incorporating <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> lighting in television studio shoots. He is also credited as being one of the first sitcom directors to increase the typical multi-camera television shoot from three to four cameras.|$|R
40|$|Type {{systems were}} {{originally}} introduced in programming languages {{to provide a}} degree of static checking, achieved through typechecking. As type systems become <b>more</b> complex <b>and</b> typechecking <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> the attribute static becomes less appropriate.
