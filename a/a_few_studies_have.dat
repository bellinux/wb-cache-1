25|$|Object memory {{involves}} processing {{features of}} an object or material such as texture, color, size, and orientation. It is processed mainly in the ventral regions of the brain. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown that on average most people can recall up to four items each {{with a set of}} four different visual qualities.

25|$|Tramadol is {{well-established}} as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{found that}} it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10μM), similar in effect to fenfluramine. The serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents like fenfluramine and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. Tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{even found}} that emotionally arousing stimuli enhance memory {{only after a}} delay. The most famous of these was a study by Kleinsmith and Kaplan (1963) that found an {{advantage}} for numbers paired with arousing words over those paired with neutral words only at delayed test, but not at immediate test. As outlined by Mather (2007), the Kleinsmith and Kaplan effects were most likely due to a methodological confound. However, Sharot and Phelps (2004) found better recognition of arousing words over neutral words at a delayed test but not at an immediate test, supporting {{the notion that there}} is enhanced memory consolidation for arousing stimuli. According to these theories, different physiological systems, including those involved in the discharge of hormones believed to affect memory consolidation, become active during, and closely following, the occurrence of arousing events.|$|E
25|$|The {{regression}} hypothesis can {{be named}} {{as the first}} established theory in language loss. Its tradition goes far back, further than any other theory. The first researcher who designed it was Ribot in 1880. Later, Freud took Ribot's idea up again and related it to aphasia (Weltens & Schmid 2004: 211). In 1940, Roman Jakobson embedded it into a linguistic framework and claimed that language attrition is the mirror image of language acquisition (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). Even though only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> tested this hypothesis, it is quite attractive to many researchers. As Weltens and Schmid (2004: 212) state, children acquire the language in stages. It was then suggested that language competence, in general, appears in different layers and therefore, attrition, as the mirror image of acquisition, will also happen from the top layer to the bottom.|$|E

25|$|Though no {{formulation}} of progesterone is approved for use via sublingual administration, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> investigated {{the use of}} progesterone by this route. A study of sublingual progesterone for luteal support in patients undergoing embryo transfer found that after sublingual administration of 50 or 100nbsp&mg progesterone dissolved in a 1nbsp&mL suspension, peak levels of progesterone were reached in 30 to 60 minutes and were on average 17.61nbsp&ng/mL with the 100-mg dose. However, the duration was short and re-administration {{had to be done}} two or three times per day for adequate circulating levels of progesterone to be maintained throughout the day. Another study found that sublingual progesterone had to be administered at a dose of 400nbsp&mg every 8nbsp&hours to achieve circulating levels similar to those produced by 100nbsp&mg/day intramuscular progesterone. Further clinical research is necessary {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} progesterone via the sublingual route of administration.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that total dietary fat intake {{is linked to}} {{an increased risk of}} obesity and diabetes. However, a number of very large studies, including the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial, an eight-year study of 49,000 women, the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, revealed no such links. None of these studies suggested any connection between percentage of calories from fat and risk of cancer, heart disease, or weight gain. The Nutrition Source, a website maintained by the Department of Nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, summarizes the current evidence on the impact of dietary fat: [...] "Detailed research—much of it done at Harvard—shows that the total amount of fat in the diet isn't really linked with weight or disease." ...|$|E

2500|$|HLA-DQ8 confers {{susceptibility}} to coeliac disease {{but in a}} fashion somewhat similar to DQ2.5. Homozygotes of DQ8, DQ2.5/DQ8 and DQ8/DQ2.2 are higher than expected based on levels in the general population.(see: Understanding DQ haplotypes and DQ isoforms). HLA-DQ8 is generally not as involved in the most severe complications, {{and it does not}} recognize the [...] "33mer" [...] of α-2 gliadin to the same degree as DQ2.5. There are a smaller number of gliadin (prolamin) peptides presented by HLA-DQ8. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> been done on the adaptive immune response for DQ8/DQ2- individuals. DQ8 appears to rely much more on adaptive immunity to the carboxyl half of alpha gliadins. [...] In addition, it appear to react with gamma gliadin to a degree comparable to DQ2.5.

2500|$|High {{levels of}} {{testosterone}} combined with {{low levels of}} cortisol and/or serotonin have been theorized as contributing factors. Testosterone is [...] "associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction", and injecting testosterone [...] "shift the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity", decreases fearfulness, and increases [...] "responding to angry faces". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with [...] "impulsive and highly negative reactions", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated. Several animal studies note the role of serotonergic functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis {{can usually}} be made by {{palpation}} or by feeling the joint and surrounding tissues, although there is controversy {{as to whether or}} not the degree of subluxation can be measured clinically. [...] If shoulder subluxation occurs, it can become a barrier to the rehabilitation process. [...] Treatment involves measures to support the subluxed joint such as taping the joint, using a lapboard or armboard. [...] A shoulder sling may be used, but is controversial and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> shown no appreciable difference in range-of-motion, degree of subluxation, or pain when using a sling. A sling may also contribute to contractures and increased flexor tone if used for extended periods of time as it places the arm close to the body in adduction, internal rotation and elbow flexion. Use of a sling can also contribute to learned nonuse by preventing the functional and spontaneous use of the affected upper extremity. That said, a sling may be necessary for some therapy activities. Slings may be considered appropriate during therapy for initial transfer and gait training, but overall use should be limited. As the patient begins to recover, spasticity and voluntary movement of the shoulder will occur as well as reduction in the shoulder subluxation. Slings are of no value at this point.|$|E
30|$|The {{function}} and physiological/pathological relevance of most circRNAs remained to be elucidated, although <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> <b>had</b> shown promising roles of circRNAs, such as miRNA sponge, promoting transcription of parent gene, mRNA traps, and translation templates.

CircRNAs had been widely identified in many species or special context such as developing stages or clinical samples, but their physiological/pathological roles remained elusive. Further intensive studies are warranted to explore the molecular and biological functions of circRNAs.|$|R
