The Defender Black was a 90 or 110 County 4x4 with metallic black paint, leather seats, <b>air</b> <b>con,</b> roll cage and dark-tinted rear windows. One {{of the most}} exciting off-road vehicles ever produced, Defender Silver is equipped with stylish and purposeful extras, inside and out, and was available in three distinct versions - TD5, 90 and 110 Station Wagon and 110 Double Cab Pickup. Designed to be tough. Very tough. It was designed to cope with the roughest off-road terrain. [...] That's why every Defender Silver was fitted with an A-frame protection bar which, while undoubtedly enhancing its rugged looks, offered additional protection {{to the front of the}} vehicle. [...] Lamp guards were fitted front and rear, and a tow pack incorporating an electrics kit not only to power trailer lights, but also additional equipment. The underside was further shielded from harm by the sump guard and air-con and ABS/TC were available as options. [...] The vehicles came of the production line and were then modified by SVO - Special Vehicle Operations. They are comparatively rare, especially the Double Cab Pick Up with its opinion splitting Fiberglass TruckMan Top..|$|E

5000|$|On the {{introduction}} of the smooth bumper facelift Nissan also offered the [...] "200SX Executive". This doesn't appear on the car at all but only on the UK vehicle Log Book. The Executive was a locally enhanced specification produced by the UK importer AFG. At launch and as tested by the press it initially had limited slip differential, leather seats (high back seats re-trimmed in UK), leather trimmed steering wheel and gear knob, headlamp washers, <b>air</b> <b>con,</b> sun roof and a multi change CD player in the boot. Some cars that were sold as Executive arrived without sunroof so a local accessory sun roof was fitted during the upgrade. It very quickly lost the CD player and the leather seats for low back seats with adjustable head rests. During the period that the Executive was sold the base model was downgraded to steel wheels. As most cars with steel wheels have had alloy wheels fitted and the grey waffle fabric trim on seats and doors was common, it's no longer easy to tell an Executive from a base model and the log book must be checked.

40|$|Brownmarmorated stink bug,Halyomorpha halys (Stål), is {{a highly}} {{polyphagous}} in-vasive species attacking both cultivated and wild plants increasing its threat to ecosys-tems as a global pest. However, dispersal biology of this invasive species is not well understood. This study evaluated the flight capacity and behavior of H. halys under laboratory, semi-field, and field conditions. Flightmills were used tomeasure the base-line flight capacity of adults collected year round {{from the field and}} included both for-aging and overwintering populations. The effects of abiotic conditions such as wind speed and temperatures on the free flight parameters of H. halys were evaluated under semi-field and field conditions. The mean flight distances over a 22 -h period were 2442 and 2083 m for male and female, respectively. Most individuals (89 %) flew < 5 km, though some flewmuch further with amaximum flight distance observed of 117 km. Flight distances by H. halys increased after emergence from overwintering sites in spring and reached their highest point in June. The incidence of take off by H. halyswas significantly affected by the wind speed; when providedwith still <b>air</b> <b>con...</b>|$|E
40|$|The low {{temperature}} {{operation of a}} heat pump makes it an excellent match {{for the use of}} solar energy. At the National University of Singapore, a solar assisted heat pump system has been designed, fabricated and installed to provide water heating and drying. The system also utilizes the <b>air</b> <b>con</b> waste heat, which would normally be released to atmosphere adding to global warming. Experimental results show that the twophase unglazed solar evaporator-collector, instead of losing energy to the ambient, gained a significant amount due to low operating temperature of the collector. As a result, the collector efficiency attains a value greater than 1, when conventional collector equations are used. With this evaporator-collector, the system can be operated {{even in the absence of}} solar irradiation. The waste heat was collected from an air-con system, which maintained a room at 20 - 22 oC. In the condenser side, water at 60 oC was produced at a rate of 3 liter/minute and the drying capacity was 2. 2 kg/hour. Maximum COP of the system was found to be about 5. 5...|$|E
