25|$|The entire steel {{superstructure}} and all <b>above-ground</b> <b>concrete</b> pouring was complete in January 2015. Glass for {{the windows and}} curtain walls began to be placed that same month, with glass enclosure of the building complete on April 14, 2015. That same day, {{the first of the}} structure's 3,600 bronze-colored panels for the building's corona were installed.|$|E

40|$|The Dhamar {{province}} of the Yemen Arab Republic was shaken on 13 December 1982 by a moderate earthquake. The earthquake caused considerable loss of life and different degrees of damage to the traditional houses in the area. The most common forms of construction, consisting of stone masonry and adobe, suffered very extensive damage. The destruction of houses was mainly due to failure of the superstructure and none due to the movement of foundations. An <b>above-ground</b> reinforced <b>concrete</b> water tank also collapsed. Ground fissures, rupture of stones on a hill side, rock falls, and slides were also observed. An isoseismal map of the earthquake-damaged area is also presented...|$|R
5000|$|... 1981 {{was a year}} of drastic {{change for}} the center. In early 1981, the DeJarnette Center for Human Development began an effort to service {{patients}} throughout the year; prior to that time, the young patients were sent to their parents' homes or therapeutic foster homes each weekend and went for extended visits during the summer to their parents' homes. Additionally, the former Adolescent Unit of Western State Hospital was shut down, and minors of adolescent age were permanently transferred to the DeJarnette Center. This was {{the apex of the}} scope and size of the DeJarnette Center. A <b>concrete</b> <b>above-ground</b> pool was constructed, and was in operation until the late 1980s, at which time insurance costs became excessive.|$|R
50|$|Dan Ladd is a Northampton, Massachusetts based American {{artist who}} works with trees and gourds. He began experimenting with glass, china, and metal {{inclusions}} in trees in 1977 in Vermont and started planting trees for Extreme Nature in 1978. He became inspired by inosculation he noticed in nature and by the growth of tree trunks around man-made objects such as fences and idle farm equipment. He shapes and grafts trees, including their fruits and their roots, into architectural and geometric forms. Ladd calls human-initiated inosculation 'pleaching' and calls his own work 'tree sculpture'. Ladd binds a variety of objects to trees, for live wood to grow around and be incorporated, including teacups, bicycle wheels, headstones, steel spheres, water piping, and electrical conduit. He guides roots into shapes, such as stairs, using <b>above-ground</b> wooden and <b>concrete</b> forms and even shapes woody, hard-shelled Lagenaria gourds {{by allowing them to}} grow into detailed molds. A current project at the DeCordova and Dana Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts incorporates eleven American Liberty Elm trees grafted next to each other to form a long hillside stair banister. Another of his installations, Three Arches, consists of three pairs of 14-foot sycamore trees, which he grafted into arches to frame different city views, at Frank Curto Park in Pittsburgh.|$|R
50|$|The large two-story Bunkhouse {{also served}} as a {{residence}} for the assistant rangers. Like the office, the bunkhouse has board-and-batten siding on its lower level with horizontal clapboard above. There is an <b>above-ground</b> <b>concrete</b> foundation in the front to make the house level against slightly sloping ground. The front porch is placed off-center. There is also a side porch with an overhanging roof. Both porches are supported by 10-inch-square posts with curved wooden braces.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, to {{celebrate}} the first century of Tulsa's incorporation as a city, the city sealed a Plymouth Prowler in a time capsule buried in Centennial Park (formerly known as Central Park) at 6th Street and Peoria Avenue. The city plans to open it in 2048. This time, the car was encased in a specially-constructed plastic box, which was then entombed in an <b>above-ground</b> <b>concrete</b> vault. The Rotary Club added various other memorabilia to {{the contents of the}} time capsule.|$|E
5000|$|There are two mines {{which have}} guided tours at regular intervals. The Red Hill Mine is a self-guided tour {{that tells the}} story of a group of Cornishmen and their {{discovery}} of the Welcome Nugget. The Sovereign Quartz Mine runs 40 minute guided tours and features several underground displays. Above ground it also features steam-driven machinery for pumping water and processing the ore. More recently an attraction titled [...] "Trapped" [...] has been added. This exhibit, which is set in series of <b>above-ground</b> <b>concrete</b> structures designed to look like tunnels from within, {{tells the story of}} the New Australasian Gold Mine disaster at Creswick in 1882. Twenty-two miners died because of the collapse and flooding of the New Australasian No. 2 Mine. This is still considered one of Australia's worst mining disaster. Australia's worst mining disaster was the Mount Keira Mine Disaster in 1902 which killed 96 workers.|$|E
