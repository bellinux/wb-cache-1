5|$|Bismuth was {{purchased}} from the American Smelting and Refining Company {{of the highest}} purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was put in aluminum cans, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The canned slugs then shipped to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an <b>aluminum</b> <b>chloride</b> solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to iron and copper in the aluminum alloy. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100–1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000–1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that {{were found to be}} workable, but less efficient or safe.|$|E

40|$|Samples of {{particulates}} {{collected from}} the exhaust of Space Shuttle launches STS- 1, - 4, - 5, - 6, and - 7 were analyzed. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry of these samples indicated that the particulates were spherical and predominantly composed of aluminum oxide. The water-soluble weight fraction, pH, acid-soluble weight fraction, and insoluble weight fraction were determined for each sample. Water-soluble weight fractions averaged about 7 {{percent of the total}} sample weight, were generally very acidic, and contained significantly elevated concentrations of <b>chloride</b> and <b>aluminum</b> (III) ion. The high concentrations of soluble <b>aluminum</b> (III) and <b>chloride</b> ions observed suggested that <b>aluminum</b> <b>chlorides</b> and/or oxychlorides had formed {{on the surface of the}} alumina particulates. More than 72 percent by weight of each sample was insoluble in either water or strong mineral acid, and was identified as alpha-Al 2 O 3. The results from these analyses suggest that the surface of Space Shuttle exhaust alumina particulates will be highly acidic and heavily chlorided, and that a substantial amount of the surface chloride may be chemically associated with aluminum (III) ions rather than just physically adsorbed as HCl...|$|R

25|$|Research in {{the area}} of a solid {{catalyst}} for alkylation has been ongoing for many years. Numerous patents exist for different catalysts, catalyst supports, and processes. Lewis acids will catalyze the alkylation reaction (alkylation of isobutane with olefins was discovered using <b>aluminum</b> <b>chloride</b> promoted with HCl). Several of the current preferred solid catalysts use a salt of HF: either boron trifluoride (BF3) or antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} can be catalyzed by {{a variety}} of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and <b>aluminum</b> <b>chloride.</b> However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product.

40|$|One of the {{characteristic}} reactions of α-polycarbonyl compounds is {{their tendency to}} undergo “decarbonylation” {{with the formation of}} a compound with one less carbon atom and carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide. An important synthetic example of this type of reaction is the thermal decomposition of oxalylacetic esters which yield the corresponding malonic esters and carbon monoxide. The related thermal decarbonylation of ethyl pyruvate has been studied by Calvin and Lemmon. These workers found that ethyl pyruvate- 2 -C^(14) gave only non-radioactive carbon monoxide which result indicates that the ester carbonyl group is lost exclusively. The decarbonylation reactions of diphenyl triketone (diphenylpropane- 1, 2, 3 -trione, I) are particularly interesting since they have been reported to be brought about by a wide variety of agents such as bases, acids, cupric acetate, <b>aluminum</b> <b>chlorides</b> and sunlight. In the present investigation, a study was made of some of these reactions using C^(14) -labeled diphenyl triketones in order to determine whether the center or side carbonyl groups are lost in the decarbonylation process...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion of {{aluminum}} in aerated Arabian Gulf seawater (AGS) and 3. 5 % NaCl solutions and its inhibition by 3 -amino- 5 -mercapto- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (AMTA) have been reported. The study {{was carried out}} using cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP), current-time at constant potential (CT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Experimental {{results indicated that the}} presence of AMTA molecules inhibit the general and pitting corrosion of Al in both AGS and NaCl solutions by shifting the corrosion and pitting potentials of Al to the more noble values, decreasing the corrosion and passivation currents and corrosion rate, while increasing the surface and charge transfer resistances. This effect was remarkably increased by increasing the AMTA concentration to 5 x 10 ─ 3 M. Although, AGS showed more aggressiveness towards Al than 3. 5 % NaCl, the inhibition efficiency of AMTA is higher for Al in AGS solution. The inhibition of Al corrosion by AMTA molecules is achieved by their adsorption then formation of a complex with the aluminum oxide preventing the formation of <b>aluminum</b> <b>chlorides,</b> AlCl 3, or chloride complexes, AlCl 4 or even soluble oxychloride complexes, Al(OH) 2 Cl 2, which lead to Al corrosion...|$|R

He researched the chemistry of hydrocarbons and polymers. In studying the chemical reactions between alkenes and dienes, particularly in the presence of an aluminium chloride catalyst, he developed the proton theory of aluminium chloride, which helped explain a variety of chemical reactions, including cracking, polymerization and dehydrogenation.

40|$|Particulate {{samples of}} {{aluminum}} oxide {{were collected on}} Teflon filters from the exhaust plume of the Space Shuttle (STS- 61 A, October 30, 1985) over the altitude interval 4. 6 - 7. 6 km immediately after launch. These particles were analyzed using SEM, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy, and conventional wet-chemical techniques. The samples were 0. 6 - 1. 0 percent surface-chlorided (<b>chlorided</b> meaning predominantly <b>aluminum</b> <b>chlorides</b> and oxychlorides, possibly including other adsorbed forms of chloride) by weight. This level of chloriding is {{about one-third of the}} amount determined previously from laboratory-prepared alumina and surface site samples of solid-rocket-produced alumina (SRPA) after both had been exposed to moist HCl vapor at temperatures down to ambient. This level is equivalent to previous laboratory results with samples exposed to moist HCl at temperatures above the boiling point of water. It is suggested that the present lower chloriding levels, determined for samples from a 'dry' Shuttle exhaust cloud, underscore the importance of a liquid water/hydrochloric acid phase in governing the extent of surface chloriding of SRPA. The reduced chloriding is not trivial with respect to potential physical/chemical modification of the SRPA particle surfaces and their corresponding interaction with the atmosphere...|$|R

Low coverage oxidation Ge(100) was studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and DFT modeling of bonding and electronic structures. 100 L O₂ exposure was found to pin the Fermi level near the valence band due to a strong coverage effect, with theoretical findings consistent with experimental observations. The passivation of Ge(100) surface using molecular silicon monoxide (SiO) was studied using STM, STS, and DFT modeling of bonding and electronic structures.
