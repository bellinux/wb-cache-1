The Ninth Circuit sided with the District Court, who held that the infringing activity was a draw to potential users and that, since Napster's future business model was predicated on expanding the number of users, Napster stood to benefit financially from the infringing activity. As for supervision, the Circuit court <b>agreed</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> the District Court's finding that Napster had [...] "the right and ability to supervise its users' conduct."

Because of Napster's failure to police within its means combined with the financial interest factor, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's finding of vicarious infringement.|$|R
40|$|Flow induces {{anisotropy}} in polymeric liquid crystals. This can {{be demonstrated}} by comparing the stress transients during a sudden increase in shear rate with those during flow reversal: the damped oscillations of the shear stress resulting from these two experiments are shifted by nearly 180 -degrees. Flow-induced anisotropy decays after the flow stops. Its evolution in time is followed by stress growth experiments in the flow direction and in the opposite one, with systematic changes in the rest period. The phase shift only disappears after several thousands of seconds. This time is much longer than the time necessary for the shear stress to relax. Other rheological characteristics, such as the variation of the dynamic moduli after stopping the flow, occur on the same time scale as the anisotropy decay. The anisotropy decay is not affected by temperature and consequently viscosity can be ruled out as a governing factor.

This is especially true during the transition period, where dramatic physiological changes foster vulnerability to immunosuppression, negative energy balance, and clinical and subclinical disorders. Using an Agilent microarray platform, this study examined changes in the transcriptome of bovine polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) due to prepartal dietary intake. Holstein cows were fed a high-straw, control-energy diet (CON; NE L [*]=[*] 1. 34 [*]Mcal/kg) or overfed a moderate-energy diet (OVE; NE L [*]=[*] 1. 62 [*]Mcal/kg) during the dry period.

40|$|AbstractThe species {{recognition}} and identification of aspergilli and their teleomorphs is discussed. A historical {{overview of the}} taxonomic concepts starting with the monograph of Raper & Fennell (1965) is given. A list of taxa described since 2000 is provided. Physiological characters, particularly growth rates {{and the production of}} extrolites, often show differences that reflect phylogenetic species boundaries and greater emphasis should be placed on extrolite profiles and growth characteristics in species descriptions. Multilocus sequence-based phylogenetic analyses have emerged as the primary tool for inferring phylogenetic species boundaries and relationships within subgenera and sections. A four locus DNA sequence study covering all major lineages in Aspergillus using genealogical concordance theory resulted in a species recognition system that <b>agrees</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> phenotypic studies and reveals the presence of many undescribed species not resolved by phenotype. The use of as much data from as many sources as possible in making taxonomic decisions is advocated. For species identification, DNA barcoding uses a short genetic marker in an organism”s DNA to quickly and easily identify it to a particular species. Partial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 sequences, which are used for barcoding animal species, were found to have limited value for species identification among black aspergilli. The various possibilities are discussed and at present partial β-tubulin or calmodulin are the most promising loci for Aspergillus identification. For characterising Aspergillus species one application would be to produce a multilocus phylogeny, with the goal of having a firm understanding of the evolutionary relationships among species across the entire genus.

Although collision is distinguished by contractional deformation, a major extensional fault zone, the Southern Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) trends parallel to the primary contractional fault, the Main Central Thrust (MCT). The channel flow hypothesis (CFH), {{characterized by}} a 30 km thick, southward flowing channel of ductile mid-crustal rocks bounded above by the STDS and below by the MCT, was developed to explain simultaneous motion on these faults. One prediction of the CFH {{is the development of}} gneiss domes, such as Gianbul Dome, that expose mid-crustal rocks within the mountain front. To test the application of the CFH in NW, India this study documents metamorphism, kinematic shear sense, deformation temperatures, and cooling ages across Gianbul Dome.

Metamorphism reached temperatures and pressures up to 750 °C and 8 kbar (Robyr et al, 2002). Kinematic shear sense indicators reveal top-down NE in the northeast side of the dome and top-down SW in the southwest. High grade metamorphic minerals grow synchronously with the deformation fabrics, indicating deformation at peak metamorphism. Deformation temperatures decrease from ~ 700 °C across the center of Gianbul Dome to 400 °C on the flanks.

40|$|Since as {{far back}} as the middle ages, {{philosophers}} have been concerned with the inner representations of the mind. St Thomas Aquinas suggested that when he thinks of an object, the object of his thought has a different sort of existence in his mind. 1 Indeed, there certainly seems to be a difference between physical phenomena and mental phenomena but merely seeming like there is a difference is not enough to show that there is a difference. In this paper I will compare two different approaches to the supposed distinction between the mental and the physical. First I will outline Brentano's theory of `Intentionality', which, in its early formulation, proposes a true distinction between physical objects and the objects of thought. I will then introduce Daniel Dennett's `Intentional Systems Theory'. Dennett's theory is an attempt to naturalise the mind and to reduce mental phenomena such as beliefs and desires to simple physical systems. 1. Brentano's Intentional Inexistence During the nineteenth century there was a division between the realist and idealist ways of thinking. The realist's believed that a real world exists and is independent of our thoughts while the idealist's held that the only objects to which we could have access are our own ideas and thoughts. We construct a representation of the world through presentations. Brentano <b>agreed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>with</b> the idealist notion of presentations and accepted that they are central to mental activity. From this starting point he developed his theories of intentional objects and the object directedness of mental acts. Brentano makes a distinction between the mental and the physical which is based on the idea that mental states involve presentation. For Brentano, the presentation involved in mental states is directed towards an object, and furthermore, every mental act is directed towards such an object. Brentano also states that this object directedness is exclusive to the mind and that nothing else that exists can display this sort of object directedness. The objects of mental states are called intentional object...|$|R

In particular, a cluster of vertebrate-like homeobox genes regulates {{the development of the}} lancelet Branchiostoma lanceolatum. A previous study has outlined the expression pattern of the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit- 1 in adult lancelets. Pit- 1 belongs to the POU family of transcription factors, which, like homeotic proteins, are members of the helix-turn-helix superfamily of proteins. POU is an acronym for Pit- 1, Oct- 1 and Oct- 2, and Unc- 86. In the present work, we investigated the head region of premetamorphic larvae of B. lanceolatum, by means of scanning electron microscopy, wholemount and tissue sections immunocytochemistry, and Western blotting assay, to verify the presence and distribution of Pit- 1. Immunoreactive Pit- 1 protein was detected in the rostral nerves and in a cluster of photoreceptor cells of the frontal eye. At the same time, an electrophoretic band of 33 kDa was shown from extracts of premetamorphic larvae and recognized by a monoclonal antibody to rat Pit- 1.

40|$|From {{the results}} of the various {{experiments}} already detailed I feel justified in drawing the following conclusions: (1) Absolutely fresh thyroid gland is not poisonous, in the usual sense of the term, when absorbed through the alimentary canal. (2) The symptoms of induced thyroidism are manifestations of an intoxication resulting from the ingestion of decomposed thyroid material, a conclusion that <b>agrees</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>with</b> the previously related observations of Lanz. (3) The so-called experimental thyroidism is not specific for the thyroid only, for the ingestion of many substances derived from animal tissues other than the thyroid gland may produce an intoxication strikingly similar in every respect to that of experimental thyroidism. (4) Most, if not all, animal tissues yield substances which, if injected in large quantities directly into the circulation or beneath the skin, will produce an intoxication often very similar to that produced by injections of various substances derived from the fresh thyroid tissue. (5) The effects resulting from the intravascular or subcutaneous injections of aqueous extracts, decoctions and the concentrated extractives of the thyroid tissue, of the thymus, of muscle, etc., are by no means necessarily indicative of the function and the action of the hypothetical internal secretions of the same tissues during life. (6) The utilization of the fact that ingestion of decomposed thyroid material produces on certain occasions an intoxication with certain symptoms similar to some of those of G-raves' disease is not justifiable for the furtherance of the theory that the symptoms of exophthalmic goitre result from an over-production of the thyroid secretion. (7) Our results lead us to conclude with Drechsel that the fresh thyroid tissue yields at least probably two substances that are capable of palliating the symptoms of the acute cachexia in totally thyroidless dogs. (8) The thymus tissue also yields one and probably two substances that are as equally capable as the thyroid extractives of palliating the acute cachexia in totally thyroidless dogs. (9) Neither of the above substances is an enzyme, nor does either contain iodine. (10) Neither the feeding of minced raw thyroid glands, nor the injection of aqueous thyroid extracts, decoctions, and concentrated solutions of the extracted palliative thyroid principles is capable of keeping totally thyroidless young dogs alive longer than a few weeks (possibly three weeks). Still less capable are the thyroid preparations containing decomposition products. (11) The presence of one, or usually several, small accessory thyroid bodies, which gradually hypertrophy and wholly or partially assume the functions of the excised thyroid lobes, accounts for the occasionally long survival of thyroidectomized, thyroid-fed, young dogs. (12) Totally thyroidless young dogs are so quickly overwhelmed by the cachexia, and the intervals between the thyroidectomy and the onset of the severe dyspnœic attacks and subsequent deaths differ so slightly, no matter which of the usual varieties of fresh food are employed, that kinds of fresh food cannot be unquestionably affirmed to influence the onset of the cachexia in any especially definite manner. Animal foods, in which constituents poisonous to rabbits have developed, probably slightly hasten the onset of the severer symptoms, and the vaunted remarkably modifying influence of a diet of ordinary milk, such as Breisacher observed, does not exist {{in the case of the}} totally thyroidless dog. (13) Monkeys whose general metabolism is disturbed in consequence of the removal of a greater portion of the thyroid gland, evidently become more susceptible to those constituents of meat that are poisonous to rabbits, and sufficient clinical evidence exists for concluding that probably a like susceptibility to animal foods containing such constituents also exists in men when the function of the thyroid gland is sufficiently disturbed. (14) And, finally, as regards the thyroid factor in the pathology of exophthalmic goitre, I agree with Gley that the majority of the symptoms in many patients with that disease can apparently, from an experimental standpoint, be as plausibly explained by the hypothesis of partially deficient thyroid activity as by the hypothesis of augmentation of thyroid function...|$|R

With exception of the Al- 33. 7 wt. % Ge alloy, accelerating dendrite tip velocities with increasing melt undercooling were observed until impingement with the sample border or with a neighboring dendrite occurred. More precisely, 8, 21, and 12 tips of the respective alloys showed a certain tip velocity at a certain melt undercooling. Acceleration velocities up to 130 µm/s and with one exception of 270 µm/s were measured. This {{can be explained by}} means of dendrite growth theory that describes how a dendrite tip propagates in an undercooled melt. Comparison between the experimentally measured tip growth rates and the Lipton-Glicksman-Kurz (LGK) growth model showed good agreement for the Al-Cu and the Al-Ge alloys. With scaling parameters σ* of 0. 04 and 0. 025, respectively, the modeled velocity curves <b>agree</b> <b>in</b> large <b>parts</b> <b>with</b> the experimental measurements. Growth of multiple dendrites in the melt - as it normally occurs in castings - inevitably leads to their mutual influence. Interaction is governed by the overlap of thermal and solutal fields as heat and solute is rejected from the growing grains. This influence is noticeable in the experiments by the deceleration of tip growth velocities when dendrites impinge on each other. Investigating this interaction and connecting the decelerating growth velocities with a theoretical prediction required the measurement of the solutal increase in the liquid. The use of a polychromatic beam made a calibration procedure necessary. The concentration measurements showed an increase of germanium in the bulk liquid by ~ 1. 5 wt. % within 2 °C and accordingly 120 seconds of cooling. The solute determination in the in-situ radiography images allowed for comparison of measured growth velocities with those predicted by the McFadden-Browne (MFB) model. The MFB model takes solute built up in the extra-dendritic liquid into account but otherwise equals the isothermal LGK model. In the model, the actual growth condition at the tip is defined by a concentration C_f measured at a finite distance δ ahead of the tip. Comparison between the predicted and the experimentally measured tip growth velocities yielded good agreement arguing for the general applicability of the MFB model that was rigorously tested for the first time...|$|R
