5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an <b>anthelmintic</b> for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Siddiqui was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to bring the <b>anthelmintic,</b> antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral constituents of the Neem tree {{to the attention of}} natural products chemists. In 1942, he extracted three bitter compounds from neem oil, which he named as nimbin, nimbinin, and nimbidin respectively. The process involved extracting the water-insoluble components with ether, petrol ether, ethyl acetate and dilute alcohol. The provisional naming was nimbin (sulphur-free crystalline product with melting point at 205°C, empirical composition C7H10O2), nimbinin (with similar principle, melting at 192°C), and nimbidin (cream-coloured containing amorphous sulphur, melting at 90–100°C). Siddiqui identified nimbidin as the main active antibacterial ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil. These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem. They also serve as natural insecticides.|$|E
25|$|Echinostomiasis can {{be treated}} with the <b>anthelmintic</b> drug praziquantel, as for other {{intestinal}} trematode infections. Side effects of <b>anthelmintic</b> drug treatment may include nausea, abdominal pain, headaches or dizziness.|$|E
25|$|Taurine {{is used in}} the {{preparation}} of the <b>anthelmintic</b> drug netobimin (Totabin).|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{also played}} a major role in the {{introduction}} of thiabendazole (a member of the benzimidazole family) as an <b>anthelmintic</b> for sheep in the early 1960s. In September 1961 in the journal Nature, he reported on his laboratory and field trials that demonstrated this compound exhibited a very high degree of <b>anthelmintic</b> activity against most of the major internal parasites of sheep.|$|E

25|$|In {{developing}} countries, moringa has {{the potential}} to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development, and support sustainable landcare. It may be used as forage for livestock, a micronutrient liquid, a natural <b>anthelmintic,</b> and possible adjuvant.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} of helminthiasis, such as intestinal obstruction occur, emergency surgery may be required. Patients who require non-emergency surgery, for instance for removal of worms from the biliary tree, can be pre-treated with the <b>anthelmintic</b> drug albendazole.|$|E
25|$|Due to the electron-withdrawing {{effect of}} the ring {{nitrogen}} atom, 2-vinylpyridine adds nucleophiles such as methoxide, cyanide, hydrogen sulfide at the vinylic site to give addition products. The addition product of methanol to 2-vinylpyridine, 2-(2-methoxyethyl)pyridine is a veterinary <b>anthelmintic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects may}} include poor coordination, {{abdominal}} pain, vomiting, headache, and allergic reactions. While {{it may be}} used during pregnancy, it is not recommended for use during breastfeeding. Praziquantel is in the <b>anthelmintic</b> class of medications. It works partly by affecting {{the function of the}} worm's sucker.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} {{issues related to}} the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30–36 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current <b>anthelmintic</b> as no new <b>anthelmintic</b> drugs are in the late-stage development.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend <b>anthelmintic</b> treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as <b>anthelmintic</b> treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E
25|$|Gordon had a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} career in veterinary research, becoming a world-renowned expert {{in the field of}} veterinary parasitology. Amongst his most important contributions in that field was the discovery that phenothiazine was a safe and effective <b>anthelmintic</b> in sheep and cattle. This discovery, along with the recognition that this compound could be manufactured locally, saved Australian sheep farmers millions of dollars.|$|E
25|$|An Echinostoma {{infection}} can {{be diagnosed}} by observing the parasite {{eggs in the}} faeces of an infected individual, under a microscope. Methods such as the Kato-Katz procedure {{can be used to}} do this. The eggs typically have a yellow-brown appearance, and are ellipsoid in shape. To confirm which species is causing the infection adult worms must be recovered from the infected individual, such as with <b>anthelmintic</b> treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{forests of}} the Bale Mountains are {{important}} for genetic stocks of wild forest coffee (Coffea arabica) and for medicinal plants in Ethiopia. Three medicinal plant hotspots have been identified: two in the Gaysay area {{and one in the}} Angesu area, spanning the park boundary. The female flowers of hagenia contain <b>anthelmintic,</b> which is used to treat tapeworms among the local populations. St. John’s wort is used to combat depression. A 2006 study estimated the value of the medicinal plants industry to be approximately two billion Ethiopian birr annually, some 8% of Ethiopia’s Federal budget at the time.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his epidemiological research, Gordon also researched and published extensively {{on the use of}} various anthelmintics in sheep. He was responsible for the discovery in the late 1930s of phenothiazine, a safe and effective <b>anthelmintic.</b> His research showed that this compound could effectively control intestinal parasites in sheep and cattle. This discovery, and local production of the required chemicals, resulted in a massive cut in the economic losses suffered by farmers due to intestinal parasitism. Phenothiazine was the mainstay of internal parasite control in sheep in Australia until the 1960s, when broad-spectrum anthelmintics became available.|$|E
25|$|A {{thorough}} {{history is}} always taken, including signalment (age, sex, breed), recent activity, diet and recent dietary changes, <b>anthelmintic</b> history, if {{the horse is}} a cribber, fecal quality {{and when it was}} last passed, and any history of colic. The most important factor is time elapsed since onset of clinical signs, as this has a profound impact on prognosis. Additionally, a veterinarian will need to know any drugs given to the horse, their amount, and the time they were given, as those can help with the assessment of the colic progression and how it is responding to analgesia.|$|E
25|$|This lack of {{deworming}} {{of pregnant}} women is {{explained by the fact}} that most individuals still fear that <b>anthelmintic</b> treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group {{of pregnant women}} treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic <b>anthelmintic</b> treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{internal}} parasites {{cannot be}} completely eliminated. [...] Therefore, most modern horse owners commonly give <b>anthelmintic</b> drugs (wormers) to their horses to manage parasite populations.|$|E
2500|$|Praziquantel is not {{licensed}} for use {{in humans}} in the UK {{but it can be}} imported when necessary on a named patient basis. [...] It is available in the UK as a veterinary <b>anthelmintic.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In addition, among Ötzi's {{possessions}} were berries, two birch bark baskets, and {{two species}} of polypore mushrooms with leather strings through them. [...] One of these, the birch fungus, {{is known to have}} <b>anthelmintic</b> properties, and was probably used for medicinal purposes. [...] The other was a type of tinder fungus, included with part of {{what appeared to be a}} complex firelighting kit. The kit featured pieces of over a dozen different plants, in addition to flint and pyrite for creating sparks.|$|E
2500|$|Worms {{may also}} be called helminths, {{particularly}} in medical terminology when referring to parasitic worms, especially the Nematoda (roundworms) and Cestoda (tapeworms). Hence [...] "helminthology" [...] {{is the study of}} parasitic worms. When a human or an animal, such as a dog or horse, is said to [...] "have worms", it means that it is infested with parasitic worms, typically roundworms or tapeworms. Deworming is a method to kill off the worms that have infected a human or animal by giving <b>anthelmintic</b> drugs.|$|E
2500|$|Ficus maxima {{is used by}} the Lacandon Maya {{to treat}} snakebite. Leaves are {{moistened}} by chewing and applied to the bite. In the provinces of Loja and Zamora-Chinchipe in Ecuador, a leaf infusion is used to treat internal inflammations. [...] The Paya of Honduras use the species for firewood, and to treat gingivitis. [...] The Tacana of Bolivia use the latex to treat intestinal parasites, as do people in Guatemala's Petén Department. [...] In Brazil it is used as an <b>anthelmintic,</b> antirheumatic, anti-anaemic and antipyretic. [...] The latex is also used to bind limestone soils to produce cal, an adobe cement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{psychedelic}} {{effects of}} ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, {{the mixing of}} sensory modalities, and psychological introspection {{that may lead to}} great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as la purga or [...] "the purge"). The intense vomiting and occasional diarrhea it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical parasites, and harmala alkaloids themselves {{have been shown to be}} <b>anthelmintic.</b> [...] Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility that is caused by these alkaloids.|$|E
2500|$|Pumpkins {{have been}} used as folk {{medicine}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments, and this Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an <b>anthelmintic</b> for the expulsion of worms. In Germany and southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were also used as folk remedies to treat irritable bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. [...] In China, C. moschata seeds were also used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of the parasitic disease schistosomiasis and for the expulsion of tape worms. Chinese studies have found that a combination of pumpkin seed and areca nut extracts was effective in the expulsion of Taenia spp. tapeworms in over 89% of cases.|$|E
2500|$|Among Wufuxu {{prescriptions}} for eliminating the Three Worms/Corpses, the primary <b>anthelmintic</b> herbs (Eskildsen 1998: 60, Arthur 2013: 87) are: shānglù 商陸 [...] "Phytolacca rivinoides, pokeweed" [...] root, tiānméndōng 天門冬 [...] "Asparagus cochinchinensis, asparagus" [...] root, huángjīng 黄精 [...] "Polygonatum sibiricum, Solomon's seal", and fúlíng 茯苓 [...] "Wolfiporia extensa, China-root fungus" [...] (often misidentified as [...] "Smilax glabra, sarsaparilla"). Pokeweed—which the Wufuxu says is effective {{alone or in}} combination with other medicinal herbs—is poisonous for humans, with the highest toxicity in the roots, yet it has been used in folk medicine as a purgative, emetic, diuretic, and hunger suppressant. Pokeweed root, asparagus root, and Solomon's seal all contain chemical compounds called saponins, which are poisons that irritate the gastric mucosa and thus can dislodge any intestinal parasites (Arthur 2013: 87).|$|E
2500|$|Common {{groundsel}} as a {{medicinal herb}} {{does not seem}} to be recommended very often since 1931, when it was recommended as a diaphoretic, an antiscorbutic, a purgative, a diuretic and an <b>anthelmintic,</b> which was a demotion as it was previously suggested for the expelling of gravel of the kidneys and reins by Pedanius Dioscorides in the 70s-90s, for use as poultices by John Gerard in the late 16th century and as a cure for epilepsy by Nicholas Culpeper in the 17th century. More current information is contradictory about the dangers of the ingestion of Groundsel. A heavily referenced paper from 1989 suggests that the response is immediate and gives pre-ambulatory care recommendations. A Canadian poisonous plants information database references a paper from 1990 in presenting this prenatal warning: [...] "In a case of prenatal exposure, a mother ingested tea containing an estimated 0.343milligram of senecionine, resulting in fatal veno-occlusive disease in a newborn infant." [...] Information about the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, the substance present in Senecio vulgaris is much less contradictory and all warn of accumulation of the alkaloid.|$|E
2500|$|While most Wufuxu {{methods for}} {{expelling}} the Three Worms involve <b>anthelmintic</b> herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe {{attributed to the}} Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "Pluck peach leaves {{on the third day}} of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." [...] One anomalous Wufuxu method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. [...] "The Recipe of Master Redpine" [...] (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "When you cut the nails of your hands and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines." [...] Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that [...] cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.|$|E
50|$|Given the {{importance}} of effective parasite control, there is heightened concern over reduced <b>anthelmintic</b> efficacy. There is {{a broad range of}} current literature reporting developing resistance of O. ostertagi to all major classes of <b>anthelmintic</b> worldwide including the United States, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, and the UK. As recently as January 2016, O. ostertagi <b>anthelmintic</b> resistance was reported to all three major drug classes on 20 dairy farms in Southern Australia The two most widely accepted <b>anthelmintic</b> resistance diagnosis methods for O. ostertagi are in vivo methods: the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and the controlled efficacy test (CET). The World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) has provided guidelines on the detection of <b>anthelmintic</b> resistance.|$|E
50|$|Echinostomiasis can {{be treated}} with the <b>anthelmintic</b> drug praziquantel, as for other {{intestinal}} trematode infections. Side effects of <b>anthelmintic</b> drug treatment may include nausea, abdominal pain, headaches or dizziness.|$|E
50|$|It gets metabolized in {{the liver}} to {{oxfendazole}}, which is <b>anthelmintic</b> too; oxfendazole partially gets reduced back to fenbendazole {{in the liver}} and rumen. Also, fenbendazole itself is an active metabolite of another <b>anthelmintic</b> drug, febantel.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that coprophagous insects suffer a suite of lethal and {{sublethal}} effects in response to veterinary <b>anthelmintic</b> residues. Adult beetles show negligible sensitivity to the <b>anthelmintic</b> ivermectin, but in contrast larvae are highly sensitive.|$|E
50|$|The root was used, until recent times, as an <b>anthelmintic</b> {{to expel}} tapeworms, {{but has been}} {{replaced}} by less toxic and more effective drugs. The <b>anthelmintic</b> activity has been claimed to be due to flavaspidic acid, a phloroglucinol derivative.|$|E
