40|$|The {{main task}} in {{synchronizing}} arrival traffic {{is to create}} smooth trajectories for an efficient use of the runways. Current decision support tools for such a task typically consist of sequencing and metering, that {{is to establish a}} reasonable sequence of aircraft arriving from different routes and to calculate for each aircraft the required en-route delay that is necessary to respect the safety separations. The major limitations of such tools are trajectory prediction uncertainties, limitations of en-route capacity and the generation of precise navigation maneuvers. These limitations decrease the confidence of decision makers in the tools. In the future, traffic management coordinators want more options to solve their problems and not yet another tool that they do not trust. In this context, we propose three ideas that increase the insight in the task of managing <b>arrival</b> <b>flows.</b> These are the impact of prediction uncertainties on the stability of traffic sequences, strategies to distribute en-route delays under uncertainty and characteristics of efficient <b>arrival</b> <b>flows.</b> The intuition of our approach is to generate understandable strategies to create efficient <b>arrival</b> <b>flows.</b> This includes information on the fuel performance of different merging strategies and on the risk that a decision support tool will generate imprecise advisories.

40|$|When {{weather or}} other {{circumstances}} reduce the landing capacity of an airport {{below the level}} of demand, arriving aircraft experience airborne holding. A ground delay program (GDP) controls the <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> by holding some aircraft at their departure airports for specified periods of time, converting airborne holding into less expensive and less risky ground holding. We developed a spreadsheet model of GDPs to provide an accessible and transparent platform for developing a better understanding of their properties. We used the model to address two questions. First, since GDPs are planned in anticipation of reductions in arrival capacity, when should uncertainty about those conditions affect the ground delays assigned to individual flights? Second, when is it advantageous to cancel flights rather than delay them, and which flights should be cancelled? Sometimes the capacity of an airport to accept arriving aircraft is reduced by weather or other circumstances {{below the level of}} demand.

40|$|Terminal area Air Traffic Management handles both {{arriving}} and departing traffic. To date, {{research work}} on terminal area operations has {{focused primarily on}} the <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> and typically departures {{are taken into account}} only in an approximate (average) manner. However, arrivals and departures are highly coupled processes especially in the terminal airspace, with complex interactions and sharing of the same airport resources between arrivals and departures taking place in practically every important terminal area. Therefore, the addition of automation aids for departures, possibly in co-operation with existing <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> automation systems, could have a profound contribution in enhancing the overall efficiency of airport operations. This paper presents the conceptual system architecture for such an automation aid, the Departure Planner (DP).

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the earliest <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> problem, defined on dynamic networks with several sources {{and a single}} sink. A dynamic network is a directed graph with capacities and transit times on its edges. Given an integral supply specified at each source of a dynamic network, the problem is to send exactly {{the right amount of}} flow out of each source and into the sink, such that the amount of flow arriving at the sink by time θ is the maximum possible for all θ ≥ 0. One obvious approach is to solve the easier static flow problem in a time-expanded network that contains one copy of the same network for each discrete time step. However, this approach is not practical in general due to the exponential size of time-expanded networks. In [3], Fleischer and Skutella describe a fully polynomial approximation scheme to solve this problem, while a special case when all transit times are zero, has been considered by Fleischer [2]. This thesis presents the first exact algorithm that avoids a time-expanded network, and solves a more general class of the earliest <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> problem in dynamic networks with multiple sources. The class is characterized by the property that the total supply at the sources is equal to the value of the maximum dynamic flow in time bound T, where T is the minimum time needed to evacuate all supplies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} the following problem of spatial downlink prioritization. Mobiles arrive at a cell at locations that are determined according to some probability distribution. The further a mobile is from the base station, the weaker is its received power and thus the lower is the transmission rate to it. Beside this uncontrollable phenomenon that differentiates between mobiles according to their location, one can design other controlled mechanisms that differentiate between them. We analyse various priority policies where the assigned priority is given {{in terms of the}} distance of the mobiles from the base station. This gives rise to a whole continuum of priority levels. We study the influence that the combined location density and priority policy have on the quality of service of the mobiles and on the network overall performance. Applying our model to a HSDPA system, we calculate a quality of service indicator, the sojourn time, using a priority scheduling strategy, a processor sharing one and a first come first served one. Considering three types of <b>arrival</b> <b>flow,</b> a uniform one, a non uniform one and a flow which generates a constant load in the cell, we show the sojourn time depends on the adopted strategy, but also on the location of the mobile and on the <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> type. In particular, a numerical study based on our model shows that a maximum SIR priority does not provide in any case the minimum sojourn time...|$|E

40|$|For the {{earliest}} <b>arrival</b> <b>flow</b> problem one {{is given a}} network G = (V, A) with capacities u(a) and transit times τ(a) on its arcs a ∈ A, together with a source and a sink vertex s, t ∈ V. The objective is to send flow from s to t that moves through the network over time, such that for each point in time θ ∈ [0, T) the maximum possible amount of flow reaches t. If, for each θ ∈ [0, T) this flow is a maximum flow for time horizon θ, then it is called earliest <b>arrival</b> <b>flow.</b> In practical applications a higher congestion of an arc in the network often implies a considerable increase in transit time. Therefore, {{in this paper we}} study {{the earliest}} arrival problem for the case that the transit time of each arc in the network at each time θ depends on the flow on this particular arc at that time θ. For constant transit times it has been shown by Gale that earliest arrival flows exist for any network. We give examples, showing that this is no longer true for flow-dependent transit times. For that reason we define an optimization version of this problem where the objective is to find flows that are almost earliest arrival flows. In particular, we are interested in flows that, for each θ ∈ [0, T), need only α-times longer to send the maximum flow to the sink. We give both constant lower and upper bounds on α; furthermore, we present a constant factor approximation algorithm for this problem. Finally, we give some computational results to show the practicability of the designed approximation algorithm...|$|E
