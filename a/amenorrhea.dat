5|$|The lactational <b>amenorrhea</b> method {{involves}} the use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational <b>amenorrhea</b> method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or <b>amenorrhea</b> (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of osteoporosis (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|Very little flow (less than 10 ml) {{is called}} hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with {{intervals}} of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation {{is known as}} metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia. Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. <b>Amenorrhea</b> refers to more than {{three to six months}} without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.|$|E
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational <b>amenorrhea.</b> On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{are those that}} are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits. Surgical sterilization, implantable hormones, and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%. Hormonal contraceptive pills, patches or vaginal rings, and the lactational <b>amenorrhea</b> method (LAM), if used strictly, can also have first-year (or for LAM, first-6-month) failure rates of less than 1%. With typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high, at 9%, due to incorrect usage. Other methods such as condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and <b>amenorrhea</b> there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of hypopituitarism was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered <b>amenorrhea,</b> weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired hypopituitarism, especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of hypopituitarism were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common hypopituitarism could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} include galactorrhea, <b>amenorrhea,</b> gynecomastia, impotence.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} {{been found to be}} a rare cause of <b>amenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Amenorrhea,</b> {{a symptom}} that occurs after {{prolonged}} weight loss; causes menses to stop, hair becomes brittle, and skin becomes yellow and unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadal {{states can}} cause {{secondary}} osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic <b>amenorrhea</b> or hyperprolactinemia. In females, {{the effect of}} hypogonadism is mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as early menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged premenopausal <b>amenorrhea</b> (>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is the cause (for example, andropause or after surgical removal of the testes).|$|E
25|$|Norplant and Depo-provera {{are also}} effective, since these methods often induce <b>amenorrhea.</b> The intrauterine system (Mirena IUD) {{may be useful}} in {{reducing}} symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is a cause}} of primary <b>amenorrhea,</b> premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), streak gonads and infertility. Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical.|$|E
25|$|When {{menarche}} {{has failed}} to occur for more than 3 years after thelarche, or beyond 16 years of age, the delay {{is referred to as}} primary <b>amenorrhea.</b>|$|E
25|$|Female-specific: masculinization, {{irreversible}} voice deepening, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth), menstrual disturbances (e.g., anovulation, oligomenorrhea, <b>amenorrhea,</b> dysmenorrhea), clitoral enlargement, breast atrophy, uterine atrophy, teratogenicity (in female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Menstrual disorders: PCOS mostly {{produces}} oligomenorrhea (fewer {{than nine}} menstrual periods in a year) or <b>amenorrhea</b> (no menstrual periods {{for three or}} more consecutive months), but other types of menstrual disorders may also occur.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen is {{also used}} in the therapy of vaginal atrophy, hypoestrogenism (as a result of hypogonadism, oophorectomy, or primary ovarian failure), <b>amenorrhea,</b> dysmenorrhea, and oligomenorrhea. Estrogens {{can also be used}} to {{suppress}} lactation after child birth.|$|E
25|$|Species: Paeonia lactiflora or Paeonia veitchii. Pinyin: Chi Shao. Common Name: Red Peony Root. Quality: Sour, Bitter, Cool. Meridians: Liver, Spleen. Actions: Clears heat, cools blood, invigorates {{blood and}} dispel stasis to treat {{irregular}} menses, dysmenorrhoea, <b>amenorrhea,</b> abdominal pain, and fixed abdominal masses.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>amenorrhea</b> {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease, but is instead a symptom. Dydrogesterone {{has been found to}} adequately induce bleeding within a sufficiently estrogen-primed endometrium. When estradiol levels are found to be low, dydrogesterone treatment is more effective when supplemented with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Benefits for {{the mother}} include less blood loss {{following}} delivery, better uterus shrinkage, and less postpartum depression. Breastfeeding delays the return of menstruation and fertility, a phenomenon known as lactational <b>amenorrhea.</b> Long term benefits {{for the mother}} include decreased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Breastfeeding is less expensive than infant formula.|$|E
25|$|Other {{names for}} this {{syndrome}} include polycystic ovary disease, functional ovarian hyperandrogenism, ovarian hyperthecosis, sclerocystic ovary syndrome, and Stein–Leventhal syndrome. The eponymous last option {{is the original}} name; it is now used, if at all, only for the subset of women with all the symptoms of <b>amenorrhea</b> with infertility, hirsutism, and enlarged polycystic ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Adult granulosa cell {{tumors are}} {{characterized}} by later onset (30+ years, 50 on average). These tumors produce high levels of estrogen, which causes its characteristic symptoms: menometrorrhagia; endometrial hyperplasia; tender, enlarged breasts; postmenopausal bleeding; and secondary <b>amenorrhea.</b> The mass of the tumor can cause other symptoms, including abdominal pain and distension, or symptoms similar to an ectopic pregnancy if the tumor bleeds and ruptures.|$|E
25|$|As growth ends, {{management}} in girls with CAH changes focus to optimizing reproductive function. Both excessive testosterone from the adrenals and excessive glucocorticoid treatment can disrupt ovulation, resulting in irregularity of menses or <b>amenorrhea,</b> {{as well as}} infertility. Continued monitoring of hormone balance and careful readjustment of glucocorticoid dose can usually restore fertility, but as a group, women with CAH have a lower fertility rate than a comparable population.|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{fertility}} awareness may {{be referred to}} as fertility awareness–based methods (FAB methods); the term Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) refers specifically to the system taught by Toni Weschler. The term natural family planning (NFP) is sometimes used to refer to any use of FA methods, the Lactational <b>amenorrhea</b> method and periodic abstinence during fertile times. A method of FA may be used by NFP users to identify these fertile times.|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone {{when used}} therapeutically {{is closely related}} to its {{physiological}} action on the neuroendocrine control of ovarian function, {{as well as on the}} endometrium. This is an indication in all cases of endogeneous progesterone deficiency – relative or absolute. The molecule was licensed for use in several indications, including threatened or recurrent miscarriage, dysfunctional bleeding, infertility due to luteal insufficiency, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, secondary <b>amenorrhea,</b> irregular cycles, pre-menstrual syndrome and also as a hormone replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|Endurance training: In female {{endurance}} athletes, {{large volumes}} of training can lead to decreased bone density and {{an increased risk of}} osteoporosis. This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation, producing <b>amenorrhea,</b> and {{it is part of the}} female athlete triad. However, for male athletes, the situation is less clear, and although some studies have reported low bone density in elite male endurance athletes, others have instead seen increased leg bone density.|$|E
25|$|Exclusive {{breastfeeding}} usually delays {{the return}} of fertility through lactational <b>amenorrhea,</b> although it does not provide reliable birth control. Breastfeeding may delay the return to fertility for some women by suppressing ovulation. Mothers may not ovulate, or have regular periods, during the entire lactation period. The non-ovulating period varies by individual. This {{has been used as}} natural contraception, with greater than 98% effectiveness during the first six months after birth if specific nursing behaviors are followed.|$|E
25|$|In women, serum {{estradiol}} {{is measured}} in a clinical laboratory and reflects primarily {{the activity of the}} ovaries. As such, they are useful in the detection of baseline estrogen in women with <b>amenorrhea</b> or menstrual dysfunction, and to detect the state of hypoestrogenicity and menopause. Furthermore, estrogen monitoring during fertility therapy assesses follicular growth and is useful in monitoring the treatment. Estrogen-producing tumors will demonstrate persistent high levels of estradiol and other estrogens. In precocious puberty, estradiol levels are inappropriately increased.|$|E
25|$|Hypersecretion is {{more common}} than hyposecretion. Hyperprolactinemia is the most {{frequent}} abnormality of the anterior pituitary tumors, termed prolactinomas. Prolactinomas may disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis as prolactin tends to suppress the secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus and in turn decreases the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, therefore disrupting the ovulatory cycle. Such hormonal changes may manifest as <b>amenorrhea</b> and infertility in females as well as impotence in males. Inappropriate lactation (galactorrhoea) is another important clinical sign of prolactinomas.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans used {{black cohosh}} to treat {{gynecological}} and other disorders, including sore throat, kidney problems, and depression. Following {{the arrival of}} European settlers in the U.S. who continued the medicinal usage of black cohosh, the plant appeared in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1830 under the name “black snakeroot”. In 1844 A. racemosa gained popularity when John King, an eclectic physician, used it to treat rheumatism and nervous disorders. Other eclectic physicians of the mid-nineteenth century used black cohosh {{for a variety of}} maladies, including endometritis, <b>amenorrhea,</b> dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, sterility, severe after-birth pains, and for increased breast milk production.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} anemia; {{intravenous}} iron {{has been found}} to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions. Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more. Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more. Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers— a regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles. Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause <b>amenorrhea,</b> infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage. Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational <b>amenorrhea.</b> On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} {{can present}} anywhere within the spectrum from asymptomatic to acute or chronic hepatitis to fulminant liver failure. Patients are asymptomatic 25–34% of the time, and {{the diagnosis is}} suspected {{on the basis of}} abnormal liver function tests. Up to 40% of cases present with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. As with other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune hepatitis usually affects young women (though it can affect patients of either sex of any age), and patients can exhibit classic signs and symptoms of autoimmunity such as fatigue, anemia, anorexia, <b>amenorrhea,</b> acne, arthritis, pleurisy, thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis, nephritis, and maculopapular rash. Autoimmune hepatitis increases the risk for cirrhosis, and the risk for liver cancer is increased by about 1% for each year of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Hyperthyroidism has unique {{effects in}} {{children}} on growth and pubertal development, e.g. causing epiphyseal maturation. In growing children, accelerated bone growth from hyperthyroidism can increase osteogenesis {{in the short}} term, but generally results in short-stature adults compared with the predicted heights. Pubertal development tends to be delayed, or slowed. Girls who have undergone menarche may develop secondary <b>amenorrhea.</b> Hyperthyroidism is associated with high sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may result in high serum estradiol levels in girls and testosterone levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased. Hyperthyroidism {{before the age of}} four may cause neurodevelopmental delay. A study by Segni et al. suggests that permanent brain damage can occur {{as a result of the}} illness.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop <b>amenorrhea,</b> and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular, anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
500|$|Secondary {{dysfunction}} {{results from}} factors that follow from the injury, such as loss of bladder and bowel control or impaired movement. The main barrier to sexual activity {{that people with}} SCI cite is physical limitation; e.g. balance problems and muscle weakness cause difficulty with positioning. Spasticity, tightening of muscles due to increased muscle tone, is another complication that interferes with sex. Some medications have side effects that impede sexual pleasure or interfere with sexual function: antidepressants, muscle relaxants, sleeping pills and drugs that treat spasticity. Hormonal changes [...] that alter sexual function may take place after SCI; levels of prolactin heighten, women temporarily stop menstruating (<b>amenorrhea),</b> and men experience reduced levels of testosterone. Testosterone deficiency causes reduced libido, increased weakness, fatigue, and failure to respond to erection-enhancing drugs.|$|E
