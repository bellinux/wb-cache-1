60|$|Washington, March 29, 1864. DEAREST MOTHER--I {{have written}} to George again to Knoxville. Things {{seem to be}} quiet down there so far. We think here that our forces {{are going to be}} made strongest here in Virginia this spring, and every thing bent to take Richmond. Grant is here; he is now down at {{headquarters}} in the field, Brandy station. We expect fighting before long; there are many indications. I believe I told you they had sent up all the sick from front. [The letter is here mutilated so as to be illegible; from the few remaining words, however, it is possible to gather that the writer is describing the arrival of a train of wounded, over 600, in Washington during a terribly rainy afternoon. The letter continues:] I could not keep the tears out of my eyes. Many of the poor young men had to be moved on stretchers, with blankets over them, which soon soaked as wet as water in the rain. Most were sick cases, but some badly wounded. I came up to the nearest hospital and helped. Mother, it was a dreadful night (last Friday night)--pretty dark, the wind gusty, and the rain fell in torrents. One poor boy--this is a sample of one case out of the 600--he seemed to be quite young, he was quite small (I looked at his body afterwards), he groaned some as the stretcher bearers were carrying him along, and again as they carried him through the hospital gate. They set down the stretcher and examined him, and the poor boy was dead. They took him into the ward, and the doctor came immediately, but it was all of no use. The worst of it is, too, that he is entirely unknown--there was nothing on his clothes, or any one with him to identity him, and he is altogether unknown. Mother, it is enough to rack one's heart--such things. Very likely his folks will never know in the world what has become of him. Poor, poor child, for he appeared as though he could be but 18. I feel lately as though I must have some intermission. I feel well and hearty enough, and was never better, but my feelings are kept in a painful condition a great part of the time. Things get worse and worse, as to the amount and sufferings of the sick, and as I have said before, those who have to do with them <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> and more callous and indifferent. Mother, when I see the common soldiers, what they go through, and how everybody seems to try to pick upon them, and what humbug there is over them every how, even the dying soldier's money stolen from his body by some scoundrel attendant, or from [the] sick one, even from under his head, which is a common thing, and then the agony I see every day, I get almost frightened at the world. Mother, I will try to write more cheerfully next time--but I see so much. Well, good-bye for present, dear mother.|$|E
6000|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I went to Romney Street--your Mother was not at home--but I have just written her that I shall see her on Wednesday. I call'd on Mr. Lewis this morning--he is very well--and tells me not to be uneasy about Letters, the chances being so arbitrary. He is going on as usual among his favourite democrat papers. We had a chat as usual about Cobbett and the Westminster electors. Dilke has lately been very much harrassed about the manner of educating his son--he at length decided for a public school--and then {{he did not know}} what school--he at last has decided for Westminster; and as Charley is to be a day boy, Dilke will remove to Westminster. We lead very quiet lives here--Dilke is at present in Greek histories and antiquities, and talks of nothing but the electors of Westminster and the retreat of the ten-thousand. I never drink now above three glasses of wine--and never any spirits and water. Though by the bye, the other day Woodhouse took me to his coffee house and ordered a Bottle of Claret--now I like Claret, whenever I can have Claret I must drink it,--'tis the only palate affair that I am at all sensual in. Would it not be a good speck to send you some vine roots--could it be done? I'll enquire--If you could make some wine like Claret to drink on summer evenings in an arbour! For really 'tis so fine--it fills one's mouth with a gushing freshness--then goes down cool and feverless--then you do not feel it quarrelling with your liver--no, it is rather a Peacemaker, and lies as quiet as it did in the grape; then it is as fragrant as the Queen Bee, and the more ethereal Part of it mounts into the brain, not assaulting the cerebral apartments like a bully in a bad-house looking for his trull and hurrying from door to door bouncing against the wainstcoat, but rather walks like Aladdin about his own enchanted palace so gently that you do not feel his step. Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform a Man to a Silenus: this makes him a Hermes--and gives a Woman the soul and immortality of Ariadne, for whom Bacchus always kept a good cellar of claret--and even of that he could never persuade her to take above two cups. I said this same claret is the only palate-passion I have--I forgot game--I must plead guilty to the breast of a Partridge, the back of a hare, the backbone of a grouse, the wing and side of a Pheasant and a Woodcock passim. Talking of game (I wish I could make it), the Lady whom I met at Hastings and of whom I said something in my last I think has lately made me many presents of game, and enabled me to make as many. She made me take home a Pheasant the other day, which I gave to Mrs. Dilke; on which to-morrow Rice, Reynolds and the Wentworthians will dine next door. The next I intend for your Mother. These moderate sheets of paper are much more pleasant to write upon than those large thin sheets which I hope you by this time have received--though that can't be, now I think of it. I have not said in any Letter yet a word about my affairs--in a word I am in no despair about them--my poem has not at all succeeded; in the course of a year or so I think I shall try the public again--in a selfish point of view I should suffer my pride and my contempt of public opinion to hold me silent--but for yours and Fanny's sake I will pluck up a spirit and try again. I have no doubt of success in a course of years if I persevere--but it must be patience, for the Reviews have enervated and made indolent men's minds--few think for themselves. These Reviews too <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>more</b> and more powerful, especially the Quarterly--they are like a superstition which the more it prostrates the Crowd and the longer it continues the more powerful it becomes just in proportion to their increasing weakness. I was in hopes that when people saw, as they must do now, all the trickery and iniquity of these Plagues they would scout them, but no, they are like the spectators at the Westminster cock-pit--they like the battle and do not care who wins or who loses. Brown is going on this morning with the story of his old woman and the Devil--He makes but slow progress--The fact is it is a Libel on the Devil, and as that person is Brown's Muse, look ye, if he libels his own Muse how can he expect to write? Either Brown or his Muse must turn tail. Yesterday was Charley Dilke's birthday. Brown and I were invited to tea. During the evening nothing passed worth notice but a little conversation between Mrs. Dilke and Mrs. Brawne. The subject was the Watchman. It was ten o'clock, and Mrs. Brawne, who lived during the summer in Brown's house and now lives in the Road, recognised her old Watchman's voice, and said that he came as far as her now. [...] "Indeed," [...] said Mrs. D., [...] "does he turn the Corner?" [...] There have been some Letters passed between me and Haslam but I have not seen him lately. The {{day before yesterday}}--which I made a day of Business--I called upon him--he was out as usual. Brown has been walking up and down the room a-breeding--now at this moment he is being delivered of a couplet, and I daresay will be as well as can be expected. Gracious--he has twins! ...|$|E
