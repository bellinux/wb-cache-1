25|$|The {{economic}} crisis was also <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> FitzGerald had feared. Fine Gael had to jettison its plans {{for tax cuts}} {{in the run-up to}} the election and a draconian mid-year budget was introduced almost immediately. The July Budget seemed exceptionally austere for a government dependent on Independent TDs support. However, the second budget introduced by John Bruton led to the Government's shock defeat in Dáil Éireann on the evening of 27 January 1982.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} 2009–10 season, he again had to {{battle with a}} couple of injuries. But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> original thought. When they tried to get him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E

[...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy.

More generally, the welfare losses from undercapacity and overcapacity are asymmetric, and parking lots should be “overbuilt. ” That is, the optimal parking lot size can be well in excess of mean demand.

40|$|In {{the past}} year, North Attleboro High School’s {{environmental}} science class {{has been conducting}} an intense study of the Ten Mile River. The focus of our study {{is to find out}} detailed information regarding the biological, physical, and chemical state of the river. The Ten Mile River is the main river within North Attleboro. It runs down to Narragansett Bay and flows through many other local towns. The watersheds are located in North Attleboro and Plainville. The river begins at Cargill Pond in Plainville and flows 61 miles through North Attleboro, Attleboro, Plainville, and Seekonk before going into Rhode Island. We studied two sites along the river within Bristol County. The first site was Cedar Street located in North Attleboro right before a local wastewater treatment plant. The second location that we studied was Water Street in Attleboro located at a confluence with Bungay River. We only visited each site once on the river. We compared the two sites with pH testing, E Coli testing, Temperature testing, Dissolved Oxygen testing, Nitrogen testing, Fecal Coliform testing, and Benthic Macro Invertebrate testing. The results show that the two locations we tested are vastly different. We concluded that Water Street was in <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>worse</b> condition <b>than</b> Cedar Street. Water Street had higher fecal counts than Cedar Street. Water Street had a higher MGBI (Major Group Biotic Index) than Cedar Street. In general, Cedar Street had higher pH, phosphorous, and Dissolved Oxygen. Water Street had a higher average temperature. From all of this, we have made the conclusion that Water Street is more polluted than Cedar Street. According to the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index, the Cedar street site numbers came out to 4. 9, which indicates that the water quality is good and there is some organic pollution. At the Water Street site, the numbers came out 6. 4, which indicates that the water quality is fair and the degree of organic pollution is fairly significant...|$|R
