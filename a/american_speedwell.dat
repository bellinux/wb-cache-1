5000|$|In the {{plantain}} family (Plantaginaceae), Torrey's few-eyed Mary (Collinsia torreyi) can {{be found}} as high as 13000 ft. Davidson's penstemon, or creeping penstemon (Penstemon davidsonii), is a perennial spreading mat, with several spreading flower stems. The tubular blossoms are longer than the stems of the dwarfed plant that supports them. (Penstemon heterodoxus) can be as small as 2 in, but usually forms mats to 8 in, ranging to 12000 ft elevation. John Muir's favorite wildflower, mountain pride (Penstemon newberryi), [...] "carpets granite slopes with brilliant pink flowers". Showy penstemon (Penstemon speciosus)) is a spreading perennial. <b>American</b> alpine <b>speedwell</b> (Veronica wormskjoldii) is an erect perennial that grows near moist streambanks and lakeshores from an underground stem (rhizome).|$|R
50|$|Veronica wormskjoldii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by the common name <b>American</b> alpine <b>speedwell.</b> It is native to much of northern and western North America, including the western United States and northern Canada, from where it grows in moist alpine habitat, such as mountain forest understory. It has a wide subarctic distribution from Alaska to Greenland. This is a rhizomatous perennial herb producing a decumbent to erect, mostly unbranched stem up to 25 to 40 centimeters tall and coated in long hairs. The oppositely arranged leaves are 2 to 4 centimeters long and lack petioles. The inflorescence is a hairy, glandular raceme of flowers {{at the tip of}} the stem. Each flower has hairy, lance-shaped sepals and a blue corolla up to a centimeter wide. The fruit is a capsule around half a centimeter long which contains tiny flattened seeds.|$|R

50|$|Veronica americana, {{variously}} called American brooklime or <b>American</b> <b>speedwell,</b> is a plant {{native to}} temperate and arctic Asia and North America where it grows in streams and bottomlands.|$|E
50|$|Veronica peregrina is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the plantain family known by several common names including neckweed, <b>American</b> <b>speedwell,</b> purslane speedwell and hairy purslane speedwell. It is native to the Americas, and is known on other continents as an introduced species and a common weed. It can be weedy in its native range as well, growing on roadsides, on fields, and in other disturbed habitat. It is an annual herb growing from a taproot. The two subspecies are defined generally {{on the basis of}} hairiness: ssp. xalapensis is coated in glandular hairs and ssp. peregrina is a hairless variety. The plant produces erect stems up to about 30 centimeters tall. The leaves vary in shape from linear to lance-shaped to spoon-shaped with smooth or serrated edges; the lower leaves are borne on petioles. The inflorescence is a loose terminal raceme of flowers and lance-shaped bracts. The flowers are generally white and 2 or 3 millimeters wide.|$|E
