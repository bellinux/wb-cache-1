25|$|During gliding, lift {{plays an}} {{increased}} role. Like drag, lift {{is proportional to}} velocity squared. Gliding animals will typically leap or drop from high locations such as trees, just as in parachuting, and as gravitational acceleration increases their speed, the aerodynamic forces also increase. Because the animal can utilize lift and drag to generate greater <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force,</b> it can glide at a shallower angle than parachuting animals, allowing it to cover greater horizontal distance in the same loss of altitude, and reach trees further away.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top {{speed of the vehicle}} and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a vehicle's aerodynamics is that it may cause the vehicle to get too much lift. Lift is an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force</b> that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA static {{aeroelastic}} {{analysis method}} {{based on the}} high-order panel method and modal method has been recommended through two examples of a high-aspect-ratio wing and a low-aspect-ratio wing. The subsonic <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> of a high-aspect-ratio wing and the subsonic/supersonic <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> of a low-aspect-ratio wing are investigated in this study. The influences of elastic structural deformation on <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> are studied {{with an emphasis on}} the aerodynamic coefficients, wing root loads, structural deformation and pressure distribution of different sections, and these results are compared with the results from low-order panel method and the results based on experimental <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces.</b> It is concluded that <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> can be accurately calculated with the high-order panel method. The method presented in this study is feasible, credible and efficient. Comprehensive static aeroelastic characteristics can be provided by the method for initial phases of aircraft design...|$|R

2500|$|Stiffer skin is {{necessary}} for bat wing skin oriented in the direction parallel to the long axes of the bones to prevent too much deformation of bat wing skin during flight(with respect to the bone), resulting in the shearing of the bat wing skin off of the bone. Flexible skin {{is necessary}} for the direction perpendicular to the long axes of the bones for facilitating the shape changes needed for movement and control during flight. [...] This anisotropy of bat wing skin is also useful as method of storing and releasing elastic energy, particularly during the downstroke. During the downstroke, the bat extends its wing [...] and the wing skin experiences an <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force.</b> The wing skin expands and [...] counteracts the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force.</b> After the wing is fully extended, the orientation of the wing is nearly vertical and the aerodynamic forces on the wing are reduced. As the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force</b> is reduced, the wing recoils, drawing the digits of the wings together in preparation for the upstroke.|$|E
2500|$|Aerodynamic {{forces on}} sails depend on wind speed and {{direction}} {{and the speed}} {{and direction of the}} craft ( [...] VB [...] ). The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface – VT [...] ) is called the point of sail. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( [...] VA [...] )—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force,</b> which may be resolved into drag—the force component {{in the direction of the}} apparent wind—and lift—the force component normal (90°) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force</b> also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force—resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)—and a lateral force, resisted by the wheels or ice runners of the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Flutter is {{a dynamic}} {{instability}} of an elastic structure in a fluid flow, caused by positive feedback between the body's deflection and the force exerted by the fluid flow. In a linear system, 'flutter point' is {{the point at which}} the structure is undergoing simple harmonic motion - zero net damping - and so any further decrease in net damping will result in a self-oscillation and eventual failure. 'Net damping' can be understood as the sum of the structure's natural positive damping, and the negative damping of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>force.</b> Flutter can be classified into two types: hard flutter, in which the net damping decreases very suddenly, very close to the flutter point; and soft flutter, in which the net damping decreases gradually. Methods of predicting flutter in linear structures include the p-method, the k-method and the p-k method. In water the mass ratio of the [...] pitch inertia of the foil vs that of the circumscribing cylinder of fluid is generally too low for binary flutter to occur, as shown by explicit solution of the simplest pitch and heave flutter stability determinant.|$|E

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{an effective}} assessment of stress-related bridge performance and safety, stress-level buffeting {{analysis of a}} long-span cable-supported bridge is necessary. A stress-level buffeting analysis requires knowledge of characteristics of distributed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> on the surfaces of a bridge deck. This paper first presents a formulation for distributed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> on the surfaces of a bridge deck based on the quasi-steady theory. The characteristics of distributed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces,</b> such as pressure coefficients, pressure admittances and span-wise pressure coherences, are introduced in the formulation. In consideration of different characteristics of incident and signature turbulences, the empirical mode decomposition is then adopted to separate their effects on the distributed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces.</b> Wind tunnel pressure tests of a sectional motionless bridge deck model were conducted to identify the characteristics of distributed <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>forces</b> on the surfaces of the Stonecutters cable-stayed bridge with a twin-box bridge deck as a case study.
