Reef herons and little egrets appear {{to be able to}} make the corrections needed when capturing fish and are more successful in catching fish when strikes are made at an acute angle and this higher success may be due to the inability of the fish to detect their predators.

40|$|AbstractInteraction {{between a}} bounded {{ultrasonic}} beam and a liquid wedge over a solid half-space is studied. A semi-analytical technique called distributed point source method (DPSM) is adopted for modeling the ultrasonic field in a wedge shaped fluid structure over a solid half space. This study {{is important for}} analyzing the ultrasonic waves used for the non-destructive inspections of partially immersed structures. It is also useful for studying the effect of underwater ultrasonic or acoustic wave experiments on marine lives near the shore. The problem geometry considers a bounded acoustic beam striking a fluid–solid interface between a fluid wedge and a solid half-space at steady-state. Solution of this problem {{is beyond the scope}} of the currently available analytical methods when the beam is bounded. Only numerical method (boundary element method (BEM) or finite element method (FEM)) based packages (e. g. PZFlex) are in principle capable of modeling ultrasonic fields in such structures. At high frequencies FEM and BEM based packages require huge amount of computation memory and time for their executions that DPSM technique can avoid. Effect of the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>strike</b> and the fluid wedge angle variation on the wave propagation characteristics is studied. Theoretical predictions are compared with some experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The {{west coast}} of India is {{affected}} by tsunamigenic earthquake along the Makran subduction zone. On 28 November 1945 at 21 : 56 coordinated universal time (UTC), a massive Makran earthquake (M 8. 0) generated a destructive tsunami that propagated across the Northern Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. This tsunamigenic earthquake {{was responsible for the}} loss of life and great destruction along the coasts of India, Pakistan, Iran and Oman. Modelling of tsunami stages has been made for the coasts of Pakistan, Iran, India and Oman using NAMI-DANCE computer code. The fault parameters of the earthquakes for the generation of tsunami are epicentre (25. 15 ° N, 63. 48 ° E), fault area (200  km length and 100  km width), <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>strike,</b> dip and rake (246 °, 7 ° and 90 °), focal depth (15  km), slip magnitude (7  m). The bathymetry data are taken from General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) and land topography data were collected using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The present simulation is carried out for a duration of 360  min. It is observed that the maximum calculated tsunami run-ups were about 0. 7 – 1. 1  m along the coast of Oman, 0. 5  m near Muscat, 0. 1  m near Sur, 0. 7 – 1. 35  m along the western coast of India, 0. 5 – 2. 3  m along the southern coast of Iran and 1. 2 – 5. 8  m along the southern coast of Pakistan. After the tsunamigenic earthquake, the tsunami wave reached the Gulf of Kachchh in about 240  min, Okha in about 185  min, Dwarka in about 150  min, Porbandar in about 155  min, Mumbai in about 300  min and Goa in about 210  min. The calculated 2 -hr tsunami travel time to the Indian coast is in good agreement with the available reports and published data. If the tsunami strikes during high tide, we should expect more serious hazards which would impact local coastal communities. The results obtained in this study are converted to be compatible with the geographic information system based applications for display and spatial analysis of modelling results. The paper also presents classification of tsunami risk zones based on elevation vulnerability. We expect that the results presented here will be supportive to the tsunami emergency response system and useful in planning the protection measures due to tsunami...|$|E

40|$|Fractures {{constitute}} some of {{the most}} permeable groundwater migration pathways. The directional regularity of fracture sets largely determines the hydraulic anisotropy (single- or multi-directional) of fractured rocks. Knowledge of the preferential directions of possible water flow and pollutant migration paths along fracture-controlled azimuths is useful for understanding the flow patterns and spread of pollutants in a given aquifer. Yet systematic regional fracture mapping is still rare in hydrogeological studies. To assist in ongoing predictive modelling of mine water pollution plume migration within the Magnesian Limestone Aquifer (Permian) in County Durham, U. K., a survey was undertaken of basic fracture characteristics, including <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> dip, <b>strike</b> directions, aperture and frequency. These parameters were measured both in natural exposures and working quarries across the outcrop of the aquifer in the study area. Scrutiny of the measurements reveals the presence of two major fracture sets, one oriented WNW to NNW and the other oriented NNE to ENE. These are likely to be extensional joints, with perhaps a few minor faults, that form reasonably consistent conjugate sets distributed across the Permian outcrop, and suggest that the permeability tensor in the aquifer is also likely to have axes oriented with maxima trending NNE to ENE. This is only slightly oblique to the general eastward trend of groundwater flow towards the coast, suggesting a mild tendency to sinistral preference in transverse dispersivity...|$|R

40|$|A {{principal}} loss mechanism for solar receivers in solar-thermal systems is {{radiation from the}} absorbing surface. This loss can be reduced by using the concept of directional selectivity in which radiation is suppressed at angles larger than the incident <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the sunlight <b>striking</b> the absorber. Directional selectivity can achieve efficiencies similar to high solar concentration, without the drawbacks associated with large heat fluxes. A specularly reflective hemispherical cavity placed over the absorber can reflect emitted radiation back to the absorber, effectively suppressing emission losses. An aperture in the cavity will still allow sunlight to reach the absorber surface when used with point focus concentrating systems. In this paper the reduction in radiative losses {{through the use of}} a hemispherical cavity is predicted using ray tracing simulations, and the effects of cavity size and absorber alignment are investigated. Simulated results are validated with proof of concept experiments that show reductions in radiative losses of more than 75 % from a near blackbody absorber surface. The demonstrated cavity system is shown to be capable of achieving receiver efficiencies comparable to idealized spectrally selective absorbers across a wide range of operating temperatures.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{algorithm}} that improves muon-based generated tomography images with increased precision and reduced image noise applicable to the detection of nuclear materials. Cosmic muon tomography is an interrogation-based imaging technique that, over the last decade, has been frequently employed {{for the detection of}} high-Z materials. This technique exploits a magnitude of cosmic muon scattering angles in order to construct an image. The scattering <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> the muons <b>striking</b> the geometry <b>of</b> interest are non-uniform, as cosmic muons vary in energy. The randomness <b>of</b> the scattering <b>angles</b> leads to significant noise in the muon tomography image. GEANT 4 is used to numerically create data on the momenta and positions of scattered muons in a predefined geometry that includes high-Z materials. The numerically generated information is then processed with the point of closest approach reconstruction method to construct a muon tomography image; statistical filters are then developed to refine the point of closest approach reconstructed images. The filtered images exhibit reduced noise and enhanced precision when attempting to identify the presence of high-Z materials. The average precision from the point of closest approach reconstruction method is 13 %; for the integrated method, 88 %. The filtered image, therefore, results in a seven-fold improvement in precision compared to the point of closest approach reconstructed image...|$|R

The Groom and Bailey (GB) decomposition (Groom and Bailey 1989) has been conventionally applied to the MT data to eliminate unwanted effects caused by near-surface galvanic distortions. The GB decomposition partly solves the distortion problem by separating the effects into determinable (shear and twist) and indeterminable parts (site gain and anisotropy) and removes the determinable part to allow the calculation <b>of</b> geoelectric <b>strike</b> <b>angles</b> (Groom and Bailey 1989).
