5|$|Smith's third {{victim was}} Carol Jordan, a 39-year-old care home worker {{and mother of}} six from Balsall Heath, who was killed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> to work. Smith hit her from behind with his car while driving back from Worcestershire, {{fracturing}} her hip. Fearing {{that he would be}} caught, Smith moved her to another location and beat her so much that dental records were required to identify her corpse. The body was discovered at 8:50am on 12 November on parkland next to Bell Barn Road, Lee Bank.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> backstage.|$|E
5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. The gag was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E

500|$|The crew used several {{different}} styles for the [...] "bullet time" [...] scene. In {{order to create}} the shot, a matte of the bullet emerging from Max's chest was combined with smoke and [...] "phony CGI bullets", according to producer Paul Rabwin. The crew tried different tracking devices for the bullet, including a pronounced blur effect, which was later removed {{in favor of a}} more realistic [...] "smoke" [...] pathway. The production crew had a difficult time deciding whether or not the bullet should remain at Chastity's speed <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> towards it, or whether she should pass the bullet; the group eventually went with the latter.|$|E
500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had dark brown hair and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked.</b> PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then we wanted to go back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E
500|$|Ray Harding {{wrote the}} script for [...] "Episode 523". Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that {{it is one of}} only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. The {{producers}} asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode, due to his experience of directing other television weddings. Hardy believed that [...] "the magic of the episode" [...] is captured best in two close-up shots of Scott and Charlene. The director recalled [...] "The image that stays with me is the close-up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close-up on Jason's face, and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about." [...] The episode was shot [...] "in great secrecy" [...] three months before it was broadcast on Australian television. The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather. Due to a limited budget, there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead. The scenes were shot in soft focus, creating [...] "a halo effect" [...] around Charlene <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> up the aisle.|$|E
500|$|According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. {{they had}} left the {{apartment}} to use a bank.

He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had [...] "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a Chelsea antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> down King's Road. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car {{so that he could}} get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted.

500|$|In April 2001, Toyah was {{the focus}} of one of Coronation Streets most {{controversial}} storylines. After enjoying a night out with her friend Sam Kingston (Scott Wright), Toyah was raped, beaten and left for dead in an alleyway by an unknown assailant <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> home alone. The storyline began during a special 45-minute episode that was broadcast during the Easter weekend. It marked the first time in forty years that Coronation Street had included a rape. Viewers saw Toyah being grabbed by her attacker, but not the actual act of rape. Instead Toyah's [...] "bruised body" [...] was found by Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) just as he set out for an early morning run. Jason took a [...] "traumatised" [...] Toyah back to her house, where she told her mother what had happened. Toyah then had to repeat the story to the police and revealed that she did not know who raped her because she was semi-conscious during the attack. Toyah underwent an examination and counselling at the local hospital. The scenes were shot at the St Mary's Hospital Sexual Assault Centre in Manchester, where the writers spent four months researching victims' experiences and working with the clinical director and the staff to get the scenario right.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} the opening scene is a calypso version of the nursery rhyme [...] "Three Blind Mice," [...] with new lyrics to reflect the {{intentions}} of the three assassins hired by Dr. No. Other notable songs in the film are the song [...] "Jump Up," [...] played in the background, and the traditional Jamaican calypso [...] "Under the Mango Tree," [...] famously sung by Diana Coupland (then Norman's wife), the singing voice of Honey Ryder, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> out of the ocean on Crab Key. Byron Lee & the Dragonaires appeared in the film and performed some of the music on the later soundtrack album. Lee and other Jamaican musicians who appear in the soundtrack, including Ernest Ranglin and Carlos Malcolm, were introduced to Norman by Chris Blackwell, the owner of then-small label Island Records who worked in the film as a location scout. The original soundtrack album was released by United Artists Records in 1963 as well as several cover versions of [...] "The James Bond Theme" [...] on Columbia Records. A single of the [...] "James Bond Theme" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart in 1962, reaching a peak position of number thirteen during an eleven-week spell in the charts. Ranglin, who had acted as arranger on several tracks, and Malcolm sued Eon for unpaid fees, both settling out of court; Malcolm and his band performed a year later at the film's premiere in Kingston.|$|E
500|$|... "LoveGame" [...] saw the {{beginning}} of the Subway section, with Gaga wearing a translucent nun's habit, and a skeletal hand. The song was performed {{with the aid of a}} gilded subway car and a [...] "disco stick" [...] while her next number [...] "Boys Boys Boys" [...] featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts. After a costume change, Gaga burst into [...] "Money Honey" [...] with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> towards the Glitter way, Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend Beyoncé bailed her out, thus performing the song [...] "Telephone". A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song [...] "Brown Eyes", after which she performs [...] "Speechless". This segment also saw the performance of [...] "You and I" [...] in some of the shows; the song was later added to Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way. During this song, she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York, and how she became who she is today. Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way, and soon they run into an angel, who plays a tune that summons a twister, taking them closer to the Monster Ball, but landing them in a strange place that they did not know. Gaga sings [...] "So Happy I Could Die", decked in a white dress, that moves on its own accord.|$|E
