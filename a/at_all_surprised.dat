500|$|The third {{scene is}} set on a {{football}} pitch during team training. The coach, played by David Ginola, asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy-saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's [...] "no pressure", produces a detonator and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>surprised,</b> and casually jogs away to resume training.|$|E
500|$|Two musical {{works from}} this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore {{there will probably be}} no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't be <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>surprised</b> and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts." [...] Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, [...] "the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best." ...|$|E
500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>surprised</b> at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E

500|$|Limbaugh's {{appearance}} in the episode has drawn both praise and criticism from news outlets, including Daniel Foster of National Review who commented, [...] "It is to Mr. Limbaugh's credit that he can make fun of himself. But Seth MacFarlane, the whiskey-soaked Dada creator of Family Guy, is responsible for more sophomoric cartooning than the combined patrons of America’s truck stop and dive bar bathrooms." [...] Foster went on to add, [...] "I can only look at the Limbaugh-MacFarlane mash-up with a wary eye." [...] Columnist Matt Lewis of Politics Daily also questioned Limbaugh's appearance on Family Guy, citing his support for former Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin, whose daughter, Bristol Palin, has openly criticized MacFarlane and called the show's writers [...] "heartless jerks." [...] In contrast, John Nolte of Andrew Breitbart's Big Hollywood wrote, [...] "What MacFarlane’s doing fits exactly into our template. He’s entitled to his opinion, {{worked very hard to}} reach the top of the most difficult business there is to succeed in, and in turn uses that forum to further his own agenda— that’s how it’s supposed to work. But {{at the same time he}} doesn’t completely shut us out." [...] Prior to the episode's official broadcast on television in the United States, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called Limbaugh's guest {{appearance in}} the episode [...] "genuinely funny," [...] and David Weigel of Slate commented, [...] "I'm not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>surprised</b> that Limbaugh would embrace the show and answer its mockery of conservatives; the plotline [...] is a perfect conservative narrative." ...|$|E

40|$|This Master thesis {{project is}} {{based on the fact that}} Volvo Truck Corporation {{received}} complaints from drivers concerning the comfort of their seats in the FH 12 truck. The complaints concerned especially the ventilated comfort seat. The seat is evaluated in this project to find the source of the complaints. It is also compared to the updated version of the seat to determine if improvements have been done. The focus in this project has been to implement real-time measurements of whole body vibration and seat pressure distribution during a long-term drive in trucks. The measurements have been analysed with calculated parameters and ratings of discomfort according to standards and recommendations. The two seats were tested by six drivers during an each time 120 km long test road. Three distances were chosen from this drive representing different types of road conditions. A method measuring whole body vibration and pressure simultaneously was used during the test drives. The post processing of the measurements began with an identification of existing methods used to analyse the objective test results. Decisions were made regarding how and when the identified methods are appropriate to use in terms of evaluating how whole body vibration and seat pressure affect the drivers’ comfort. The analysis showed that no significant differences exist between the two seats concerning whole body vibrations. This is not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>surprise</b> since the seats are based on the same frame. The vibration accelerations for both seats do not exceed the limitation stated by the European Union. Some values do, however, exceed the recommendation made by the Swedish work environment authority. This leads to the conclusion that measures should be taken to decrease the vibration acceleration i. e. improve the driver’s working environment. No significant differences could either be shown in the pressure measurements but all calculated pressure parameters indicates that the old ventilated seat is better than the updated version. Numerous of parameters have been calculated and evaluated to obtain a complete picture of the pressure. None of the parameters should, however, be analysed alone but as a part of a complete analysis. Even though no significant differences could be pointed out between the seats a lot of information about the weaknesses and strengths for both seats were obtained during this project. A relationship between vibration and pressure has also been examined. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

Villette had already been arrested with his pockets full of diamonds, but the luck of the House of Valois, and the astuteness of Jeanne, procured his release. So the diamonds were, in part, 'dumped down' in England; many were kept by the La Mottes; and Jeanne paid some pressing debts in diamonds.|$|R

On 18 April 2011, Storck announced {{its plan to}} move chocolate production from its factory in Hampshire to Germany, {{with the loss of}} 84 jobs; 30 marketing and sales jobs were to remain at the Winchester site. The decision was based on economic factors, namely a weak chocolate market and lack of profitability at the English factory. The managing director of Storck, Thomas Huber, explained: This difficult decision has been driven by commercial reality. Despite our best efforts to re-launch the Bendicks brand and diversify into new flavours and categories, {{we have not been able}} to drive the critical mass to support an independent manufacturing plant for Bendicks products only in the UK. The Member of Parliament for Winchester, who raised the matter with the Prime Minister, stated: Clearly this is not <b>at</b> <b>all</b> a <b>surprise</b> following the figures Storck management shared with me and the minister last month but it's a cruel blow nonetheless for the workforce who have given so much to this company over many years.
