5|$|DiCaprio {{appeared}} in the mostly improvised short film called Don's Plum, as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> aspiring director R. D. Robb. When Robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, however, DiCaprio and costar Tobey Maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended {{to make it a}} theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. The film eventually premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival, where it was well received by critics. DiCaprio's last film of the year 1995 was The Basketball Diaries, a biographical film about Jim Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> <b>to</b> the position of Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E
5|$|The renowned {{entomologist}} and collector William Sharp Macleay was {{sought out}} by Edwards whenever his stage appearances {{took him to}} Sydney. Beginning in 1858, Macleay mentored Edwards and encouraged him to search for more insect specimens when his theater obligations allowed. Robust and adventuresome, Edwards occasionally trekked out into the wilds of Australia on the hunt for insects. While in Sydney, Edwards went up two times in a hot air balloon as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> George Coppin, narrowly avoiding severe injury or death in the first ascent. Edwards' further travels included New Zealand, Peru, Panama and Mexico in pursuit of insects and dramatic roles.|$|E

5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited by drug dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he was surprised to see that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, Edwards was {{assigned}} to a medical malpractice lawsuit that had been perceived to be unwinnable; the firm had accepted it only as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> an attorney and state senator {{who did not want}} to keep it. Nevertheless, Edwards won a $3.7 million verdict on behalf of his client, who had suffered permanent brain and nerve damage after a doctor prescribed an overdose of the anti-alcoholism drug Antabuse during alcohol aversion therapy. In other cases, Edwards sued the American Red Cross three times, alleging transmission of AIDS through tainted blood products, resulting in a confidential settlement each time, and defended a North Carolina newspaper against a libel charge.|$|E

25|$|On October 5, 2008, Anthony Limon {{had agreed}} as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> Torres to drive four men in his Hummer {{limousine}} that night, {{picking up the}} first three and taking them to the Elephant Bar restaurant in suburban Lakewood, where they picked up Saenz. Later, he ordered Limon to drive to Montebello, then at 5 a.m. ordered him {{to drive to the}} limo owner's home in Whittier. Saenz was filmed on a home surveillance system arriving at Torres' house, chasing him out of his front door and then shooting Torres four times in the head, possibly due to lost money. The DVD disc that had captured the shooting was removed from the surveillance system. However, shortly after the investigation of the homicide, video of the murder was retrieved from the security equipment's hard drive, leading investigators to identify Saenz as the shooter.|$|E
25|$|The Afrobarometer Survey 2008 {{collected}} {{information about}} Tanzanians' {{opinions about the}} water sector. The disparity in access to safe and clean water between rural and urban areas {{is illustrated by the}} responses: 51% of urban residents were satisfied with government efforts to deliver water and sanitation services, compared to 39% in rural areas. Accordingly, the water sector is considered as a higher priority for government action by rural Tanzanians. 44% of respondents in rural areas cited water supply as one of the three most pressing issues that the government should address (for 16% it {{is the single most important}} problem). In urban areas water supply came third behind economic and health concerns in 25% of responses. Issues of corruption in the water sector were also examined by the Survey: 4% of respondents admitted that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> <b>to</b> government officials in order to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

Isabella approached Paul at his office with a case against her husband, which he took. Paul gave Isabella shelter, and the two were drawn to each other. Upon {{the ending of the}} case, Isabella's past as a call girl came out, but Paul forgave Isabella for lying, and they became even closer. Isabella was keen on leaving the city after the case was over, but both Michael and Paul had their reasons for keeping her in town. Isabella was surprised to learn that she was pregnant with Paul's child. Paul's marriage took another hit when Christine returned home to find him passionately kissing Isabella. However, Isabella didn't want Paul, and she decided to tell Michael that she was carrying his child after a night of passion that they had. Michael reluctantly agreed to pay for her expenses and went along with all of her demands, while Paul became closer to his ex-wife, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). Paul found out that he was the father of Isabella's child and decided to raise his son with her. Both Michael and Mary Williams (Carolyn Conwell), Paul's mother, were not happy to learn the truth. Mary did her best to break up the couple, and Paul eventually realized that he couldn't be one happy family with Isabella and their baby.|$|E
