5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty to Hitler and went to Berlin to be by his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> room of the bunker, she by biting into a capsule of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public was unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E

5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a forged check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use forged letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces {{on the ground}} floor, and a library in the north room on the second floor, as well as <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> room over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow ground floor rooms where the garden is visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed {{to be placed in}} their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east corner of the building there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} without <b>a</b> <b>sitting</b> council from 1905 to 1921, the {{government}} of the Territories was small but still active. A small civil service force was sent to Fort Smith to set the town up as the new administrative capital in 1911. A budget to provide minimal services was still given by the federal government. Commissioner Frederick D. White administered the territories day-to-day operations during that period. During this 16-year lapse in legislative government, no new laws were created, and the Territories and its population were severely neglected even with the services provided at the time.|$|E
