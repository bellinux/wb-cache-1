5|$|The {{relative}} importance and interactions between these different antioxidants {{is a very}} complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having synergistic and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the antioxidants with which it interacts.|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at {{the tips of the}} rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debbie is {{the most}} {{powerful}} cyclone on record to strike Ireland in September, and possibly the only tropical cyclone on record to ever strike Britain and Ireland while still tropical. The fourth named storm of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie originated from a well-defined tropical disturbance that was first identified in late August over Central Africa. Tracking generally westward, the system moved off the coast of Senegal on September5 into the Atlantic Ocean. By this time, it was estimated to have become a tropical storm, but forecasters did not issue advisories on the system until two days later. Late on September6, Debbie passed through the southern Cape Verde Islands as a strong tropical storm or minimal hurricane, resulting in a plane crash that killed 60people in the islands. Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> Debbie was uncertain over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward. It was not until a commercial airliner intercepted the storm on September10 that its location became certain. The following day, Debbie intensified and reached its peak intensity as a Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, with maximum winds of 120mph (195km/h).|$|E

5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches. The islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Kitts were placed under {{a tropical storm}} warning the following day. These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses. Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was {{not a threat to}} the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> emergency supplies.
