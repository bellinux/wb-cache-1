5|$|Griffith {{remained}} a one-station market, however {{instead of taking}} programming from Prime {{in line with the}} network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing <b>a</b> <b>relay</b> of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains <b>a</b> <b>relay</b> of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996.

According to the doctor of the Brazilian Aquatic Sports Confederation (CBDA), Gustavo Magliocca, Cielo had an inflammation of the supraspinatus tendon.

30|$|Also note that, {{while the}} above three {{communication}} systems yield the same spectral efficiency, the <b>relay</b> in <b>a</b> one-way <b>relaying</b> system needs to transmit more symbols (and thus consume more energy) {{as compared to}} the <b>relay</b> in <b>a</b> two-way <b>relaying</b> system.

In <b>a</b> two-way <b>relaying</b> system, the relay is only active during one slot, transmitting a total of 1, 536 symbols. This favors the two-way relaying system in applications where low relay energy consumption is required, such as battery-powered sensor networks and on-body relaying networks.|$|R

30|$|To start <b>an</b> <b>relay</b> service, the MS j {{needs to}} {{initiate}} <b>an</b> <b>relay</b> service request (“request” for short in {{the remainder of}} the paper) first, indicating the requested transmission duration, denoted by D_j^k, where k is the index of the time slot when the request is made. In addition, we use D_j^k= 0 to indicate that no request is made in the kth time slot. The relay service request is processed by the assigned RS and an admission control decision is made instantaneously. Specifically, whenever both the uncommitted channel resource and energy resource of the RS are sufficient to fulfill the MS’s relay service request, this request is admitted. Otherwise, the request is rejected.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} a two-user {{interference}} channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay,</b> where the relay’s transmit symbol depends {{not only on}} its past received symbols, but also on its present received symbol. This is an appropriate model for studying amplify-and-forward type relaying when the bandwidth delay-spread product is much smaller than one. For the discrete memoryless interference channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay,</b> we derive <b>a</b> genie-aided outer bound. For the Gaussian interference channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay,</b> we define strong and very strong interference conditions and propose an outer bound for each case. We also propose an achievable scheme based on instantaneous amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying for the Gaussian interference channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay</b> and so it achieves capacity under some conditions. Our result extends the previous result by El Gamal, Hassanpour, and Mammen on the optimality of instantaneous AF relaying for the Gaussian <b>relay</b> channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay</b> {{to that of the}} Gaussian interference channel with <b>a</b> causal <b>relay</b> under strong and very strong interference.
