5|$|In 1088, Robert's {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of England began to falter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the Cotentin, but it extended across the Avranchin, with control over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, Hugh d'Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.|$|E

25|$|The first {{proposal}} for a tuberculosis facility was made in paper by George Bodington entitled An essay on the treatment and cure of pulmonary consumption, on principles natural, rational and successful in 1840. In this paper, he proposed a dietary, rest, and medical care program for a hospital he planned to found in Maney. Attacks from numerous medical experts, especially articles in The Lancet, disheartened Bodington <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> plans for housing the insane.|$|E

He later emigrated to India, where he died shortly after his arrival.|$|E
25|$|He {{served as}} the town rabbi of Radin for a short period. He then {{resigned}} from this position to establish the yeshiva in the city, which eventually became world-famous. By all accounts he was a modest and humble man. For a while he had a shop selling household provisions, which his wife managed. However, the business was not successful <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> teaching {{in order to support}} himself and his family. From 1864 to 1869 he taught Talmud in Minsk and Washilishok.|$|E

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Steele's Bayou expedition, Grant had lost his last chance to attack the Confederate right flank. Porter, together with most others, thought that the Union forces should pull back to Memphis to regroup and consider what to do next. Grant, however, had no such inclination, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the prospect of attacking the Confederate left. Porter unhesitatingly accepted Grant's position, and he immediately began to advise the general how best to incorporate the Navy into his plans. The ensuing close working arrangement between the two men became {{an important part of the}} rest of the Vicksburg campaign.|$|E
25|$|Wallace {{returned}} to Indiana in 1867 to practice law, but the profession did not appeal to him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> politics. Wallace made two unsuccessful bids {{for a seat}} in Congress (in 1868 and 1870), and supported Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes in the 1876 election. As a reward for his political support, Hayes appointed Wallace as governor of the New Mexico Territory, where he served from August 1878 to March 1881. His next assignment came in March 1881, when Republican president James A. Garfield appointed Wallace to an overseas diplomatic post in Constantinople, Turkey, as U.S. Minister to the Ottoman Empire. Wallace remained in this post until 1885.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} towns {{responsible}} {{for military weapons}} at this time were Birmingham and London, Henry VIII however did not look kindly on British made weapons <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Italy for help {{in the manufacture of}} bronze cannons, he bought shells and bombs from the Dutch and much of the armoury and swords came from the more experienced Flemish. The majority of gunpowder was delivered from Antwerp until the threatened invasion by the Spanish in 1588. Howard of Effingham and Sir Francis Drake failed to capitalise on an initial victory over Philip II of Spain's fleet and allowed it to sail up the Channel due to low supplies of imported gunpowder, this proved the importance of more British arms manufacture as opposed to relying on imports.|$|E

As there was a large age gap between Josh and Naomi, they decided to keep their fling a secret. O'Reilly told Mark James Lowe from All About Soap that the relationship came out of the blue for Naomi and she definitely did not plan for it to happen. The actress also told Lowe that she was not surprised when she received the storyline and compared Naomi's life to [...] "a really trashy novel."

500|$|Francis Albert Sinatra ( [...] ; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor, and {{producer}} {{who was one}} of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the [...] "bobby soxers". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

500|$|The Golden Age of Grotesque is {{the final}} studio album to feature {{longtime}} keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and guitarist John 5, who would both acrimoniously quit the group over the following years. John 5's relationship with Manson had soured {{over the course of}} the Grotesk Burlesk Tour. According to John, Manson spoke to him only once during the entire tour: [...] "It was on my birthday <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> me and said, 'Happy birthday, faggot'—then walked away." [...] Manson also displayed hostility towards the guitarist on stage. During a performance of [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] at the 2003 Rock am Ring festival, Manson kicked and then shoved John, who responded in anger by throwing his guitar to the ground and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Gacy, who was also the band's last remaining original member – excluding Manson – quit shortly before the recording of the band's next studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me (2007). He would later file a $20 million lawsuit against Marilyn Manson for unpaid [...] "partnership proceeds", accusing the vocalist of spending money earned by the band on [...] "sick and disturbing purchases of Nazi memorabilia and taxidermy, including the skeleton of a young Chinese girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cadéac wrote {{music in}} most of the vocal forms of the time and place, {{including}} secular chansons, motets, mass settings, Magnificats, and one isolated setting of the Credo (part of the mass). [...] A total of 11 chansons, 24 motets, eight settings of the mass, and four of the Magnificat survive. [...] His chansons seem to be his earliest work, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> sacred music later in his career. [...] Pierre Attaingnant (in Paris) and Jacques Moderne (in Lyons) published most of his chansons between 1538 and 1541. [...] One of them became extraordinarily famous: Je suis deshéritée was widely distributed, and composers as diverse as Jean Maillard in France, Nicolas Gombert in the Habsburg chapel and the Low Countries, Orlande de Lassus in Bavaria, and Palestrina in Italy all used it as source material for masses later in the century.|$|E
2500|$|Pope later immortalised Grub Street in his 1728 poem The Dunciad, a satire of [...] "the Grub-street Race" [...] of {{commercial}} writers. [...] Such infighting was not unusual, but a particularly notable episode occurred from 17521753, when Henry Fielding started a [...] "paper war" [...] against hack writers on Grub Street. [...] Fielding {{had worked in}} Grub Street during the late 1730s. [...] His career as a dramatist was curtailed by the Theatrical Licensing Act (provoked by Fielding's anti-Walpole satire such as Tom Thumb and Covent Garden Tragedy) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> law, supporting his income with normal Grub Street work. [...] He also launched The Champion, and over the following years edited several newspapers, including from 17521754 The Covent-Garden Journal. [...] The [...] "war" [...] spanned many of London's publications, and resulted in countless essays, poems, and even a series of mock epic poems starting with Christopher Smart's The Hilliad (a pun on Pope's Dunciad). [...] Although {{it is not clear}} what started the dispute, it resulted in a divide of authors who either supported Fielding or Hill, and few in between.|$|E

2500|$|As soon as {{he became}} a {{cardinal}}, François de Tournon was drawn into {{the affairs of the}} King of England. [...] Henry VIII wanted a divorce from the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. The one person who {{might have been able to}} manage the intricacies of the Roman Curia on his behalf, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, [...] had been imprudently cast aside. [...] Henry desperately needed someone else to deal with the Curia for him. [...] He tried getting a cardinal of his own: the Bishop of Worcester, Girolamo Ghinucci; [...] Gregory di Casale; Giambattista Casale; Giovanni Matteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona; and Stephen Gardiner. [...] The King was successful with none of them, facing opposition from the Emperor, the Curia, and even the families of the would-be cardinals. [...] Finally Henry realized that he would have to rely on someone else's resources, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> King Francis I. [...] A meeting between the two monarchs took place at Boulogne on 20 October 1532, in which it was agreed that the two new French cardinals, Gramont and Tournon, should be sent to Rome to publicize the new rapprochement between England and France, to remove opposition to 'the King's great matter', and to bring about an alliance between France and the Papacy through the marriage of the Pope's niece and the King's son. [...] Pope Clement was to be invited to Nice to meet with King Francis, and perhaps with Henry VIII.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two most}} {{authoritative}} sources for intelligence for the Soviet Union about Germany in the late-1930s were Sorge and Rudolf von Scheliha, the First Secretary at the German embassy in Warsaw. Unlike Sorge {{who believed in}} communism, Scheliha's reasons for spying were due to money problems as he had a lifestyle beyond his salary as a diplomat, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> selling secrets to provide additional income. Scheliha sold documents to the NKVD indicating that Germany was planning from the late-1938 on turning Poland into a satellite state, and after the Poles refused to fall into line, on invading Poland from March 1939 onward. Sorge for his part reported that Japan did not intend for the border war with the Soviet Union that began in May 1939 to escalate into all-out war. Sorge also reported that the attempt to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance was floundering; the Germans wanted the alliance to be directed against Britain while the Japanese wanted the alliance to be directed against the Soviet Union. Sorge's reports that the Japanese were not planning on invading Siberia were disbelieved in Moscow and on 1 September 1939, Sorge was attacked in a message from Moscow reading: [...] "Japan must have commenced important movements (military and political) in preparation for war against the Soviet Union but you have not provided any appreciable information. Your activity seems to getting slack." ...|$|E
