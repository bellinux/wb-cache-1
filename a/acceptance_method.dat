40|$|Hyper-heuristics {{have emerged}} as {{automated}} high level search methodologies that manage a set of low level heuristics for solving computationally hard problems. A generic selection hyper-heuristic combines heuristic selection and move acceptance methods under an iterative single point-based search framework. At each step, the solution in hand is modified after applying a selected heuristic and a decision is made whether the new solution is accepted or not. In this study, we represent the trail of a hyper-heuristic as a third order tensor. Factorization of such a tensor reveals the latent relationships between the low level heuristics and the hyper-heuristic itself. The proposed learning approach partitions the set of low level heuristics into two subsets where heuristics in each subset {{are associated with a}} separate move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method.</b> Then a multi-stage hyper-heuristic is formed and while solving a given problem instance, heuristics are allowed to operate only in conjunction with the associated <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> at each stage.

40|$|A {{selection}} hyper-heuristic is a {{high level}} search methodology which operates over a fixed set of low level heuristics. During the iterative search process, a heuristic is selected and applied to a candidate solution in hand, producing a new solution which is then accepted or rejected at each step. Selection hyper-heuristics have been increasingly, and successfully, applied to single-objective optimization problems, while work on multi-objective selection hyper-heuristics is limited. This work presents one of the initial studies on selection hyper-heuristics combining a choice function heuristic selection methodology with great deluge and late acceptance as non-deterministic move <b>acceptance</b> <b>methods</b> for multi-objective optimization.

40|$|Grouping {{problems}} {{are hard to}} solve combinatorial optimization problems which require partitioning of objects into a minimum number of subsets while another additional objective is simultaneously optimized. Considerable research e ort has recently been directed towards automated problem-independent reusable heuristic search methodologies such as hyper-heuristics, which operate on a space formed {{by a set of}} low level heuristics rather than solutions, directly. Hyper-heuristics are commonly split into two main categories: selection hyper-heuristics, which are the focus of the work presented in this thesis, and generation hyper-heuristics. Most of the recently proposed selection hyper-heuristics are iterative and make use of two key methods which are employed successively; heuristic selection and move acceptance. At each step, a new solution is produced after a selected heuristic is applied to the solution at hand and then the move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> is used to decide whether the resultant solution replaces the current one or not. This thesis presents a novel generic single point-based selection hyper-heuristic search framework, referred to as grouping hyper-heuristic framework. The proposed framework deals with one solution at any given decision point during the search process and embeds axed set of reusable standard low level heuristics specifically designed for the grouping problems. The use of standard heuristics enables the re-usability of the whole framework across different grouping problem domains with less development effort. The proposed grouping hyper-heuristic framework is based on a bi-objective formulation of any given grouping problem. Inspired from multi-objective optimization, a set of high quality solutions is maintained during the search process, capturing the trade-of between the number of groups and the additional objective for the given grouping problem. Moreover, the grouping framework includes a special two-phased acceptance mechanism that use the traditional move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> only to make a preliminary decision regarding whether to consider the new solution for acceptance or not. The performance of different selection hyper-heuristics combining different components, implemented based on the proposed framework is investigated on a range of sample grouping problem domains, including graph coloring, exam timetabling and data clustering domains. Additionally, the selection hyper-heuristics performing the best on each domain are compared to the previously proposed problem-specific algorithms from the scientific literature. The empirical results shows that the grouping hyper-heuristics built based on the proposed framework are not only sufficiently general, but also able to obtain high quality solutions, competitive to some previously proposed approaches. The selection hyper-heuristic employing the 'reinforcement learning' heuristic selection method and embedding the 'iteration limited threshold accepting' move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> performs the best in the overall across those grouping problem domains...|$|E

Hyper-heuristics are search methodologies that not only aim to provide a general framework for solving problem instances at different difficulty levels in a given domain, but a key goal is also to extend the level of generality so that different problems from different domains can also be solved. Indeed, a major challenge is to explore how the heuristic design process might be automated. Almost all existing iterative selection hyper-heuristics performing single point search contain two successive stages; heuristic selection and move acceptance. Different operators {{can be used in}} either of the stages. Recent studies explore ways of introducing learning mechanisms into the search process for improving the performance of hyper-heuristics. In this study, a broad empirical analysis is performed comparing Monte Carlo based hyper-heuristics for solving capacitated examination timetabling problems. One of these hyper-heuristics is an approach that overlaps two stages and presents them in a single algorithmic body. A learning heuristic selection method (L) operates in harmony with a simulated annealing move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> using reheating (SA) based on some shared variables. Yet, the heuristic selection and move acceptance methods can be separated as the proposed approach respects the common selection hyper-heuristic framework. The experimental results show that simulated annealing with reheating as a hyper-heuristic move <b>acceptance</b> <b>method</b> has significant potential. On the other hand, the learning hyper-heuristic using simulated annealing with reheating move acceptance (L–SA) performs poorly due to certain weaknesses, such as the choice of rewarding mechanism and the evaluation of utility values for heuristic selection as compared to some other hyper-heuristics in examination timetabling. Trials with other heuristic selection methods confirm that the best alternative for the simulated annealing with reheating move acceptance for examination timetabling is a previously proposed strategy known as the choice function. status: publishe...|$|E

Almost all selection hyper-heuristics perform a single point based iterative search over the space of heuristics by selecting and applying a suitable heuristic to the solution in hand at each decision point. Then the newly generated solution is either accepted or rejected using an <b>acceptance</b> <b>method.</b> This improvement process is repeated starting from an initial solution until a set of termination criteria is satisfied. The number of studies on the design of hyper-heuristic methodologies has been rapidly increasing and currently, we already have a variety of approaches, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It has been observed that different hyper-heuristics perform differently on a given subset of problem instances and more importantly, a hyper-heuristic performs differently as the set of low level heuristics vary. This thesis introduces a general "multi-stage" hyper-heuristic framework enabling the use and exploitation of multiple selection hyper-heuristics at different stages during the search process. The goal is designing an approach utilising multiple hyper-heuristics for a more effective and efficient overall performance when compared to the performance of each constituent selection hyper-heuristic. The level of generality that a hyper-heuristic can achieve has always been of interest to the hyper-heuristic researchers. Hence, a variety of multi-stage hyper-heuristics based on the framework are not only applied to the real-world combinatorial optimisation problems of high school timetabling, multi-mode resource-constrained multi-project scheduling and construction of magic squares, but also tested on the well known hyper-heuristic benchmark of CHeSC 2011. The empirical results show that the multi-stage hyper-heuristics designed based on the proposed framework are still inherently general, easy-to-implement, adaptive and reusable. They can be extremely effective solvers considering their success in the competitions of ITC 2011 and MISTA 2013. Moreover, a particular multi-stage hyper-heuristic outperformed the state-of-the-art selection hyper-heuristic from CHeSC 2011...|$|E

These disks offer a 30 % savings of input weight and an 8 % savings in cost compared in cast-and-wrought disks. Similar savings were demonstrated for other rotating engine components. A compressor rotor fabricated from hot-die-forged-HIP superalloy billets revealed input weight savings of 54 % and cost savings of 35 % compared to cast-and-wrought parts. Engine components can be produced from compositions such as Rene 95 and Astroloy by conventional casting and forging, by forging of HIP powder billets, or by direct consolidation of powder by HIP. However, each process produces differences in microstructure or introduces different defects in the parts. As a result, their mechanical properties are not necessarily identical. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>methods</b> should be developed which recognize and account for the differences...|$|R
