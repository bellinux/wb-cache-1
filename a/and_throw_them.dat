5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community. The neutral zone was in section Z, {{on the same side of}} the ground as the Liverpool fans. The two groups thus stood yards apart, separated only by chicken wire. At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> across the divide.|$|E
5|$|At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew {{is confronted}} by Barbossa {{and his men}} and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish {{suddenly}} arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the Queen Anne's Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena {{goes back to the}} dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed {{from the perspective of}} the player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A heads-up display at the bottom of the screen shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{this lack}} of large game, the Taíno people became very skilled fishermen. One {{technique}} was to hook a remora, {{also known as a}} suckerfish, to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the course of this battle that Keysor {{performed}} the actions that led to him receiving the Victoria Cross. Early in the morning on 6 August 1915 the 1st Battalion carried out a diversionary attack at Lone Pine and after heavy fighting that lasted almost the entire day they managed to capture the Turkish trenches. After this more fighting would continue around the position for the next three days as the Turks attempted to regain the position. The fighting was carried out at close range, using bayonets and improvised grenades and bombs. Over the course of about 50 hours on 7–8 August, Keysor continually risked his life to pick up the Turkish grenades as they were thrown into the trenches <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> back. Later, despite being wounded and ordered to seek medical attention, Keysor continued to remain in the line, volunteering to throw bombs for another company.|$|E

The player can also pick up the other {{character}} <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> in any direction, similar to barrels. The game also features [...] "Animal Friends", which returns from its predecessor. Playable animals include Squitter the spider, Glimmer the anglerfish, Rambi the rhino, Rattly the rattlesnake, Clapper the seal, Enguarde the swordfish and Squawks the parrot. These animals have unique abilities which the player can utilise, such as Rambi's ability to charge at enemies, Squawks' ability of flight, and Rattly's ability to jump extreme heights.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the character, Blizzard's Geoff Goodman said they crafted Doomfist as an [...] "ode {{to the fighting}} genre", both in his skill kit and in concept art. Though Blizzard tried to keep all of his attacks as melee, they found, as they had with Genji, that Doomfist needed some type of ranged attack to make him playable; an early attack had been a phantom punch {{that would have been}} launched from his fist. Doomfist had also be considered as a Tank class, but Blizzard did not want to make the mistake again of having a high-health character with powerful attacks as they had initially with Roadhog at the game's introduction. At one point during development, Doomfist {{would have been able to}} pick up enemies and use them as human shields or to throw them, but Blizzard dropped this as he was not supposed to be a wrestler or luchador, according to Goodman. They also dropped an ability for him to grab pieces of the ground <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them.</b> His ultimate ability was originally designed for Orisa, the character introduced prior to Doomfist.|$|E
500|$|The game's 'FreeFlow' {{combat system}} allows for basic attacks {{including}} strikes, counters, and dodging {{which can be}} combined to keep Batman attacking while moving between enemies and avoiding being attacked himself. Basic enemies include enemies armed with shields and shock batons, while others are armed with guns which significantly damage Batman. These enemies can perform a charge and tackle attack only used by larger enemies in previous games; precision timed dodging, and a batarang can instantly defeat some charging enemies. The system adds the ability to combine attacks on prone enemies without interrupting a combo streak. Batman can counter enemy attacks <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> into other enemies for increased damage. Batman is also capable of disarming enemies wielding items like baseball bats and using the acquired weapon on several foes before it breaks. Arkham Knight introduces [...] "Dual Play", in which players can seamlessly switch control of Batman {{to one of his}} allies: Robin, Nightwing or Catwoman while in FreeFlow Combat, which the player enters when they have accumulated an uninterrupted combat streak. Each successful, uninterrupted attack adds to the player's combat score, which carries over between each controlled character and unlocks double-team takedowns on opponents at higher scores.|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} was a Three Way match for what ring {{announcer}} Jeremy Borash {{described as the}} [...] "TNA X Division Championship of the World", in which then-champion Christopher Daniels defended against the challengers A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe. Its duration was 22 minutes and 50 seconds. The match began with Joe and Styles double teaming Daniels, with the two engaging in a kicking competition against Daniels' back to see who could kick the hardest. While Daniels and Joe stood at ringside, Styles used the ropes to slingshot himself {{up into the air}} where he performed a backflip onto both competitors in what Styles' named the Shooting Styles Press. Later back in the ring, Daniels grabbed Styles and fell backwards in the process causing Styles to flip overhead towards Joe. Styles landed on Joe's shoulders and quickly fell backwards, flipping Joe forward. A few minutes later, Joe held Daniels in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold, which was broken when Styles ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform his signature Spiral Tap aerial technique, landing onto Daniels and Joe. Afterwards, Styles and Daniels fought {{on the top of a}} turnbuckle, with Joe ascending as well in order to lift up both <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> off in a suplex. Joe followed by performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on Styles, forcing him back and neck-first into the mat. Daniels then attempted to hit Joe with the TNA X Division Title belt, which Joe countered into a powerslam. Daniels then followed by kicking the belt into the side of Joe's head. Styles eventually gained the pinfall on Daniels after countering Daniels' signature Angel's Wings maneuver into a bridging pin to win the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} followers, {{estimated}} by Prince at 500 but by his critics at one {{fifth of the}} number, were gathered together, and it was given out by [...] "Beloved" [...] or [...] "The Lamb" [...] (the names by which the Agapemonites designated their leader) that his disciples must divest themselves of their possessions <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> into the common stock. This was done, even by the poor, all of whom {{looked forward to the}} speedy end of the present dispensation and were content, for the short remainder of this world, to live in common and, while not repudiating earthly ties, to treat them as purely spiritual. With the money thus obtained the house at Spaxton that was to become the [...] "Abode of Love" [...] was enlarged and furnished luxuriously, and the three Nottidge sisters, who contributed £6,000 each, were immediately married to three of Prince's nearest disciples. Agnes, the eldest of the Nottidge sisters, objected to the spiritual marriage which entailed a celibate life and, as one writer reports, became pregnant by another member of the community; however, it is unlikely that she committed adultery because her husband never accused her, and she later gained sole custody of their child in 1850 after proving herself of good moral character before a court. Agnes wrote to her younger sister Louisa warning her not to come to Spaxton. Despite this Louisa travelled to Somerset to join them. Her mother Emily feared the spiritual and financial influence that Prince had established over her daughters. Emily instructed her son Edmund, her nephew Edward Nottidge, and her son-in-law, Frederick Ripley, to travel down to Somerset and to rescue her unmarried daughter, Louisa after her arrival. The three men succeeded in removing Louisa against her will in November 1846, and imprisoned her in 12 Woburn Place, a villa by Regents Park.|$|E

In February 1998, three men accused of sodomy were taken to the base of a mud and brick wall, which was then toppled over onto them by a tank. A similar death sentence for two men occurred in March 1998. Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Hassan, was reported to say, [...] "Our religious scholars are not agreed on the right kind of punishment for homosexuality.

2500|$|To {{the use of}} {{lots and}} auguries, they are {{addicted}} beyond all other nations. Their method of divining by lots is exceedingly simple. From a tree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small pieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, <b>and</b> <b>throw</b> <b>them</b> at random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the community, if for the public the lots are consulted, or {{the father of a}} family about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the Gods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and having done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If the chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the same affair during the same day: even when they are inviting, yet, for confirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the known practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds. But to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions divine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same sacred woods and groves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly labour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest and the King, or the Chief of the Community, who both carefully observed his actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and assurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles, even by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods, and the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of divination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the nation with whom they are at war they contrive, it avails not how, to gain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from among themselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according as the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the whole.|$|E
