5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not be taken out of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E
50|$|In 1975 a Ganley F1 {{project was}} initiated. The Ganley-Cosworth 001 car was hand-built by Howden Ganley on his {{premises}} at Windsor. It was <b>almost</b> <b>readied,</b> and Ganley had two DFV engines at hand, {{but it never}} ran in anger. Ganley eventually used the equipment to start Tiga Race Cars with fellow driver Tim Schenken the following year.|$|R
50|$|Lazio {{appointed}} {{a new coach}} in Sven-Göran Eriksson, snatching the Swede from an <b>almost</b> <b>readied</b> contract with Blackburn Rovers. Ex-Sampdoria man Eriksson brought playmaking secondary striker Roberto Mancini with him. In addition, he signed Vladimir Jugović and Alen Bokšić from Juventus, with Bokšić embarking on a second tenure at Lazio. Matias Almeyda also arrived at the club from Spanish side Sevilla, while wing-back Giuseppe Pancaro, signed from Cagliari, also {{proved to be a}} key player.|$|R

5|$|Miličević {{began playing}} in bands around Troy {{in the late}} 1990s. He co-founded the group Morphic with some friends in 2000. The band first {{operated}} under the name Loki, before settling on its final name. By 2001, the group performed gigs at small Michigan venues and clubs, and recorded a number of demo tracks. The following year, Miličević left the band and was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to quit his musical career. However, during this period, manager Arthur Spivak, who had previously met Miličević at a showcase concert with Morphic, told him about an audition for Thirty Seconds to Mars. Miličević then {{decided to move to}} Los Angeles where he had a successful audition with Thirty Seconds to Mars, replacing guitarist Solon Bixler. By 2003, the band consisted of Miličević, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Jared Leto, drummer Shannon Leto, and bassist Matt Wachter. The new line-up debuted on The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn in February 2003.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decision}} to undertake Operation Tungsten {{was made in}} mid-March {{on the basis of}} a decrypted radio message that indicated that Tirpitz was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> for combat and would conduct high-speed trials on 1 April. As a result of the delays to the operation, the sailing of the attack force coincided with the departure of Convoy JW 58 for the Soviet Union. It was hoped that if German forces spotted the British fleet it would be assumed that the warships were supporting the convoy. As part of the final preparations for the attack a full-scale rehearsal was conducted using the training range at Loch Eriboll on 28 March. From 1 April onwards, the Admiralty received hourly weather reports from a group of Norwegian Secret Intelligence Service agents in Alta, near Kaafjord.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

The main objective was to bring a simple practical solution to the dron, which will correspond to the current functional and aesthetic standards of industrial design in the aircraft industry. Whole concept of the dron is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. Thanks to its simplicity, small dimensions and dron structure, it takes a minimal transport space and is <b>almost</b> instantly <b>ready</b> for use...|$|R

25|$|In 1991, {{freelance}} writer Danny Casolaro (among others) {{claimed to be}} <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to expose the alleged October surprise conspiracy, when he suddenly died a violent death in a hotel bathtub in Martinsburg, WVA, raising suspicions. He appeared to be traveling on leads for his investigation into the Inslaw Affair. His death was ruled a suicide.|$|E

Recently, it has been confirmed that several species of snake are fully viviparous, such as the boa constrictor and green anaconda, nourishing their young through a placenta {{as well as a}} yolk sac, which is highly unusual among reptiles, or anything else outside of requiem sharks or placental mammals. Retention of eggs and live birth are most often associated with colder environments.|$|E
60|$|But Dan {{was past}} that. Afterward {{he said his}} grip was locked. He held, and not another foot did the {{swordfish}} get. Again I leaned over the gunwale.

5000|$|Principal {{photography}} {{lasted about}} five months, and, according to McElwee, [...] "I'd guess {{the total amount}} of footage I actually shot was about 25 hours." [...] The total [...] "filming time" [...] could be considered much more substantial, however: [...] "I was <b>almost</b> always <b>ready</b> to shoot. I kept the camera within reaching distance, sometimes balanced on my shoulder...even between major portraits, when I was on the road, I was totally open to filming whatever might happen in a gas station or in a restaurant, or wherever. So in one sense you can count all that time as 'filming time'." ...|$|R
60|$|Betsey, too, {{a spoiled}} child, trained up {{to think the}} {{alphabet}} her greatest enemy, left {{to be with the}} servants at her pleasure, and then encouraged to report any evil of them, she was <b>almost</b> as <b>ready</b> to despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan's temper she had many doubts. Her continual disagreements with her mother, her rash squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at least so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no means without provocation, she feared the disposition that could push them to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any repose to herself.|$|R
25|$|In February 2012, {{a source}} {{revealed}} that DRDO was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> for the test, {{but there were}} scheduling and logistical issues since the missile was to traverse halfway across the Indian Ocean. Countries like Indonesia and Australia as well as international air and maritime traffic in the test zone had to be alerted 7– 10 days before the test. Moreover, Indian Navy warships, with DRDO scientists and tracking and monitoring systems, were to be positioned midway and near the impact point in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of construction, a number of {{problems}} came up, including structural issues, a shortage of manpower, and the disobedience of workers. Excavation of the ditches and the initial stages of construction were largely complete by June 1752, and work on the fort proper began in October of the same year. The fort was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> by 1757, and it was fully completed in the early 1760s. The fort quickly fell into disrepair, being described as a ruin in 1789. Some minor repair works were carried out in 1796.|$|E
25|$|To {{throw off}} the press and keep his {{intentions}} hidden, Rickey got heavily involved in Gus Greenlee's newest foray into black baseball, the United States League. Greenlee started the league in 1945 {{as a way to}} get back at the owners of the Negro National League teams for throwing him out. Rickey saw the opportunity as a way to convince people that he was interested in cleaning up blackball, not integrating it. In midsummer 1945, Rickey, <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> with his Robinson plan, pulled out of the league. The league folded after the end of the 1946 season.|$|E
60|$|Grant fancied {{that it was}} {{not without}} a purpose his {{companion}} checked her horse to let the others come up, and, though it cost him an effort, acquiesced. His laugh was <b>almost</b> as <b>ready</b> as that of the rest as they rode on four abreast, until at last the lights of Cedar Range blinked beside the bluff. Then, they grew suddenly silent again as Muller, who it seemed remembered that he had been taught by the franc tireurs, rode past them with his rifle across his saddle. They pulled up when his figure cut blackly against the sky on the crest of a rise, and Hetty's laugh was scarcely light-hearted.|$|R
5000|$|Official {{tests were}} satisfactory, and in 1938 the Polish Air Force ordered 200 {{aircraft}} {{of the production}} variant LWS-3A Mewa (or [...] "Mewa A").

In August 1939, about 30 aircraft were <b>almost</b> completed (10 <b>ready,</b> but lacking propellers, 7 in painting and 10 in final assembly).|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{with the}} second album <b>almost</b> {{completed}} and <b>ready</b> to release, they decided to rename the album to avoid a court hearing by another band.

25|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} home season in 1999–2000, taking his first Test five-for against Zimbabwe in Jamaica. Two months later, after {{setting up a}} tight win over Pakistan, he and Franklyn Rose seemed <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> to succeed Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. But both fell away during the 2000 tour of England, where King {{was said to be}} troubled by a heel injury. An introverted character and a genuine No. 10, King was a forgotten man for four years, until he was recalled for the home series against South Africa in 2004–05, when a raft of leading players were sidelined by a contract dispute.|$|E
25|$|It was Blue Byte's {{desire to}} improve upon any {{aspects of the}} first game which they felt didn't work which led to Thomas Häuser {{becoming}} project manager. When the first game was in development, Häuser was newly employed by Blue Byte, and had done quality assurance work on it. In this capacity, {{he had made a}} list of possible gameplay improvements for the developers, who told him {{there was no time to}} implement his changes, as the game was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> for release. However, they had been impressed with his ideas, and, when the second game was greenlit, they suggested he apply his ideas to this game. This ultimately led to Häuser, a programmer by trade, working as the lead designer on the sequel.|$|E
25|$|The project PZL.50 (or PZL P.50) {{and named}} Jastrząb (Hawk), started in late 1936. The design was {{accepted}} by the Air Force Command in 1937 and two prototypes were ordered. In June 1938, 300 Mercury VIII engines were also ordered for the PZL, {{the first to be}} delivered in June 1939. The engine for the prototype was imported from Great Britain and fitted in September 1938. The prototype was <b>almost</b> <b>ready</b> by October, but its completion was delayed by the lack of a retractable landing gear, delivered by the British Dowty firm. Due to the delay, the Polish aviation authorities missed the chance of starting flying tests with some temporary fixed landing gear, since Polish industry had not yet produced suitable retractable gears. Avia-manufactured undercarriage units were specified for the production series.|$|E
