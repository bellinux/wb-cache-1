5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of his large works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E
5|$|With hostility towards reform growing, {{the poor}} results, and Kosygin's reformist stance, {{led to a}} popular {{backlash}} against him. Kosygin lost most of the privileges he had enjoyed before the reform, but Brezhnev {{was never able to}} remove him from the office of Chairman of the Council of Ministers, despite his weakened position. In the aftermath of his failed reform, Kosygin spent {{the rest of his life}} improving the economic administration through the modification of targets; he implemented various programmes to improve food security and ensure the future intensification of production. There is no proof to back up the claim that the reform itself contributed to the high growth seen in the late-1960s, and that its cancellation had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stagnating growth of the economy which began in the 1970s.|$|E

Rather, they both had a love of prize {{fighting}} and {{used to go to}} boxing matches together, engaging in jocose discussion of the relative merits of Negro with Jewish pugilists. They would occasionally wager a bottle of whisky on these bouts.|$|E

25|$|Welland's {{original}} script also featured, {{in addition}} to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.|$|E
25|$|In {{retaliation}} for the attack, {{a few days later}} Frémont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the Klamath Lake massacre. The entire village was razed and at least 14 men, women and children were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> previous attack.|$|E
25|$|Hodgson {{joined the}} University of London's Officers' Training Corps. Refusing to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sea despite his {{experience}} and Third Mate's certificate, {{he received a}} commission as a Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge, and returned to writing.|$|E

25|$|Upon his arrest, Andersen {{initially}} denied having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> murders, {{even when}} confronted with DNA evidence. Moments later, when lead interrogator Geir Hansen suggested that Andersen himself could be a victim in the case, Andersen delivered a full confession, naming 21-year-old Viggo Kristiansen as his accomplice. As a result, police immediately arrested Kristiansen. The two suspects were close friends, {{had served in the}} military Home Guard together and had been seen by witnesses near the crime scene {{on the day of the}} murders.|$|E
25|$|The Dalai Lama {{denied that}} his {{government}} had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Olympic protests {{and said that}} he did not advocate a boycott of the games. He called on demonstrators to refrain from any violence, and gave interviews clarifying that his goals were not currently to seek independence from China. The Dalai Lama threatened to resign over TPUM disobedience to the official policy of non-violence and genuine Tibetan autonomy. In the end, international pressure finally led PRC representatives to renew unofficial talks with their Dharmsala counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Bagri {{would later}} state before his later trial {{that he knew}} was {{probably}} a suspect by October 1985 but insisted he would have faced charges {{if there were any}} evidence he had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bombing. It was established by November that it was a man with a Sikh name who probably checked the bag in Vancouver that caused the crash. Parmar was not seen in Canada sometime after late 1986, as authorities believed him to be living in Pakistan where he continued operations against India.|$|E

25|$|Cockburn {{commanded}} {{a squadron of}} warships for the landings in Walcheren in July 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. He took command of the third-rate HMS Implacable {{off the coast of}} Spain in January 1810 and sailed to Quiberon Bay with a small squadron whose mission was to arrange the escape of the King of Spain, whom the French had imprisoned at the Château de Valençay. The mission failed when Ferdinand refused to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British. Cockburn was promoted to commodore, hoisting his broad pennant in the fourth-rate HMS Grampus in November 1811.|$|E
25|$|In early January 2008, protesters marched {{from the}} Minnesota State Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center {{in hopes of}} {{securing}} a protest permit. The Saint Paul Police Department authorized the event, but only approved the permit through July 2008. On February 8 and February 9, 2008, antiwar protesters attended a weekend conference at the University of Minnesota to discuss the protests and antiwar rally. On February 28, 2008, the Associated Press (AP) reported that the police department adopted new guidelines for the investigation of protest groups. The police department said that this did not have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> convention.|$|E
25|$|It seems {{unlikely}} from the workmanship that the well's stone and 'cross' have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> old chapel, but {{one possibility is}} that it came from over the entrance door to Laigh Chapelton as the custom was for a Templar property to have the 'cross' symbol of the order displayed in such a fashion. On the other hand it could have been made for the Chapelton (old) House to associate the building with the Christian history of the site. The stone is unusually thick and has been clearly reworked to pass a spout through it.|$|E

25|$|Until 1914, the American {{judicial}} system, {{including the}} Supreme Court of the United States, largely followed the precepts of English common law {{when it came}} to matters dealing with the validity of introducing evidence in criminal trials. In most cases, the general philosophy was that the process by which the evidence was obtained had little, if <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> permissibility of its use in court. The only limiting factor was that the police agents could not break the law to seize the evidence; however, since what is now illegal seizure was then permitted by the courts, it rarely presented a significant challenge.|$|E
25|$|During the trial, a {{mattress}} {{was presented to}} court, supposedly stained with Anwar's semen. This was submitted as DNA evidence of Anwar's sexual acts. Anwar denied having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> mattress, although the DNA tests came out positive. Lim Kong Boon, a DNA chemist, testified during the trial that DNA taken from 10 of 13 semen stains on the mattress matched Anwar's DNA. The defence team implied that DNA samples may have been taken from Anwar, while unconscious, after his beating in police custody, to create false forensics evidence to frame Anwar; however, High Court Judge Augustine Paul accepted that DNA evidence.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt {{tried to do the}} next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E

25|$|Religious {{communities}} or {{branches that}} had their headquarters outside the country, {{such as the}} Jesuit and Franciscan orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden to have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> education of the young, because {{that had been made}} the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and they were also prohibited from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals. Although there were tactical variations in Enver Hoxha's approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. From 1945 to 1953, the number of priests was drastically reduced and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that the project was joined by both the US Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. The project was still top secret at this time, and little actual {{information}} was shared, especially with the Coast Guard. The Canadian liaison was required, as ideal siting for the stations would require several stations in various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. One site in Nova Scotia {{proved to be a}} battle; the site was owned by a fisherman whose domineering teetotaler wife was dead set against having <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sinful Navy men. When the site selection committee of J.A. Waldschmitt and Lt. Cdmr. Argyle were discussing the matter with the husband, a third visitor arrived and he offered the men cigarettes. They refused, and the hostess then asked if they drank. When they said they did not, the land was quickly secured.|$|E
25|$|Postal {{history has}} become a philatelic {{collecting}} speciality in its own right. Whereas traditional philately {{is concerned with the}} study of the stamps per se, including the technical aspects of stamp production and distribution, philatelic postal history refers to stamps as historical documents; similarly re postmarks, postcards, envelopes and the letters they contain. Postal history can include the study of postal rates, postal policy, postal administration, political effects on postal systems, postal surveillance and the consequences of politics, business, and culture on postal systems; basically <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> function of the collection, transportation and delivery of mail. The specialized area of philatelic history defines postal history as the study of rates charged for postal services provided, routes followed and special handling of letters. Areas of special interest include disrupted or transitional periods, such as wars and military occupations, and mail to remote areas.|$|E
