40|$|Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), {{which is}} {{available}} in different degrees of substitution and viscosity designations, {{is one of the}} most commonly used cellulosic polymers in aqueous film coating. It is relatively easy to process due to its non-tacky nature and has been known to produce smooth and clear films. For aqueous film coating, it is cost effective to use a coating formulation containing a high concentration of polymer without affecting the viscosity or spray rate and compromising on the quality of the film coat. Hence, it is ideal to use a polymer of low viscosity grade. The rheological properties of HPMC with various viscosity grades were determined. It was found that HPMC Methocel E 3 had the lowest viscosity and was the least affected by the increase in polymer concentration. Additives can modify the film properties, including the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer. Glass transition temperature influences the viscosity of the coating solution and the mechanical properties, adhesion and permeability of the film coat. Various concentrations of different additives were incorporated in HPMC formulations to study the effect on these properties. Some long-chain fatty acids were included in the study to investigate if their hydrophobic carbon chains could retard moisture permeation of HPMC films. It was observed that HPMC films containing water-soluble additives produce films with clarity similar to those without additives, whereas those with hydrophobic additives tend to be patchy or hazy in appearance. A vinyl pyrrolidone / vinyl acetate copolymer (S 630) was investigated for its influence on HPMC films, comparing the results with a commonly used plasticizer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and another copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Intrinsic properties of the solutions, such as viscosity and glass transition temperature, were evaluated. The effect of S 630 on the film properties, such as physical appearance, surface roughness, moisture permeation and mechanical properties, as well as its ability to promote better adhesion of the film coat to the core surface, were compared. S 630 was found to be effective both as a film-former and plasticizer, reducing the glass transition temperature and viscosity, but enhancing the tensile strength, elongation and work of failure of the cast film. The water vapour permeability was slightly increased but not to the same extent as with polyethylene glycol PEG). A 10 % concentration of this copolymer increased the adhesive strength and toughness of the HPMC film coat. Aqueous film coating was carried out in the ultra-coater, using HPMC coating formulations containing 8 % w/w of solids, without or with 10 % concentration (based on dry weight of total solids) of the additives, PEG, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and S 630, for coating the tablets. Capsule-shaped lactose tablet cores of specific surface area, hardness, weight, friability and disintegration time were used to study the process variables. Process variables, including air flow rate, temperature and humidity, coating application rate or pump flow rate, <b>atomising</b> <b>air</b> pressure and speed of the rotating disk, were investigated in order to obtain the optimum operating conditions for these solutions. It was found that the process parameters were similar for all the coating formulations containing 8 % solid. The additives used in the coating formulations had little influence on the coating process. The ultra-coater was an effective unit for the aqueous film coating of tablets with a batch size of not less than 5 kg...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of spray nozzle internal geometry on heat transfer performance and the resultant power requirements. An experimental apparatus was designed and built, which allowed for close control of the heat transfer from air to water and the required energy for droplet production. The apparatus allowed for simultaneous measurements of heat transfer rate from the gas to the spray droplets and the pumping power requirements for the sprayed liquid. A spray chamber was constructed {{in the form of}} a Perspex cylinder, 372 mm internal diameter and 372 mm height, mounted on its vertical axis. Thermocouples, humidity sensors, and pressure sensors were used to measure the temperature difference of the air and water, the humidity difference of the air, and the pressure drop across the nozzle. The spray nozzles have been installed at the centre of the upper cover plate directed along the cylinder axis. The heat and mass transfer process was carried out in a counter current flow. Two different nozzle designs were the subject of this investigation. The pressure swirl nozzle works on liquid pressure alone. Droplet formation and size is influenced by changes of the internal geometry and liquid pressure. An effervescent two fluid atomiser with internal mixing was tested. The influence of changes in gas bubble and exit orifice geometry on droplet size and formation was investigated. Analysis of the heat transfer process is based on the energy balance for the whole cylinder. This analysis allows for the determination of the nozzle with the best performance characteristics. From the required energy to produce the droplets and the rate of heat transfer, a new equation for the index of energy performance, was defined. A Laser Doppler Analyser was used to determine the droplet size and velocity for the low pressure nozzles and this data was compared with the existing theory. The droplet distribution of the spray nozzles was determined for various configuration. The measured droplet size was below the calculated droplet size using the derived equations from the literature. Photographs of the spray angle at different liquid pressures were taken for digital analysis. The spray angle showed reasonable agreement with the literature. A three dimensional numerical model was designed to simulate the heat transfer process inside the spray chamber using PHOENICS, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. The software modelled the heat and mass transfer inside the spray chamber. This model then allowed for the testing of different droplet distributions, formations, and their influence on the heat transfer process. In order to validate the results, the necessary variables such as the gas mass flow, liquid mass flow rate, droplet size, spray angle and scatter, hot air inlet temperature, were obtained from the experimental data. The result of the simulation is the air outlet temperature and humidity of the spray chamber. The internal 3 D flow field is solved with the Lagrangian and Eulerian equation including the disturbance, solved with the k-epsilon turbulence model, created by the spray droplets. Four different pressure swirl configurations were simulated. Every configuration had five different pressure points. Every pressure point was simulated individually in order to find out if the numerical simulation software was able to predict the correct result for different liquid mass flow rates without altering the boundary setting and parameters. The heat transfer process was found to depend on the droplet size and distribution produced by the spray nozzle. A comparison of the experimental data with the simulation results demonstrated the accuracy of the CFD model. The temperature accuracy was ± 5. 9 % and for the humidity ± 12 % on average for all simulations. It was found that the heat transfer of the effervescent atomiser depends on the mass ALR and that the highest heat transfer was measured when it was operating with an ALR of 0. 1. The tested effervescent atomiser was found to be strongly influenced by the <b>atomising</b> <b>air,</b> an effectiveness of 93 % achieved. The change of the internal geometries had no significant influence on the heat transfer rates. The change of the internal geometry, especially the exit orifice diameter, had a strong influence on the pressure swirl nozzle performance, which started at 85 % and reached a maximum of 95 %. It was found that the pressure requirement for the 4. 7 mm exit orifice was only 20 % of the pressure requirement of the 2. 5 mm exit orifice in order to achieve the same cooling performance. The pressure swirl needed for all flow rates approximately 20 times less energy to achieve the same cooling as the effervescent nozzle...|$|E
