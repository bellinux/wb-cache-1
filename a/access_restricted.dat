2500|$|Portions of {{the club}} used only for the {{operation}} and maintenance typically have <b>access</b> <b>restricted</b> to staff and performers. These include (but are not limited to) management offices, employee booths, performer dressing rooms, and service areas, such as the kitchen and behind the bar. [...] This business practice does not differ significantly from what is seen in other customer service businesses such as retail stores and restaurants. [...] More frequently seen booths are entry booths, where security staff monitor customers entering and leaving the club and collect the cover charge, and the DJ booth, where the DJ operates. The DJ booth contains sound, lighting, and other equipment {{which is used to}} [...] "orchestrate the crowd" [...] by adjusting the club environment, and is equivalent to a control room in a traditional theater.|$|E

40|$|Many {{policymakers and}} some {{behavioral}} models hold that <b>restricting</b> <b>access</b> to expensive credit helps consumers by preventing overborrowing. I examine some effects of <b>restricting</b> <b>access,</b> using household panel survey data on payday loan users collected around {{the introduction of}} binding restrictions on payday loan terms in Oregon. Borrowing fell in Oregon relative to Washington, with former payday borrowers shifting partially into plausibly inferior substitutes: bank overdrafts and late bill payment. Additional evidence suggests that <b>restricting</b> <b>access</b> caused deterioration in the overall financial condition of Oregon households.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has on the}} basis of general equilibrium models warned that trade liberalisation in non-optimally managed renewable resources might cause over-exploitation and reduced steady-state welfare. Welfare effects of trade liberalisation in open access and optimal management are found case specific and dependent on factors such as the country's status as importer or exporter, the state of the fish stocks {{and the size of the}} countries on the world market. The present paper develops an alternative partial equilibrium framework capable of identifying welfare effects of fish trade liberalisation also in the presence of complex but realistic management schemes, such as regulated open <b>access</b> and regulated <b>restricted</b> <b>access.</b> The case dependency known from the general equilibrium analysis is confirmed, but the introduction of realistic fisheries management schemes in the partial equilibrium model extended this case dependency. The welfare effect of trade liberalisation in an exporter country is negative under open access, but was found positive under regulated <b>restricted</b> <b>access</b> in the present paper.
