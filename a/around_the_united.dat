5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the Kinetoscope cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E
