5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, people <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, women <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black people <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to examine social, economic, and health factors related to paid work in well-functioning older adults and if and how these factors vary by race. Method: We used sex-stratified {{logistic}} and multinomial logistic regression to examine cross-sectional data in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort study. The sample included 3, 075 community-dwelling Black (42 %) and White adults aged 70 to 79 at baseline. Results: Multinomial logistic regression analyses show Black men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work full-time, and Black women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work part-time. Men with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work full-time. Men with better physical functioning <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work full- and part-time. Women with ≥US$ 50, 000 family income and fewer chronic diseases <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work full-time. Women who were overweight and had fewer chronic diseases <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work part-time. Discussion: Results suggest that well-functioning, older Black adults <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to work than their White counterparts, and working relates to better health and higher income, providing support for a productive or successful aging perspective...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} subgroup sensitive {{physical activities}} using differential item functioning (DIF) analysis. Methods: A sub-unweighted sample of 1, 857 (males = 923 and females = 934) from the 2003 - 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Physical Activity (PA) questionnaire data {{was used for}} the analyses. Using Mantel-Haenszel, SIBTEST and ANOVA DIF methods, 33 specific leisure-time moderate and/or vigorous PA (MVPA) items were analyzed for DIF across race/ethnicity, gender, education, income and age groups. Results: Many leisure-time MVPA items were identified as large DIF items. When participating in the same amount of leisure-time MVPAs, non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in basketball and dance activities than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW); NHW <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participated in golf and hiking than NHB; Hispanics <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in dance, hiking and soccer than NHW whereas NHW <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in bicycling, golf, swimming, and walking than Hispanics; females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in aerobics, dance, stretching and walking than males whereas males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in basketball, fishing, golf, running, soccer, weightlifting and hunting than females; educated persons <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in jogging and treadmill exercise than less educated persons; persons with higher incomes <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in golf than those with lower incomes; and adults (20 - 59 yrs) <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in basketball, dance, jogging, running, and weightlifting than older adults (60 + yrs), whereas older adults <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to participate in walking and golf than younger adults. Conclusions: DIF methods are able to identify subgroup sensitive PAs, and thus provide useful information to help design group sensitive, targeted interventions for disadvantaged PA subgroups...|$|R
50|$|When {{it came to}} interacting, and {{actually}} spending time with children in commercials. Men were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than women to be with only boys.

Women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to not only <b>be</b> with <b>more</b> children in commercials, they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to take care of}} them as well. Compared to men’s 17.7%, women were 35.0% likely to be involved in some type of childcare activity (giving medicine, putting on bandages, etc.) in commercials. This finding was significant.

40|$|This {{research}} had two aims. Firstly, to examine availability of emotional support in chat rooms, and secondly, to investigate openness and dishonesty in chat rooms. Three {{hundred and twenty}} respondents (160 women and 160 men) filled out the ‘Chat Room Survey’.

Women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to give emotional support. Men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to than women to lie, and <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to lie about their socio-economic status. In contrast, women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to lie for safety reasons. This study challenges some past speculations about online relationships, and argues that future research must consider demographic details more when examining interactions on the Internet. ...|$|R

5|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior.

The researchers found lesions like those caused by stress fractures on a dromaeosaurid hand claw, one of only two such claw lesions discovered {{in the course of the}} study. Stress fractures in the hands have special behavioral significance compared to those found in the feet, since stress fractures there can be obtained while running or during migration.

5|$|In Western countries, {{the number}} of new episodes per year has been {{estimated}} to be between 0.89 and 1.89 cases per 100,000 people.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to osteoporosis, menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
