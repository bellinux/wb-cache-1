Typically the handle is an index or a pointer into a global array of tombstones.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Improvement {{in medical}} care for sickle cell patients, {{translating}} into improvement in survival, has created {{the need for an}} active and intentional process of transition from pediatric to adult oriented health care. Objective: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the perspectives of adolescents and young adults with sickle cell disease as they prepare to transition, and to evaluate their current health care knowledge base and skills. Methods: A sample of 18 pediatric sickle cell patients age 15 - 22 years were recruited from a comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. Two sections of a four part questionnaire containing open- and closed-ended questions were assessed in order to explore these patients’ expectations and concerns about the transition process, and to evaluate their self-management of sickle cell disease. Results: Themes identified from the open-ended questions include: 1) Apprehension to Leaving Pediatric Care, 2) Forming New Relationships with Adult Providers, 3) Growing Up and Responsibility, 4) Worries Regarding Readiness and Support, and 5) Active Role in Transition. Statistical analysis of the close-ended questions revealed that patients appeared to have similar levels of independence in performing skills related to “Knowledge of Health Issues/Diagnosis, “Being Prepared”, and “Taking Charge”. However, there was a significantly lower level of independence in skills related to “Preparing for Legal/Other Issues After Age 18 ”. Overall, level of independence/readiness seemed to not be influenced by patients’ age, gender, or disease type. Discussion: Patients’ expectations and concerns about transition were mostly related to issues regarding patients’ perceived readiness for transition and the amount of support and understanding they receive from various health care providers. Additionally, continued monitoring and <b>addressing</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> in which the patient states he/she needs assistance with to achieve independence will be essential in the transition process. Conclusions and Public Health Significance: Transition from pediatric to adult care providers is a crucial step in the care of individuals with sickle cell disease. By eliciting the expectations and concerns of these patients’ and evaluating their knowledge base and skills, we are able to gather further insight into barriers to transition, and begin to develop a plan to address these obstacles. ...|$|R

The messages are broken into categories, each with its own interrupt number, and most categories contain sub-categories, called [...] "functions" [...] and identified by [...] "function numbers". A BIOS client passes most information to BIOS in CPU registers, and receives most information back the same way, but data too large to fit in registers, such as tables of control parameters or disk sector data for disk transfers, is passed by allocating a buffer (i.e. some space) in memory and passing the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> the buffer in registers. (Sometimes multiple <b>addresses</b> <b>of</b> data <b>items</b> in memory may be passed in a data structure in memory, with the <b>address</b> <b>of</b> that structure passed to BIOS in registers.) The interrupt number is specified as the parameter of the software interrupt instruction (in Intel assembly language, an [...] "INT" [...] instruction), and the function number is specified in the AH register; that is, the caller sets the AH register to the number of the desired function. In general, the BIOS services corresponding to each interrupt number operate independently of each other, but the functions within one interrupt service are handled by the same BIOS program and are not independent.

40|$|AbstractThis paper <b>addresses</b> {{the problem}} <b>of</b> <b>items</b> {{exposure}} rate in computer adaptive testing {{and its relation}} with the structure <b>of</b> an <b>item</b> bank. An item is a structure defined by real and/or virtual components possibly containing text, image, audio and/or video elements, which are useful to build a context where a question is made about, and of diverse elements or mechanisms for information acquisition to provide an answer to this question. Every item has an associated difficulty that depends on how easy is {{to answer the question}} about the defined context. An item bank is a deposit of this kind of structures and, in this paper, the item bank structure is defined in terms of statistical indexes arising from the onedimensional Order Statistics Theory, namely, nearest neighbor index and the standard variate of normal curve; and another one from the concept of compactness of intervals of real numbers. In this sense, the work talks about items difficulty exposure rate assuming that the item bank is, in fact, defined by a finite discrete set <b>of</b> <b>items</b> difficulties. Therefore, the emphasis is given on the items difficulty and it is assumed that the number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> per difficulty in the item bank is unlimited. The experimental results are obtained through a simulation environment that takes into account the definition of the structure <b>of</b> an <b>item</b> bank, the definition of a testing subject and the definition <b>of</b> an <b>item</b> administration context. Therefore, the results are mainly experimental rather than theoretical, although the validation of the simulation environment is based on theoretical results of other authors in the field...|$|R

Cdterion-referenced item writing is centrally concemed with determining the content congruence and leamability <b>of</b> each <b>item's</b> content. Cut score dependability focuses on the consistency of decisions in repeated testing or the assessment of language leamer performances. A more general issue related to language program development also involves empirical rationalization of cut score decisions. In this case the issue is of determining the optimal index of gain score dependability in the pre-instruction and post-instruction approach to assessing the language learning gains.

Thc optimal index of gain score dependability is derived from examining the cut score dependability of the pre-instructional administration of the criterion-referenced test {{as well as the}} postinstructional criterion-referenced test, in relation to differences in the ratio of pre and post instruction variances.
