40|$|During a 10 -year period (1984 - 1994) 1229 stapes {{operations}} for otosclerosis were performed at our respective institutions by experienced surgeons well {{trained in the}} various techniques. Procedures included 691 stapedectomies, 234 small-fenestrae stapedotomies, and 304 revision operations. These primary and revision cases resulted in 20 ears with severe sensorineural hearing loss or <b>anacusis</b> noted during the immediate postoperative period. This article will critically evaluate those procedures that resulted in profound hearing loss and attempt to determine possible reasons for this occurrence. It is hoped that these data will allow surgeons to identify before and/or during surgery patients at risk for development of this complication and therefore decrease the overall morbidity rate of this exacting procedure...|$|E
40|$|Following {{vestibular}} schwannoma excision, {{a subset}} of cases {{has been reported in}} which hearing is present immediately after surgery, but is lost in the early postoperative period. Such cases have rarely been reported, and the postoperative audiological data collected from patients in these cases lacks the time resolution necessary to determine the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for the pattern of hearing loss. The present study aimed to more clearly define delayed hearing loss by collecting detailed data documenting changes in behavioural and electrophysiological auditory responses following vestibular schwannoma surgery. In particular, we aimed to use this data to determine the time course of changes in auditory function and to identify whether the site of impairment was cochlear or neural. Preoperative and daily postoperative monitoring of auditory function was performed in 19 patients undergoing vestibular schwannoma excision via the retrosigmoid approach at Christchurch Public Hospital. The pre- and postoperative assessment battery included pure-tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, tone decay, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurement. Intraoperative ABR was performed in four cases in which clear preoperative waveforms were present. Transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG) was carried out if wave I was lost in the early postoperative period. Thirteen of the 19 patients suffered immediate <b>anacusis</b> following surgery and six had measurable hearing postoperatively. The behavioural and electrophysiological data collected in each case is discussed with regard to the likely pathophysiology of pre- and postoperative hearing loss. No patients demonstrated behavioural evidence of delayed hearing loss, however a gradual deterioration of ABR in the early postoperative period was observed in Case 16. ECochG and DPOAEs in this case indicated the presence of cochlear function although the patient presented with immediate postoperative <b>anacusis</b> in the ipsilateral ear. These results are consistent with postoperative retrograde degeneration of the cochlear nerve...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} first case report of a labyrinthine artery aneurysmmasquerading as an {{internal}} auditory canal tumor. A 72 -year-old woman presented to the clinic with a 1 -week history of sudden onset right facial paralysis, right facial pain, hearing loss, and vertigo. On examination, she {{was found to have}} a dense right-sided facial paralysis involving all branches of the facial nerve, right facial hypoesthesia involv-ing all branches of the trigeminal nerve, no response to whispered voice in the right ear, and left beating horizontal nystagmus. The Weber tuning fork test demonstrated sound lateralization to the left, and the Rinne tuning fork test demonstrated no ability to discern sound over the right ear and right mastoid. Behavioral audiometry revealed a complete <b>anacusis</b> of the right ear. Radiographic Finding...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} {{the effect of}} intratympanic gentamicin as treatment of disabling vertigo secondary to a vestibular schwannoma in elderly patients. PATIENTS: Four elderly patients with a vestibular schwannoma, with an extrameatal diameter of less than 1 cm, experiencing disabling vertigo and followed a wait-and-scan policy. INTERVENTION: Intratympanic injection of gentamicin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjective improvement of {{quality of life and}} audiologic and vestibular assessment. RESULTS: We obtained a subjective improvement in {{the quality of life for}} all the 4 patients. In fact, disabling vertigo disappeared in all cases; 3 patients recovered their posttreatment unsteadiness after a period of vestibular rehabilitation, whereas one of them complained of persistent unsteadiness. The hearing remained unchanged in 3 patients, whereas in one, the pretreatment severe sensorineural hearing loss progressed to <b>anacusis.</b> CONCLUSION: This treatment represents an additional option in patients with small not-growing tumor affected by vestibular symptoms to be combined with a wait-and-scan policy. © 2013, Otology &Neurotology, Inc...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveOsteoma occurs almost {{exclusively}} {{in the head and}} neck region, only rarely developing into the internal auditory canal. We report an incidental finding of a case in the radiological evaluation of a patient with left hemifacial spasm. Patients and methodsA 79 -year-old woman consulted for left hemifacial spasm associated with left <b>anacusis.</b> Symptoms occurred up to 30  years prior to the first radiological investigations. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MRI) images were taken. ResultsMRI demonstrated a left internal auditory canal lesion with spontaneous hypointense signal on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. CT showed the lesion as a typically dense and opaque osteoma. It measured 0. 6 cm in maximum size. No surgery was performed because of the slow-growing features of the lesion. Clinical monitoring was recommended. ConclusionOsteomas are diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Our case was symptomatic and raised the question of surgical management. This article discusses the presentation and management associated with this exceptional osteoma location...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. Although {{hereditary}} neuropathy with {{liability to}} pressure palsies (HNPP) presents {{with a distinct}} phenotype on history, clinical exam, and nerve conduction studies, it may be masked if diagnostic work-up suggests other causes. Case Report. In a 37 -year-old male with pseudoradicular lumbar pain, neurological exam revealed sore neck muscles, peripheral facial nerve palsy, right <b>anacusis</b> and left hypoacusis, hemihypesthesia of the right face, mild distal quadriparesis, diffuse wasting, and generally reduced tendon reflexes. He {{had a history of}} skull fracture due to a gunshot behind the right ear and tuberculosis for which he had received adequate treatment for 3 years; MRI revealed a disc prolapse at C 6 / 7 and Th 11 / 12. Nerve conduction studies were indicative of demyelinating polyneuropathy with conduction blocks. Despite elevated antinuclear antibodies and elevated CSF-protein, HNPP was diagnosed genetically after having excluded vasculitis, CIDP, radiculopathy, and the side effects of antituberculous treatment. Conclusions. HNPP may manifest with mild, painless, distal quadriparesis. The diagnosis of HNPP may be blurred by a history of tuberculosis, tuberculostatic treatment, hepatitis, and the presence of elevated CSF-protein...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} haematological routine parameters and audiogram shapes in patients affected by sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL). Design: A retrospective study. All patients were divided into four groups according to the audiometric curve and mean values of haematological parameters (haemoglobin, white blood cell, neutrophils and lymphocytes relative count, platelet count, haematocrit, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen and neutrophil-to-lymphocite ratio) of each group were statistically compared. The prognostic role of blood profile and coagulation test was also examined. Study sample: A cohort of 183 SSNHL patients without comorbidities. Results: With a 48. 78 % of complete hearing recovery, individuals affected by upsloping hearing loss presented a better prognosis instead of flat (18. 36 %), downsloping (19. 23 %) and <b>anacusis</b> (2. 45 %) groups (p[*]=[*] 0. 0001). The multivariate analysis of complete blood count values revealed lower mean percentage of lymphocytes (p[*]=[*] 0. 041) and higher platelet levels (p[*]=[*] 0. 015) in case of downsloping hearing loss; {{with the exception of}} fibrinogen (p[*]=[*] 0. 041), none of the main haematological parameters studied resulted associated with poorer prognosis. Conclusions: Our work suggested a lack of association between haematological parameters and a defined audiometric picture in SSNHL patients; furthermore, only fibrinogen seems to influence the prognosis of this disease...|$|E

40|$|Some {{patients}} suffer {{hearing loss}} in the early postoperative period following vestibular schwannoma (VS) excision despite having intact hearing immediately after surgery. As this phenomenon has rarely been documented or described, the putative mechanism remains vague. The objective {{of the current study}} was to document the patterns of change in behavioural and electrophysiological responses in patients following VS surgery to better describe the phenomenon of delayed hearing loss. In particular, we aimed to determine whether the impairment that eventually leads to delayed hearing loss is neural or cochlear in origin. Auditory function was monitored in six adult patients who underwent surgery at Christchurch Public Hospital for excision of unilateral vestibular schwannoma through the retrosigmoid approach. Patients were assessed pre- and postoperatively by puretone audiometry, speech audiometry, tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), and auditory brainstem response (ABR). When measurable hearing was demonstrated postoperatively, pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry and ABR were assessed at 24 hour intervals following surgery. Transtympanic electrocochleography (ECochG) was carried out if wave I of the ABR was lost during the postoperative period. Postoperative monitoring revealed that 4 patients suffered permanent <b>anacusis</b> and the remaining 2 patients had permanent hearing preservation. There were no patients who experienced delayed hearing {{loss in the}} early postoperative period. A phenomenon similar to delayed hearing loss was observed in case 2 who demonstrated loss of ABR wave I on the 7 th postoperative day. Postoperative ECochG recorded in this case showed an enhanced negative SP on the operated side. The findings of this study are discussed in detail with particular reference to the underlying pathophysiology...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: First, {{to assess}} for the {{performance}} of the Carina placed on the round window at various European centers; second, to study the follow-up after 2 years and discuss limitations and technical issues; and finally, to further develop our understanding of the principles of acoustic transfer through the round window. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients were included in this retrospective study (7 women and 4 men) from 7 European tertiary referral hospitals (4 centers in France, 2 in Belgium, 1 in Spain). The mean age was 50. 8 years (35 - 71 yr). All patients have multiple previous surgeries (> 3 surgical procedures) for otosclerosis (3 patients) or chronic otitis media (8 patients), and in all cases, the stapes was not accessible due to obliteration by sclerotic tissue. Preoperative and postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, as well as aided and unaided thresholds and speech scores were measured. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative air-conduction and bone-conduction pure-tone averages. The average free field functional gain obtained with the implant ranged from 22 to 42 dB at each individual frequency, with a mean of 29 +/- 5 dB across all audiometric frequencies. Word recognition scores demonstrated significant differences between unaided and implant-aided conditions. Complications included 2 cases of postoperative infection (including 1 <b>anacusis)</b> that required explantation, and 1 case reduced initial benefit, followed by a nonfunctioning device. In 10 patients, postoperative hearing was unchanged. The 8 other patients are using their implant daily. CONCLUSION: These results show that this option is valid for patients with a fixed footplate and unsuccessful previous surgeries or patients who cannot benefit from a stapedotomy for anatomic reasons. In some cases, access to the round window membrane could represent a limitation. However, these promising initial results establish the need for further works with regard to 3 issues: 1) clinical data studies are needed, including a greater number of patients to confirm these preliminary results; 2) a long-term follow-up must be performed to detect any possible cochlear adverse effects, in particular, on the basilar membrane; 3) the effect of fascia interposition and tip size has to be evaluated in experimental studies.

40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste estudo é o de identificar as diversas causas que nos obrigam a novo procedimento cirúrgico. Apesar de várias alterações técnicas como platinectomia total, platinectomia parcial, interposição óssea, fenestra na platina e o emprego de vários tipos de próteses, os problemas continuam a existir, talvez também pelo pouco treinamento feito pelos residentes nos Centros Universitários, onde o número de cirurgias estapedianas vem caindo ano a ano, o que leva à pouca experiência destes residentes em sua vida futura. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Avaliação Retrospectiva. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Baseou-se em 74 casos de revisões de estapedectomia, {{realizadas}} em 68 pacientes, sendo 47 ouvidos submetidos à primeira revisão e 4 ouvidos submetidos à uma segunda revisão, todos operados anteriormente pelo autor, de uma população de 725 estapedectomias realizadas na clínica privada e 282 estapedectomias realizadas no Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro (HUAP) - Universidade Federal Fluminense/Niterói-RJ, de julho de 1980 a junho de 1999. Acrescentamos mais 21 casos operados de primeira revisão e de 2 casos operados de segunda revisão oriundos de outros serviços. RESULTADOS: Considerando todos os casos de revisões cirúrgicas realizadas, os ganhos auditivos obtidos foram os seguintes: em 78, 3 % dos pacientes os ganhos auditivos alcançados foram de até 20 dB; em 10, 8 % dos pacientes de 20 dB a 25 dB; em 8, 2 % dos pacientes acima de 25 dB, tendo ocorrido anacusia em 2, 7 % dos pacientes. A avaliação auditiva incluiu o limiar aéreo-ósseo de 250 a 8000 Hz com a discriminação vocal e o SRT, sendo que nas freqüências de 500, 1000 e 2000 Hz os limiares das vias aérea e óssea foram calculados através dos audiogramas realizados nos pré e pós-operatórios. Os resultados auditivos pós-operatórios dependem da afecção cirúrgica encontrada, principalmente pela presença ou ausência da bigorna e pela reobliteração óssea na janela do vestíbulo. Fizemos o acompanhamento audiológico de todos os ouvidos operados após seis meses da cirurgia e de sessenta e seis ouvidos operados com um ano de cirurgia e com oito pacientes não retornando ao segundo exame. AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study is to identify the various reasons for a new surgical procedure to be decided on. In spite of several technical alterations, such as total platinectomy, partial platinectomy, bone interposition, fenestration in the footplate and the use of different types of prosthesis, there are still many problems concerning the improvement of impaired hearing, partly due to insufficient training of resident doctors at the University Centers, where the number of stapedial surgeries has been decreasing year after year. This creates a situation in which our resident doctors have little opportunity to gain experience in this area. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was based on 74 cases of revision stapedectomy, performed in 68 patients, being that 47 ears were submitted to revision and all of them have been previously operated on by the first author above mentioned, out of a population of 725 stapedectomies performed at Antonio Pedro University Hospital (HUAP) Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UFF) / Niterói-RJ, from July 1980 to June 1999. We added 21 more cases of revision surgery originated elsewhere. As far as obliteration of the oval window was concerned, for which cutting drills were used, there were 04 cases of variable sensorineural hearing loss and 02 cases of <b>anacusis.</b> The cases of vertigo and / or loss of balance with possible perilymphatic fistula were solved by means of replacement of the long prosthesis by a smaller one, the vertigo and/or loss of balance being thus eliminated. We conducted the audiologic follow-up of all operated ears 06 months after the surgery and of 66 operated ears, 08 patients had not undergone a second examination 01 year after. Auditory postoperative results depend on the surgical pathology found, {{not only because of the}} presence or absence of the incus but also because of the osseous reobliteration of the oval window. CONCLUSION: Considering all revisionsurgery cases, the auditory gains obtained were the following: for 78. 3 % of the patients, the auditory threshold was as low as 20 db, for 10. 8 % of the patients, it ranged from 20 dB to 25 dB, and for 8. 2 % of the patients, it was only above 25 %; there was <b>anacusis</b> in 2. 7 % of the patients. The standard audiologic evaluation included pure tone threshold for air and bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz, speech recognition threshold and speech discrimination score. The PTA at 500, 1000 and 2000 was calculated for air and bone curves from both preoperative and postoperative audiograms...|$|E
