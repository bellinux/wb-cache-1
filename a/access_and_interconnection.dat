The network's links, which may be generated by vertical and/or horizontal relations, or by more complex morphologies, may explain the transition between dynamic equilibria and the instability of economic aggregates. Moreover, networks shape strategic interaction among agents by determining their strategies; the problem of <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection,</b> particularly relevant in the Internet, is perhaps the best example.

40|$|Purpose – The study aims {{to analyze}} {{the extent to which}} {{economic}} theories of network industries could anticipate the behavior of regulators regarding the promotion of network <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> policies in telecommunication markets. Methodology/approach/design – The paper first analyzes the main economic arguments for regulating network industries, in order to highlight the regulatory metalinguistics they contain. Then, the study indicates some critiques to economic rationality addressed by Public Interest Theories of Regulation. At last, it verifies how well economic theories of network industries explain IP interconnection policies recently developed in two European countries, namely, France and Germany. Findings – European regulator's decisions of imposing IP interconnection obligations on fixed network operators suggest that regulatory intervention on such fields is strongly influenced by non-economic values, such as effective competition and technological neutrality...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of electric power markets, the requirements of open <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> of power grids, more and more mid and long term instability accidents due to cascading failures are observed in large interconnected power systems. In order to improve frequency slow dynamics stability and security of interconnected power systems and to prevent viability crisis under large and cascaded disturbances, a novel time simulation model for frequency slow dynamics of interconnected power systems is developed in this paper with the assumption of uniform frequency in each area and the particular consideration of the respective dynamics of each area frequency simultaneously and corresponding interaction. In this model, the area center of inertia (COI) dynamics, speed governor and rotor dynamics and frequency-dependant load models are considered. The simulation algorithm is then presented.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of the Internet marketplace and the business relationships of key players involved in network services provision. A brief overview of existing pricing policies and research work in this area is presented and some new issues are introduced. We believe that the role of information asymmetry is critical when considering agreements for Internet <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection.</b> In negotiation and contract preparation, information asymmetry gives rise to adverse selection. The current structure of connectivity agreements does not address information asymmetries thus allowing the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in the form of moral hazard. Inasmuch as interconnection agreements involve sharing and/or exchanging network resources, either party will tend to exploit the agreement to its own advantage (i. e. conserving its own resources) and, possibly, {{to the detriment of the}} other (i. e. over-utilising the other’s resources). The discussion focuses on interconnection agreements between Internet Service Providers, namely peering and transit. The paper concludes with an outline of an incentive compatible mechanism that can sustain quality of service requirements in interconnection agreements. 1...|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} in {{regulatory}} economics the incentive that a vertically integrated company in the telecommunications sector, owning a local and a long distance network, has to deny (or charge a very high price for) interconnecting competitors in the long distance market in its local loop bottleneck or even supply a poor interconnection quality. This occurred in the US telecommunications market, given the dependence of the new long distance competitors (MCI and Sprint) on the AT&T local networks to connect with end users. Aiming to avoid these problems and introduce competition {{at least in the}} long distance segment, the telecom reform in Brazil followed closely the US antitrust experience in the AT&T divestiture of 1984, reducing the previous verticalization of the state-owned company TELEBRAS before privatization. There is an extensive economic literature on the idea of vertical foreclosure. Most of this literature concentrate on the idea of a vertical merger between firms in the downstream and upstream markets generating foreclosure.

40|$|To address {{situations}} where commercial negotiations about <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> fail, the Common Regulatory Framework requires {{national regulatory authorities}} (NRAs) to have power to resolve disputes between providers. The NRA can impose proportionate obligations. Describing dispute resolution as either a form of regulation {{in its own right}} or as simple adjudication is likely to mislead without some analysis of what is meant. There may be a tendency, when the NRA is resolving a dispute, to reflect an interventionist regulatory approach but there are markets that have effective competition and in which the regulator may properly tend towards resolving a dispute towards the adjudication end of the spectrum with a less interventionist approach. This paper reflects on principles that have been applied in the UK and on experience in appeals to and beyond the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Because the task of judges is to tackle the grounds of appeal raised before them, courts do not provide a comprehensive guide to NRAs as to how to handle the wide range of issues that can arise.

40|$|Internet Service Providers {{compete for}} {{customers}} while exchanging traffic flows {{to provide a}} complete, end to end, service to final users. This requires reliable interconnections among competitors that form multiple Global Supply Chain Networks (GSCNs) for the delivery and exchange of Internet traffic. Interconnection decisions form {{the architecture of the}} Internet supply chain as they design {{the rules of the game}} played by the operators, in terms of reciprocal <b>access</b> pricing <b>and</b> quality and modalities of traffic exchanged. From a provider's point of view, the strategic assessment of its direct interconnection environment is crucial in defining the competitive and complementary elements of its extended GSCN. This paper focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and the degree of mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship is clearly explained as follows: thebetter connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver its traffic with high Quality of Service and low costs, while the less interconnected among themselves a provider's neighbours are, the easier it is, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. This bargaining power, of a wellconnected provider over its poorly connected network - neighbours, shows when contracting over quality standards, <b>access</b> pricing <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> terms. This paper estimates two separate econometric models showing that the connectivity features of the GSCN display significant differences in network hierarchy and complexity depending on whether they are observed from a European, North American or Rest of the World observation point...|$|R

40|$|Calling {{mobile phones}} {{tends to be}} far more {{expensive}} than calling subscribers connected to fixed lines. The reason for this discrepancy is rooted in the currently rather over-priced interconnection fees in the mobile sector. In order to find some explanations and to address this problem more carefully in the future, this paper tries to present and assess the technical, economic and legal framework of mobile telecommunications. Since interconnection may be of rising importance in a future of multiple communication networks, this paper sets out a clear economic understanding of interconnection as well as the relevant rules of the current as well as the future legal framework on European Community level (section C.). Thereafter, a section on pricing issues (section D.) points out the risk of collusion in mobile interconnection. Since issues of price regulation tend to be controversial in the entire communications sector but often do not distinguish between onesided <b>access</b> <b>and</b> mutual <b>interconnection,</b> a general description of price regulation methods is provided before conclusions for the appropriate method for interconnection are drawn. Although this paper’s focus is as far as possible on two-way interconnection, the general issues of this section sometimes draw attention to one-sided access as well, in order to provide a more complete view of the pricing problematic. Finally, regulatory practices at national level, which contribute to continuing high price levels for calls to mobile networks, and their consequences are shown up (section E.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} of the EC telecommunications market has, from the beginning, {{been based on}} a dual-regime of sector-specific regulation and competition law. One of the areas where the interrelation between these two sets of rules is most obvious is that of access to telecommunications networks. The material in this thesis is up to date as of the 31 st July, 2004. This thesis examines the Essential Facilities Doctrine (EFD) as the competition law principle which deals with access of new market entrants to established facilities and, {{in the case of}} telecommunications, networks. This examination leads to the conclusion that if there is an EFD in EC law, it should be applied with extreme caution. The thesis then examines the New Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications, with a particular emphasis on the framework for <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection,</b> and concludes that EC competition law has acquired a prevailing role in the context of regulation of telecommunications. The reform of regulation of electronic communications that is so profoundly inspired by competition law principles, marks a previously unattained level of mutual interaction between regulation and EC antitrust law. Concerning the viability of this dual regime of competition law and regulation, the thesis comes to the conclusion that before sustainable competition has been established, a certain degree of sector-specific regulation has to be upheld. Phasing-out sector-specific regulation too early by relying solely on competition law would create considerable risks for both new entrants and incumbent operators...|$|E

40|$|This {{commentary}} summarizes {{and suggests}} some technological implications and interpretations for installation subsidies and income subsidies {{for renewable energy}} deployment. Installation subsidies incentivize adoption by financing part of the up-front installation cost. Income subsidies incentivize actual generation of renewable electricity using the hardware installation. Noted programs in this category include the various feed-in-tariff (FIT) instruments. We attempt to develop some technological interpretations for these two categories of instruments: Installation subsidies induce innovations which contribute to cost reduction driven by learning curve and local systems integration (Shum et al. 2008). Such policy instruments reinforce the notion of renewable energy technology as a manufactured technology. Income subsidies, on the other hand, induce innovations in policy and a cluster of technologies at network level, beyond the unit, such as grid <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> technologies, smart metering and communications technologies which enables trading of renewable generated electricity among units and the grid operator. Income induces an adoption externality at network level. Income subsidies render the renewable energy technology behaves like an information technology. The dichotomy between manufactured technology and information technology (Watanabe et al. 2005) serves as a novel framework to discuss & distinguish ex-post innovation focus in technological and policy realms of different fiscal instruments. This greatly sharpens the focus of policy making beyond just effective administering those instruments. From a theoretical viewpoint, our analysis re-formulates the renewable energy deployment problem as an innovation management problem contingent upon the type of policy instruments used and the underpinning basis of increasing returns (to deployment) mechanism. Alternatively, different policy instruments (social technology) trigger different technological trajectory of a given physical technology. This therefore affords a refined interpretation of energy policy in terms of connecting it to the larger literature of innovation and technical changes. Some future directions are motivated...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point of the thesis is the key competition law issues that arise in relation to access to telecommunications markets in the EU and Japan. This issue is presently regulated in the EU and Japan by a dual regime combining general competition law regulation and sector-specific regulation aimed at opening up the markets. Chapter 1 analyses the relevant general competition rules (i. e. dominance and its abuse, including the doctrine of essential facilities) and the relevant sector-specific rules (i. e. interconnection) that apply to access to EU telecommunications markets. Chapter 2 does the same exercise for Japan through {{the analysis of the}} relevant general competition rules (i. e. refusal to deal) and sector-specific rules (i. e. general market <b>access</b> regulation <b>and</b> <b>interconnection)</b> that apply to access to Japanese telecommunications markets. The analysis described above leads to the core object of the thesis which is the study, undertaken at Chapter 3, of the interrelation between general competition rules and sector-specific rules as they apply to access to telecommunications markets in the EU and Japan. This thesis will argue that the dual regime presently regulating access to the EU and Japanese telecommunications industries needs to be maintained. However, the increasing complexity and dynamic character of the telecommunications industry means that a change in the current interrelation between the two types of regulation is necessary. It will be argued that the future balance between the two types of regulation should be one where sector-specific rules will increasingly serve limited functions and where general competition rules will progressively take precedence over the regulation of third party access to telecommunications markets.

40|$|I present here {{a unique}} {{empirical}} {{analysis of the}} consumer welfare benefits of prior regulation in the mobile telecommunications industry. In particular, I analyze the relative consumer benefits of state rate regulation and federal entry regulation. The institution of filing requirements and FTC review and approval of various consumer pricing regimes is highly analogous to the consumer price controls imposed by various state level public utility commissions in the past. Furthermore, {{the imposition of a}} zero-price rule is analogous to past rate regulation; in particular it is similar to past wholesale regulation with its underlying principles of open <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> rights to non-network competitors. Consumer welfare in this empirical analysis is defined in terms of consumer prices, not in express terms of innovation increases in the application and equipment markets. A motivating rationale behind the zero-price rule, and network neutrality regulation in general, is that each application provider should enjoy nondiscriminatory access to the Internet for the equal opportunity to compete for the attention of end users. Consumer prices offer a proxy for the size of the available network because as prices decrease subscribership typically increases. As the size of the network increases, the benefit of network effects (e. g., profit, reputation, and notoriety) increases and, therefore, the incentive for innovation by application and equipment innovators increases. My analysis is set forth as follows. Part I presents a brief overview of a few key elements of the network neutrality debate that have led to various proposals for direct or indirect price regulation. Part II presents an introduction to the mobile communications industry and describes the unique dataset I use. Part III sets forth the empirical model to test for the efficacy of past regulation, including consumer price regulation and wholesale 2 ̆ 2 open access 2 ̆ 2 pricing regulation, and presents the results. Specifically, price regulation, akin to proposed consumer price regulation and the zero-price rule, is shown to have had little or no benefit to consumers and may have harmed consumers in some instances. Moreover, even subjectively innocuous regulation is shown to have, at best, an ambiguous effect on consumer welfare. Comparable analysis of regulation increasing market entry suggests great consumer welfare benefits, indicating that regulation is best directed at encouraging increased competition rather than dictating specific network neutrality requirements to individual operators. Finally, the Conclusion sets forth the policy recommendations indicated by the empirical results...|$|E
40|$|The {{telecommunications}} {{markets in}} the European Union have gone {{through a period of}} rapid technological as well as economic change. After the market opening in the late 1990 s, the approach to regulate these markets has likewise changed over time. Whereas a sectorspecific framework dominated the phase from 1998 - 2002, a more prominent role of competition law regulating telecommunications markets has become visible within the last years. The two reviews of the regulatory framework (2002 and 2010) have seen sector-specific measures being scaled back and competition law measures gaining a more prominent role. This paper tries to analyse the development from sector-specific regulation towards competition law in its application to telecommunications {{markets in the}} EU. It draws conclusions from the changes in the different reviews and demonstrates how these modifications of the framework have taken place. Additionally, the practical implementations are analysed with respect to two countries. Despite the fact, that EU member states are following a joint approach (EU framework), there are still differences on the national level as regards the application of regulatory instruments and the regulation of specific markets. This can be demonstrated by looking at how national regulatory authorities conduct the process of for example market definition, market analysis, SMP designation and levying of remedies. In the paper Germany and Austria are analysed, two neighbouring countries, with similar principles in the transposition of EU frameworks into national legislation, but with strongly different outcomes as regards specific regulatory measures in terms of e. g. market analysis, price regulation, organisation of the regulatory authorities etc. Thereby we demonstrate that although the EU framework tends to achieve harmonisation, there are still a number of differences between member states in practical implementation. The paper is organised as follows: after the introduction in section 1, section 2 draws the picture of the development of the most important elements of the EU regulatory framework over time. Thereby. we specifically look at the issues of market definition, analysis and dominance designation but also issues of <b>access</b> <b>and</b> <b>interconnection</b> are analyzed. This encompasses conclusions regarding the overall trends of development {{in the design of the}} EU regulatory framework. Section 3 analyses the corresponding developments in the Austrian and the German telecommunications act, especially with respect to the balance between the role of sector-specific regulation and competition law in national legislation. This is done be looking at some specific topics such as, market definition and analysis, organization of the regulatory authority, potential conflicts between regulatory authority and competition authority regarding competences and responsibilities, possibilities of enforcement, and the treatment of margin squeeze. Section 4 contains our conclusions with respect to the practical implementation in member states against the overall goal of harmonisation and demonstrates differences in the way EU legislation has been transposed to national legislation in a comparison between Germany and Austria.

The work intervened into a 15 hour live international radio-symposium exploring the impact and contribution of contemporary art within the public sphere, titled LaPublika, and hosted by the developing new international cultural centre Tabakalara. The LaPublika symposium was broadcast by radio stations across Spain and Portugal ? including Casares Irratia (Donostia / San Sebastian), TEA FM (Zaragoza), Radio Manobras (Porto), 97 FM (Bilbao), Cuac FM (A Coru?a), Radio Vallekas (Madrid), amongst others ? and was streamed live and internationally via the symposium?s dedicated website.

The work attempted to follow the progress of one day?s sunset, and its passage, over a scattering of disparate and diverse locations across the earth, towards and over the event site in Donostia / San Sabastian. The work opened a series of short audio connections to people stood out on the earth?s surface. By giving temporary access to the microphones of their mobile phones, these individuals allowed listeners to eavesdrop onto whatever may or may not be audible around them, as daytime passed into night within their personal location and environment. Across the daylong broadcast of the LaPublika symposium, 'Grey Line' periodically interrupted the broadcast schedule to connect live to these people ? as they stepped out into their own landscape to watch the shadow?s edge reach them. These provisional audio connections opened moments of access out onto the relentless journey of one day?s perpetual sunset, and onto one of the planet?s inevitable rotations. ?

How might live connections and interaction between a globally dispersed collective of participants be both performed and revealed solely through the engagement of daily and familiar technologies already available to those participants?
