[...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published by the}} Evening Standard in two parts on 22 and 23 April 1970, McCartney said: [...] "The album was finished a year ago, but {{a few months ago}} American record producer Phil Spector was called in by Lennon to tidy up some of the tracks. But a few weeks ago, I was sent a re-mixed version of my song 'The Long and Winding Road' with harps, horns, an orchestra, and a women's choir added. No one had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought. I couldn't believe it." [...] The Beatles' usual producer, George Martin, called the remixes [...] "so uncharacteristic" [...] of the Beatles, while Johns, who was denied a production credit by Lennon, described Spector's embellishments as [...] "revolting … just puke".|$|E
500|$|... "Grown Woman" [...] is {{an urban}} R song written by Ne-Yo, Magnus Beite, Bernt Stray, and Norwegian {{production}} team StarGate (who also produced the song). Jeremy Helligar of True/Slant commented {{the song was}} [...] "still {{to the left of}} what normally passes for modern R" [...] Originally revealed as [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] and later changed to [...] "Grown Woman," [...] the lyrics and theme of the song are based on a woman who [...] "asserts her maturity and clues her suitors in on what won’t fly when it comes to relationships." [...] The song is one of three records which Ne-Yo co-wrote for Rowland after the singer specifically approached him to pen records for her album. Its concept was devised in a brief conversation between the pair. Rowland said, [...] "'Ne-Yo <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to talk about,' and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'. [...] want a record that declared that I'm Grown!" ...|$|E

500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Australian Idol, Coulter was offered recording contracts by record labels including the show's sponsor Sony BMG, but she signed with Australia's biggest independent label Shock Records. Coulter explained, [...] "I'd {{met with a}} number of labels and Shock were the only one that <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do and what kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with". Her debut single [...] "Hell No!" [...] was released in June 2005, ahead of the related self-titled debut album, Ricki-Lee. The song peaked at numberfive on the ARIA Singles Chart – remaining in the top-ten for three consecutive weeks. It was eventually certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, for shipments of 35,000 copies. [...] "Sunshine" [...] was released as her second single in September, which peaked at numbereight and was also certified gold. Ricki-Lee was released on 3 October 2005, which peaked at number 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Coulter collaborated with a several producers and songwriters on the album, including Audius Mtawarira, Israel Cruz, Nitty, Jarrad Rogers and Kara DioGuardi, among others. [...] "Breathe" [...] was released as the album's third and final single in January 2006, and reached number14. At the 2006 Australian and New Zealand Urban Music Awards, Ricki-Lee was nominated for 'Best R Album'.|$|E
2500|$|The limited series Agents of Atlas #1-6 (Oct. 2006 - March 2007) {{was set in}} {{the present}} day and {{likewise}} set in mainstream continuity. The series emerged from what writer Parker called [...] "a huge editorial hunch" [...] at Marvel, and said {{the revival of the}} characters [...] "is something that [...] Mark Paniccia was looking at and [...] thought specifically of me, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do with it". Paniccia says the idea came to him when he picked up a copy of the What if? story and found the cover [...] "intriguing; it instantly tickles the nostalgia bone".|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E

2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E
2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as you speak to them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeing further {{potential}} in the idea, Horn teamed Jeczalik and Langan with Dudley in February to develop the project and brought {{in one of his}} business partners, ex-NME journalist Paul Morley, as a provider of concepts, art direction and marketing ideas. Morley came up with the project name (taken from the essay [...] "The Art of Noises" [...] by noted futurist Luigi Russolo, and finalised at Jeczalik's request by dropping the final 's'). Much later, in a July 2002 article penned for The Guardian, Morley wrote [...] "I loved the name Art of Noise so much that I forced my way into the group. If over the years people <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did in the group, I replied that I named them, and it was such a great name, that was enough to justify my role. I was the Ringo Starr of Art of Noise. I made the tea. Oh, and I wrote the lyrics to one of the loveliest pieces of pop music ever, Moments in Love." [...] Horn himself joined the new group as production advisor and provider of further ideas. This {{was the first time that}} he had been part of a group since parting company with his The Buggles' partner Geoff Downes (after they had been part of Yes). It would also be the first and last time that he would enjoy chart success as an artist since the new wave hit in 1979 with [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star".|$|E

2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to talk about, and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
