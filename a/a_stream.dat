5|$|The creek's use as {{a tribal}} {{boundary}} is disputed. As other southern California Native Americans have done, a tribe typically claimed both sides of <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> or river—and used drainage divides as boundaries instead. However, the presence of Aliso Canyon, a steep and difficult-to-traverse gorge, suggests the opposite. Kroeber (1907) {{was the first to}} support this theory, and many other archaeologists have followed as well. The Juaneño disagree, arguing that their boundary stretches north to the northern drainage divide of the Aliso Creek watershed, which supports the practice of claiming both sides of <b>a</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

Users browse through or search the video content found in those channels, watch the videos on the PC, cast the videos to a TV via <b>a</b> <b>streaming</b> device or gaming console, or record the videos to watch later on most media devices.

The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|At about 02:30, crewmen aboard Tubantia spotted <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> {{of bubbles}} rapidly {{approaching}} the ship's starboard side, {{followed by an}} explosion. The ship quickly began sinking. Distress calls sent out by Tubantia were answered by three ships, Breda, Krakstau, and La Campine, which between them rescued all 80 passengers and all 294 members of the crew. The ship and her cargo were a total loss. Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the entire war.|$|E
5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not fully understood by professional philosophers.|$|E

5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in <b>a</b> <b>stream</b> of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Crawford starred {{opposite}} Ramón Novarro in Across to Singapore, {{but it was}} {{her role}} as Diana Medford in Our Dancing Daughters (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled Clara Bow, the original It girl, then Hollywood's foremost flapper. <b>A</b> <b>stream</b> of hits followed Our Dancing Daughters, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.|$|E
