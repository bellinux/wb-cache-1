5|$|In {{association}} football, kit (also {{referred to}} as strip or soccer uniform) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's Laws of the Game specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dangerous to either the player or another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that, {{in the event of}} a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to different coloured attire.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E
5|$|Pearl's {{favorite}} {{activities are}} socializing at the Bikini Bottom Mall, and using her father's credit card to buy <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in style. Mr. Krabs disapproves of Pearl's prodigal spending, but nonetheless pays for her items to avoid disappointing his daughter. Pearl is employed {{as an assistant}} at Grandma's Apron, a store for elderly residents {{on the ground floor}} of the shopping center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma's Apron, is voiced by actress Betty White.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in lightly used {{wilderness}} areas, {{it is best}} {{to replace}} <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> gathered, so <b>that</b> it looks as natural as possible. Make certain <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in or near the fire is cool first.|$|R

5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane for me, the concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for {{each pair of}} its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> edible, whether or not the item is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{equipment}} or kit players {{are required to}} wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate shin guards. An athletic supporter and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals. Headgear is not a required piece of {{basic equipment}}, but players today may choose to wear it {{to protect themselves from}} head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjective}} antediluvian {{is sometimes}} used figuratively {{to refer to}} <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> of great age or outmoded. H. P. Lovecraft was particularly fond of the term, using it frequently in his horror stories.|$|E
25|$|Kami is the Japanese {{word for}} a god, deity, divinity, or spirit. It {{has been used to}} {{describe}} mind (心霊), God (ゴッド), supreme being (至上者), one of the Shinto deities, an effigy, a principle, and <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> worshipped.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} serious {{allegation}} against the Post {{is that it is}} willing to contort its news coverage to suit Murdoch's business needs, in particular that the paper has avoided reporting <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unflattering to the government of the People's Republic of China, where Murdoch has invested heavily in satellite television.|$|E
25|$|The Musqueam {{band has}} since brought {{a lawsuit against}} the City of Richmond {{claiming}} they sold it under duress. The lawsuit remains dormant and it is the understanding of Coun.

25|$|In this theory, {{sovereign}} {{government is}} not financially constrained {{in its ability to}} spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a debt ceiling law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms or public) has the potential to cause inflationary pressures.|$|E
25|$|Spinoza’s second {{knowledge}} involves reasoning plus emotions. He {{explains that}} this knowledge is had by the rationality of any adequate causes {{that have to}} do with anything common to the human mind. An example of this could be <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> classified as being of imperfect virtue. Imperfect virtues are seen as those which are incomplete. Many philosophers, such as Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle, would compare imperfect virtue to pagan virtue.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio waves and static magnetic fields easily penetrate {{many types of}} matter and <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not inherently ferromagnetic. For example, various expensive biological samples, such as nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, or proteins, can be studied using nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance {{a good choice for}} analyzing dangerous samples.|$|E
