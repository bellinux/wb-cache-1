5|$|The {{spacecraft}} verified {{the existence}} of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field was offset from the centre <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> {{in a manner similar to}} the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to have more than one ring.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E

25|$|The Powder River basin {{is shaped}} like a large shallow bowl, with its westernmost rock {{formations}} lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As these mountains uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, which were then eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.|$|E
25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and topped off with dry riprap. Riprap protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E

Adapting to monocular patches with non-zero <b>tilt</b> <b>and</b> zero slant produced large TAEs and smaller SAEs.

25|$|Subsequently, about 30 {{million years}} ago, {{the land was}} uplifted <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> towards the south by earth movements. The upper layers of rock were eroded away and the older rocks were exposed in places. Because of the tilt the oldest rocks became exposed in the north. These are the bands of shales and ironstones on the {{northern}} scarp of the moors and Cleveland Hills. The middle layers form the sandstones of the high moors and the youngest layers of limestone form the tabular hills. In the dales where the rivers have cut through the younger rocks there are also exposures of older shales, ironstone and sandstone. Rosedale {{is an example of}} this.|$|E
25|$|Semiconductor optical {{amplifiers}} (SOAs) are amplifiers {{which use}} a semiconductor {{to provide the}} gain medium. These amplifiers have a similar structure to Fabry–Pérot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Recent designs include anti-reflective coatings <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> wave guide and window regions which can reduce end face reflection to less than 0.001%. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which {{is greater than the}} gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Another type of SOA consists of two regions. One part has a structure of a Fabry-Pérot laser diode and the other has a tapered geometry {{in order to reduce the}} power density on the output facet.|$|E

25|$|The doors, {{most often}} {{credited}} as a Lamborghini trademark, were a remarkable design feature for the Countach. They {{first appeared on}} the Alfa Romeo 33 'Carabo' concept car in 1968, an earlier design accomplishment, also by the talented Gandini. The doors {{have come to be}} known as scissor doors: hinged at the front with horizontal hinges, so that they lifted up <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> forwards. The main reason is the car's tubular spaceframe chassis results in very high and wide door sills. It was also partly for style, and partly because the width of the car made conventional doors impossible to use in even slightly confined space. Care needed to be taken, though, in opening the doors with a low roof overhead. The car's poor rear visibility and wide sills led to drivers adopting a method of reversing the car for parking by opening the door, sitting on the sill, and reversing while looking over the back of the car from outside.|$|E
25|$|After one saros, the Moon {{will have}} {{completed}} roughly an integer number of lunar orbit cycles and synodic, draconic, and anomalistic periods (241, 223, 242, and 239) and the Earth-Sun-Moon geometry will be nearly identical: the Moon {{will have the}} same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from the Earth. In addition, because the saros is close to 18 years in length (about 11 days longer), the earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, <b>and</b> <b>tilted</b> to it in nearly the same orientation (same season). Given the date of an eclipse, one saros later a nearly identical eclipse can be predicted. During this 18-year period, about 40 other solar and lunar eclipses take place, but with a somewhat different geometry. One saros equaling 18.03 years is not equal to a perfect integer number of lunar orbits (earth revolutions with respect to the fixed stars of 27.32166 days sidereal month), therefore, even though the relative geometry of the Earth–Sun–Moon system will be nearly identical after a saros, the Moon will be in a slightly different position with respect to the stars for each eclipse in a Saros series. The axis of rotation of the Earth–Moon system exhibits a precession period of 18.59992 years.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The probe-coil’s {{lift-off}} <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> variations {{will cause}} noise signals that can obscure the valuable signals when the surface inspection is performed. Prevention of noise signals due to lift-off <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> variations {{is an important}} element in most eddy current inspections. In this paper, the electromagnetic field and impedance of a cylindrical probe-coil have been calculated numerically for arbitrary lift-off <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> angle above a conducting plate using three-dimensional Finite Element Modeling. The probe’s liftoff <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> effect on impedance change produced by a crack have been also investigated. The results show that the tilt curve are almost straight line and is characteristics of same phase with lift-off curve when probe’s tilt angle is less than a certain angle. Moreover, the phase of impedance locus due to a crack is approximately vertical to lift-off <b>and</b> <b>tilt</b> curve at the optimum excitation frequency. Phase rotation method can be used to remove simultaneously the probe’s tilt disturbance to crack impedance change with lift-off noise. The numerical results are confirmed by experiment measurement and the proposed method can be effectively applied to an actual eddy current testing...|$|R
