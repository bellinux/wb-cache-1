5|$|As Gotō's ships {{endeavored}} to escape, Scott's ships tightened their formation <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> pursue the retreating Japanese warships. At 00:06, two torpedoes from Kinugasa barely missed Boise. Boise and Salt Lake City turned on their searchlights to help target the Japanese ships, giving Kinugasas gunners clear targets. At 00:10, two shells from Kinugasa exploded in Boises main ammunition magazine between turrets one and two. The resulting explosion killed almost 100 men {{and threatened to}} blow the ship apart. Seawater rushed in through rents in her hull opened by the explosion and helped quench the fire before it could explode the ship's powder magazines. Boise immediately sheered out of the column and retreated from the action. Kinugasa and Salt Lake City exchanged fire with each other, each hitting the other several times, causing minor damage to Kinugasa and damaging one of Salt Lake Citys boilers, reducing her speed.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Armored Division made a {{stand at}} Bastogne and held off the Germans {{long enough to}} enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Bastogne. After a rest period in January 1945, the 9th Armored Division made preparations for a drive across the Roer River. The offensive was launched on February 28, and the 9th smashed across the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7, 1945. The division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated. The Division drove on to Frankfurt <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> assist in {{the closing of the}} Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the Mulde River. The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V-E Day in May 1945.|$|E

On February 22, 1863, troops from Dodge's command attacked Tuscumbia and the rear column of Van Dorn's column, capturing a piece of artillery, 100 bales of cotton, 100 prisoners and Van Dorn's supply train.

25|$|Cleveland {{took the}} lead again {{in the third quarter}} on a 39-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Lavelli, his second of the day. The Rams responded with a touchdown run by Hoerner and another touchdown quickly thereafter when Motley fumbled and Los Angeles's Larry Brink took it into the end zone. Down 28–20 as the fourth quarter began, Cleveland was helped by interceptions by Thompson and Lahr that put its offense in good field position. On a drive with 10 minutes left to play, Cleveland went for it on fourth down three times and made the necessary yards each time, advancing to the Los Angeles 14-yard line. From there, Graham threw a touchdown pass to Bumgardner, who dove to catch it {{in the corner of the}} end zone. After several more defensive stands, the Browns had the ball back and drove toward the Rams' end zone as the game drew to a close. Graham fumbled, however, and the Rams recovered with three minutes left. Cleveland's defense held, and Los Angeles punted, giving the Browns the ball back at their own 31-yard line with 1:49 left in the game. Graham scrambled up the middle for 16 yards on the first play, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> his receivers. A pass to Bumgardner and two to Jones on the sidelines, followed by another to Bumgardner, put the ball at the Los Angeles 11-yard line. Graham ran a quarterback sneak on the next play to place the ball at the middle of the field in preparation for a field goal. After a time out, Groza came in and kicked the field goal with 0:28 left on the clock to put Cleveland ahead 30–28. The Rams fumbled the ensuing kickoff and the Browns recovered, appearing to seal the victory. The officials ruled that Groza had kicked prematurely, however, and Los Angeles returned his rekick to their 46-yard line. An interception by Lahr on a sideline pass stopped the drive and gave Cleveland the win.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, Clancy {{switched}} to end {{and became the}} first Michigan Wolverine with 50receptions in a season, and set Michigan single-season records with 52receptions and 762yards. [...] In his first game at the end position, Clancy made what was described as [...] "a circus catch" [...] in the endzone on a pass from quarterback Dick Vidmer. [...] Clancy set the Big Ten receiving record in against Wisconsin, catching a 52-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Wally Gabler on Michigan's first offensive play. [...] At the time, the Associated Press reported: [...] "What makes Clancy's record so much more impressive {{is the fact that he}} came to Michigan as a quarterback, {{switched to}} halfback and won a spot there two years ago <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> end this season. [...] And with Michigan's reputation for always having talented ends—Benny Oosterbaan, Lowell Perry, Ron Kramer and John Henderson among them—Clancy's feat takes on even more brilliance." [...] At the end of the season, Clancy's teammates chose him as captain for the 1966 season. [...] He was also named a second-team All-Big Ten player by the United Press International (UPI).|$|E
500|$|At 12:05, Duncan {{raised the}} signal {{ordering}} his ships {{to engage the}} enemy closely. At the same time, the Dutch ship Jupiter, under Rear-Admiral Hermanus Reijntjes, fourth from {{the southern end of}} the line, opened fire on the rapidly approaching Monarch. The Dutch ships had waited until the British were well within effective range in order to maximise the effect of their shot, and soon Onslow's flagship was under fire from the entire rearguard of the Dutch line, the ship suffering damage while attempting to break through the Dutch line between Jupiter and Haarlem at 12:30. On Monarch, Captain Edward O'Bryen remarked to Onslow that he could not see where his ship could pass between the closely formed Dutch ships, to which the Admiral responded that [...] "the Monarch will make a passage." [...] Striking the small gap between the ships, Onslow fired raking broadsides into both vessels <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> lay his ship alongside Reyntjes' flagship. As he did, the Dutch frigate Monnikkendam and the brig Daphné pulled out of the second line and attempted to fill the gap Monarch had created, firing into the British ship of the line as they did so. In response, Onslow opened fire on the smaller vessels, destroying the frigate's wheel and damaging the rigging, so that the ship fell back, followed later by the severely damaged brig.|$|E

2500|$|The Germans tried {{twice to}} bluff Gambier-Parry into {{surrender}} {{but he had}} received orders from CYRCOM to break out and retreat to El Adem and decided to attack at dawn, to gain a measure of surprise. On 8 April, A Squadron of the 18th Cavalry broke through <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> attack Italian artillery, as some Indian troops of the 11th Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry (Frontier Force) got away.

2500|$|The F135 {{originated}} with Lockheed Corporation Skunk Works, with {{efforts to develop}} a stealthy STOVL strike fighter for the U.S. Marine Corps under a 1986 DARPA program. Lockheed employee Paul Bevilaqua developed and patented a concept aircraft and propulsion system, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Pratt & Whitney (P) to build a demonstrator engine. The demonstrator used the first stage fan from a F119 engine for the lift fan. The engine fan and core from the F100-220 {{were used for the}} core of the demonstrator engine, and the larger low-pressure turbine from the F100-229 was used for the low-pressure turbine of the demonstrator engine. The larger turbine was used to provide the additional power required to operate the lift fan. Finally, a variable thrust deflecting nozzle was added to complete the [...] "F100-229-Plus" [...] demonstrator engine. This engine proved the lift-fan concept and {{led to the development of}} the current F135 engine.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Brennan {{wrote for}} the majority.

[...] The McCarran Amendment permitted adjudication of the Native American tribes' rights in state court, and Brennan held there was no strong policy argument to eliminate the state courts' jurisdiction in this area. [...] Moreover, the circumstances necessitating abstention were not present here, largely because this case did not present complex issues of state law or policy to be resolved, as was the case in past abstention cases such as Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co. (1941), Burford v. Sun Oil Co. (1943), or Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux (1959). [...] Nor was this an attempt to enjoin state criminal proceedings, as in Younger v. Harris (1971).|$|E
2500|$|The {{system was}} a {{consolidation}} of several streetcar lines {{assembled in the}} late 1890s and early 1900s by Francis Marion [...] "Borax" [...] Smith, an entrepreneur who made a fortune in his namesake mineral, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> real estate and electric traction. The Key System began as the San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway (SFOSJR), incorporated in 1902. Service began on October 26, 1903 with a 4-car train carrying 250 passengers, departing downtown Berkeley for the ferry pier. Before the end of 1903, {{the general manager of}} the SFOSJR devised the idea of using a stylized map on which the system's routes resembled an old-fashioned key, with three [...] "handle loops" [...] that covered the cities of Berkeley, Piedmont (initially, [...] "Claremont" [...] shared the Piedmont loop) and Oakland, and a [...] "shaft" [...] {{in the form of the}} Key pier, the [...] "teeth" [...] representing the ferry berths at the end of the pier.

[...] The Court accepted that there may have been evidence which could have supported an inference that the Legislature was moved by racial considerations, but found that there was also evidence supporting the contrary inference that was [...] "equally, or more, persuasive." [...] The Court accepted the finding that appellants failed to demonstrate that the statute was [...] "the product of a state contrivance to segregate on the basis of race or place of origin," [...] and therefore upheld the District Court's decision.|$|E

The Levites thus complained that they had been held back from bringing an offering for the dedication of the altar. The Midrash compared this to the case of a king who held a feast and invited various craftsmen, but did not invite a friend of whom the king was quite fond. The friend was distressed, thinking that perhaps the king harbored some grievance against him. But when the feast was over, the king called the friend and told him that while the king had made a feast for all the citizens of the province, the king would make a special feast with the friend alone, because of his friendship.
