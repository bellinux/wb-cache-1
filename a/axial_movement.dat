5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E
500|$|The arm {{and frame}} {{components}} were {{replaced with a}} cylindrical platen in 1869. Unlike modern typewriters, the revised machine entered letters around the cylinder, with axial rotation providing letter spacing and horizontal shifting providing line spacing. Paper was clipped directly to the cylinder, which limited its length and width to {{the dimensions of the}} apparatus. The platen was again redesigned in early 1872 to allow the use of paper of any length. The redesigned platen also introduced the modern spacing functionality (horizontal and <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> providing letter and line spacing, respectively).

Whilst axial compression is regarded as stimulatory, the role of interfragmentary shear is controversial. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine how the initial mechanical conditions produced by interfragmentary shear and torsion differ from those produced by <b>axial</b> compressive <b>movements.</b> Methods The finite element method was used to estimate the strain, pressure and fluid flow in the early callus tissue produced by the different modes of interfragmentary movement found in vivo. Additionally, tissue formation was predicted according to three principally different mechanobiological theories. Findings Large interfragmentary shear movements produced comparable strains and less fluid flow and pressure than moderate <b>axial</b> interfragmentary <b>movements.</b> Additionally, combined <b>axial</b> and shear <b>movements</b> did not result in overall increases in the strains and the strain magnitudes were similar to those produced by <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> alone. Only when <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> where applied did the non-distortional component of the pressure-deformation theory influence the initial tissue predictions.

50|$|Metal bellows {{are created}} by rolling annular {{corrugations}} into a smooth extruded or welded pipe. In 1946, Albert Dreyer developed a multi-walled joint {{that was designed to}} accommodate <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> as well: the axial expansion joint.|$|R
50|$|The {{universal}} {{expansion joint}} can absorb not only <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> but angular and lateral movements as well. It {{consists of two}} metal bellows with an intermediate pipe and connectors on both sides. As a special form of the axial expansion joint, the universal expansion joint has only a limited pressure resistance for stability reasons and, moreover, loads the adjacent pipe supports with the axial compressive force resulting from the internal pressure. It is usually used to compensate large <b>axial</b> and lateral <b>movements</b> at low pressure.|$|R

50|$|As {{the slot}} has a helix angle of about 35°, any <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> {{of the outer}} shaft causes the segment to rotate, exposing more or less of the nose {{constant}} radius and thus changing the duration.|$|E
50|$|The rollers {{act as the}} “threads” of the nut assembly, causing <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the {{rotating}} screw due to their orbital restraint. Screw rotation spins the rollers, which spin the bearing ring, dissipating the load-induced friction along the way.|$|E

50|$|Duct {{segments}} {{are typically}} separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen {{to separate the}} duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer <b>axial</b> <b>movements,</b> and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments. fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} planetary {{roller screw}} {{is also known}} as the non-recirculating roller screw. The lack of <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the roller relative to the nut, and the gearing of rollers to nut, are definitive of the standard type of roller screw.|$|E
50|$|In axial compensation, {{the thermal}} {{expansion}} of {{a straight line}} section between two fixed points is absorbed by an axial expansion joint. The distance between two fixed points defines the pipeline length requiring compensation, and thus determines the <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> that must be achieved by the expansion joint.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the system}} is [...] "fully compensated", the unavoidable, small <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of lateral {{expansion}} joints is absorbed by an additional lateral expansion joint. However, often the pipeline itself can compensate this through elastic bending. In this case, adequate bearing play must be provided in the pipe guides.|$|E
30|$|The {{results for}} direct weight loading {{in this study}} are {{consistent}} with the literature. A slight axial weight load resulted in a relatively large extent of <b>axial</b> <b>movements.</b> Duda et al. [6] detected in vivo interfragmentary movements up to 4  mm in patients treated with an Ilizarov frame and mobilised with direct weight loading and a maximum load of 20  kg. At the same applied load in our experimental set-up, there were <b>axial</b> gap <b>movements</b> of 3  mm. Contact of the bone ends at a plane osteotomy leads to force transmission of all of the axial applied load through the osteotomy and none through the fixator [7]. The loading cell filled the defect fully and therefore simulated an already closed osteotomy gap {{at the beginning of the}} measurement of the loading forces in the osteotomy. The forces were directly proportional to the applied axial load, and the load force was one-to-one transferred to the osteotomy.|$|R

Our aim is to explore different power screw-properties, various types of power screws, designing procedure of a power screw (*we will be considering designing of a SCREW-JACK),CAD (CATIA V 5) model, computer program (MATLAB) to reduce the calculation time in designing considering all the design constraints and factors...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{mechanics}} of fiber assemblies have neglected fiber movements that are due to perturbations of the assembly. <b>Axial</b> <b>movements,</b> which are treated in the paper, are important in pilling, bagging, felting, and incremental drafting of yarns in weaving, but lateral movements may also occur. A dynamical model is analogous to molecular statistical mechanics. Both a diffusion model and a driven model are presented. The resistance to movement is due to gripping forces, which may be externally imposed or caused by structural features, such as twist; both are easy to take into account. The geometric forms of entanglements {{and the way in}} which they add to frictional resistance are discussed in more detail...|$|R
50|$|The {{inverted}} planetary {{roller screw}} {{is also known}} as the reverse roller screw. The lack of <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the roller relative to the screw, and the gearing of rollers to screw, are definitive of the inverted type of planetary roller screw. This type of roller screw was developed simultaneously with the standard roller screw.|$|E
50|$|Little {{force is}} needed to move the shaft axially {{so there is a}} {{possibility}} that when using the Helical Camshaft for LIVC load control alone the <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> could be connected directly and mechanically to the accelerator pedal. Similarly, if the Helical Camshaft is used to improve high RPM power only a simple self-contained centrifugal controller/actuator could be used.|$|E
50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} is {{when the}} workpiece {{is supported by a}} blade instead of by centers or chucks. Two wheels are used. The larger one is used to grind the surface of the workpiece and the smaller wheel is used to regulate the <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> of the workpiece. Types of centerless grinding include through-feed grinding, in-feed/plunge grinding, and internal centerless grinding.|$|E
40|$|Offshore {{pipelines}} {{are increasingly}} being required to operate at high temperature and pressure, and the associated axial expansion {{is a major concern}} for design. It is essential to have an in-depth understanding of pipe-soil interaction phenomenon to control the creeping and buckling failures. In this regard the paper presents laboratory modelling performed at Monash University to interpret the pipe-soil interaction behaviour. A special test setup(MAPS) was developed to model axial walking of pipe on clay seabed. Drained and undrained behaviour loading was analysed with different rates of <b>axial</b> <b>movements.</b> Based on the outcomes, the pre-peak, peak and residual components of the load displacement curve are explained using a simplified theoretical frame work...|$|R

Following the validation of the numerical method against published centrifuge test results and limit analysis solutions, we present {{the findings of a}} detailed parametric study on the response of partially-embedded pipelines under vertical and <b>axial</b> <b>movements,</b> employing 2 -D plain strain and full 3 -D soil–pipeline models. Emphasis is put on practical findings, and on proposing simplified expressions for the estimation of the contact enhancement factor and of the equivalent friction factor, that can be used at least for preliminary design purposes...|$|R
40|$|We analyze {{sinusoidal}} {{pulsating flow}} that develops in the vibrating flow pump (VFP) artificial heart casing. In such system flow is {{induced by the}} <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> of the vibrating pipe. Pipe is capped with the flexible thin disk that is called jelly-fish valve (JFV). Valve is opened during the downward pipe motion and is closed during the upward motion. Valve movement is very similar with the movement of falcon wings. It {{is due to the}} pipe motion and happens under the influence of fluid inertial, JFV spring, fluid shear and pressure forces. Authors utilized industrial strength CFD-ACE+ / FEMSTRESS software package from CFDRC to analyze dynamic fluid-structure interaction, flow velocity field and time-dependent vorticity distribution.

50|$|This {{means the}} segment can be {{positioned}} anywhere along the helical slot {{and there will}} always be a smooth transition for the follower to and from the segment. The lobe segment is fixed to the inner shaft so any relative <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> has the effect of changing the valve opening duration. The follower is arranged so that it always remains aligned with the segment which remains stationary axially.|$|E
5000|$|The seals dual {{pressure}} zone helps maintain a constant {{pressure zone}} within the system. The constant pressure stabilizes the seal {{and does not}} allow the two seal faces to come in contact.

The slightest <b>axial</b> <b>movement</b> will cause the two seal faces to touch and erosion of the seal will begin to occur.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{high frequency}} arc instabilities observed in subsonic-arc-attachment thrusters, a 3 kW, segmented-anode arc jet {{was designed and}} tested using hydrogen as the propellant. The thruster nozzle geometry was scaled from a 30 kW design previously tested in the 1960 's. By observing the current to each segment and the arc voltage, {{it was determined that}} the 75 - 200 kHz instabilities were results of <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> of the arc anode attachment point. The arc attachment point was fully contained in the subsonic portion of the nozzle for nearly all flow rates. The effects of isolating selected segments were investigated. In some cases, forcing the arc downstream caused the restrike to cease. Finally, decreasing the background pressure from 18 to 0. 05 Pa affected the pressure distribution in the nozzle including the pressure in the subsonic arc chamber...|$|R
40|$|An {{outer race}} carrier is {{constructed}} for receiving {{an outer race}} of an antifriction bearing assembly. The carrier in turn is slidably fitted in an opening of a support wall to accommodate slight <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> of a shaft. A plurality of longitudinal splines on the carrier are disposed to be fitted into matching slots in the opening. A deadband gap is provided between sides of the splines and slots, with a radial gap at ends of the splines and slots and {{a gap between the}} splines and slots sized larger than the deadband gap. With this construction, operational distortions (slope) of the support wall are accommodated by the larger radial gaps while the deadband gaps maintain a relatively high springrate of the housing. Additionally, side loads applied to the shaft are distributed between sides of the splines and slots, distributing such loads over a larger surface area than a race carrier of the prior art...|$|R
50|$|The axial {{expansion}} joint absorbs <b>movement</b> in an <b>axial</b> direction. Standard connectors of the {{axial expansion}} joint are welded ends, fixed flanges and loose flanges. Axial expansion joints are often equipped with a guiding tube {{on the inside of}} the metal bellows. This reduces the flow resistance and prevents damage caused by direct contact with the flowing medium. Axial expansion joints, which can absorb large movements, frequently consist of two metal bellows and an inside or outside sleeve that protects against buckling under internal pressure. For small nominal diameters, protective tubes prevent mechanical damage during installation and operation. Axial expansion joints are suitable for internal and external overpressure. If pressure is applied to the outside of the metal bellows of {{axial expansion joint}}s, the expansion joints permit very large <b>axial</b> <b>movements</b> in case of internal pressure in a pipeline. Because there is no danger of buckling when an external overpressure is applied, the creator of the metal expansion joint was by a professor called Joshua Yap.|$|R
