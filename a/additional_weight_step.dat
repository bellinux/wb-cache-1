40|$|Note: Manuscript version. Figures in {{separate}} file The thermal decomposition of syngenite, K 2 Ca(SO 4) 2. H 2 O, formed during {{the treatment of}} liquid manure has been studied by Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, high temperature X-ray diffraction and Infrared Emission Spectroscopy. Gypsum was found as a minor impurity resulting in a minor weight loss due to dehydration around 100 °C. The main endothermic dehydration and decomposition stage of syngenite to crystalline K 2 Ca 2 (SO 4) 3 and amorphous K 2 SO 4 is observed around 200 °C. The reaction involves a solid-state recrystallization, while water and the K 2 SO 4 diffuse out of the existing lattice. The <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> loss <b>steps</b> around 250 and 350 °C are probably due to presence of larger syngenite particles, which exhibit slower decomposition due to the slower diffusion of water and K 2 SO 4 out of the crystal lattice. A minor endothermic sulphate loss around 450 °C is not due to the decomposition of syngenite or its products or of the gypsum impurity. The origin of this sulphate is not clear...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMining {{height of}} coal seams {{plays a major}} role in the failure of the key stratum as well as combinational key stratum. Based on {{analyzing}} the relevant parameters of combinational key stratum, applying numerical analysis, the influence of mining height on combinational key stratum fracture, which is also the influence on the main roof <b>weighting</b> <b>step,</b> is studied and the computational formula of the main roof first <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> in shallow seams is revised. The first <b>weighting</b> <b>step</b> of the Da-liu-ta 1203 working face, derived from the calculation through the revised formula, is very close to the actual measurement.

50|$|The {{class were}} {{widely used in}} Devon and Cornwall where the track had many sharp curves. It was found that flange wear on the leading driving wheels became {{excessive}} {{as a result of}} these bends. In November and December 1927 <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> was added to the front end of four examples so that the pony truck would be forced to impart more side thrust to the main frames on bends. These locomotives reverted to their original state, but between January and March 1928, 65 engines of 5300 series received <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> on the pony truck, and 3000 was added to their running numbers, temporarily creating an ‘8300 Class’. However, the <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> placed them in the Red category of route availability. From 1944 onwards there was a shortage of locomotives in the Blue category and so the <b>additional</b> <b>weights</b> were removed and the surviving locomotives resumed their original running numbers. The last to be returned to its original condition was 8393 in September 1948.|$|R

5000|$|Physical {{measurements}} of the sled are taken, and {{the temperature of the}} sled's steel blades is checked and may not be more than 5 °C above that of a previously established control temperature. Additionally, for artificial track races the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine if the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 90 kg. Women may use <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 70 kg. Doubles athletes may use <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 90 kg. <b>Additional</b> <b>weight</b> is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds 180 kg. If one of the partners weighs more than 90 kg, the weight exceeding the 90 kg mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner’s weight and the 90 kg mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official weight table. Between runs athletes are randomly selected for <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> checks. Before each run the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{kinematic}} and spatioternporal gait variables of aquatic walking with <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> applied on the affected limb in people post-stroke. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals post-stroke with hemiparesis (age 66 ??? 11 yrs, 5 females: 16 males) {{participated in this}} study. A repeated measures comparative design {{was used to compare}} the aquatic gait patterns among three different walking conditions for aquatic walking. Participants walked in water at chest depth (xiphoid process) under each walking condition. Kinematic and spatiotemporal gait variables were processed and analyzed by using Vicon Motus Video v 9. 2. RESULTS: The use of <b>additional</b> <b>weight,</b> regardless of position showed increase in gait speed and foot-off percentage of the less-affected limb compared to no weight condition (all Ps < 0. 05). Knee weight condition showed a significant decrease in sagittal plane knee range of motion of the less-affected limb compared to no weight condition (P < 0. 05). Ankle weight condition showed significant decrease in peak knee flexion and sagittal plane ankle range of motion of the less-affected limb compared to no weight condition (both Ps < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The use of <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> could provide stability during gait training in people post-stroke. The study findings suggest that the use of <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> on the affected limb for people post-stroke may reduce compensatory movement patterns and demonstrate a similar walking pattern to that seen on land. Depending on the level of function, the use of <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> could provide benefits to restore healthy gait patterns in people post-stroke...|$|R

The experimental design was arranged in RBD consisting of 2 block and 1 factor; different engine rotation n speed (rpm) threshing and packaging material.

The following analyses were carried out: moisture content, germination, damaged grains, <b>additional</b> <b>weight</b> and free fatty acid (FFA).
