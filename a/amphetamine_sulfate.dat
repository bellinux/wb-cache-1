The presence of the amphetamine models is monitored via either {{the reduction in the}} magnitude of the voltammetric peak corresponding to the electrochemical reduction of the quinone functionality of the sodium 1, 2 -naphthoquinone- 4 -sulfonate or via growth of a new voltammetric peak related to reaction between the amphetamine model and NQS, both of which are well resolved from one another. The protocol is shown to be successful in artificial saliva and authentic human oral (saliva) fluid.

5000|$|The first {{patented}} amphetamine brand, Benzedrine, was a racemic (i.e., equal parts) {{mixture of}} the freebases or sulfate salts of both amphetamine enantiomers (levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) that {{was introduced in the}} United States in 1934 as an inhaler for treating nasal congestion. It was later realized that the amphetamine enantiomers could treat obesity, narcolepsy, and ADHD. Because of the greater central nervous system effect of the dextro enantiomer, sold as Dexedrine, prescription of the Benzedrine brand fell and was eventually discontinued.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityPurpose: It was {{the purpose}} of this study to test {{hypotheses}} concerning the effects of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> on certain areas of behavior and school performance of hyperactive children. The literature inciicated that some children were observed to be less active and less impulsive and to have greater emotional control and a longer attention span when given <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate.</b> No diagnostic criteria had been established to determine with which children this medication was effective, although many observers felt that the predicted effect occurred with children suffering from an organic cerebral dysfunction. A preliminary study by this writer to investigate the hypothesis that the administration of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> to children suffering from organic cerebral dysfunction produced more efficient behavior, produced inconclusive results. It suggested that hyperactivity was the factor which differentiated between those children who would show the predicted behavioral changes with <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> and those who would not.

40|$|Methods of {{detection}} of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) from colloidal suspensions and vapour deposited films of both {{silver and gold}} are compared. Different aggregating agents are required to produce effective SERS from silver and gold colloidal suspensions. Gold colloid and vapour deposited gold films give weaker scattering than the equivalent silver substrates when high concentrations of drug are analysed but they also give lower detection limits, suggesting a smaller surface enhancement but stronger surface adsorption. A 10 (- 5) mol dm(- 3) solution (the final concentration after addition of colloid was 10 (- 6) mol dm(- 3)) of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> was detected from gold colloid with an RSD of 5. 4 %. 25 mul of the same solution could be detected on a roughened gold film. The intensities of the spectra varied across the film surface resulting in relatively high RSDs. The precision was improved by averaging the scattering from several points on the surface. An attempt to improve the detection limit and precision by concentrating a suspension of gold colloid and <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> in aluminium wells did not give effective quantitation. Thus, positive identification and semi-quantitative estimation of <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> can be made quickly and easily using SERS from suspended gold colloid with the appropriate aggregating agents...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{amphetamine}} on neuromuscular synaptic transmission observed in this laboratory (1) suggested {{the possibility of}} an action of this drug on the autonomic ganglion. After a study of the effect on the ganglion, it was thought of interest to extend this investigation to synapses of the central nervous system. METHOD. The stellate ganglion was chosen because of the facility with which the post synaptic potentials can be registered. Cats anesthetized intraperitoneally with a sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) -urethanc solution (Nembutal 0. 3 gm. for 1 cc. of 25 per cent urethane solution, 1 cc. per kgm. of body weight) were used.

Methods: A total of 107 children ages 6 â 12 years were enrolled in this multicenter, dose-optimized, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. After 8 weeks of open-label dose optimization, 97 subjects were randomized to 2 weeks of double-blind treatment in the sequence of R-AMPH followed by placebo (n = 47) or placebo followed by R-AMPH (n = 50). Efficacy measures included the Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) Rating Scale and Per-manent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP) administered predose and at 0. 75, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours postdose on 2 laboratory classroom days. Safety assessments included physical examination, chemistry, hematology, vital signs, and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{estimation}} in rats {{of the in}} vivo release and metabolism of dopamine (DA) is described. The method {{is based on the}} dialysis principle and consists of inserting transversally in the striatum a thin (0. 2 mm) dialysis tube (Amicon Vitafiber) which is then perfused with Ringer. The Ringer, flowing at a constant rate of 2 microliters/min in the dialysis tube, extracts low molecular weight substances from the surrounding tissue by way of simple diffusion along a concentration gradient. At the distal end of the dialysis tube, the Ringer is collected every 10 to 20 min and directly injected into a high performance liquid chromatographer (HPLC) equipped with reverse phase octadecyl sulfate columns which separate DA and its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). These substances are then quantitatively estimated by oxidative electrochemical detection. The basal output of DA is 0. 3 pmol/ 20 min, whereas the outputs of DOPAC and HVA are 60 and 20 pmol/ 20 min, respectively. In basal conditions the output of DA, DOPAC, and HVA is stable over at least 10 hr. Histological examination of the track left by the dialysis probe in rats after 10 hr of continuous dialysis reveals very little damage and normal neuronal morphology {{in the vicinity of the}} dialysis tube. Increase of the K+ concentration in the Ringer to 30 mM produced a sharp, reversible increase of DA output. Both the basal and K+-stimulated release were Ca++ dependent, because omission of Ca++ abolished basal and K+-stimulated DA release. Electrical stimulation of the nigrostriatal DA neurons in the medial forebrain bundle sharply increased DA output. <b>Amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> in low doses (1. 0 mg/kg, i. v.) produced a 9 -fold increase in DA release and decreased DOPAC and HVA output. alpha-Methyl tyrosine (150 mg/kg, i. v.) reduced within 2 hr DA release to 15 % of basal values and in parallel also decreased the output of DOPAC and HVA. Reserpine (5 mg/kg, i. p.) reduced DA release but in a slower fashion than alpha-methyl tyrosine and increased DOPAC and HVA. Pargyline (75 mg/kg, i. p.) produced a 4 -fold increase of DA release, while it rapidly brought to zero DOPAC and HVA output. gamma-Butyrolactone (700 mg/kg, i. p.) rapidly and lastingly reduced DA, DOPAC, and HVA output. The biochemical and histological results obtained indicate that the method is suitable to estimate in the rat the changes in the release o f endogenous DA and its metabolites which take place in vivo under administration of centrally acting drug...|$|E
40|$|Since Bradley's {{report in}} 1937 that {{described}} {{the efficacy of}} racemic <b>amphetamine</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{in the treatment of}} children with disruptive behaviours, numerous studies have documented the safety, efficacy and tolerability of psychostimulant treatment for children and adolescents with attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Stimulants should generally be considered first when initiating pharmacotherapy for most patients with ADHD, but {{as a part of a}} multimodal approach of ADHD. The most commonly prescribed and studied psychostimulants include methylphenidate (RitalineReg.), dextroamphetamine (DexaminReg.), recently methylphenidate OROS (ConcertaReg.) and mixed amphetamine salts (AdderallReg.). The lack of pharmacologic coverage throughout the school day may account for the apparent failure of stimulants to affect some key domains of functioning in children with ADHD. Recently sustained-release preparation of psychostimulants have been developed (Ritaline SRReg., Ritaline LAReg., ConcertaReg., Adderall XRReg., [methylphenidate HCI] Metadate CDReg., [dextroamphetamine] SpansulesReg.). Since January 2003, the atomoxetine (Strattera Reg.) with the pharmacological profile approaching an antidepressant is approved by the FDA in United States for children and adults with ADHD. Preliminary data suggests comparable efficacy to stimulant across the ADHD symptoms spectrum without predictors available for who responds better to stimulants versus atomoxetine. The efficacy of other non-stimulants is until now not enough documented (for instance, alpha 2 agonists as clonidine, tricyclic antidepressants as desipramine and nortriptyline, SSRI as fluoxetine, bupropion or modafinil). The medications are second choice alternatives for problematic cases. The prescriptions for ADHD symptoms are under the responsibility of clinicians (usage "label off"). The purpose of this paper is to briefly review the available data about the pharmacotherapy of children and adolescents with ADHD in order to provide the clinician with rational, empirically based strategies. This paper especially describes the medications available in Switzerland, as the short- and long-acting RitalineReg., DexaminReg. and ConcertaReg [...] The effects of slow-release preparations of methylphenidate are reported. A persistent question attached to ADHD is the allegation that stimulant therapy can lead to substance abuse or drug addiction in either adolescence or adulthood. This paper briefly reviews the available data about this topic. Scientific data have shown that there is no evidence at this time that long-term treatment with stimulants or other psychoactive drugs prescribed for the treatment of children or adolescents with ADHD is associated with high rates of substance abuse later in life. During the past decade epidemiologic studies have documented high rates of psychiatric comorbidity among children with ADHD, as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and learning disabilities. If not recognised and not treated, the combination of comorbid symptoms and ADHD may lead to high morbidity and disability with poor long-term prognosis. The choice of the currently available drugs in Switzerland is still limited, and the clinician is in an unpleasant situation when the effectiveness of the methylphenidate is insufficient or patients develop problematic side effects. The clinicians in Switzerland await with interest the introduction of new preparations of psychostimulants, as the methylphenidate OROS (ConcertaReg.) or Ritaline LAReg. wich have an action of long duration, or the atomoxetine (StratteraReg.) with the pharmacological profile approaching an antidepressant. The introduction of other preparations already marketed in the United States could widen the pallet of drugs indicated in the treatment of the ADHD in the child and the teenager.
