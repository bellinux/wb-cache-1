5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce {{showed little}} {{interest}} in women, {{but when he was}} in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington recommended twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed {{little interest in}} his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807).

After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a de facto legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted argumentative strategies from the 1980s American pro-choice movement.|$|E

500|$|The {{patriotic}} lay {{songs of}} the American Revolution constituted the first kind of mainstream popular music. These included [...] "The Liberty Tree" [...] by Thomas Paine. Cheaply printed as broadsheets, early patriotic songs spread across the colonies and were performed <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>at</b> public meetings. Fife songs were especially celebrated, and were performed on fields of battle during the American Revolution. The longest lasting of these fife songs is [...] "Yankee Doodle", still well known today. The melody dates back to 1755 and was sung by both American and British troops. Patriotic songs were based mostly on English melodies, with new lyrics added to denounce British colonialism; others, however, used tunes from Ireland, Scotland or elsewhere, or did not utilize a familiar melody. The song [...] "Hail, Columbia" [...] was a major work that remained an unofficial national anthem until the adoption of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner".

500|$|Language and {{literacy}} have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction {{in a variety}} of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be {{due in part to the}} fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. [...] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>at</b> school as compared to children without disabilities. Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.|$|E
500|$|The show's only main {{character}} {{to have been}} spared harsh criticism, Clair has garnered very positive reviews from critics, by whom she continues to be venerated frequently. Critics and journalists often celebrate the character's [...] "outspoken, womanist views". Blake Green of The Baltimore Sun described the character as [...] "the perfect wife and mother of five who also practiced law and dressed to the nines." [...] Jezebel's Hillary Crosley Coker hailed Clair as a [...] "career-driven matriarch that kicked ass <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>at</b> work." [...] Writing for Complex, Nikeita Hoyte described Clair as [...] "A hard-ass mom who radiates {{the beauty of a}} goddess", while the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "Clair was one big beacon of gorgeous in the Huxtable household." [...] Daisy Dumas of the Daily Mail dubbed Clair an [...] "Indomitable matriarch". AfterEllen.com's Jill Guccini called Clair [...] "divine". Including her on her list of [...] "Diverse TV Ladies That Can Help Young Girls Learn How to Kick Ass", she hailed her relationship with Cliff as [...] "something that young girls—gay or straight—really need to see", while praising her occasional use of Spanish. In a retrospective review of The Cosby Show in 2014, Daily Life writer Ruby Hamad highlighted Clair as the [...] "one thing about the show that is as good now as it was then". In terms of the character's best episodes, Joe Reid of The Atlantic cited Clair's unimpressed reaction to her husband allegedly confusing a cherished memory of her with that of an old love interest in the sixth season episode [...] "Isn't It Romantic?" [...] as a personal favorite, specifically lauding Rashad's pronunciation of [...] "tacky barrette" [...] and [...] "her hairpin turn when Cliff's real gift is revealed that shows that next dimension that always pushed Clair {{to the top of the}} heap." [...] Meanwhile, Kevin O'Keefe, writing for the same publication, selected Clair's enraged monologue to Vanessa in season six's [...] "Off to See the Wretched", followed by the character's dismay upon learning that Sondra has decided not to return to law school, as his favorites, enjoying the way in which Clair adopts an [...] "attack mode" [...] in both circumstances. Reviewing the character's conversation about pregnancy and marriage with Denise in season three's [...] "The Shower", Slates Aisha Harris wrote [...] "written realistically and delivered beautifully by Rashad, the moment attains a level of artistry that spot-on TV lessons rarely reach." [...] When the show aired, both middle and upper-class working women responded well to Clair. However, some few reviewers have occasionally accused the character of being too perfect and one-dimensional, while others found her to be too aggressive, outspoken, lacking in maternity and overly controlling towards both her children and husband. Additionally, some feminist critics did not appreciate the fact that Clair rarely struggles with everyday situations that working mothers typically encounter in real life.|$|E
