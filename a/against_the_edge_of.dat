25|$|On October 1, 2010, Tesla {{issued a}} second product safety recall in the US {{affecting}} 439 Roadsters. The recall involved the 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable from a redundant back-up system. The recall followed an incident where the low voltage auxiliary cable {{in a vehicle}} chafed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a carbon fiber panel, causing a short smoke and a possible fire behind the right front headlamp. This issue {{was limited to the}} 12V low-voltage auxiliary cable and did not involve the main battery pack or main power system.|$|E
25|$|The {{baseplate}} (sole plate) {{is generally}} circular (though this, too, varies by individual models) {{and may be}} used in conjunction with a fence attached to the base, which then braces the router <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the work, or via a straight-edge clamped across the work to obtain a straight cut. Other means of guiding the machine include the template guide bushing secured in the base around the router cutter, or router cutters with built-in guide bearings. Both of these run against a straight edge or shaped template. Without this, the varying reaction of the wood against the torque of the tool makes it impossible to control with the precision normally required.|$|E
25|$|A few {{patients}} {{who have had a}} hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip (iliopsoas) rubs <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather. Incision made {{in the front of the}} hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).|$|E
5|$|Those {{species that}} make easily heard noises usually {{do so by}} rubbing a row of pegs on <b>the</b> hind legs <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{forewings}} (stridulation). These sounds are produced mainly by males to attract females, though in some species the females also stridulate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{boundaries}} between West Tampa and [...] "Anglo Tampa" [...] also blurred as the larger city grew west and south until its suburbs bumped <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> West Tampa. <b>The</b> process concluded in 1925, when West Tampa was formally annexed {{by the city}} of Tampa.|$|R
5000|$|The seal at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mask {{is a wide}} {{tube with}} thin, {{flexible}} walls running around <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mask, full of air at atmospheric pressure. On the surface it pushes <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wearer's face, causing a tight seal despite small variations in head shape. At {{more than a few}} feet depth pressure (underwater or in a caisson) this tube collapses, destroying the seal and making the mask leak.|$|R
25|$|Removing {{contact lenses}} {{incorrectly}} {{could result in}} damage to the lens and injury to the eye so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.|$|E

50|$|A {{steel cage}} match is a match fought within a cage formed by placing sheets of mesh metal around, in, or <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wrestling ring. The most common way of winning is by simply {{escaping}} the cage, either {{over the top}} of the cage wall and having both feet touch the arena floor, or by escaping through the cage door with both feet touching the arena floor. The other occasional ways to win a steel cage match are by pinfall, by submission, though these are less common stipulations in the modern era.|$|R

2500|$|The part of {{the plate}} under the rail base is tapered, setting the cant of the rail, an inward {{rotation}} from the vertical. The usual slope is one in forty ( [...] 1.4 degrees [...] ).

Older single-shoulder types were adaptable for various rail widths, with the single shoulder positioned on the outside (field side) of the rails.

500|$|Musical tones {{produced}} by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and unvoiced th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds <b>of</b> air breaking <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what {{is perceived as a}} poor tone.
