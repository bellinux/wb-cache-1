25|$|Inside Portfolio, Brodovitch {{promoted}} features {{devoted to}} respected artists and designers, contributed articles on vernacular design, and made wildly imaginative layouts. The magazine encompassed {{an array of}} subject matter and design styles. Works of great French poets were interspersed with off-beat articles about graffiti by hobos. It was <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> composed mix-up of all things art. Unfortunately, the publication lasted only three issues. The no-expense-spared ethos of the magazine, paired {{with the lack of}} advertising, caused the magazine to quickly fold.|$|E

25|$|The Rutgers School of Social Work {{was built}} {{as the home}} of the School of Ceramics (now the Department of Materials Science and Engineering) in 1922.

The third floor classroom has <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> enormous gas-fired fireplace which was state of the art when constructed. The floor of the room consists entirely of hand-laid artistic tile, including an unusual feature, a pre-Nazi use of a then-innocuous pattern now known as the swastika.

50|$|Holland {{commented on}} the {{principal}} singers as follows: <b>As</b> <b>beautifully</b> as Renée Fleming sings and as assiduously as she pursues the part, she leaves {{a hole in the}} opera that nothing around it can fill. Ms. Fleming does everything an opera singer can do, but I am not sure that Blanche is a character that opera can ever reach. As Stanley in a baritone part, Rodney Gilfry sings strongly and summons the necessary physical menace. Elizabeth Futral made Stella a satisfying operatic character (and) Anthony Dean Griffey sang touchingly and surely in the tenor role of Mitch.|$|R
25|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> attired Nastassya Filippovna is met by Keller and Burdovsky, who are {{to escort}} her to the church where Myshkin is waiting. A large crowd has gathered, among whom is Rogozhin. Seeing him, Nastassya Filippovna rushes to him and tells him hysterically to take her away, which Rogozhin loses no time in doing. The Prince, though shaken, is not {{particularly}} surprised at this development. For the remainder of the day, he calmly fulfills his social obligations to guests and members of the public. The following morning he takes the first train to Petersburg and goes to Rogozhin's house, but he is told by servants that there is no one there. After several hours of fruitless searching, he returns to the hotel he was staying at when he last encountered Rogozhin in Petersburg. Rogozhin appears and asks him {{to come back to the}} house. They enter the house in secret and Rogozhin leads him to the dead body of Nastassya Filippovna: he has stabbed her through the heart. The two men keep vigil over the body, which Rogozhin has laid out in his study.|$|E

In a review for the website DVD Verdict, David Gutierrez awarded [...] "Attack of the Alligators!" [...] a perfect score of 100, judging it the best of the collection and praising its production values: [...] "It's like <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> directed short film". He elaborated: [...] "'Attack of the Alligators!' serves as a terrific example of how strong Thunderbirds can look. It's not Howdy Doody sporting a jetpack – it's an hour-long programme that feels like a motion picture." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} London production {{opened on}} October 8, 1953, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and was warmly received by both audiences and critics; it ran for 946 performances. The show was restaged by Jerome Whyte. The cast featured Valerie Hobson, {{in her last}} role, as Anna; Herbert Lom as the King; and Muriel Smith as Lady Thiang. [...] Martin Benson played the Kralahome, a role he reprised in the film. Eve Lister was a replacement for Hobson, and George Pastell replaced Lom during the long run. The New York Times theatre columnist Brooks Atkinson saw the production with Lister and Pastell, and thought the cast commonplace, except for Smith, whom he praised both for her acting and her voice. [...] Atkinson commented, [...] "The King and I is <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> written musical drama on a high plane of human thinking. [...] It can survive in a mediocre performance." ...|$|E

Eric Neigher of 1UP.com enjoyed Titan Quest while noting that it stayed within genre traditions: he rounded off his review by saying [...] "While it may not break, or even dent, any new ground, Titan Quest features <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> realized game world based on a tried-and-true core mechanic, with tons of replayability". Jim Rossignol of Eurogamer said that, while it stood high among its contemporary peers, Titan Quest did not evolve the genre {{enough for him to}} really enjoy it. GameSpy's Miguel Lopez praised the visuals, gameplay, character customization and editing tools. His main criticisms were performance difficulties and the large potential for cheating in multiplayer. GameSpot's Ryan Davis called it [...] "the next-best thing" [...] to a new Diablo title, praising its single-player campaign and multiplayer while faulting its familiar feel, inventory system and recurring technical issues.|$|E

Publishers Weekly gave the book a starred review, calling it [...] "the best yet, <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> orchestrated and intelligent novel that succeeds on every level". The review went on to praise the [...] "sharp social commentary and the nifty world building". Kirkus Reviews gave Mockingjay a starred review, saying that the book is exactly what its fans are looking for and that [...] "it will grab them and not let go".

500|$|... 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish {{noted that}} there have been two main {{opinions}} of Mysts slow, puzzle-based gameplay; [...] "Fans consider Myst an elegant, intelligent game for grown-ups, while detractors call it a soulless stroll through a digital museum, more art than game." [...] Game industry executives were confused by Mysts success, not understanding how an [...] "interactive slide show" [...] {{turned out to be a}} huge hit. Online magazine writer Russell Pitts of The Escapist called Myst [...] "unlike anything that had come before, weaving video almost seamlessly into <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> rendered world, presenting a captivating landscape filled with puzzles and mystery. In a game market dominated by Doom clones and simulators, Myst took us by the hand and showed us the future of gaming. It took almost a decade for anyone to follow its lead." [...] Critics from Wired and Salon considered the games approaching the level of art, while authors Henry Jenkins and Lev Manovich pointed out the series as exemplifying the promise of new media to create unseen art forms.|$|E
500|$|... "Half a Life" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} within the United States on May 6, 1991, in broadcast syndication. Keith DeCandido, {{in a review}} for Tor.com, commended Stiers' acting, saying that he gave [...] "a noble, nuanced performance as Timicin." [...] He also approved of the episode, {{saying that it was}} the first time that Lwaxana Troi was treated as a real character without causing him to cringe; at the same time, DeCandido did not forget the problems with her previous appearances on the show. Noting [...] that it was one of the best episodes to feature a Prime Directive debate, DeCandido endorsed the writer's idea not to take sides regarding the suicide. [...] "This is a magnificent, tragic love story, one that takes a thin character and gives her depth, one that gives us <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> realized guest character in Timicin (casting Stiers was a masterstroke, as he always brings subtle nuance to his roles), and one that takes its issues seriously," [...] DeCandido wrote. He gave the episode a score of eight out of ten, later concluding that it featured [...] "one of the show's most tragic love stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was <b>a</b> <b>beautifully</b> fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion of everything else. For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
