Although traditional Chinese Confucian philosophy favored peaceful political solutions and showed contempt for brute military force, the military was influential in most Chinese states.

40|$|The European Union {{has made}} a {{commitment}} to promoting sustainable mobility through <b>advanced</b> transport <b>logistics.</b> One of the principal areas yet to be addressed is that of the potential barriers to <b>advanced</b> transport <b>logistics</b> and the attitudes of industry to this advancement. This paper addresses some of these concerns and argues that competition for high-value contracts can be very tough, especially where the contracts are from large organisations that often prefer to develop a relationship with only one transport service provider. The paper attempts to put the research into a theoretical framework of Resource-Advantage Theory. Empirical evidence is presented from key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and a focus group on the motives for and challenges of forming collaborative ventures. The paper argues that joining forces to form a road haulage consortium can allow small-to-medium operators compete against larger players by improving services to the customer through reduced delivery times and wider geographical coverage. Collaboration has potential benefits not only for freight transport service providers in terms of efficiency and utilisation, but also for the wider society through increased quality of life...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} {{for analysis of}} Combat Logistics Force performance in wartime conditions with stochastic demand. The imposition of randonmess on consumption, transit, and commodity transfer rates is intended to faithfully represent the dynamic environment in which logistics ships operate. An object oriented computer simulation is used to generate data for measuring the days of supply onhand for naval forces in various scenarios. This data is then used to construct cumulative probability distributions with which to compare the ability of different Combat Logistics Force configurations to sustain these naval forces. Analysis results quantity the impact of employing multi-product station ships with carrier battle groups {{in terms of the}} probability of these groups falling below some percentage of capacity measured in days of supply. The impact of additional shuttle ships is demonstrated, as well as the consequence of withdrawing shuttle ship operations from an <b>advance</b> <b>logistics</b> support base. Finally, the simulation is used to find a Combat Logistics Force configuration which minimizes the probability of naval forces exhausting their supplies of propulsion fuel, aviation fuel, provisions, and non-specific ordnance. In these experiments, unclassified approximations of the North Korea and Baltic major regional contingencies are modelled and run independently. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

There are different policy discussions at local and global scales {{in terms of}} food supply and distribution, mainly in urban context that involves the coordination of multiple producers, distributors, logistics operators and traders of foods. When the availability of food is ensured, the food supply is made with high economic, social and environmental costs [1].

50|$|The three-month junior supply officers' course (JSOC) was undertaken, {{certainly}} from 1973, by all junior supply officers {{before their}} first appointment; this became the initial logistics officers' course (maritime) - ILOC (M) - in January 2004. From May 1963, the three-month supply charge course (SCC) prepared senior lieutenants {{for their first}} appointment as supply officer (head of department) in a destroyer, frigate or ocean-going survey ship (the supply officer was often the junior head of department); SCC became the <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> officers course (maritime) - ALOC(M)) - in January 2004 and the professional logistics command course (maritime) - PLCC(M) - in September 2010.

Our purpose is not to make an exhaustive description of the French situation, but to give an understandable view of the current state of those systems. The paper first defines what we call “logistics” in France and in which way it is integrated in firms management (chapter 1). It also points out some geographic, economic and regulation characteristics of French situation that have significant impacts on the development of <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> (chapter 2). It briefly presents the most relevant <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> organisations in manufacturing, distribution, and logistics supply. It points out the so-called “driving forces” which lead French firms to develop such systems (chapter 3). The paper then focuses on <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> characteristics observed in France, and presents the main information and communication systems that are at their basis (chapter 4). As a conclusion, it presents the main difficulties that firms still have to overcome to develop <b>advanced</b> <b>logistics</b> and its further developments...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{feedstock}} {{supply chain}} logistics {{and the associated}} costs are key to building a sustainable biofuels industry, as biomass conversion facilities that rely on an unsustainable biomass supply quickly become unsustainable to operate. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has developed cost and quantity targets for biofuels production, requiring large quantities of biomass that meet aggressive cost targets. Analyses performed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have shown that these targets cannot be met with conventional biomass logistics systems. Therefore, INL has developed an advanced, commodity-based Uniform Format biomass feedstock logistics system that addresses barriers to meeting these goals and enables DOE targets to be met.
