5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage.

According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode.

Cohen got in contact with <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, and at {{the urging}} of Shufeldt, Heilmann devoted much of the next few years {{attempting}} to find an English–language publisher willing to undertake a translation of his work. None of the larger publishers he approached were willing to do so unless Heilmann himself was prepared to finance it, which he was unable to do. In the meantime, Heilmann took the opportunity to revise and improve his manuscript, which included information he acquired from examining the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx {{for the first time in}} 1923 at the invitation of Josef Felix Pompeckj, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Natural History Museum in Berlin. Examining this important specimen in person allowed Heilmann to add some additional details and revisions to his understanding of the hip, the skull, and the flight feathers. With the help of the English paleontologist Arthur Smith Woodward of the British Museum, he finally met success in finding a small London publisher willing to produce an English version of his manuscript in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, <b>a</b> <b>professor</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
