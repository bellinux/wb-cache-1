The Northern Commercial Company built a store to replace Barnette's cabin, and Wickersham recorded {{a wide range}} of businesses, including 500 houses and 1,200 people. To manage the growing population, the settlement held <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> November 10, 1903 to decide whether to incorporate Fairbanks as a town or not. The vote passed, and Barnette was sworn in as the city's first mayor on the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{carried over into}} the 2010 session and Lingle stated in January 2010 that the bill was a {{distraction}} from the budget {{and should not be}} voted on for final passage in the Senate. Senator Brian Taniguchi argued the legislature could work on several issues simultaneously and the bill would pass. If passed, the amended bill would have to be approved by the House of Representatives. Speaker of the House Calvin Say stated that <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the bill would depend on whether the Senate passed the bill with enough votes to override a gubernatorial veto, arguing that {{he does not want to}} force <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> controversial legislation in an election year if the bill's approval was in doubt. The Senate bill contains an effective date of January 1, 2010, and if the language is not changed, the bill could be vetoed regardless of its content.|$|E

5|$|Academic {{dress is}} {{required}} for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held amongst the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations – 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum. This was widely interpreted by students as being <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> not so much making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow. In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.|$|E
5|$|During this time, St. Anthony, on {{the east}} side, was {{separate}} from Minneapolis, on the west side. As a result of inferior management of the water power, St. Anthony found its manufacturing district declining. Some people and organizations started to talk about merging the two cities. A citizens' committee recommended merging the two cities in 1866, but <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> this issue was rejected in 1867. Minneapolis incorporated as a city in 1867. The two cities found themselves competing with St. Paul, which had a larger population, the head of navigation of the Mississippi River, and more access to railroads.|$|E

5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies that Republicans promised to bring to <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> a procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed {{the presence of a}} glioblastoma, which is a very aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E

5|$|Shiller {{defeated}} Reed {{again in}} 2003, {{this time with}} 58% of the vote. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2004 budget. Shiller was the only alderman who did not cast <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> {{the passage of the}} Big Box Ordinance, which required large retailers to pay a living wage. Target sent a letter to Mayor Daley and alderman indicating that if the ordinance were not overturned, they would not proceed on projects in Chicago. Shiller voted to sustain Daley's veto.|$|E
5|$|Temperance {{became a}} part of the evangelical Protestant {{initiative}} during Indiana's pioneer era and early statehood. Many Hoosiers freely indulged in drinking locally distilled whiskey on a daily basis, with binges on election days and holidays, and during community celebrations Reformers announced that the devil was at work and must be repudiated. A state temperance society formed in 1829 and local temperance societies soon organized in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Logansport. By the 1830s pietistic (evangelical) Protestants and community leaders had joined forces to curb consumption of alcohol. In 1847 the Indiana General Assembly passed a local option bill that allowed <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> whether to prohibit alcohol sales in a township.|$|E

The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives, but on January 29, House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the bill, which was approved by voice vote. No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on the bill for 2010 unless two-thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill, and it was considered dead.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he shared}} {{interests}} in both philanthropy and military affairs with his father, they eventually had a falling out while Johnston {{served as a}} State Assemblyman, and was bitterly opposed by his father in <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the 1889 World's Fair Bill. The feud became so heated that while Johnston was Mayor of Tivoli, his father, who owned the building where the town government met, barred his son from entering the building. The village government was forced {{to move to another}} building and remained there until 1894, when they finally returned to de Peyster's building. Another incident occurred and was reported in the press when Johnston's mother fell ill, and he visited her at the de Peyster family home and was violently assaulted by his father. The father {{went so far as to}} run against his son for Mayor of Tivoli in 1900, but was defeated in the general election.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending {{to the full}} Senate that it be {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year grace period to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E

Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, and asked for <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> whether the body {{should be returned to}} the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. When the body was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E
5|$|The Whitlam Government {{implemented}} {{a large number}} of new programs and policy changes, including the termination of military conscription, institution of universal health care and free university education, and the implementation of legal aid programs. With the opposition-controlled Senate delaying passage of bills, Whitlam called a double dissolution election in 1974 in which he won a majority in the House of Representatives, albeit a slightly reduced one, and picked up three Senate seats.The Whitlam government then instituted the first and only 1974 joint sitting enabled under s. 57 of the Constitution as part of the double dissolution process. Despite the government's second election victory, the opposition, reacting to government scandals and a flagging economy suffering from the 1973 oil crisis and the 1973–75 recession, continued to obstruct the government's program in the Senate. In late 1975, the Opposition Senators refused to allow <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> the government's appropriation bills, returning them to the House of Representatives with a demand that the government go to an election, thus denying the government supply. Whitlam refused to back down, arguing that his government, which held a clear majority in the House of Representatives, was being held to ransom by the Senate. The crisis ended on 11 November, when Whitlam arrived at a pre-arranged meeting with the Governor-General, Sir John Kerr, at Government House in order to call a half-Senate election. Kerr dismissed him and commissioned the opposition leader, Malcolm Fraser, as prime minister. Labor lost the subsequent election by a landslide.|$|E
