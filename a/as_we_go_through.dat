500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give you three hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E

I noted a row of straw beehives, beehive-shaped, beehives of the type long since condemned as inefficient by all progressive minds, and in the doctor's acre of grass a flock of two whole sheep was grazing,--no doubt he'd taken them on account.

Feige added that “We didn’t want to re-invent the wheel the new logo, but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, which is why it starts with the flip, but suddenly it’s more dimensional <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the lettering and it reveals itself with the metallic sheen before settling into the white-on-red, well known Marvel logo, with the added flourish of the arrival and the announcement of the Studios {{at the bottom of the}} word Marvel.” Imaginary Forces used the same animation technique on the updated logo, as they did when they created the first version in 2002.
