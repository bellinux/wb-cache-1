Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol was administered to several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

2500|$|After the war, Cade recuperated {{very briefly}} in Heidelberg Hospital, then {{took up a}} {{position}} at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments {{which led to the}} discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. Since he had no sophisticated <b>analytical</b> <b>equipment</b> these experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of guinea pigs. His early experiments suggested to him that the urine from manic patients was more toxic. There are 2 toxic substances in urine: urea and uric acid. He found urea was the same in both ill and healthy people. He started to work on uric acid. In order to do that, he made artificial solutions of uric acid. To make up different strengths of uric acid he needed to convert it unto a substance that he could more easily manipulate. On its own uric acid would not dissolve in water. Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium was added to make a solution of lithium urate. [...] Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with lithium carbonate solution, as a control solution, the guinea pigs were more restful. His use of careful controls in his experiments revealed that the lithium ion had a calming effect by itself, but even this finding may have been caused by the toxic effects of an excessive dose of Lithium. [...] After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans, Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with mania, dementia præcox or melancholia, with outstanding results. [...] The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Measurement of trace {{elements}} {{is playing a}} vital role in industries and various sectors of science and technology including semiconductors, food, health and environmental sectors. In most of the cases a small error in measurement can vitiate all the measures taken for quality control and management. Many decisions regarding the suitability of materi l/products are based on the analysis. To reduce or eliminate the rejection rate of the products, accurate and reliable measurements are needed which can be achieved by the use of certified reference materials (CRMs). Their use in calibration of <b>analytical</b> <b>equipments</b> and validation of test methods ensures high quality in measurements and it provides traceability to the measurement data with national/international measurement systems (SI unit) also. In the present scenario of globalization of economy, use of certified reference materials (CRMs) in measurements is essential for global acceptance of products and test reports. Their use fulfil a mandatory requirement of international quality systems (ISO 9000, ISO/IEC standard 17025) including our national accredit tion body, National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL), World Trade Organization (WTO) etc. International manufac-turers of CRMs are meeting most of the requirement of CRMs of the country.

40|$|Chemical {{constituents}} in ice core {{samples are}} proxy for past environmental {{condition of the}} earth. Conventional method for major ion analysis requies liquid samples preparation from ice core samples. Cutting and decontamination process of ice sample is labor work in cold laboratory and clean room. And these process make difficult for high spatial resolution analysis. Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA) system is developed by Sigg and others (1994) and it is applied for GRIP ice core analyis. This system foward the chamical analysis and improved resolution in mm order. Röthlsberger and others(2000) improved CFA for low concentration and firn sample. Present CFA system connects many <b>analytical</b> <b>equipments</b> in order to determinate many chamical species in liquid and composition of air. But uncertain of depth for each analysis is remained. We planed to develop CFA-IC system which is conbination of continuous melting of ice sample and chamical analysis using ion chromatography. Simillar system is already developed by Huber and others (2001) and therefore we made simillar flow line with this. Analysis speed ion chromatograpy is quite slow and unsuitable for CFA but it can analyse more than 10 ion species from same sample of 1 cc and this is advantage for comparison with physical property analysis of ice core study. Present situation of our development is complete to make flow line and program of control/monitor for each devices. We are now making sequencial program for whole control of CFA system. 第 4 回極域科学シンポジウム個別セッション：[OM] 気水圏 11 月 15 日（金） 国立極地研究所 ３階ラウン...|$|R
