25|$|In 1969 the French government's foreign {{relations}} underwent a change with Charles de Gaulle leaving office and Georges Pompidou taking over as president. This {{change in policy}} included improving French relations with French speaking African countries, which resulted in defense accords with Senegal. Talks about the purchase of French fighters started in December 1971, but the French government was then worried that Portuguese Mirage fighters stationed in Africa would be in range of Guinea-Conakry and Senegal, and would result in protests against France by these countries. In 1972 France gave permission {{for the start of}} negotiations as long as conditions for the basing of the aircraft were agreed on before <b>any</b> <b>acquisition</b> took place. However, by then the Portuguese government was facing financial problems and the difference between Portugal's and France's strategy for Africa had also further slowed any talks.|$|E
500|$|In {{light of}} a Cuban uprising, President James K. Polk refused {{solicitations}} from filibuster backer John L. O'Sullivan and stated his belief that <b>any</b> <b>acquisition</b> of the island must be an [...] "amicable purchase." [...] Under orders from Polk, Secretary of State James Buchanan prepared an offer of $100 million, but [...] "sooner than see [...] transferred to any power, [...] would prefer seeing it sunk into the ocean." [...] The Whig administrations of presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore did not pursue the matter and took a harsher stand against filibusters as Venezuelan Narciso Lopez, with federal troops intercepting several expeditions bound for Cuba. When Franklin Pierce took office in 1853, however, he was committed to Cuba's annexation.|$|E
2500|$|One caveat, however, was the [...] "one owner, one vote" [...] {{provision}} of the cooperative's bylaws. <b>Any</b> <b>acquisition</b> of one station by an existing station owner triggered an automatic redistribution of the acquired station's shares among the other owners. As a result, even though it owned 11 of CTV's 24 affiliates, Baton still had only had one vote out of eight.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{witness to}} appear for the prosecution, {{forensic}} psychiatrist Park Dietz, began his testimony on February 12. Dietz {{testified that he}} did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect {{at the time that he}} committed the crimes, stating: [...] "Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses." [...] He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive. Although Dietz did concede <b>any</b> <b>acquisition</b> of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice, he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: [...] "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He had to drink alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do." [...] Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both Return of the Jedi and The Exorcist III; particularly the level of [...] power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer would occasionally view scenes from these films before searching for a victim. Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with substance use disorder, paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.|$|E

5000|$|Telstra {{submitted}} {{that this}} conclusion is not denied by the provisions of Section 152EB which deal expressly with the subject of just terms. If a Commonwealth law provides for the acquisition of property on unjust terms, then Section 51(xxxi) renders that law invalid, since it is beyond the legislative powers of the Commonwealth to create such a law, then Section 152EB, the final provision of Part XIC of the Trade Practices Act, acts to save that law from invalidity, via reasonable compensation by the Commonwealth. Telstra argued that this provision did not save the impugned provisions from invalidity stating that relevant acquisitions [...] "occur by the imposition of the standard access obligations on carriers or providers pursuant to Section 152AR" [...] and not by any ACCC determination. Furthermore, <b>any</b> <b>acquisition</b> only comes into operation when a relevant request for the service is made by a provider, and not by any ACCC determination. Telstra stated that Section 152EB should be considered engaged only in respect to determinations that effect an acquisition, {{and that the only}} relevant determinations are those made by the ACCC. Thus, Telstra argued, this provision did not apply to <b>any</b> <b>acquisition</b> effected by Section 152AR since the relevant acquisition is effected by the provider’s request for access engaging the standard obligations under Section 152AR, and not by any determination made by the ACCC.|$|E
