40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} determine the extent of forestry-induced acidification of salmonid rivers and streams in acid sensitive catchments of County Wicklow. The study involved a detailed chemical examination of four selected acid sensitive catchments from January to May 2004, viz. Vartry Reservoir Inflows, Cloghoge River, Glendalough Lake Upper and the King’s River. Sampling sites varied as to the characteristics of their catchment, e. g. <b>afforested,</b> partially <b>afforested,</b> moorland and areas harvested of trees, allowing for comparisons of chemical data. It was demonstrated that streams draining <b>afforested</b> catchments were artificially acidified compared to non-forested streams. Statistical analysis rejected the null hypothesis (ANOVA: F > F Critical, T-Test: t stat > t Critical) that there was no significant difference in surface water chemical quality between <b>afforested</b> and moorland sampling sites and <b>afforested</b> and clearfelled sites. There were highly significant differences between <b>afforested</b> and moorland sites for pH, alkalinity, total aluminium, colour, TON, chloride and calcium at all catchments. Streams draining heavily <b>afforested</b> catchments were shown to experience greater acid episodes compared to partially or non-forested streams. The data presented in this report furthers our understanding of acidification due to afforestation in Ireland and coupled with past and present research, should assist in a review of the Forestry and Water Quality Guidelines, especially with regard to designation of acid-sensitivity and remediation measures...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} how organic C (OC) accumulates in <b>afforested</b> soils and {{to quantify the}} contribution of aggregate-associated OC to OC accumulation, we investigated the changes in soil structure, total soil OC, and aggregate-associated OC from 0 - to 10 - and 10 - to 20 -cm depths in <b>afforested</b> forests and adjacent farmlands of northwestern China. We assessed the contribution of macroaggregate-associated OC increase to total soil OC accumulation. Afforestation increased macroaggregate amount, mean weight diameter, and mean geometric diameter but decreased the amount of microaggregate and silt + clay-sized fractions. The improvement of soil structure was greater in surface than subsurface soils and was greater in soils <b>afforested</b> with white birch than in soils <b>afforested</b> with other tree species. Fifty years after afforestation, total soil OC concentrations and stocks and aggregate-associated OC concentrations increased depending on soil depth and tree species. Afforestation increased macroaggregate-associated OC stocks but decreased microaggregate- and silt + clay-associated OC stocks. Soil OC stocks and changes in OC stocks after afforestation mainly depended on macroaggregate-associated OC stocks and their changes.

40|$|The {{concept and}} {{structure}} of the Spatial Decision Support System <b>AFFOREST</b> sDSS dealing with environmental performance (EP) of afforestation on agricultural land in northwestern Europe, is presented. EP is defined in terms of three environmental impact categories: (1) carbon sequestration (2) groundwater recharge and (3) nitrate leaching. The core of the sDSS is a raster based geographical database which allows for queries addressing 14 types of questions on where, how and how long to <b>afforest</b> in order to reach a desired EP or change in EP due to afforestation of the agricultural land. First the study area is differentiated according to the site conditions (based on soil texture, soil drainage, initial land use, yearly average precipitation, and yearly average N deposition. Then the EP for every site class is computed as a function of time using the VSAM metamodel. VSAM results from a conceptual simplification of an existing mechanistic point model, the forest process model SMART 2. Input data for the metamodel are limited to the classified site conditions, the tree species used for afforestation, the afforestation strategy and the evaluation time. Besides limiting the data requirements, the metamodel approach allows for rapid and flexible computations on large numbers of pixel classes. Finally, {{depending on the type of}} question, the sDSS creates georeferenced outputs based on SQL-type spatial or attribute queries and more advanced multiple goal programming techniques...|$|E

40|$|A forest/tree {{model has}} been {{developed}} of which the main growth processes {{are based on the}} CENW model. The model links the flows of carbon (C)), energy, nutrients and water in trees and soil organic matter. Modelled tree growth depends on physiological plant factors, the size of plant pools, such as foliage mass, environmental factors, such as temperature and rainfall, and the total amount and turn-over rates of soil organic matter, which drives mineraliZation of soil organic nitrogen (N). The forest/tree {{model has been}} developed as a generic model for coniferous trees. In addition, the model has been extended generically for deciduous trees by shedding of leaves in autumn and including growth buds in which C can be stored during winter time, and from which re-growth is initiated in spring. In spring the initial C gives the leaf activity an augmentation for photosynthesis. For the purpose of the available input parameters in the <b>AFFOREST</b> project it was needed to change the daily time step of the original CENW-model into a fortnightly time step. In relation to this, the original simple hump functions for N, water and temperature dependencies are replaced by smooth minimum/optimum/maximum functions. The model was validated against data obtained for Quercus robur (Oak) from the <b>AFFOREST</b> chronosequence in Vestskoven in Denmark. The different tree stands covered a chronosequence over a period of 35 years. The forest/tree model was successfully able to simulate all aspects of tree growth, which included water, N and C dynamics reflected in biomass production.

We sampled Rs monthly for three years in two adjacent plots, one left as control in natural condition, and one <b>afforested</b> with Acacia saligna. Sampling occurred 3 e 6 years after afforestation. Soil temperature (Ts) was a good predictor of Rs on certain periods of the year, although we could not relate this to specific levels of soil moisture (q). Seasonal Rs variation related more to q than to Ts, which {{could be explained by}} extremely low annual precipitation (138 mm), concentrated during winter months.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the development of}} the METAFORE metamodel for the <b>AFFOREST</b> project, focusing on aspects that are important in defining the role of the metamodel in the entire system. Two modes are distinguished: one in which the METAFORE metamodel operates in a batch mode for generating the AFFOREST-sDSS tables for decision support, and another mode of operating with an extended user interface and extended possibilities for evaluating detailed results. The various detailed process-based models are from different sources and each of the institutes had experts on the processes that were modelled. From these models, the individual partners developed meta-descriptions of their parts of the system. The task of the METAFORE metamodel was to combine all this knowledge into a single model executable, and assure a correct calculation of the values needed for the <b>AFFOREST</b> database and the AFFOREST-sDSS. The design of the METAFORE distinguishes a metamodel framework and the model components or submodels. The metamodel framework focuses on the interface and communication between the different submodels and it is responsible for the communication between the submodels. In this design, the submodels are merely servers, waiting to be initialized or called to perform one step of the simulation (i. e. one month or one year of the simulation). To do this, each submodel has only a limited set of exposed methods. Although the detailed process models, as part of their scientific development process, have been extensively validated and calibrated, this does not automatically assure a proper simulation of the processes by the metamodel. During the entire process of the development of METAFORE, the simulation behaviour of the METAFORE modules were constantly tested against the detailed process models. In the end, METAFORE has been developed as a simplification of the detailed models with a lesser demand on data. This means that the detailed behaviour in the process models can at best result in similar but aggregated behaviour in the METAFORE metamodel. It is concluded that the results are satisfactory...|$|E

The results provide rare quantitative evidence that strong lifestyle and productivist motivations significantly affect farmers’ behaviour. Environmental values and perceptions regarding the extent to which forestry is seen as a component of a natural landscape were two further factors found to affect the probability of participation.

40|$|Farmer's {{decisions}} {{to invest in}} renewable energy sources can contribute to lower greenhouse gas and mitigate climate change. However, it remains unclear how associated high sunk establishment costs, long-term commitment, highly uncertain net returns, and policy induced incentives could drive farmer's decision to <b>afforest</b> agricultural land. A real option model is used to theoretically frame the decision to switch from agriculture to energy forestry. Optimal investment timing is modeled and the functioning of government subsidies offered {{to speed up the}} switch to energy forestry is analyzed. The empirical analysis examines the establishment of new short-rotation coppice willow stands in Central East Sweden. It is shown that in the presence of volatile agricultural profits and high establishment costs, subsidies are needed to accelerate investment. We then examine the case of the municipality of Enköping and show that the combination of governmental subsidies for energy forestry with compensation for sewage sludge treatment provides an effective stimulus to investment in new willow stands which also has environmental benefits. © 2013 Elsevier B.
