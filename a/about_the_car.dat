In the episode, Michael Britten finds out the truth <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> accident that caused his split realities, and seeks out those responsible for it. He finds out that Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) caused the accident, alongside Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman) and Captain Carl Kessel (Mark Harelik).|$|E
5|$|While {{proud to}} be the first French World Champion, Prost, annoyed that French journalists were proclaiming it as a win for France, pointed out in {{interviews}} that other than himself, nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> (the MP4/2B) {{had anything to do with}} France. The team was British (having been founded by a New Zealander), the tyres were American Goodyears, the TAG-Porsche engine was German, the chassis itself was built by Hercules Aerospace in the USA, and was sponsored by an American tobacco company (Marlboro) and the Saudi Arabian owned company Techniques d'Avant Garde (TAG).|$|E

25|$|The car {{stayed on}} the lead lap, until a minor safety-car hiccup saw it go down a lap, and {{seemingly}} out of race contention. New co-driver Russell Ingall {{was told by the}} team to not worry <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and just push 110% {{for the rest of the}} day - to spare nothing. When the leading Richards/Skaife Commodore retired with a failed diff, Ingall scrambled the car back onto the lead lap. Between them, Perkins and Ingall spent the rest of the race gradually whittling back the gap to the leaders.|$|E
25|$|However, for the {{endurance}} races and the Australian Grand Prix support races, Perkins Engineering picked up significant sponsorship from Bob Jane T-Marts, {{and the car}} was painted yellow and blue, the colours of the T-Marts. Driving with Steve Harrington, Perkins proved there was life in the older model VL Commodore which won first time out in Bob Jane colours at the 1992 Don't Drink Drive Sandown 500 after a late race battle with the BMW M3 Evolution of Tony Longhurst and Paul Morris. Perkins then sensationally put the Commodore onto the front row for the 1992 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst, but alternator and tyre problems in the rainstorms that marred the race (and eventually caused its early finish) saw them eventually finish in 9th place. While driving the older VL, Perkins also pointed out during the top ten runoff at Bathurst that the only 'old' thing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was its superseded body shape. The speed of the Perkins VL at Bathurst {{raised questions about the}} legality of the car, though {{it should be noted that}} Perkins' qualifying time of 2:14.08 was only 0.74 seconds faster than he had qualified in 1990. Also, in that same time period other cars such as the Sierra's and the 4WD, twin-turbo Nissan GTR had also improved their own lap times at Bathurst by around 2–3 seconds per lap.|$|E
25|$|After {{travelling}} to Malaysia for {{the second}} round of the season, Alonso was passed fit to take part in the event after undergoing medical tests at the track. In the season opener, his Ferrari replacement Sebastian Vettel had finished on the podium, whilst McLaren occupied the last row with huge difficulties with the performance of the car and the new engine package. In spite of this, Alonso stated at the aforementioned press conference that he had no regrets about leaving Ferrari for McLaren, saying that he was no longer content with just podium finishes after 14 years in Formula One and therefore was prepared to take risks in order to win. In the race, Alonso failed to finish after overheating issues with his car's hybrid system. Notably, Vettel won the race, prompting Alonso to once again a couple of weeks later publicly defend his decision saying that it was 'difficult to keep the trust' amid Ferrari's attempts to persuade him the 2015 car was going to be a big improvement. He said that he would only suggest the move was a mistake should Ferrari actually win the title in November. Having been lapped and outside the points in the , Alonso suggested he was just happy to finish the race to gather information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Alonso collided with 2014 teammate Kimi Räikkönen during the first lap of the , sending his car briefly airborne and landing on Räikkönen's sidepod. Both drivers were unhurt and the incident was ruled as a 'race incident' with Räikkönen spinning in front of Alonso due to wheelspin. At the , Alonso managed to score his first point of the season. At the , he finished fifth, his best result since rejoining McLaren. It was also the first time both drivers finished in the points as Jenson Button finished in ninth. However he failed to score any further points in the remainder of the season.|$|E

In an August 2009 edition of The New Yorker, Lutz was quoted as saying, [...] "All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, along comes Tesla.

It really does shake about. And, of course, once you excite the chassis the door panels start rattling and squeaking. Whereas the other cars feel taut and solid, this one's like a big go-kart with a plastic body on it." [...] He severely criticized the old racing technology: [...] "It's not even '60s technology, from a frame point of view, it's '50s twin-tube technology, not even a spaceframe. It's only got local frames to hold the bulkhead to the dash, attach the front suspension, rear suspension and rollbar. And then you have the marketing Kevlar glues in with a quarter inch of rubber." ...|$|E

The Pacer was heavy; Car & Driver wrote, [...] "American Motors had already quoted a curb weight of 2990 lb. for the basic Pacer when we first wrote <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and that already seemed quite heavy; but when we weighed the test car (whose air conditioning, automatic transmission, power steering and so forth would not account for the full difference) it registered an astounding 3425 lb.", and the standard [...] I6, with a single-barrel carburetor and optimized for low emissions (all vehicles at the time carried emissions-reducing devices, including Exhaust Gas Recirculation); was relatively low-powered ("The Pacer comes with either of two AMC inline six-cylinder engines, both producing 100 bhp, but the larger 258-cu-in. unit delivering better mid-range torque").

2500|$|... 1990 was the 500th World Championship Grand Prix ever held; and it {{came after}} yet more {{controversial}} events at Suzuka. Senna had crashed into Prost at the very first corner on the first lap of the race; and he won the Drivers' Championship for the second time. The Australian Grand Prix that year was an incredibly exciting race: Senna led for 61 laps, but crashed {{near the entrance to}} the permanent race course because of gearbox problems. The race then turned into a dead-heat sprint between Nelson Piquet in his Benetton-Ford and Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari. Mansell charged through the field and repeatedly broke the lap record in pursuit of his former Williams teammate. This almost ended in disaster when the Ferrari almost hit the Benetton {{at the end of the}} Brabham Straight in a last-ditch overtaking move on the last lap. Piquet won from the Ferrari's of Mansell and Prost. There was pre-race controversy when Prost refused to take part in both the annual end of season drivers' photo and the special photo shoot with the World Champions in attendance (including legendary five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio, three-time champions Sir Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, and Nelson Piquet; and other world champions James Hunt, Alan Jones, Denny Hulme and Senna), as Prost was still disgusted and angry did not wish to appear in the photos with Senna following their controversial first corner crash in the previous race in Japan which gave the [...] World Championship to Senna. The 1991 race was notable for being held in extremely wet and tricky conditions and the race was eventually stopped after 14 of the scheduled 82 laps and Ayrton Senna was declared the winner. Prost had been fired from Ferrari for making unsavory comments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> after Suzuka; he did not compete in this race. The Drivers' Championship had already been decided in Senna's favour; but the Constructors' Championship was still yet to be decided between McLaren and Williams. Senna's victory plus his teammate Gerhard Berger's third gave McLaren its fourth consecutive Constructors' Championship; Williams (which was behind McLaren in points) drivers Mansell finished second (but crashed near the race's end at the chicane after the pits) and Riccardo Patrese finished fifth. This race has the record of being the shortest ever Formula One race as it only lasted 52 kilometres (33 miles)/24 minutes. Triple World Champion Nelson Piquet, who finished fifth, retired from Grand Prix racing following the race. 1992 saw Senna drive very hard to try to stay with new world champion Mansell's dominant Williams; this ended in Senna running into the back of Mansell at the last corner. Mansell retired from Formula One and went to compete in CART in the United States; Senna's teammate Gerhard Berger won the race. 1993 saw Senna win what was to be his 41st and final victory and final race for McLaren ahead of Alain Prost, who was competing in his final Formula One race in a Williams before he too retired. Senna embraced his once extremely bitter rival Prost on the podium. It was announced around this time that the Australian Grand Prix would be moving to Melbourne for 1996.|$|E
