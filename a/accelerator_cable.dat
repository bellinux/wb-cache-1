50|$|Senna {{led from}} the start, with Berger {{overtaking}} Prost when the Frenchman momentarily could not engage second gear. The first corner at St Devote saw a variety of accidents: Alex Caffi in his new Dallara-Ford hit the wall, AGS's Philippe Streiff retired from a stunning 12th place on the grid when an <b>accelerator</b> <b>cable</b> broke, and World Champion Nelson Piquet collided with Eddie Cheever's Arrows-Megatron which forced his retirement {{at the end of}} the first lap. With Nakajima's failure to qualify and Piquet's race only lasting one lap, Monaco in 1988 was a total disaster for Lotus.|$|E

50|$|IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity is a {{bimonthly}} peer-reviewed scientific journal covering {{research on}} applications of superconductivity and other relevant technology. Electronic applications include analog and digital circuits employing thin films and active {{devices such as}} Josephson junctions. Large-scale applications include magnets for power applications such as motors, generators, magnetic resonance, <b>accelerators,</b> and <b>cable</b> applications such as power transmissions. The journal was established in 1991 and is published by the IEEE Council on Superconductivity. The editor-in-chief is Britton L. T. Plourde (Syracuse University). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2013 impact factor of 1.324.|$|R
40|$|In {{particle}} <b>accelerators</b> coaxial <b>cables</b> {{are commonly}} used to transmit wideband beam signals covering many decades of frequencies over long distances. Those transmission lines often have a corrugated outer and/or inner conductor. This particular construction exhibits {{a significant amount of}} frequency dependent group delay variation. A comparison of simulations based on theoretical models and S 11 and S 21 network analyzer measurements up to 2. 5 GHz is presented. It is shown how the non-linear phase response and varying group delay leads to ringing in the pulse response and subsequent distortion of signals transmitted through such coaxial transmission lines...|$|R

40|$|Fast-cycling {{magnetic}} fields, {{produced by}} superconducting magnets of modern <b>accelerators,</b> generate <b>cable</b> losses, which reduce with increase of contact resistance between wires in the cable. On {{the other hand}} the contact resistance has to have enough small value {{in order to provide}} flow of currents between wires. At IHEP it was carried out the study of crossover resistances in Rutherford type superconducting cable with a different resistive coating of wires in order to find the optimal coating, satisfying both above-mentioned conditions. Values of crossover resistance were measured for 19 -strand cables, made from wires with NbTi filaments into copper matrix with a different coating (Ni, Cr and natural oxide). Also dependence of resistance on pressure was studied in the region, corresponding for pressure values, produced in the coils of superconducting magnets for accelerators. Besides the obtained experimental results, the description of features of samples and measuring technique are presented as well as the outcome of calculations of cable component of losses for fast-ramping dipole magnet with two-layer coil...|$|R

40|$|In the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN 22 km of {{flexible}} superconducting cable, the auxiliary busbar cable, will conduct currents {{of up to}} 600 A to {{a large number of}} corrector magnets distributed throughout the <b>accelerator.</b> A prototype <b>cable</b> with 42 active conductors underwent several experiments to measure the hot spot temperature and the quench propagation velocity {{as a function of the}} current. The former was evaluated for various energy extraction scenarios as they are foreseen for the LHC corrector circuits. The experimental results and the heat flow simulations show that the quench behavior in this busbar prototype is strongly influenced by the heat flow through the insulation material (polyimide) into the helium bath, leading to stable configurations above the critical temperature T/sub c/ for currents between 250 A and 500 A. Special attention was paid to the study of discontinuities in the wires, like feedthroughs, where the wire is not immersed in liquid helium, and joints, where the wire cross-section is increased. The experiments and simulations led to a thorough understanding of the quench process in the wires of the prototype cable, which resulted in guidelines for the design, the use and the installation of the cable in the LHC.

The EuCARD 2 collaboration is closely liaising with similar programs for high field accelerator magnets in the USA and Japan. The main focus of EuCARD 2 WP 10 is the development of a 10 kA-class superconducting, high current density <b>cable</b> suitable for <b>accelerator</b> magnets, The <b>cable</b> will be used to wind a stand-alone magnet 500 mm long and with an aperture of 40 mm. This magnet should yield 5 T, when stand-alone, and will enable to reach a 15 to 18 T dipole field by placing it in a large bore background dipole of 12 - 15 T. REBCO based Roebel cables is the baseline. Various magnet configurations with HTS tapes are under investigation and also use of Bi- 2212 round wire based cables is considered. The paper presents the structure of the collaboration and describes the main choices made {{in the first year of}} the program, which has a breadth of five to six years of which four are covered by the FP 7 frame...|$|R
