5000|$|The {{introduction}} of earnings-related unemployment and sickness benefits significantly reduced inequalities between those in work {{and those who}} were unemployed. In 1964, the net income received by the <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earner,</b> when on unemployment or sickness benefit, was only 45% of what he received at work, whereas by 1968 the figure had increased to 75%. The earnings-related supplement for unemployment benefits was made available to those who had earned at least £450 in the previous financial year. The supplement was paid after a twelve-day waiting period, and the rate was one-third the amount by which the average weekly earnings (up to £30) exceeded £9. The earnings-related supplement was based on the assertion that a person's commitments for mortgages, rents, and hire purchase agreements were related to their normal earnings and could not be adjusted quickly when experiencing a loss of normal income. As a result of this supplement, the total benefit of a married man with two children went up by 52%, and that of a single man by 117.% The duration was limited to 26 weeks, while the total benefit was restricted to 85% of average weekly earnings in the preceding financial year. From 1965 to 1970, including Earnings Related Supplement, unemployment or sickness benefits as a percentage of net income at average earnings rose from 27% to 53.3% for a single person, 41.2% to 65.2% for a married couple, and from 49.3% to 72.7% for a married couple with two children. According to one study, the {{introduction of}} earnings-related unemployment benefits increased the unemployment income “of a typical married man with two children from 40 percent to 60 percent of average employment income.” ...|$|E
40|$|In July, 1989, when 11 {{units of}} newly constructed, {{affordable}} housing were {{offered for sale}} in Boston's South End, 500 people applied for those units. 299 were qualified buyers. This example illustrates the level of demand for reasonably priced housing that exists in Boston. A study by Kenneth Leventhal & Company gives some insight into why this demand is so great: in 1988, {{the average price of}} a home in Boston was $ 196, 600 which required a household income of $ 50, 467. Only 30 percent of Boston area households could afford the average priced home. However, the average wage paid in the city of Boston in 1988 was approximately $ 28, 000. In other words, the <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earner</b> cannot afford the average yearly cost. In the never-ending quest to produce housing at an affordable cost, many strategies have been employed to compensate builders for their costs. This thesis looks for ways to control costs by comparing hard and soft construction costs of four residential developments in the city with four developments in the suburbs. It presents construction cost data broken down by trade in order to further isolate differences existing between urban and suburban projects. It then analyzes th...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{with the}} Great Depression ignore decades of globalisation, write SHAHAR HAMEIRI and TOBY CARROLL On 29 Sepember, US$ 1. 2 {{trillion}} was wiped off {{the value of}} the New York Stock Exchange as members of the House of Representatives in the US, under pressure from constituents, voted against the US$ 700 billon bailout package designed to resuscitate the financial system. The knockback sent reverberations around the world, with markets falling sharply from Europe to East Asia. What this knockback demonstrated, despite the “we are all capitalists now” proclamations of recent years, is that many Americans feel little affinity with the Wall Street set who had been “managing” their investments and who had extended their mortgages (without worrying about who would extend the cash needed to service them). Many argue that this is a crisis of regulation, or a crisis of responsibility and ethics, as if these were technical problems to be tweaked. However, the roots of the political (as opposed to the strictly financial) crisis we are currently witnessing run much deeper. A quarter of a century of globalisation has fundamentally transformed not only our economies, but also our states and societies, leaving politicians few options. While the current crisis has often been compared to the Great Depression of the 1930 s, the two periods are distinctly different. The way out of the Great Depression essentially involved the establishing of a political compact between industrial capitalists and organised labour, with the state acting to stimulate demand and mitigate the risk to workers through a variety of compensatory mechanisms. What followed was a period of relatively equitable economic growth in the developed world that, among other things, gave birth to the mass consumer society of our time. In contrast, the era of globalisation, which was ushered in by declining rates of profit and other crises in the 1970 s and ’ 80 s, has involved a process of “financialisation”, where the relationship between industrial and financial capital, which concerned political economists from Marx to Keynes, has apparently become largely redundant. Financial deregulation has permitted the enormous growth of global markets for a variety of financial products, which act somewhat autonomously from and greatly eclipse the “real” economy of trade in goods and services. Financialisation has been part of a broader process that has placed the market at the centre of social relations, redistributing wealth and power. This has involved assaults against worker rights in many industrialised countries at a time where capital has been liberated to relocate to sources of cheaper labour. Furthermore, at the same time many workers in the West have been both voluntarily and forcibly drawn into becoming investors - substituting the socialisation of risk that was embodied in the welfare state with tying pension plans to the market like never before. And while the massive extension of credit, both in the form of mortgages and credit cards (which are now often tied together), provided palliative care to many, with some workers experiencing declining real wages, it also served to further lock them to a highly volatile system in which they had very little power to advance their interests vis-a-vis highly powerful and well-connected market players. Meanwhile, the risk to capital has been socialised, with public bailouts a common feature of the past 25 years, regardless of the recent failure of the US government’s rescue package. Yet, despite such bailouts, under globalisation arguments have been continuously advanced for less regulation and for the importance of paying CEOs “well”. In this hyper-capitalist environment inequality has been soaring, with the average pay packet of a high-end American CEO being 250 times that of an <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earner.</b> In short, there has been concentration of capital that still retains an insatiable appetite for profit. In trying to satisfy this appetite capital has gone in search of returns in dangerous waters (such as that section of the population that aspires to owning homes yet has been so marginalised that it does not have the means to service its borrowings). In the short term, you can disguise this concentration by creating complex financial instruments to on-sell. In the medium-to-longer term, reality hits home when people begin to default. So the big question seems to be not how to reregulate financial markets, but whether everyday citizens can be convinced that their interests are advanced by a different set of interests to theirs and an ideology that has spent the past quarter of a century eroding the “over-regulation” of the Western welfare state and dispensing with its social safeguards. While US taxpayers were told by people like US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that bailing out capital was necessary to support the system for everyone and that caution had to be exercised in reregulating the financial sector, middle America doesn’t appear to have much sympathy for him or the obscenely remunerated “Just Do It” set at the centre of this debacle. The US government has put together another bailout package, but the crisis seems far from over for the very reason {{that it is hard to}} see where new sources of real productive output will emerge, especially in an economy such as the United States. The game of smoke and mirrors no longer holds any attraction for those left with cash to allocate. Where the fix to the Great Depression came in the form of redistributive measures to workers within the domestic economy - a globalised world makes this process next to impossible for the very reason that capital can so easily relocate to cheaper sources of labour outside of America. Even if capital can get back on its feet with a public bailout, finding profitable undertakings inside US borders that benefit the broad population seems highly unlikely. • Shahar Hameiri is a doctoral candidate at the Asia Research Centre, Murdoch University.

Without action, the <b>average</b> full time <b>wage</b> <b>earner</b> would face the second highest marginal tax rate this year and {{nearly half of all}} taxpayers would be in the top two brackets in ten years’ time. The Turnbull Government is giving hard working Australians greater incentive to earn more without being taxed more. The Government will prevent <b>average</b> full time <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> from moving into the second top tax bracket until 2019 - 20 by increasing the 32. 5 per cent tax threshold from $ 80, 000 to $ 87, 000.

This will reward hard working Australians for doing more overtime, picking up more shifts, taking a promotion or a better new job, without being penalised by paying more tax through the higher rate.

The amount of Social Security benefit {{is based on}} an {{individual}} worker’s lifetime earnings and replaces approximately 40 % of an <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earner’s</b> income. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that the U. S. poverty line in 2006 for a single-person family unit was $ 9800 annually (approximately $ 816. 67 monthly). The median monthly Social Security benefit for 2006 is estimated at $ 989. 50. Since the Social Security benefit is often the sole (or primary) source of income, many Social Security beneficiaries fall below the poverty line. This paper will examine some strategies for future beneficiaries to maximize their Social Security benefits and possibly alleviate future income deficiencies. Methods such as increasing lifetime earnings, accurately assessing future financial needs, and establishing additional sources of income will be discussed. Studies focus on at-risk populations already susceptible to and/or for whom impoverishment is exacerbated. Results show that expectations and reliance on Social Security differ among ethnic groups as well as among gender groups. There are also differences in trends in plans to obtain information regarding benefits.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this paper defines three different synthetic measurements of disincentives for formal work: two standard measurements, namely the tax wedge and the marginal effective tax rate (METR); and a new, innovative measurement called formalization tax rate (FTR). The novelty of the latter is that it measures disincentives stemming not only from labor taxation, but also from benefit withdrawal due to formalization. A descriptive analysis across a large number of OECD and Eastern European countries reveals that the disincentives for formal work – when measured through the FTR – are especially high for low-wage earners. This suggests that formal work might not pay in this segment of the labor market, in particular for the so-called mini-jobs and midi-jobs (low paying part-time work). Another novelty of the paper is its empirical approach. Using EU-SILC 2008 data and OECD Tax and Benefit data for six Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Slovakia), we match disincentives for formal work to individual observations in a large data set. Applying a probit regression, the analysis finds a significant positive correlation between FTR or METR and the incidence of being informal. In other words, controlling for individual and job characteristics, the higher the FTR or the METR that individuals are facing is, {{the more likely they are}} to work informally. The tax wedge, on the other hand, yields a negative correlation. This indicates that the tax wedge is not sufficiently capturing disincentives for formal work. We also conclude that in cross-country analysis, it might be more useful to use the tax wedge that applies to low <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> as opposed to <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners.</b> formalization tax rate, measurement of work disincentives, informal employment, non-wage labor costs and benefits, tax evasion...|$|R

On the other hand, Turkey’s ranking becomes well above the EU average as the family size gets larger and the income level decreases. According to the OECD data, the tax wedge in Turkey is the highest in the OECD as well as compared to the EU countries in regards to the low-income families with two children (both single parent at 67 % of <b>average</b> <b>wage,</b> and one <b>earner</b> at <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> and the <b>earner</b> at 33 % of <b>average</b> <b>wage)</b> (ibid). The last point worthy of note is the remarkable fall in the tax wedge in Turkey between 2007 and 2009. OECD (2010) reports that Turkey ranks alongside the ten EU countries with the most significant reduction in tax wedge during this period, accounting for almost seven percentage point decrease for low-earner single persons without children. In fact, the decline in the tax wedge in Turkey corresponds to the period of the approval of a recent regulation that stipulated a cut in employers’ SSC. An evaluation of this regulation constitutes the main interest of this paper.|$|R
50|$|In China, as {{in other}} countries, an {{important}} determinant of the affluence of a household was the dependency ratio - the number of nonworkers supported by each worker.

Two <b>average</b> <b>wage</b> <b>earners,</b> however, could easily support one dependent. Families with several workers and few or no dependents had substantial surplus earnings, which they saved or used to buy nonessential goods.

The main aims are to estimate returns to education and to identify, conditioned on education and labour market experience, earnings differentials by gender and across sectors (public, private and informal). We confirm the general pattern that returns to education are increasing in level and years of education but note differences across sector of employment and the earnings distribution.

How many households have individuals with multiple jobs? Why do individuals hold multiple jobs? How important is agriculture to rural Nebraskans’ families, communities and the state? This report details 2, 482 responses to the 2006 Nebraska Rural Poll, the eleventh annual effort to understand rural Nebraskans’ perceptions. Respondents were asked {{a series of questions}} about their jobs and their perceptions about the importance of agriculture in Nebraska. For all questions, comparisons are made among different respondent subgroups, that is, comparisons by age, occupation, region, etc. Based on these analyses, some key findings emerged: • Rural Nebraska households have an average of 1. 3 <b>wage</b> <b>earners.</b> One quarter (25 %) of the households have no <b>wage</b> <b>earners,</b> 24 percent have one <b>wage</b> <b>earner</b> and 48 percent have two <b>wage</b> <b>earners.</b> Of the households with at least one <b>wage</b> <b>earner,</b> the <b>average</b> number of <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> is 1. 7. • Rural Nebraska households with at least one <b>wage</b> <b>earner</b> have an <b>average</b> of two jobs that contribute to the household income. Twenty-seven percent of the households have one job contributing to the household income and 55 percent have two jobs that make up their income. • Persons living in or near smaller communities have a higher average number of jobs per household than do persons living in or near larger communities. Persons living in or near communities with populations less than 5, 000 have an approximate average of 2. 07 jobs per household, compared to an approximate average of 1. 92 jobs per household for persons living in or near communities with more than 5, 000 people. • Fourteen percent of rural Nebraska households have an individual with more than one job. • Persons living in or near smaller communities are more likely than persons living in or near larger communities to have an individual with more than one job in their household. • Sixty percent of the households with an individual having more than one job say that more than one job is necessary to pay for living essentials. Thirty-seven percent say that individual has more than one job to make additional income for non-essential items. • Of the households with a person having more than one job, farmers and ranchers are the occupation group most likely to say that the individual has more than one job to secure employment benefits. Twenty-two percent of farmers and ranchers give this reason for having a multiple job holder in their household. • Twenty-seven percent of the rural Nebraska households with at least one <b>wage</b> <b>earner</b> have someone that is actively seeking a better paying job. Only nine percent of the households have someone that is seeking a job with more hours. • Nineteen percent of rural Nebraskans currently own a farm or ranch, 11 percent own a business and five percent own both a farm or ranch as well as another type of business. • Persons living in the Southeast region are more likely than persons living in other regions of the state to own a farm or ranch. Twenty-five percent of the Southeast residents own a farm or ranch, compared to 16 percent of persons living in either the Panhandle or South Central regions. • Most rural Nebraskans view agriculture as important to the state, their community and their family. The proportions believing agriculture is important to the various areas are as follows: the state’s economy (90 %), the state’s quality of life (88 %), their community’s economy (88 %), their community’s quality of life (85 %), their family’s quality of life (72 %) and their family’s personal finances (57 %) ...|$|R

Further analyses find no evidence that this mean premium is explained either by unobserved differences or by measurement error. The author also finds that a narrow focus on the mean impact partially masks heterogeneity in the impact across the distribution. Notably, membership wage effects were considerably more pronounced for low <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> than for high <b>wage</b> <b>earners...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} the possibility of alleviating poverty in Ontario through minimum wage increases. Using survey data from 2004 to profile low <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> and poor households, we find two important results. First, over 80 percent of low <b>wage</b> <b>earners</b> are not members of poor households and, second, over 75 percent of poor households {{do not have a}} member who is a low <b>wage</b> <b>earner.</b> We also present simulation results which suggest that, even without any negative employment effects, planned increases in Ontario's minimum wage will lead to virtually no reduction in the level of poverty. ...|$|R
