5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' offense {{in the second half}} of the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E

[...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the point of the film.

No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone.

500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving.

[...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level.

500|$|From 1155 Henry {{claimed that}} Pope Adrian IV {{had given him}} {{authorisation}} to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland, but Professor Anne Duggan's research indicates that the Laudabiliter is a falsification of an existing letter <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> in fact Adrian's intention. It originally allowed Henry's brother William some territory. Henry did not personally act on this until 1171 by which time William was already dead. He invaded Ireland to assert his authority over knights who had accrued autonomous power after they recruited soldiers in England and Wales and colonised Ireland with his permission. Henry later gave Ireland to his youngest son, John. In 1172 Henry gave John the castles of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau as a wedding gift. This angered Henry's eighteen-year-old son, Henry the Young King, who believed these were his. A rebellion by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons ensued. Louis VII of France supported the rebellion. William the Lion, king of the Scots, and others joined the revolt. After eighteen months, Henry subdued the rebels. In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a partible inheritance: his eldest surviving son, Henry, would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; Richard (his mother's favourite) would inherit the Duchy of Aquitaine; Geoffrey would inherit Brittany; and John would inherit Ireland. [...] This resulted in further conflict. The younger Henry rebelled again, but died of dysentery. Geoffrey died in 1186 after an accident in a tournament. In 1189, Richard and Philip II of France reasserted their various claims exploiting the aging Henry's failing health. Henry was forced to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard his sole heir. The old King died two days later, defeated and miserable. French and English contemporary moralists viewed this fate as retribution {{for the murder of}} Becket; even his favourite legitimate son, John, had rebelled although the constantly loyal illegitimate son Geoffrey remained with Henry until the end.|$|E

2500|$|Iliadis auditioned {{dozens of}} actors before he hired Garret Dillahunt {{for the role}} of Krug, the leader of the family that kidnaps Mari.

But if they [...] respond to this, then here you, accursed ones, have started a war. Following the logic of the Tagliavini commission, the Georgians ought not to have responded. Even if Russian tanks had reached Tbilisi, and the Georgians had responded, they, the swine, would have started a war. The logic is irreproachable: if the Georgians had not responded, {{there would have been no}} war." [...] Latynina argued that according to the Tagliavini mission [...] "Georgia had no right to send a single shell into the city [...] But the opposite side had a right to burn down Nuli, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> an infringement of human rights."

2500|$|In 1989, Fender {{teamed up}} with fellow Tex–Mex musicians Doug Sahm, Flaco Jiménez, and Augie Meyers to form the Texas Tornados, whose work meshed conjunto, Tejano, R, country, and blues to wide acclaim.

The audition was nearly a bust, because he played country music <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> what the executives were looking for. Fender was persuaded to play some vintage rock and blues numbers which was what the executives were looking for, and was subsequently given a record contract. After being a solo act, Fender was not sure if signing with a group was a good thing, but according to Fender, he [...] "just wanted to record for a major label." [...] The group released four albums and won a Grammy in 1990 for Best Mexican American Performance for the track [...] "Soy de San Luis". Fender described the group in this way: [...] "You've heard of New Kids on the Block? Well, we're the Old Guys in the Street." [...] Following the death of Sahm, the Tornados' production slowed. A live 1990 appearance on TV's Austin City Limits, one of three the group made, was released in 2005 as part of the Live From Austin, Texas, series.|$|E
