500|$|IGN's Vince Ingenito {{labeled the}} game as [...] "both a very good brawler and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> sloppy love letter to fans". Ingenito praised the story mode, unique {{fighting}} game mechanics, and the overall use of the DC license, but criticized rough cutscene graphics, stating that bland textures and poorly modeled buildings eroded their visual impact. Game Informers Andrew Reiner considered {{the game as}} [...] "a finely tuned fighter" [...] that [...] "nails the spectacle of a superhero brawl". Reiner praised NetherRealm Studios for delivering a [...] "great fighting game experience", claiming that the NetherRealm Studios' appreciation for the DC universe blended nicely with their Mortal Kombat formula.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor's feet to the stage {{in order to ensure}} that the crystal didn't move. Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes, with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes. The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia, which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after [...] "". She also didn't like how it appeared on screen: [...] "I thought it was going to look like my body turning to stone. Instead I looked like <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> hot fudge sundae, and my head was the cherry on top." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{initially}} travelled to India to meet A. R. Rahman, {{but found}} it hard to communicate her ideas to him and the planned musical collaboration did not take place. Rahman did, however, provide M.I.A. with a number of contacts and allow her to use his studio, where 22 members of drumming group The Tapes were recorded for Kala. Producer Switch, who had initially travelled to India purely to engineer the planned sessions, ultimately became involved in the composition of several tracks for the album. A visit to Angola to work with DJ Znobia was cancelled after Znobia was involved in a car accident, but M.I.A. was able to record in Trinidad, Liberia, Jamaica and Australia. She and Switch relied heavily on Logic Pro, a digital audio workstation produced by Apple, and were able to capture vocals and background sounds outside the traditional studio environment, using a microphone and a Macbook Pro. The album features guest vocals from Afrikan Boy, The Wilcannia Mob, and Timbaland, and further collaborations with Switch, Blaqstarr, Morganics and Diplo. She likened the process of recording the album to [...] "making <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> marble cake with lots of different countries and influences. Then you slice it up and call each slice a song".|$|E

500|$|Spin-off {{media has}} tried {{to fill in the}} gaps of Ianto's {{character}} history from before he began working at Torchwood Three; Ianto's first week at Torchwood One is shown in a flashback in the novel Trace Memory. The segment also depicts his budding relationship with Lisa Hallett. Also expanding on Jones's time living in London, the comic The Legacy of Torchwood One! (Torchwood #1) shows how Ianto was taken under the wing of Rupert Howarth, a senior researcher, during his first few weeks at Torchwood One. Ianto's characterisation is explored in The Twilight Streets, in which Ianto sheds some light on the difficulty he had [...] "coming out" [...] as a teenager; Ianto's mother tried to have a conversation with him about it, but he remarks [...] "She didn't work me out, Gwen. No one has. And if I ever do, I'll let you know." [...] He then engages in a diatribe with Gwen {{about what it means to}} him to be bisexual after Gwen jokes to him that he has the [...] "best of both worlds". A scene in David-Lloyd's [...] "Shrouded", in which Ianto is emailing his sister, Owen is seen to wrestle control of the computer and tries to write to her that [...] "I've recently discovered that I'm <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Old</b> Gay"; Ianto rebukes him. In the storyline's conclusion, an alternate timeline is created where Ianto did not die in the events of Children of Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Carl's {{profile on}} the {{official}} EastEnders website says he is [...] "seductive" [...] and can draw people to him, especially women, and can easily fool people. He can read people quickly, understanding what they want, and can tell who has power, but is waiting for a moment when he can take it for himself because he enjoys having power. He rarely gets into fights, is unsympathetic and angry, becoming suspicious of everybody. He is entrepreneurial, pragmatic and ingenious, and {{could have been a}} successful businessman if he did not choose a life of crime, though {{it was the only way}} he knew to get women, cars and money. He will do whatever he can to get what he wants. In August 2013, Coonan said, [...] "I wouldn't mess with a man like Carl—I would stay indoors a lot more if I'd got on the wrong of someone like him. He's someone who doesn't care and who'll go to any lengths to take people out." [...] In the run-up to Carl's departure, All About Soap called him [...] "a horrible bloke". Heat said Carl [...] "thinks he's hard as nails, but compared to , he's just <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> pussycat." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, a few critics took a more-mixed {{view of the}} album. Emma Johnston {{from the}} English {{language}} version of Metal Hammer rated the album six out of ten, pointing out that [...] "there's little here to have progressive scene-leaders like Opeth looking over their shoulders." [...] She elaborated that apart from the string-drenched interlude on [...] "Dawn of Redemption", [...] "Extol hardly shifts out of a single gear, but it's worth a listen {{for those who like}} their genres bobbing around in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> melting pot." [...] Anthony Peronto of Christian Music Zine rated it at three-point-seventy-five out of five, summarizing that while metal pioneer comebacks are not entirely new, this one did not entirely click with him. He concluded that [...] "The music itself was excellence in and of itself but perhaps it was the odd mix of vocals that let me down. I guarantee after a few listens even a doubter like me will warm up to return of Extol and the album they've always intended to create." [...] Mario of Metal 4 rated the album six out of ten, stating the while the album is decent, it also is fairly predictable.|$|E

2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw me coming. I had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass and I tried to recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E

5000|$|Uka Airport is an {{airfield}} in Kamchatka Krai, Russia, located 11 km {{northwest of}} Uka.

Yale and Martyn conferred for two hours in Yale's quarters; but only the bull-terrier who keeps watch over Yale's boot-trees knows what they said. A horse, hooded and sheeted to his ears, left Yale's stables and was taken, very unwillingly, into the Civil Lines. Yale's groom went with him. Two men broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint-pots and some large scenery-brushes. Then night fell over the Cantonments, {{and there was a}} noise as of a horse kicking his {{loose-box}} to pieces in Yale's stables.

5000|$|The {{municipality}} (originally the parish) {{is named}} after the old Vestby farm (Old Norse: Vestbýr), since the first church was built here.

60|$|All {{this while}} Colonel Durnford had been {{behaving}} as a British officer should do. Scorning to attempt flight, whenever I looked round I {{caught sight of}} his tall form, easy to recognize by the long fair moustaches and his arm in a sling, moving to and fro encouraging us to stand firm and die like men. Then suddenly I saw a Kaffir, who carried <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> smooth-bore gun, aim at him {{from a distance of}} about twenty yards, and fire. He went down, as I believe dead, {{and that was the end}} of a very gallant officer and gentleman whose military memory has in my opinion been most unjustly attacked. The real blame for that disaster does not rest upon the shoulders of either Colonel Durnford or Colonel Pulleine.|$|E
60|$|The Seddons had <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> {{farmhouse}} {{modified to}} modern ideas of comfort {{on the road}} out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had been rather pleasantly subdued from use to ornament. It had rich blossoming cherry and apple trees. Large patches of grass full of nodding yellow trumpets had been left amidst the not too precisely mown grass, which was as it were grass path with an occasional lapse into lawn or glade. And Margaret, hatless, with the fair hair above her thin, delicately pink face very simply done, came to meet our rather too consciously dressed party,--we had come in the motor four strong, with my aunt in grey silk. Margaret wore a soft flowing flowered blue dress of diaphanous material, all unconnected with the fashion and tied with pretty ribbons, like a slenderer, unbountiful Primavera.|$|E
6000|$|He {{then took}} us {{all over the}} fort,--up an {{inclined}} plane {{to the top of}} the ramparts, and into the Indian barracks on one of the wide walls, where we saw a lot of Cheyennes and Kiowas, and Indians from other tribes, sitting around and making bows and arrows, and polishing sea-beans to sell to visitors. At each corner of the fort was a [...] "lookout tower,"--a little box of a place, stuck out from the top of the wall, with loopholes and a long, narrow passage leading to it, with a high wall on each side to protect from bullets and arrows the man who went to look out. One of the towers had been knocked off, probably by a cannon-ball. These towers and slim little passages took our fancy greatly. Then Mr. Cholott took us downstairs to see the dungeons. He got the key and gave it to <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>old</b> Indian, named Red Horse, who went ahead with a lighted kerosene-lamp.|$|E
