5|$|Konishi {{describes}} a wideband 12GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs {{and also has}} a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). <b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which {{are considered to be}} spurious.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Averno's {{real name was}} {{not a matter of}} public record, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. However, in May 2011, Averno was booked in a Lucha de Apuesta, where he lost his mask and was forced to reveal his true identity. Ruíz left CMLL in April 2014 and joined rival {{promotion}} Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) the following month.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{with huge}} ancient ruins, {{knowledge}} of the site was never completely lost in the region. It seems that local people never forgot about Tikal and they guided Guatemalan expeditions to the ruins in the 1850s. Some second- or third-hand accounts of Tikal appeared in print starting in the 17th century, continuing through the writings of John Lloyd Stephens in the early 19th century (Stephens and his illustrator Frederick Catherwood heard rumors of a lost city, with white building tops towering above the jungle, during their 1839-40 travels in the region). Because of the site's remoteness from modern towns, however, no explorers visited Tikal until Modesto Méndez and Ambrosio Tut, respectively the commissioner and the governor of Petén, visited it in 1848. Artist Eusebio Lara accompanied them and their account was published in Germany in 1853. Several other expeditions came to further investigate, map, and photograph Tikal in the 19th century (including Alfred P. Maudslay in 1881-82) and the early 20th century. Pioneering archaeologists started to clear, map and record the ruins in the 1880s.|$|E

50|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{may lead}} to problems in social interaction with peers. These problems can be severe or mild depending on the individual. People with <b>AS</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> target of bullying behavior. Children with <b>AS</b> <b>are</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> target of bullying at school due to their idiosyncratic behavior, precise language, unusual interests, and impaired ability to perceive and respond in socially expected ways to nonverbal cues, particularly in interpersonal conflict, which results in them being sought out by classmates and rejected. People with <b>AS</b> may <b>be</b> overly literal and may have difficulty interpreting and responding to sarcasm, banter, or metaphorical speech. Difficulties with social interaction may also manifest in a lack of play with other children.|$|R
50|$|Private {{commissions}} {{can be for}} dining rooms, bathrooms, {{living rooms}} or, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case- children's bedrooms. A child's room can be transformed into the 'fantasy world' of a forest or racing track, encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. <b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Rick Latimer, {{a man who}} {{was seeing}} her mother, Meg, had been enchanted by Cal. Rick fell deeply in love with Cal, and this angered Meg. But, however, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case, {{whenever}} she tried to get her way with things, failed.|$|R
25|$|Systemic therapy {{seeks to}} address people not just individually, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> focus of {{other forms of}} therapy, but in relationship, dealing with the {{interactions}} of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes family therapy and marriage counseling). Community psychology {{is a type of}} systemic psychology.|$|R
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{in number}} theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, {{so in this}} section all moduli p, q, etc., {{are assumed to be}} positive, odd primes.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with {{policies}} {{intended to}} forge or bolster national identity in a state, Magyarization was perceived by {{other ethnic groups}} such as the Romanians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Croats, Serbs, etc., as aggression or active discrimination, especially where they formed the majority of the population.|$|E
25|$|The pointed {{ends of the}} chopsticks {{should be}} placed on a chopstick rest when the chopsticks are not being used. However, when a chopstick rest is not {{available}} <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in restaurants using waribashi (disposable chopsticks), a person may make a chopstick rest by folding the paper case that contained the chopsticks.|$|E
50|$|The {{sessions}} forming {{this record}} {{follow the same}} experimental approach, combining some original compositions and some re-interpretations of jazz standards, exploring different musical forms (including some reminding of European classical music), pursuing interplay and counterpoint, and researching new sound textures, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case in Manne's work.|$|R
5|$|The Sejm had mostly {{advisory}} powers, {{although it}} could legislate on some strictly local matters, such as communal self-government and spending of some local taxes. It could opine legal acts {{relevant to the}} Grand Duchy. Its deputies {{had the right to}} file petitions and complaints to the King of Prussia, who could consent or reject (<b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case) the Sejm proposals. Proposals from and to the King required a two-thirds majority; other proposals required a simple majority.|$|R

25|$|Therefore, GTR (for four characters, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in phylogenetics) {{requires}} 6 substitution rate parameters, {{as well as}} 4 equilibrium {{base frequency}} parameters. However, this is usually eliminated down to 9 parameters plus , {{the overall number of}} substitutions per unit time. When measuring time in substitutions (=1) only 8 free parameters remain.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was landing at Samara Kurumoch Airport, when it touched down about 400 meters {{short of a}} runway in heavy fog, bouncing and flipping over. Six {{people were killed and}} 26 injured. The accident occurred at about 10:45a.m. local time (06:45 GMT). The aircraft did not catch fire after the accident, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with airliner accidents.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the index}} scale is linear (and not logarithmic, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> when {{measuring}} {{things such as}} brightness or sound level), {{it is reasonable to}} assume that one hour of exposure at index 5 is approximately equivalent to a half-hour at index 10, although other factors like the body's ability to repair damage over a given time period could detract from the validity of this assumption.|$|E
50|$|The {{testimony}} of Ursula Kemp's eight-year-old son helped {{to secure a}} conviction: partly because of her son's evidence {{and partly because of}} the court's promise to treat her with clemency, she confessed to the art of witchcraft, and in this confession (<b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case) she implicated others that she knew.|$|R

50|$|Theudoald died, {{probably}} killed, around 741, {{after the}} death of his uncle and protector, Charles Martel.

25|$|Feedback is also {{central to}} the {{operations}} of genes and gene regulatory networks. Repressor (see Lac repressor) and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons, which were identified by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod in 1961 as feedback loops. These feedback loops may be positive (as {{in the case of}} the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell), or negative (<b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in metabolic consumption).|$|E
25|$|The {{substitution}} rule demonstrates several common {{aspects of}} rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; {{one can tell}} whether it was correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Norwegian {{part of the}} massif, the Swedish part is {{relatively}} poorly studied from an archeological point of view; <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in the mountains, human traces are light. The mountain was freed from ice about 8000 years ago and the first humans arrived during the Stone Age, their presence attested to by certain relics, such as a stone axe near the river Fulan. These people were hunter-gatherers, and had no fixed settlement, which remained the case up until the Iron Age.|$|E
