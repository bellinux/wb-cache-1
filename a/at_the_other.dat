5|$|After {{the release}} of Loukyam and Govindudu Andarivadele, Aagadu lost major portion of its screens. In its lifetime, Aagadu {{collected}} a distributor share of 342.5 million and was declared a box office bomb due to the high costs involved. It however managed to perform better than the year's other commercial failures 1: Nenokkadine and Rabhasa. Aagadu final distributor share figures of AP/Nizam, Karnataka, {{and the rest of}} Indian box office stood at 214 million, 37.5 million and 16 million respectively. It also collected 62.5 million at the United States box office and 12.5 million <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> international markets in its full run.|$|E
5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> mints {{during the years}} the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and mint mark among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from this}} active communication, a good bughouse player tries to {{coordinate}} silently by {{keeping an eye}} on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. This can mean as little as glancing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.|$|E

5|$|At the Eastern Gate, Thomas {{assembled}} more forces than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> gates, so that Khalid {{would be}} unable to move to Shurahbil's assistance and take command in that decisive sector. Thomas' attack at several gates also gave more flexibility to the operation: if success were achieved in any sector other than the Gate of Thomas, such success could be exploited by sending troops to that sector to achieve the breakthrough. Thomas ordered Khalid to be taken alive.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{end of the}} river, the Millennium Bridge {{was opened}} in 2001. There was once a ferry at this point, before 1865, which gave access to the Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. South Bridge {{replaced}} the ferry in 1865, {{making it easier for}} workers to reach the dock. The swing footbridge was closed in 1934, but was not demolished until 1944.|$|E

The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied around their necks with a concrete block <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated {{as a result of}} decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Available sources {{leave some}} {{uncertainty}} and ambiguity regarding the exact timeline of Crittenden's education. All {{seem to agree}} on his graduation from William and Mary in 1806 and admission to the bar in 1807. Sources disagree on matriculation and graduation dates, as well as Crittenden's age and the duration of his studies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> institutions.|$|E
5|$|Barnes and Morris {{took the}} score to 73 before {{the latter was}} bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it {{from the middle of}} his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a {{defensive}} field, employing leg theory to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the leg side with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past. Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, pulling Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.|$|E

5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that was as close as they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|ESF is an {{autonomous}} institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools {{share a common}} Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation {{as part of the}} SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five statutory colleges that are at Alfred University and Cornell University.|$|E
5|$|Hence, {{weakness}} of shrug {{on one side}} and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve {{on the side of the}} shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or poliomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a {{confident}} appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) against Washbrook, {{but was not}} supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end. This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then on-drove a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|In 1915 and 1918, Sybil Thorndike {{played the}} role at Old Vic {{and then at the}} Prince's Theatre in 1926. Flora Robson {{played the role}} in Tyrone Guthrie's Old Vic {{production}} in 1934. In 1955, Vivien Leigh played Lady Macbeth opposite Laurence Olivier at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. In 1977 <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> Place in Stratford, Judi Dench and Ian McKellen played the infamous husband and wife in Trevor Nunn's production. Other notable Lady Macbeths in the late 20th century included Judith Anderson, Pamela Brown, Diana Wynyard, Simone Signoret, Vivien Merchant, Jane Lapotaire, Helen Mirren and Janet Suzman.|$|E

5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end, Morris {{continued}} {{to take advantage}} of Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E
