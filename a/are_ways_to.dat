25|$|The light-front coupled cluster (LFCC) {{method is}} a {{particular}} form of truncation for the infinite coupled system of integral equations for light-front wave functions. The system of equations {{that comes from the}} field-theoretic Schrödinger equation also requires regularization, to make the integral operators finite. The traditional Fock-space truncation of the system, where the allowed number of particles is limited, typically disrupts the regularization by removing infinite parts that would otherwise cancel against parts that are retained. Although there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> circumvent this, they are not completely satisfactory.|$|E

25|$|Many {{sports are}} practised in São Vicente, {{and many have}} spread to the {{remaining}} islands.

Cycling, walking trails and horseback riding <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> explore the island. São Vicente has an excellent 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, tourism has excellent growth potential on São Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Baía das Gatas, Calhau, and São Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.|$|E
25|$|Applying a pinch {{current in}} a plasma {{can be used}} to {{counteract}} expansion and confine the plasma. A simple {{way to do this is}} to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.|$|E

25|$|Homeless shelters {{can become}} grounds for {{community}} {{organization and the}} recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this form of initiative.

SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach. Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level.

25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS performance will be that of a single disk (write speed will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a single disk). However, there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS performance will be that of a single disk, which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E

2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to surf the web without being tracked by device fingerprinting today. However, {{for people who do}} not want device fingerprinting, there <b>are</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> attempt to block fingerprinting. The only ways to stop device fingerprinting cause web browsing to be very slow and websites to display information incorrectly. “There are not convenient options for privacy when it comes to device fingerprinting” said Peter Eckersely a staff scientist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation and privacy-advocacy group. [...] Trying to avoid device fingerprinting is mostly just impractical and inconvenient. Fingerprints are tough to avoid because they are taken from data that are routinely passed from computers to websites automatically. Even if someone changes something slightly, the fingerprinters can still recognize the machine. There is one way to figure out that a device is being fingerprinted. The software JavaScript can be used to collect fingerprinting data. If it asks a browser for specific information, that could be a clue that a fingerprinter is working. Companies that are most known for conducting fingerprinting are advertisers.|$|E
