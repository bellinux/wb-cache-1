40|$|<b>Antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> are {{generally}} thought to exert their therapeutic action on detrusor overactivity {{by reducing the}} ability of the detrusor muscle to contract. We review currently available published data to establish whether there is any evidence to support this contention. Using a PubMed data search, only 14 original articles (including two abstracts) were found that contained cystometric data for both filling and voiding phases and where the actions of <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> have been reported in detail. These articles were separated into three groups dealing with neuropathic patients (three papers), patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (four papers) and a group whose aetiology was unclear (seven papers). Variables relating to bladder function during the filling phase (time of first desire to void, time to first unstable contraction, and bladder capacity) were identified. Similarly, variables relating to voiding were identified and compared (e. g. maximum detrusor pressure and detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate). The <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> have a clearly significant effect on sensations of urge, time to first sensation to void, maximum bladder capacity, decrease in voiding frequency and reduction in incontinence episodes. However, only one article (studying neuropaths) reported a significant reduction of the variables associated with detrusor contraction. The remaining four studies (idiopaths/not stated), reported no change in bladder contractility with <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Thus the available data do not support the conclusion that <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> at doses used in current clinical practice exert their therapeutic action by inhibiting detrusor contractility, but they suggest effects on variables associated with sensation...|$|R

40|$|Overactive bladder (OAB) is {{a symptom}} complex of urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and nocturia, with or without urgency incontinence.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} was to characterize the placebo response in <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drug</b> trials for OAB, based on changes in commonly-used efficacy endpoints. Methods Placebo arm data for incontinence episodes, micturitions, voided volume and study characteristics were extracted from randomized placebo controlled <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drug</b> trials in OAB, from studies identified in a prior meta-analysis, and from a systematic review of more recently published studies. Relationships between variables were examined using linear regression, and changes in endpoints were analyzed by a meta-analysis approach. The effect of placebo arm size and magnitude of placebo response on probability of successful study outcome was analyzed using an ANOVA model. Results Changes in the placebo arms for all 3 endpoints were substantial and statistically significant, and highly heterogeneous. There were significant associations between baseline and change scores for some {{but not all of}} the endpoints. More recent studies tended to have more subjects than earlier studies, and there were positive associations between probability of achieving statistically significant results and size of the placebo arm. The magnitude of changes in placebo arms did not appear to influence the likelihood of the study to be statistically significant. Conclusion This analysis confirms earlier observation that the placebo response in OAB trials is substantial and highly heterogeneous. There are multiple potential reasons for this; however, these could not be explored in this analysis of study-level data. Two approaches may be used in clinical trials to manage high placebo effect: recruitment of 1) greater numbers of patients and/or 2) more severely affected patients; however, only the former approach is associated with increased probability of successful study outcome. </p...|$|E

Saline 0. 9 % was used as the control. Accommodative microfluctuations were found to play a minor role in determining the magnitude of sensitivity out to an eccentricity of 5 degrees; between 5 degrees and 27. 5 degrees, the effect of microfluctuations was masked by the mydriasis produced by the drugs used in the study.

40|$|The major aims {{of medical}} therapy in {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) are: a) to ameliorate symptoms (pain, bowel movement abnormalities, bloating) and b) to improve psychological problems of the patients. The first step of IBS therapy is the diet. In fact some forms of IBS can be ascribed to food intolerance. When abdominal pain, meteorism and constipation are the main symptoms, treatment with high-fiber diet, antispastic and <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> is indicated. Sometimes amitriptyline, an antidepressant which also shows anticholinergic and analgesic properties, can be helpful. When diarrhoea is prevalent, the most effective drug is represented by loperamide.

Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, {{as well as with}} either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{drugs on the}} {{extracellular}} concentration of dopamine in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens septi (a limbic area) and the dorsal caudate nucleus (a subcortical motor area), was studied in freely moving rats by using brain dialysis. Drugs abused by humans (e. g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e. g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U- 50, 488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e. g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drug),</b> and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) ] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} esaprazole, a novel antiulcer drug, on gastric acid {{secretion}} and plasma gastrin levels were investigated in dogs {{provided with a}} gastric fistula or Heidenhain pouch. Esaprazole affected in a different extent the tests performed on dogs with a gastric fistula. The greatest inhibitory effect was obtained against 2 -deoxy-D-glucose-induced acid output and gastrin release. An intermediate inhibition by esaprazole was detected on bethanechol-evoked secretion, and the lowest activity was found versus histamine-stimulated secretion. All these responses were strongly inhibited by the <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drug</b> pirenzepine used as reference drug. Moreover, both esaprazole and pirenzepine prevented the acid secretory response to a test meal in dogs with a Heidenhain pouch, without significantly affecting plasma gastrin levels. The present {{results suggest that the}} depressant action of esaprazole on gastric secretion depends on its peripheral anticholinergic activity, consisting of a partial blockade of acid output and a main reduction of vagally mediated gastrin release. On the basis of these findings, the antiulcer activity of esaprazole might be in part ascribed to its inhibitory effects on gastric secretion...|$|E
40|$|Functional antagonism" {{is often}} used to {{describe}} the general relaxant effect of beta 2 agonists and xanthines and their ability to protect the airways against bronchoconstrictor stimuli. This study in guinea pig isolated trachea addresses {{the question of whether the}} capacity of these drugs to protect against constrictor stimuli is related to smooth muscle relaxation. Three <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> were also examined to determine whether antagonism of mediators other than muscarinic agonists might contribute to bronchodilatation by these <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Terbutaline (1. 1 x 10 (- 7), 2. 2 x 10 (- 7) M), theophylline (2. 2 x 10 (- 4), 4. 4 x 10 (- 4) M), and enprofylline (5. 2 x 10 (- 5), 1. 0 x 10 (- 4) M) relaxed the tracheal tension that remained after indomethacin treatment. They did not, however, alter the carbachol concentration-response curve significantly. In addition, neither theophylline (2. 2 x 10 (- 4) M) nor terbutaline (1. 1 x 10 (- 7) M) altered histamine induced contraction. Atropine sulphate, glycopyrrolate, and ipratropium bromide had EC 50 values of 10 (- 9) - 10 (- 8) M for relaxation of carbachol induced contractions, whereas concentrations of 10 (- 6) - 10 (- 3) M or greater were required to relax contractions induced by allergen and nine other non-muscarinic mediators. It is suggested that bronchodilatation by <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> in vivo is due to inhibition of acetylcholine induced bronchoconstriction alone and that beta 2 agonists and xanthines have poor ability to protect airway smooth muscle against constrictor stimuli. Hence mechanisms other than bronchodilatation and "functional antagonism" should be considered to explain the protection against constrictor stimuli in asthma seen with beta 2 agonists and xanthines...|$|R

In these diseases the pathologically changed nervous control of cardiovascular system has the central role. The actual NCV syndromes are neurogenic hypertension, representing the sympathetically mediated disorder, and vasovagal syncope, which is the vagally mediated disorders. Vasovagal syncope, the disease far from its etiological treatment, could benefit from recruiting and application of <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> used in other parasympathetic disorders. The informational spectrum method (ISM), a method widely applied for the characterization of protein-protein interactions in the field of immunology, endocrinology and anti HIV drug discovery, was applied for the first time in the analysis of neurogenic hypertension and vasovagal syncope therapeutic targets. In silico analysis revealed the potential involvement of apelin in neurogenic hypertension. Applying the EIIP/ISM bioinformatics concept in investigation of drugs for treatment of vasovagal syncope suggests that 78 % of tested <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> could have anti vasovagal syncope effect.

The <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs</b> concentration-dependently shifted the concentration-response curves to bethanechol to the right without {{any change in the}} maximum response. The analysis of data based on Schild plots was consistent with a simple competitive antagonism, since regression slopes did not differ significantly from unity. The pA 2 values indicated a significantly higher affinity of AF-DX 116 and atropine for atrial muscarinic receptors with respect to those of the gastric mucosa or urinary bladder. By contrast, in the case of pirenzepine the pA 2 values for the three tissues did not differ significantly. These results suggest that each examined tissue apparently contains homogeneous population of acetylcholine muscarinic (M 2) receptors. The pA 2 values found for AF-DX 116 and atropine suggest, however, that the putative M 2 subtype of atrial muscarinic receptor differs from both those of the gastric fundus and those of the urinary bladder...|$|R

Unmonitored use of penile sheath drainage can lead to serious complications. Case report A 32 -year old, male person, sustained complete paraplegia at T- 11 level in 1985. He had been using condom catheter. Eleven years after sustaining spinal injury, intravenous urography showed no radio-opaque calculus, normal appearances of kidneys, ureters and bladder. Blood urea and Creatinine were within reference range. A year later, urodynamics revealed detrusor pressure of 100 [*]cm water when detrusor contraction was initiated by suprapubic tapping. This patient was advised intermittent catheterisation and take anti-cholinergic drug orally; but, he wished to continue penile sheath drainage. Nine years later, this patient developed bilateral hydronephrosis and renal failure. Indwelling urethral catheter drainage was established. Five months later, ultrasound examination of urinary tract revealed normal kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Conclusion Spinal cord injury patients with high intravesical pressure should not have penile sheath drainage as these patients {{are at risk for}} developing hydronephrosis and renal failure.

Estradiol treatment compared to placebo treatment significantly reduced the activation in this left medial frontal region during scopolamine challenge. Estradiol treatment also increased activation in the precuneus (BA 31) during mecamylamine challenge. These data are the first to show that estradiol modulated antimuscarinic- and anitnicotinic-induced brain activity and suggest that estradiol affected cholinergic system regulation of cognition-related brain activation in humans...|$|E

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Treatment {{options for the}} overactive bladder were {{recently}} discussed at the 4 th International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) held in Paris, 5 - 8 July 2008. This article will overview current thoughts on the pharmacological and clinical basis for the different classes of drugs currently used {{for the treatment of}} lower urinary tract symptoms/overactive bladder syndrome/and detrusor overactivity. Individual drugs are not discussed in detail; particular consideration is given to therapeutic aspects of the management of the elderly patient. Recent findings An extensive literature review confirms the rationale for using <b>antimuscarinic</b> <b>drugs,</b> and that the currently used drugs are efficacius with an acceptable tolerability and safety. In patients resistant to antimuscarinics, botulinum toxin may be an alternative - the vanilloids resiniferatoxin and capsaicin have very limited use. New therapeutic options with positive proof-of-concept studies, but with limited clinical experience, are beta(3) adrenoceptor agonists and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. Positive signals have been found for other classes of drugs (e. g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, neurokinin receptor- 1 antagonists), but available information is not sufficient for proper assessment.
