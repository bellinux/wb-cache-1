50|$|Haggling, {{otherwise}} known as bargaining, is most present in businesses where items have no fixed price.

The first CS100 was {{expected}} to be flying by mid-2016 in Lufthansa colours. “Certification is a great thing, but 2016 <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> critical for orders,” analyst Chris Murray, aManaging Director with Alta Corp, told Bloomberg Business. Fred Cromer, president of Bombardier’s commercial aircraft unit hinted during a press conference on 21 December 2015 that price cuts - or other incentives - may be offered during negotiations in order to jump start sales (list price for the CS100 was US$71.8 million and for the CS300 US$82 million). In addition to attractive prices, customers “are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> support, they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> spares, they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> training,” he explained. While Cromer would not offer specifics, his comments about the possibility of an [...] "aggressive deal" [...] were widely published worldwide and were likely to plant the seed about discounting in the minds of potential purchasers.|$|R

5000|$|Ira Boudway {{observed}} in Bloomberg Business: The {{problem is that}} cutting the feed from the booth also means cutting down egos and cutting into advertising reach.

5000|$|On November 11, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Robin Swicord would direct a drama film based on the short story Wakefield by E. L. Doctorow, after the short story of the same name by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Bonnie Curtis and Julie Lynn would produce the film through Mockingbird Pictures, along with Elliott Webb as co-producer. Swicord had written the screenplay after meeting with Doctorow and discussing her ideas on how to present the story on film. She said, [...] "I had to really interrogate the story before I ever got up the courage to meet with Doctorow, because I knew he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what kind of movie this <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> I met him and we had great conversations.

5000|$|The preview track, [...] "The Eye", {{for which}} a video was {{released}} prior to the album, is a front-porch acoustic. The review from NPR Music said, [...] " [...] 'The Eye' is exactly what it proclaims itself to be: a quiet breath {{in the midst of}} the album's glorious storm. Rooted in Carlile's love of both classic country and California pop, the song is the kind many other artists <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> cover. It will be hard to top the original, though; it so eloquently highlights the telepathic connection Carlile shares with her longtime bandmates. A favorite on recent tours, 'The Eye' is destined to become a centerpiece in Carlile's catalog." ...|$|E
50|$|As our {{business}} grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility {{and to encourage}} {{men and women to}} exercise their initiative. This requires considerable tolerance. Those men and women, to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do their jobs in their own way. Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs. Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And it's essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.|$|E
5000|$|Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) {{facilitated}} {{a classroom}} environment {{that allowed the}} students to continue {{to get to know}} one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their behavior indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome. If students decided after the initial interaction that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding eye contact, and avoiding each other period. Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. “People want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don’t want to waste our time.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{considered}} the song a highlight on Chesney's album, making note of how Strait and Chesney both [...] "playfully soften the F in the title, making for a genuinely funny highlight" [...] (thus making the line sound closer to [...] "shit work"). Brady Vercher of Engine 145 {{gave it a}} thumbs-down rating, saying [...] "What makes this a bad song is that it’s dull and boring, with zero redeeming qualities. If music is supposed {{to make you feel}} something, then this song captures the monotony of 'shiftwork,' but who in their right mind <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bored when they listen to a song?" [...] Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe, gave it a [...] "B-", saying that [...] " [...] the ’big ol’ pile of shiiiiiftwork” wordplay in the chorus is funny.

5000|$|Roger Ebert, {{the late}} {{reviewer}} for the Chicago Sun-Times, {{has written that}} test screenings by filmmakers are [...] "valid" [...] {{to get an idea}} of an audience response to a rough cut. But [...] "too often, however, studio executives use preview screenings as a weapon to enforce their views on directors, and countless movies have had stupid happy endings tacked on after such screenings." [...] Ebert writes that Billy Wilder dropped the first reel from Sunset Boulevard after a test screening. [...] Producer Tim Bevan emphasizes that the goal of the film editing process is to turn unedited film [...] "into 85 to 110 minutes of story that people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go and see", and he [...] "absolutely believes in the testing process. 99.9 times out of 100 the audience will speak louder than anybody else". Even though [...] "editing rooms can be very combative places" [...] with directors, the test results make the process [...] "less combative." [...] While filming Johnny English (2002) with director Peter Howitt, testing led to reshoots of the beginning of the film to set up the character better, and [...] "test scores leaped considerably." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since that time, Mayor Eddie Pérez {{and former}} House Speaker James Amann {{continued}} {{to investigate the}} feasibility of a new downtown arena, with Mayor Perez making statements {{to tear down the}} XL Center and replace it with the new arena as recently as March 2008. The current lease for the XL Center runs until 2013. After that, the facility must {{be turned over to the}} city of Hartford. By that point, the city wants to decide whether the building can be refurbished or if it has enough financial support to build a new arena. Mayor Eddie Perez met with a newly formed task force of city business leaders to determine the benefits of building a new arena. [...] "In order to consider the new arena, we have to find out where the corporate support is for a new arena and that's the charge I gave the task force," [...] Perez said. [...] "My hope is that by late September of this year, they can give me an idea where the corporate support would be and how we can go about organizing that support. [...] "The mayor said that he feels the city needs a new arena to attract more events and possibly a professional sports franchise. [...] "For a region to survive, you need a dynamic urban center and entertainment is part of a dynamic urban center," [...] said Oz Griebel of the Metro Hartford Alliance. [...] "If you're going to offer entertainment venues, whether they be basketball games, hockey games, rodeos, concerts, you have to have a venue that people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come to."

5000|$|The {{bridge is}} named for Judge Carroll Lee Cropper. Cropper became Boone County judge in 1942 and served for the next 20 years. He {{was born in a}} farm house near Bullittsburg Baptist Church in 1897 and {{graduated}} from Burlington High School in 1916. He served in World War I and after returning settled on his family farm, eventually becoming a cashier at the Boone County Deposit Bank. He served as a state representative for 12 years beginning in 1934. Upon the death of Judge Nathaniel E. Riddell in 1942, Cropper was appointed to finish the unexpired term. The next year he was elected to his first full term. The position Cropper held is the equivalent of today's county judge/executive; prior to voters' approval of the Judicial Reform Amendment to the state constitution in 1975, and its full implementation at the start of 1978, county judges in Kentucky also had judicial powers. During his terms in office, Cropper witnessed Big Bone Lick becoming a state park, development of the airport now known as Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and the construction of Interstates 71 and 75. It was during Judge Cropper's terms that Boone County began its tremendous population growth. In a Kentucky Post interview in 1974, Cropper said [...] "I'm not against progress, but I actually hate to see farms turn into subdivisions. It spoils the nature of the county. A lot of people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come here." [...] During his 20 years in office, Judge Cropper saw the county increase in population 250 percent from approximately 10,000 to 25,000. A Democrat, Cropper served as Boone County campaign manager for Franklin Roosevelt's first campaign for the presidency in 1932. He also served as chair of the Boone County Democratic Party. Upon his retirement in 1962, Cropper became president of the People's Deposit Bank and five years later chairman of the board. He died in 1976, and is buried along with his wife Kathryn in Bullittsburg Baptist Cemetery.|$|E

Robert Bales, the U.S. soldier accused of murdering 16 Afghan {{citizens}} (mostly women and children) in an incident known as the Kandahar massacre. Browne defended Bales alongside military lawyers. Browne described Bales as [...] "mild-mannered", and claimed his client was upset after seeing a friend's leg blown off {{the day before the}} killings, but held no animosity toward Muslims. Browne said [...] "I think the message for the public in general is that he's one of our boys and they need to treat him fairly." [...] Browne also criticized anonymous reports from government officials, stating [...] "the government <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> blame this on an individual rather than blame it on the war."
