5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small bony fishes. It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed this species as Endangered. <b>Although</b> <b>more</b> specimens have since been discovered, the conservation status of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} {{dining rooms}} {{for males and}} females; workhouses without separate dining rooms would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> generous. The master and matron, for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|E

The closed Høvik Station will be used to turn trains.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{mechanisms}} {{have been proposed}} to interpret the origin of volcanism in the NCVP. This includes slab windows, mantle plumes, crustal extension and deglaciation. The most common and best mechanism used to explain NCVP volcanic activity is incipient rifting of the North American Plate caused by crustal extension. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Mafic magma rises along these fractures to create passive lava flows, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> viscous felsic magma also makes {{its way to the}} surface and can produce explosive eruptions. Two major structural features, the Tintina and Denali-Coast fault systems, run parallel with the NCVP. Both structures have had strike-slip motions since the Cretaceous period and has resulted in several hundred kilometres of crustal displacement.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that she likes the story. <b>Although</b> <b>more</b> sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E
5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range in size from regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>more</b> {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less {{abundant in}} the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>more</b> common since 1995, few above-normal {{hurricane}} seasons {{occurred during}} 1970–94. Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926 to 1960, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900–25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870–99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, {{of which a}} record 4 occurred after November 1 and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on New York City. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as Category 4 in strength.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda's {{most celebrated}} open cluster is NGC 752 (Caldwell 28) at an overall {{magnitude}} of 5.7. It is a loosely scattered cluster in the Milky Way that measures 49 arcminutes across and features approximately twelve bright stars, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> than 60 stars of approximately 9th magnitude become visible at low magnifications in a telescope. It {{is considered to}} be one of the more inconspicuous open clusters. The other open cluster in Andromeda is NGC 7686, which has a similar magnitude of 5.6 and is also a part of the Milky Way. It contains approximately 20 stars in a diameter of 15 arcminutes, making it a tighter cluster than NGC 752.|$|E

5|$|By mintages, the {{key dates}} {{in this series}} are the 1948, 1949-S, 1953 and 1955. Franklin half dollars have been {{extensively}} melted for their silver, and many dates are rarer than the mintage figures indicate. For example, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> than nine million 1962 halves were struck for circulation, and an additional three million in proof, the coin was more valuable as bullion than in any condition when silver prices reached record levels in 1979–1980. In 2010, the 1962 half in MS-65 condition sold for about US$145, {{second only to the}} 1953-S in price in that grade.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic {{like the rest of the}} British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E

The traditional economy of the Antankarana revolved around fishing and livestock, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> recently they have adopted farming; many are salary earners working in civil administration, teaching, trade and other areas.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. <b>Although</b> <b>more</b> than 10,000fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine.

The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, <b>although</b> <b>more</b> samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
