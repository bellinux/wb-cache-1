60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces at me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to kiss me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mistah Buzzard, {{you don't}} really mean that!" [...] exclaimed old Granny Fox, just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to believe it, but couldn't.|$|E
60|$|But {{his sister}} {{did not keep}} quiet for long, and tore and pulled at the rich brocade <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to destroy it, {{stamping}} about and shouting angrily.|$|E
6000|$|... "She cry half 'e time, sah--den {{she look}} up bold, and resolute, just like ole Massar, sah, when he tell he rijjement 'charge baggonet,' and seem <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>want</b> {{to go right}} into T'ousandacres' huts. Lor' bless me, sah, Masser Mordaunt--if she ask me one {{question}} about you to-day, she ask me a hundred!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't <b>want</b> to hurt me, but {{admitted}} {{that they would be}} willing to state that Agatha had ability and taught science well. Then she stopped and I asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could go no farther. Ability wasn't all a teacher needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She seemed mighty {{careful about}} how she slipped out of those bushes,' thought Mr. Bob-cat. 'She acted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't <b>want</b> to be seen. I wonder why. I wonder <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has a secret hidden in those bushes. I suppose the {{way to find out}} is to look.' ...|$|R
60|$|Contemptuous fury on {{the part}} of all the ladies. Mrs. Sniff looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> {{somebody}} to hold her, and everbody else looking as if they'd rayther not.|$|E
6000|$|... "Looking at him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to pot at {{him with}} a rifle. I should like to do it myself. What were you saying when he came up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I?" [...] drawled Harry dryly. [...] "Maybe. And {{then when}} Dick made his run, pretty Dora Stanhope just put {{out her arms}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to hug-- Whow!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In Sting's {{inauguration of}} Amie and Lizzy, Amie's eyes {{can be seen}} {{watering}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> still <b>wants</b> to be in Claw or maybe because she let her former team down in [...] "Tower of Strength." [...] She felt very sad but got through it in the end.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor woman}} was in despair at {{witnessing}} her husband's undignified actions {{and wondered what}} she might do to control him. The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's face wore an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> still <b>wanted</b> to play the piano.|$|R
5000|$|... "'Happy Pills' {{tells the}} story of Jones emancipating herself from a {{relationship}} and finding that she’s better off alone - or at least without whoever it is she’s leaving behind. The narrative is far from groundbreaking and the lyrics themselves read like a high school poetry assignment (“with you gone, I’m alive / makes me feel like I took happy pills / and time stood still”), yet the song itself is undeniably addictive and pleasant. Thick, clean percussion fills the track - what else would you expect from a Danger Mouseproduction? - and Jones’ soulful voice takes on an almost sinister tone, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to make the mate she’s left behind writhe with the realization that she’s happier without him." [...] —review by Andrew Bailey from [...] "Beats Per Minute" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{clouds of}} doubt {{rolled off the}} mind of Mr. Bishopriggs. The lady's friend knew of the lost letter. And, better still, the lady's friend looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it!' {{the poor}} thing burst out aloud, {{clasping}} her little fingers, and pressing them back against her forehead, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to break them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three cheers for Dan!" [...] {{and there}} was Mrs. Jo in the doorway waving her dish-towel, and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to dance a jig for joy, as she used to do when a girl.|$|E
60|$|Outside {{the hours}} when Nell sat to him, he {{purposely}} saw but little of her, leaving her to nestle under Sylvia's wing; and this <b>she</b> did, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>wanted</b> to come out. Thus he preserved his amusement at her quaint warmths, and quainter calmness, his aesthetic pleasure in watching her, whose strange, half-hypnotized, half-hypnotic gaze, had {{a sort of}} dreamy and pathetic lovingness, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were brimful of affections that had no outlet.|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} {{included}} in the setlist of the band's third worldwide tour, The Self-Titled Tour. For each performance of the song, the band was accompanied by a gospel choir, who sang alongside Williams. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard commented, [...] "Williams kept conjuring the refrain , appearing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> never <b>wanted</b> the moment to end. Could you really blame her?" [...] The New Zealand Heralds Rachel Bache stated that the track [...] "had everyone dancing".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, that's all right," [...] said Mrs. Gereth <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had only}} <b>wanted</b> {{to feel that}} she had been irreproachably considerate. After this she was gentler still, but she had another point to clear up. [...] "Why have you given, for a reply, your sister's address?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said she, after pausing a little, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to be {{sure and}} get it right, [...] "you two saved my life, and I {{want to give you}} {{something}} to remember me by." ...|$|E
60|$|She became {{sudden and}} incalculable. Often {{she stood at}} the window, looking out, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to go. Sometimes she went, she mixed with people. But always she came home in anger, as if she were diminished, belittled, almost degraded.|$|E
6000|$|While I was speaking, Dolores {{turned me}} toward the moonlight, and fixed her great dark eyes piercingly upon me, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to read my soul. [...] "Is that all?" [...] she said; [...] "is that the only reason?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Notice {{those eyes}} of hers, so deep, and sorry for {{everybody}} in general? If it was anybody in particular, that fellow would be in luck. Oh. she's a dumpling, there's no mistake about it! 'Nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered!' That's Miss Carver's style. <b>She</b> looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> just <b>wanted</b> to forgive somebody something. I'm afraid you ain't wicked enough, Barker. Look here! What's the reason we can't make up a little party for the Easter service at the Catholic cathedral Sunday night? The girls would like to go, I know." ...|$|R
60|$|She came in very quietly, {{and stood}} still, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not <b>want</b> to {{interrupt}} Graham's eloquence.... But his doubts and questionings fled before her presence. He remembered {{the things that}} he had meant to say. He faced the cameras again and the light about him grew brighter. He turned back to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! I {{should be}} quite {{in the way}}. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not <b>want</b> me. My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could almost say the same. What am I to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{for some}} reason, she must call in Rouen {{on the way}} back to London. He had an instinctive mistrust of her desire for the place. But, perversely, she wanted to go there. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to try its effect upon her.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes blazed at him, he felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to destroy}} him. She had gripped {{him and was}} trying to break him. His anger sprang up, against her. At least he would fight for his {{existence}} with her. A hard, blind resistance possessed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most {{women know}} by {{instinct}} {{whether they can}} give it or not," [...] Lady Otway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to get this said while her sister-in-law's attention was diverted. [...] "And if not--well then, my advice would be--don't marry." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{taking one}} look at his face, she slipped in ever so quietly, like a very good child.... Marvellous the {{instinct}} and finesse of the young when they are women!... Not a vestige in her of yesterday's seductive power; not a sign {{that there had been}} a yesterday at all--just confiding, like a daughter. Sitting there, telling him about Ireland, showing him the little batch of drawings she had done while she was away. Had she brought them because she knew they would make him feel sorry for her? What could have been less dangerous, more appealing to the protective and paternal side of him than she was that morning; <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> only <b>wanted</b> what her father and her home could not give her--only wanted to be a sort of daughter to him! ...|$|R
5000|$|In the city, Assistant Commissioner Vetrimaaran (Arun Vijay) {{is celebrating}} his elder brother, Aravind (Amit Bharghav) and sister-in-law, Abhinaya's (Abhinaya) wedding anniversary. Everyone {{in the family}} is happy, except for Vetri's mother who berates Abhinaya for not giving her grandchildren despite having been married for so many years. However, after {{successfully}} undergoing treatment by a famous fertility specialist, Dr. Tulsi (Kalyani Natarajan), Abhinaya finally becomes pregnant. While {{the rest of his}} family are in a celebratory mode, Vetri notices Abhinaya being moody most of the time, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> does not <b>want</b> the baby.|$|R
40|$|This thesis mainly {{deals with}} men?s oppression {{and its effect}} toward Firdaus which leads her to her search for {{self-esteem}} in Nawal El Saadawi?s Woman at Point Zero. I find out that Firdaus, the main female character in the novel, has experienced unbearable suffering in her life which leads her to hate men and the hatred makes her wants to find her own self-esteem {{in order to be}} respected. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the ways of the male characters? oppression toward Firdaus and how the oppression affects Firdaus in her way to find her self-esteem. To reach the purpose of this study, I use cultural approach, mainly the ideology of patriarchy, in order to help me to recognize the oppression that men use which makes Firdaus suffer and begin to look for her self-esteem. Through the topic which I present in this thesis, I see that the men in Firdaus? life make her suffer in their own way, especially through their sexual desires that need to be fulfilled. Not only that they force Firdaus with their desires, but they also try to persuade her and make up the situation <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to do it by her own free will and give them the pleasure for free. This kind of treatment of men is considered as oppression toward Firdaus and this oppression makes Firdaus suffer and the suffering little by little make Firdaus realize that actually every human being has a price and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to have it too. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> to be respected by others and that need of being respected has made her try to find her self-esteem, no matter what it takes, <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to have it. Therefore, I find out that women, especially in rural world like Egypt, {{have to go through a}} lot of oppressions. However they should have courage to find their own dignity and overcome their fears in facing those oppressions and also defense their right as women...|$|R
6000|$|... "I gave ’er a smile—I {{thought she}} {{deserved}} it—but she didn’t smile back. She was rather a nice-looking {{woman in the}} ordinary way, but I could easy see ’ow temper spoils a woman’s looks. She stood there giving little shivers and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to bite somebody.|$|E
6000|$|Alice {{was just}} {{beginning}} to say 'There's a mistake somewhere--,' when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished. 'Oh, oh, oh!' shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to shake it off. 'My finger's bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{profound}} mistrust possessed him suddenly. Why did {{the witches}} quarrel about letting him sleep here? And what meant that stare {{of the girl}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> to impress his features for ever in her mind? His own nervousness alarmed him. He seemed to himself to be removed very far from mankind.|$|E
60|$|It {{was surely}} a merry party in that Pullman. The bridal couple emerged from their hiding place {{and held a}} sort of {{reception}} in which the Rube appeared shy and frightened, and Nan resembled a joyous, fluttering bird in gray. I did not see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> kissed every man on the team, but <b>she</b> kissed me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been <b>wanting</b> {{to do it for}} ages. Milly kissed the Rube, and so did the other women, to his infinite embarrassment. Nan's effect upon that crowd was most singular. She was sweetness and caprice and joy personified.|$|R
60|$|She went away, {{leaving him}} in a {{thoughtful}} mood, though his heart beat. Lucy was clever {{and would not have}} given him such a hint unless she thought it was justified. Still, she might be mistaken and he feared to risk too much; then there were other difficulties--he was not rich. He went to the writing-room, knitting his brows, and stopped abruptly when he found Alice there alone. She put aside a half-finished letter, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did not <b>want</b> him to go away, and he advanced to the table and stood looking down at her.|$|R
60|$|So Nuttie had to submit, {{though she}} pouted to herself, feeling grievously misjudged, first <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been <b>wanting</b> {{in regard to}} the memory of her mother, who had been so fond of Mark, and so rejoiced in his happiness; and then that her vexation was treated as mere love of gaiety, whereas it really was {{disappointment}} at not seeing Mr. Dutton, that good, grave, precise old friend, who could not be named in the same breath with vanity. Moreover, she could not help suspecting that respect to her mother was after all only a cloak to resentment against Mark and his marriage.|$|R
