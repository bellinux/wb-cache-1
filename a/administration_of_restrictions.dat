At the same time, the accuracy of legal regulations is uncertain due to thevariety of legal classifications and the vague administrative procedures envisaged for theirimplementation. This article offers an extensive analysis of the accuracy of legal restrictionson the vote for people {{with cognitive}} impairments in all electoral democracies. The articleargues that the prospect of ever regulating the vote accurately, {{in the sense of}} avoidingboth misclassifications and arbitrary <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>restrictions,</b> is difficult to envisage.

50|$|Hypervolemia, or fluid overload, is {{the medical}} {{condition}} {{where there is}} too much fluid in the blood. The opposite condition is hypovolemia, which is too little fluid volume in the blood. Fluid volume excess in the intravascular compartment occurs due to an increase in total body sodium content and a consequent increase in extracellular body water. The mechanism usually stems from compromised regulatory mechanisms for sodium handling as seen in congestive heart failure (CHF), kidney failure, and liver failure. It may also be caused by excessive intake of sodium from foods, intravenous (IV) solutions and blood transfusions, medications, or diagnostic contrast dyes. Treatment typically includes <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> diuretics and <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the intake of water, fluids, sodium, and salt.|$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{hydrothorax}} is an infrequent {{complication of}} cirrhosis and symptoms are mainly related to shortness of breath, cough and chest discomfort. A {{number of different}} pathogenetic mechanisms have been postulated {{for the development of}} pleural effusions in cirrhotic patients. Spontaneous infection of the pleural fluid, defined as spontaneous bacterial empyema, is a serious complication characterized by high mortality rate. Diagnosis is based on high clinical suspicion and initial therapy of hepatic hydrothorax is aimed at suppressing the production <b>of</b> ascites with <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> diuretics and <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> sodium intake. When these fail (10 % of cases) and thoracentesis is required every 2 - 3 weeks, the hydrothorax is defined as refractory and alternative more aggressive therapeutic strategies, such as thoracoscopic repair of diaphragmatic defects with pleural sclerosis, transjugular percutaneous intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt placement (TIPSS) and liver transplantation, must be considered.

40|$|Background and Objective: Obesity is a {{worldwide}} {{public health problem}} that results in comorbidities including diabetes, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease and some types of cancer. It seems that soy isoflavones can improve obesity and reverse subsequent metabolic disorders. In this study, we assessed the effect <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> calorie supplemented with genistein on diet-induced obese rats. Subjects and Methods: Thirty rats obesed with high fat diet were divided randomly into 3 experimental groups (n= 10) as follows: group 1 : low calorie diet supplemented with 50 mg/kgbw genistein, group 2 : low calorie diet supplemented with Dimethyl Sulphoxide (DMSO) (as vehicle) and group 3 : obese control rats with ad libitum access to standard food. After 4 weeks, fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed for biochemical analysis. Results: The results showed that <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> genistein in conjunction with low calorie diet can synergistically improve triglyceride (p= 0. 005), VLDL (p= 0. 005), total cholesterol(p= 0. 002) and LDL-C (P= 0. 003) and increase HDL-C (p= 0. 001) but {{has no effect on}} body weight and proinflammatory biomarkers (resistin and CRP). <b>Restriction</b> <b>of</b> calorie also resulted in the decrease of glucose level, TG, TC, LDL, proinflammatory biomarker (CRP) and increase in HDL-C (p< 0. 05) but has no effect on resistin level. Conclusion: It seems that <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> genistein with <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> calorie is useful for improvement of hyperlipidemia in obese hyperlipidemic patients.

40|$|It is {{essential}} that postmarketing surveillance be con-ducted for any new drug, especially if the drug is a trail-blazer for {{a new class of}} compounds, so that possible safety concerns not detected during clinical trials can be brought to light.

40|$|Abstract. This paper quantifies and {{analyzes}} measures <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on inward {{foreign direct}} investment (FDI) {{in the service sector}} for developing countries, using a methodology developed in Golub (2003) in a study of OECD countries. Several different types <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> are considered: limitations on foreign ownership, screening or notification procedures, management restrictions, and operational restrictions. These restrictions on FDI are computed for a large number of subsectors and then aggregated into a single measure for the service sector as a whole in each country. The sample includes 50 developing countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. Notwithstanding the world-wide trend towards liberalization <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> since the early 1990 s, there remain substantial disparities between regions and individual countries in the severity <b>of</b> observable <b>restrictions</b> on inward FDI in services. The paper finds that Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe generally have low levels <b>of</b> <b>restrictions,</b> whereas the highest levels <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> are found in East Asia and the Middle East.

40|$|Objective: To {{construct}} an empirical classification {{of patients with}} shoulder complaints, and then to investigate {{the relationship between the}} empirical classification and the setting in which the patients were recruited, their demographic and clinical characteristics, and the original diagnostic categories. Study Design and Setting: A latent class analysis was performed on the combined data of two previous studies. Results: Four clusters of patients emerged, one with patients who have a small chance <b>of</b> any <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motion of the shoulder and a moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motions of the neck, a second with patients who have a high chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motions of the shoulder and a moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> motions of the neck, a third with patients who have a low to moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> all motions, and a fourth with patients who have a high chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> all of the motions. Patients recruited from a clinic for rheumatology and rehabilitation and from the orthopedic clinic were more present in the second cluster. Patients in the third cluster were on average younger than those in the other clusters. There appeared to be little agreement between the clusters found and the classification of patients according to the original diagnostic categories. Conclusion: Patients experiencing shoulder pain can be classified in a simple way into four categories, reflecting the distinction between problems of the shoulder and those of the neck. A simple classification rule is proposed with which almost all patients can be classified into the four clusters. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

The animals were divided into four groups and administered orally 37 kBq carrier-free Na 131 I in 0. 25 ml normal saline. One group of ani-mals was given food and water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. Food and water to the remaining groups were restricted before and/or after the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> 131 I. The animals in each group were sacrificed 4 h and 24 h after administration, and the activity of 131 I in thyroid, blood, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, urine, feces, and carcass was measured. There was {{a significant increase in}} the retention of 131 I in the thyroid and the concentration of 131 I in the blood due to the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> food and water after the <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> 131 I. In contrast, a significant decrease in the urinary excretion was observed in these animals.

40|$|License Plate Recognition {{plays an}} {{important}} role on the traffic monitoring and parking management. <b>Administration</b> and <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> those transportation tools for their better service becomes very essential. In this paper, a fast and real time method has an appropriate application to find plates that the plat has tilt and the picture quality is poor. In the proposed method, at the beginning, the image is converted into binary mode with use of adaptive threshold. And with use of edge detection and morphology operation, plate number location has been specified and if the plat has tilt; its tilt is removed away. Then its characters are distinguished using image processing techniques. Finally, K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classifier was used for character recognition. This method has been tested on available data set that has different images of the background, considering distance, and angel of view so that the correct extraction rate of plate reached at 98 % and character recognition rate achieved at 99. 12 %. Further we tested our character recognition stage on Persian vehicle data set and we achieved 99 % correct recognition rate.

40|$|A novel DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{technique called}} AFLP is described. The AFLP technique {{is based on}} the selective PCR amplification <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50 - 100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity...|$|R
