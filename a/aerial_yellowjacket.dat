25|$|The common <b>aerial</b> <b>yellowjacket</b> lives across Canada and the United States. They occur {{from north}} central Alaska to {{as far south}} as New Mexico and Arizona. D. arenaria are in fact {{one of the most common}} aerial yellowjackets found in eastern North America, and nests can be found in {{arboreal}} to subterranean habitats. Their nests are made from paper-like material and are usually found in trees and shrubs. In urban settings, their nests are frequently found on buildings.|$|E

2500|$|Yellowjacket or Yellowjacket is {{the common}} name in North America for predatory social wasps of the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula. Members of these genera are known simply as [...] "wasps" [...] in other English-speaking countries. Most of these are black and yellow like the eastern yellowjacket Vespula maculifrons and the <b>aerial</b> <b>yellowjacket</b> Dolichovespula arenaria; some are black and white like the bald-faced hornet, Dolichovespula maculata. Others may have the abdomen {{background}} color red instead of black. They can be identified by their distinctive markings, their occurrence only in colonies, and a characteristic, rapid, side-to-side flight pattern prior to landing. All females are capable of stinging. Yellowjackets are important predators of pest insects.|$|E
