5000|$|Forbidden Hollywood is the parody {{show that}} opened Off-Off-Broadway and was taped live in Hollywood. It {{was created by}} Gerard Alessandrini, who also created the ever-popular series of Off-Broadway parodies of Broadway theatre, Forbidden Broadway.

It also spoofs movie stars like Tom Hanks, Keanu Reeves, Barbra Streisand, Ann-Margret and Whoopi Goldberg. A The New York Times reviewer wrote that although the production had funny moments, [...] "the tone that defines the show is a glib disaffection for Hollywood", lamenting that the show missed the opportunity to use more songs from films, and concluding: [...] "It's fine if Mr. Alessandrini wants to see Hollywood as the enemy, but you have to know your enemy to take good aim at it." ...|$|R
