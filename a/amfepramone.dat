However, it is not known whether <b>amfepramone</b> produces immediate vascular effects when applied in vitro to rat aortic rings and, if so, what mechanisms may be involved. We analyzed the effect of <b>amfepramone</b> on phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings with or without endothelium and the influence of inhibitors or blockers on this effect. <b>Amfepramone</b> produced a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in phenylephrine-precontracted rat aortic rings that was not affected by the vehicle, atropine, 4 -AP, glibenclamide, indomethacin, clotrimazole, or cycloheximide. The vasorelaxant effect of <b>amfepramone</b> was significantly attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and tetraethylammonium (TEA), and was blocked by removal of the vascular endothelium.

The linear range for the <b>amfepramone</b> determination by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was 0. 05 to 2. 0 mg L- 1 (r = 0. 998) in acidic medium and 0. 25 to 4. 0 mg L- 1 (r = 0. 994) in alkaline medium.

40|$|The low configurational {{stability}} of two model compounds, the anorectic drug <b>amfepramone</b> {{and one of}} its basic metabolites, rac-cathinone, was examined for its mechanism and kinetics. Assuming a common intermediate for chiral inversion and deuteration, the rates of racemization were determined by the indirect method of proton-deuterium substitution monitored by H- 1 -NMR. The rate of racemization increased linearily with increasing pD. At a pD of 7. 4, the rate of racemization of both aminoketones was markedly dependent on buffer concentration, indicating a. mechanism of general-base catalysis. The reactions were some five to six times faster in phosphate buffers than in hydroxylamine buffers of identical molarity. <b>Amfepramone</b> racemized about five times faster than the primary amine cathinone.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the frequency of prescriptions for appetite suppressants in community pharmacies at Cruz Alta, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The sales of fenproporex, <b>amfepramone</b> and sibutramine in the months of September, October and November 2010 and April, May and June 2011 were compared. It was observed that the most commonly dispensed anorectic in the three community pharmacies analyzed was sibutramine.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} efficacy and safety of <b>amfepramone,</b> fenproporex and mazindol as a monotherapy for the treatment of obese or overweight patients. A systematic review of primary studies was conducted, followed by a direct meta-analysis (random effect) and mixed treatment comparison. Medline and other databases were searched. Heterogeneity was explored through I 2 associated with a p-value. Of 739 identified publications, 25 were included in the meta-analysis. The global evaluation of Cochrane resulted in 19 studies with a high level of bias and six with unclear risk. Due to the lack of information in primary studies, direct meta-analyses were conducted only for <b>amfepramone</b> and mazindol. Compared to placebo, <b>amfepramone</b> resulted in higher weight loss in the short-term (< 180 days; mean difference (MD) - 1. 281 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 0 %; p= 0. 379) and long-term (≥ 180 days; MD - 6. 518 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 0 %; p= 0. 719). Only studies with long-term follow up reported efficacy in terms of abdominal circumference and 5 - 10 % weight reduction. These results corroborated the finding that the efficacy of <b>amfepramone</b> is greater than that of placebo. Treatment with mazindol showed greater short-term weight loss than that with placebo (MD - 1. 721 kg; p< 0. 05; I 2 : 0. 9 %; p= 0. 388). However, metabolic outcomes were poorly described, preventing a meta-analysis. A mixed treatment comparison corroborated the direct meta-analysis. Considering the high level of risk of bias and the absence of important published outcomes for anti-obesity therapy assessments, this study found that the evaluated drugs showed poor evidence of efficacy in the treatment of overweight and obese patients.

Aims: This study had evaluated the behavior in rats after treatment with Homeo-PaxÃ‚Â® in pre-clinical models of depression and anxiety. Mathods: Elevated Plus Maze Test (EPM), Forced Swimming Test (FST), Open Field Test (OFT) and the Rota Rod Test (RRT) behavior assays were used to confirm its activity. In the EPM, the animals treated with Homeo-paxÃ‚Â® on the 1 st day and until the 20 th day of treatment remained longer in the open arms of the maze than on 30 th day. This result was statistically significant compared with the control group (p < 0. 05). In the FST, the treatment with Homeo-paxÃ‚Â® (0. 5 ml, p. o) increased the swimming time, compared to the control group. This effect was dependent on treatment time, resulting in a similar effect to that presented by <b>amfepramone</b> (10 mg/kg, p. o). In the OFT, crossing by the animals was significantly increased by the treatment with <b>amfepramone</b> (10 mg/kg, p. o), and also with the 30 -day treatment with Homeo-paxÃ‚Â®.

40|$|Obesity is a {{major health}} problem worldwide. It is {{associated}} with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and decreased longevity. In managing obesity, diet and exercise are essential; pharmacological therapy may be added for obese patients or overweight patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Sibutramine is a serotonergic and adrenergic drug that reduces food intake and increases thermogenesis. It reduces bodyweight by about 4. 2 kg after 12 months, and improves blood glucose and lipids; however, it can increase heart rate and blood pressure. In the SCOUT (Sibutramine Cardiovascular OUTcomes) study, sibutramine increased serious cardiovascular events, such as stroke or myocardial infarction, compared with placebo, and was consequently withdrawn from the market. The lesson learnt from this {{is the importance of}} patient selection, limiting the duration of treatment and stopping treatment in non-responders. Currently, phentermine and <b>amfepramone</b> (diethylpropion) are approved for short-term treatment of obesity (up to 3 months) and orlistat is approved for longer-term treatment; however, the gastrointestinal adverse effects of orlistat may be intolerable for some patients.

40|$|Background: Obesity is {{a serious}} chronic disease and the {{prevalence}} of this condition is increasing among the elderly. Although the benefits of weight loss to improve control of associated diseases are well known in young adults, {{they are not in}} older patients. The use of anti-obesity drugs to promote weight loss is widespread in Brazil and other countries, and obesity specialists frequently prescribe medicines in doses and for durations previously unreported in the literature. Sibutramine, orlistat and <b>amfepramone</b> (diethylpropion) have been evaluated in clinical trials of more than 2 years` duration in adults, demonstrating safety and efficacy, but long-term studies in obesity treatment are absent for other drugs. The efficacy and safety of obesity pharmacotherapy among the elderly is unknown. Objective: To describe the experience of obesity pharmacotherapy in the elderly in a specialized obesity care setting in Brazil, with a focus on efficacy and safety. Methods: A retrospective evaluation was conducted on medical charts from an outpatient clinic of a specialized tertiary centre for the treatment of obesity. We included patients who had had at least one consultation between January and December 2007, were aged >= 60 years {{at the beginning of the}} treatment, had had at least 6 months of follow-up and had received a prescription of at least one potential weight-loss drug. Diagnoses reported on medical records were documented. Age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI) were recorded at admission, after 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, and at the last available visit. The medicines prescribed, together with the dose, duration of use, adverse effects and reasons for discontinuation, were documented. Results: The group consisted of 44 women (86 %) and 7 men (14 %), with a mean +/- SD age of 65. 2 +/- 4. 5 years, weight of 95. 3 +/- 12. 5 kg and BMI of 38. 5 +/- 4. 3 kg/m(2). The mean +/- SD time of follow-up was 39. 3 +/- 26. 4 months, and the mean weight loss was 6. 65 kg (p = 5 % was achieved by 64. 71 %, 63. 64 %, 62. 16 % and 69. 70 % in the 6 th, 12 th, 18 th and 24 th months, respectively, and a weight loss of >= 10 % was achieved by 17. 65 %, 34. 09 %, 32. 43 % and 39. 39 % in the 6 th, 12 th, 18 th and 24 th months, respectively. The medicines prescribed were sibutramine, orlistat, fluoxetine, sertraline, topiramate, fenproporex, mazindol and <b>amfepramone,</b> alone or in combinations, concomitantly or sequentially. The reasons for discontinuation were lack of response (n = 13), loss of response (development of tolerance) [n= 11], lack of adherence (n = 14) and adverse effects (n= 14). One episode of atrial flutter occurred in a patient taking fenproporex. The weight-loss medications were generally well tolerated, and only transient adverse events were reported.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The International Narcotics Control Board {{released}} its 2005 annual report, highlighting the Brazil population {{as one of}} the largest consumers of anorectics. In Brazil, the National Health Surveillance Agency issued the resolution RDC 58 / 2007 in order to control the prescription and sale of such drugs. In Belém, the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon region, this resolution came into force in 2008, leading to inspections of drugstores and magistral pharmacies. The aim of this work was to evaluate the consumption of psychotropic anorectic drugs and the impact of RDC 58 / 2007 on the prescription and dispensing of anorectics in drugstores and magistral pharmacies in Belém. METHODOLOGY: A retrospective quantitative and descriptive study was conducted of records from the Municipal Department of Health Surveillance of Belém, for 2005 to 2008. The differences in findings were regarded significant when p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 1, 641 balance sheets of drugstores and magistral pharmacies were analyzed. <b>Amfepramone</b> was the most dispensed medication, followed by fenproporex and mazindol. The highest consumption of anorectics occurred in magistral pharmacies. In 2008, there was a significant reduction in dispensing of anorectics, in drugstores as well as in magistral pharmacies. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that there was a decrease in the dispensing of anorectics after RDC 58 / 2007 came into force, and that the magistral pharmacies dispensed more of these drugs. This resolution is a remarkable tool in health control, where it is of great benefit to public health and contributes substantially to the rational use of medicines in Brazil...|$|E

40|$|Obesity is a {{worldwide}} heath {{problem that is}} associated with significant complications, social problem and increased mortality. Obesity is defined as excess of body fat that may have negative influence on heath. it is a multifactorial problem and associated with many conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, sleep apnea, gallbladder disease, reproductive system diseases both in men and women, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, social and psychological problems and some type of cancer. Despite the best efforts of health care systems to control obesity epidemic, the currently available anti-obesity medications are very limited. Many anti-obesity agents such as ephedrine, mazindol, Phenylpropanolamine, Fenfluramine/Dexfenfluramine, amphetamines, rimonabant, and most lately sibutramine have been withdrawn from the market due to their poor efficacy and/or safety issues. Increased physical activity and healthy diet are the first approach in obesity managements. Pharmacotherapy is recommended for those who have body mass index higher than 30 or (27 with comorbidities). Surgical intervention is considered as a last option in controlling obesity, which is the most effective way currently. The current pharmacotherapies in obesity are targeting caloric intake reduction (appetite suppressants), limiting fat absorption (Orlistat) or induce energy expenditure and thermogenesis (e. g. caffeine). At present drugs that are available in the U. S. market are Orlistat (Xenical®), Phentermine, <b>Amfepramone</b> (Diethlpropion) and Fluoxetine. Lorcaserin (Belviq), PHEN/TPM-ER combination (Qsymia), and Bupropion/Naltrexone (Contrave) have been approved recently and they are assume to be promising and safe. Admitting that these drugs can clinically induce weight loss when used as mono-therapy, however the use of anti-obesity agents as adjunctive therapy with intensive lifestyle modification is the most successful strategy. Close-follow up with blood glucose level and blood pressure monitoring is important in patients taken anti-obesity medications. The aims of weight loss are to improve well-being and physical health. egységes, osztatlanáltalános orvosango...|$|E
