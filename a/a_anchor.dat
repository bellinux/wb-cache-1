This work provides evidence for the over-expression of LRBA in certain cancers, and that LRBA promoter activity and endogenous LRBA mRNA levels are negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor p 53 and positively regulated by E 2 F transactivators. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of LRBA expression or function leads to decreased proliferation of cancer cells and that LRBA plays a role in the EGFR signal transduction pathway. In addition to the findings of LRBA 2 ̆ 7 s role in carcinogenesis, this work also shows evidence of the knockdown of the SH 2 -containing Inositol 52 ̆ 7 Phosphatase (SHIP) in both mouse and human cells.

40|$|We {{describe}} PALML, a novel gene encoding a 551 {{amino acid}} protein with similarity to paralemmin and the paralemmin-like amino terminal domain of AKAP 2, a protein kinase <b>A</b> <b>anchor</b> protein. PALML mRNA {{is expressed in}} many tissues and is most abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscle, while absent from brain and blood. Exogenously expressed PALML fusion protein has a widespread cytoplasmic localization, and it is excluded from the nucleus. Human PALML maps on human chromosome 1 p 21 (between D 1 S 2767 and D 1 S 223). SSCP-HD analysis of exonic sequences in patients with VUR (familial non-syndromic vesicoureteral reflux syndrome) excluded mutations in the PALML gene from causing this disease. PALML, paralemmin and AKAP 2 share {{the presence of a}} conserved coiled coil region that may mediate protein interactions with shared partners. Based on its resemblance to paralemmin and AKAP 2, PALML is hypothesized to be involved in regulating intracellular signaling and membrane-cytoskeletal interactions. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{effective}} vaccine, there is an urgent need for safe and effective antiviral agents to prevent transmission of HIV.

C 5 A exhibits a broad range of antiviral activity against HIV isolates, and it prevents infection of the three in vivo targets of HIV: CD 4 (+) T lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells by disrupting the integrity of the viral membrane and capsid core while preserving the integrity of host membranes. C 5 A can interrupt an ongoing T cell infection, and it can prevent transmigration of HIV through primary genital epithelial cells, infection of mucosal target cells and transfer from dendritic cells to T cells ex vivo, justifying future experiments to determine whether C 5 A can prevent HIV transmission in viv...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the area of}} video annotation, indexing and retrieval, and shows how a set of tools can be employed, along with domain knowledge, to detect narrative structure in broadcast news. The initial structure is detected using low-level audio visual processing in conjunction with domain knowledge. Higher level processing may then utilize the initial structure detected to direct processing to improve and extend the initial classification. The structure detected breaks a news broadcast into segments, each of which contains a single topic of discussion. Further the segments are labeled as <b>a)</b> <b>anchor</b> person or reporter, b) footage with a voice over or c) sound bite. This labeling {{may be used to}} provide a summary, for example by presenting a thumbnail for each reporter present in a section of the video. The inclusion of domain knowledge in computation allows more directed application of high level processing, giving much greater efficiency of effort expended. This allows valid deductions to be made about structure and semantics of the contents of a news video stream, as demonstrated by our experiments on CNN news broadcasts. <br /...|$|E
40|$|During its {{transport}} to the bacterial surface, the phosphate {{groups of the}} lipid <b>A</b> <b>anchor</b> of Escherichia coli and Salmonella lipopolysaccharide are modified by membrane enzymes including ArnT, EptA and LpxT. ArnT and EptA catalyse the periplasmic addition of the positively charged substituents 4 -amino- 4 -deoxy-L-arabinose and phosphoethanolamine respectively. These modifications are controlled by the PmrA transcriptional regulator and confer resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides, including polymyxin. LpxT, however, catalyses the phosphorylation of lipid A at the 1 -position forming 1 -diphosphate lipid A increasing the negative charge of the bacterial surface. Here, we report that PmrA {{is involved in the}} regulation of LpxT. Interestingly, this regulation does not occur at the level of transcription, but rather following the assembly of LpxT into the inner membrane. PmrA-dependent inhibition of LpxT is required for phosphoethanolamine decoration of lipid A, which is shown here to be critical for E. coli to resist the bactericidal activity of polymyxin. Furthermore, although Salmonella lipid A is more prevalently modified with l- 4 -aminoarabinose, we demonstrate that loss of Salmonella lpxT greatly increases EptA modification. The current work {{is an example of the}} complexities associated with the structural remodelling of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides promoting bacterial survival...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It {{has been}} known {{for a number of years}} that glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins, in {{contrast}} to many transmembrane proteins, are insoluble at 4 °C in nonionic detergents such as Triton X- 100. Recently, it has been proposed that this behavior reflects the incorporation of GPI-linked proteins into large aggregates that are rich in sphingolipids and cholesterol, as well as in cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as heterotrimeric G proteins and src-family tyrosine kinases. It has been suggested that these lipidprotein complexes are derived from caveolae, non-clathrin-coated invaginations of the plasmalemma that are abundant in endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and lung. Caveolin, a proposed coat protein of caveolae, has been hypothesized to be essential for formation of the complexes. To further investigate the relationship between the detergent-resistant complexes and diverse group of proteins is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) <b>a</b> <b>anchor</b> (reviewed by Cross, 1990; Englund, 1993). This group includes lymphocyte and trypanosome surface antigens, adhesion molecules, exofacial enzymes, and receptors. The core structure of the anchor consists of a phosphoethanolamine residue amide-linked to the COOH-terminal amino acid of the protein, three mannose residues, an unacetylated glucosamine residue, and a phosphatidylinositol molecule that is embedded in the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer. This core is transferred en bloc to the polypeptide chain in the endoplasmic reticulum, following cleavage of a hydrophobic COOH-terminal domain that serves as a signal for anchor addition...|$|E
