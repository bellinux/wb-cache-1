Children learning <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>language</b> to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows.|$|E

5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity.

These kinds of differences {{are not part of}} the linguistic system, but are an important part of how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
