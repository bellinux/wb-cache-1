5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E

25|$|A {{practical}} {{question in}} active vegetation restoration is whether certain plants facilitate the recruitment and persistence of other plants (as predicted by theories of succession), or whether initial community composition determines long-term community composition (priority effects). If the former applies, {{it may be}} more effective to plant facilitative species first, <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> plant dependent species as conditions become appropriate (e.g., when enough shade is provided by overstory species). If the latter applies, it is probably best to plant all desired species at the outset.|$|E
25|$|They can {{be divided}} into flabby or robust body types. Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes, they have a reduced body mass, and low {{metabolic}} rates, expending minimal energy as they lie <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> ambush prey. An example of a flabby fish is the cusk-eel Acanthonus armatus, a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90% water. This fish has the largest ears (otoliths) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.|$|E

25|$|Cataline's pack train usually {{consisted}} of sixty mules. The pack mules could carry 250 - 300 pounds and could navigate very difficult trails. Cataline's mules were so well trained {{that when the}} corregidor rang a signal bell, {{they would go to}} their own packs <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> be loaded. Each outfit also employed six or more men, a foreman, also known as a corregidor, a second man, known as a secundo, a cook and several muleteers. In Cataline's outfit, his corregidor was Ah Gun and his secundo was Dave Wiggins.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Mike Flanagan was {{suffering}} arm problems, and many scouts {{decided that he}} did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> see if his arm would recuperate. [...] The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. [...] During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. [...] Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer Jeff Bagwell in return. [...] The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.|$|E

[...] He ordered all the soldiers who were not involved in the mutiny to remain in their positions and sit down, and then led his personal guards to the main command post to restore order. The leaders of the mutiny were identified and executed.|$|E
2500|$|Special {{complications}} {{arise in}} the professional game, under ICC and other regulations, when technology is used to assist the umpires, and overturns a decision made on the field. Video review by the third umpire may reveal that a no ball should have been called (especially for overstepping or a beamer) when the batsman has been given out. If so, the ball is deemed to be dead {{from the moment of}} the 'dismissal event,' and any runs scored after that point (runs, byes or leg byes) will not count, but the batting team do get the no ball penalty. [...] It is now customary for a batsman given out to stand {{at the edge of the}} playing area <b>and</b> <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> see if the video may discover a no ball, in which case he is reinstated. If the batsmen have crossed in running, the batsmen do not return to their original ends. Video review may also reveal that a no ball should NOT have been called, in which case the ball becomes dead at the time of the on-field call.|$|E
