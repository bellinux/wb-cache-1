The decision, dated 7March 1995, ordered the institute's departure by 1996. Simultaneously, the institute wrote to Luzhkov describing the earlier events from their perspective, and requested compensation for loss of the building.

Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Slaughter was the {{favorite}} choice {{for governor of}} Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby's name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he {{had no desire to}} do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{the assault}} on his deputies, El Paso County Sheriff M.F. Bowers wired the {{governor}} and requested {{the intervention of the}} state militia (predecessor to the Colorado National Guard). Governor Davis H. Waite, a 67-year-old Populist, dispatched 300 troops to the area on March 18 under the command of Adjutant General T.J. Tarsney. Tarsney found the area tense but quiet. Union president Calderwood <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E

5|$|Alexios {{was able}} to recover a number of {{important}} cities and islands, and in fact much of western Asia Minor. Nevertheless, the Catholic/Latin crusaders believed their oaths were invalidated when Alexios did not help them during the siege of Antioch (he had in fact set out on the road to Antioch but had been persuaded to turn back by Stephen of Blois, who <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> all was lost and that the expedition had already failed). Bohemund, who had set himself up as Prince of Antioch, briefly went to war with the Byzantines, but he agreed to become Alexios' vassal under the Treaty of Devol in 1108, which marked the end of the Norman threat during Alexios' reign.|$|E

Williams {{confirmed that the}} woman was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had been}} put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
5|$|In January 1900, Taft {{was called}} to Washington to meet with McKinley. Taft hoped a Supreme Court {{appointment}} was in the works, but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on the commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines. The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench; the president <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> if he fulfilled this task, McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court. Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission, with responsibility for success or failure; McKinley agreed, and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900.|$|E

5|$|The Finns {{relied on}} {{military}} assistance from Sweden, and Eljas Erkko {{took part in}} the Stockholm assembly of Scandinavian leaders between 18 October and 19 October. There, Erkko met the Swedish foreign minister Rickard Sandler in private, and Sandler <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he would persuade the Swedish government to assist Finland during a possible war. During the actual war, however, Sandler failed in this task and resigned. Finland was totally isolated by a German and Soviet blockade, and attempted in October to obtain arms and ammunition in absolute secrecy by enlisting the German arms dealer Josef Veltjens.|$|E
5|$|With Burgers due {{to stand}} for {{re-election}} the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, {{and the idea of}} annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return to Athens in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done to Athens. Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E

5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, who reported that there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} charge, Manekshaw reached the {{conclusion}} that poor leadership had been {{a significant factor in}} IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralized soldiers, and issued orders to advance to the positions lost in the war, which kept morale up. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter Indira Gandhi and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated {{that he did not want}} any more men to die. The COAS <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he would get the orders rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that the COAS should allow him to command his troops the way he wished or send him to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government. The next task Manekshaw took-up was to reorganize the troops in North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). He took measures to overcome the shortages of equipment, accommodation, and clothing.|$|E

5|$|The {{views of}} Whitehall were not echoed by the naval commanders, {{especially}} Sir Varyl Begg, Commander-in-Chief of British {{forces in the}} region, who believed that the carrier {{was too weak to}} defend herself against Indonesian attack or strike in turn against them. Begg adjudged that the narrowness of the Strait combined with local geographical features restricted the ships' movement and negated their radar, while custom prevented the carrier from flying its aircraft or even carrying them on deck, rendering it and the escorts extremely vulnerable in case of attack. He offered instead to send the destroyers, which were far more expendable pieces than a fleet carrier. His views were supported by the High Commissioner to Malaysia, Lord Antony Head, who argued that there would be very little gain for Indonesia and loss for Britain if the carrier was not risked. Luce, however, remained adamant that the Victorious must sail through herself, but in order to assuage Begg's fears <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the more modern carrier HMS Centaur would be on hand to provide air cover for the task force. Reinforcements were also rushed to Singapore to meet any Indonesian provocation. Thorneycroft ordered Begg to begin planning for the forced passage of the Strait, as officials determined on 3–4 September that the carrier must not be diverted.|$|E
5|$|This tactic did {{not prove}} successful: pro-Nazi {{propaganda}} and protests were rampant, {{even among the}} Lithuanian population, and the local government was powerless to prevent them. The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations. On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship. During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament, pro-German parties received 87% of votes (25 seats out of 29) in the Klaipėda territory. Dr. Ernst Neumann, the chief defendant in the 1934 trials, {{was released from prison}} in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda's pro-German movement. In December he was received by Adolf Hitler, who <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939. Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self-determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda. The parliament was expected to vote for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939. Germany's official channels maintained silence on the issue. Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region, and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti-Communist alliance against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Although the Russians {{were quick}} {{to come to the}} aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian {{relationship}} was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worst during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia were locked in competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britain’s alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo-Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. This history of suspicion and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able to assuage the fears of Rospopov and <b>assured</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny ‘’would unite the two countries better than any treaty’’.|$|E
