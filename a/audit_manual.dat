40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare data {{collected}} by automated form processing with manual data collection for clinical indicators (CIs) in paediatric emergency medicine. Design/methodology/approach: Paediatric patients presenting with croup, asthma, bronchiolitis, head injury and gastroenteritis in August 2006 were identified by ICD 9 coding and a traditional <b>manual</b> <b>audit</b> was performed by two data collectors. Data were collected on a total of 16 CIs for these five illnesses. <b>Manual</b> <b>audit</b> data were then compared to information collected for this same patient population using TELEform, an automated forms processing (AFP) system that had been employed for over two years. Findings: Teleform data were only available for 24 patients compared to information for 127 patients identified by ICD 9 coding and <b>manual</b> <b>audit.</b> Teleform data overestimated compliance with clinical guidelines by 17 percent giving an overall departmental agreement with CIs of 90. 6 percent compared to 73. 5 percent in the <b>manual</b> <b>audit.</b> Additionally, <b>manual</b> <b>audit</b> demonstrated that when the clinical guideline was incorporated into the clinical record, compliance was 92. 5 percent compared to 51. 3 percent when it was not. Originality/value: This single center study demonstrates that data collected by AFP such as TELEform, overestimate emergency department performance regarding CIs compliance. Departments that use automated data collection tools need to establish relationships between such data and data collected via more traditional auditing methods...|$|R

(28) and (29) then disappears as the distortions in search and allocation of tightness across the formal and the informal sector are fully eliminated. In this case, there are no other distortions present except that too few workers have chosen to educate themselves. Recall that this is a consequence that taxation harms high income earners relatively more. This distortion can, however, be corrected for by increasing the <b>audits</b> in the <b>manual</b> sector and reducing them in the sector for highly educated workers, which is captured by the right-hand side in (30) and (31). As informal sector work for manual workers becomes less attractive when the government increases the number of <b>audits,</b> <b>manual</b> workers are encouraged to acquire higher education. Similarly, less audits in the highly educated sector further encourages workers to acquire higher education.|$|R

Most organisations have computerized their operating systems and for auditors to effectively carry out their audits, {{it is essential that}} they incorporate Information Technology during their audit process. The research meant to identify the changes that Information Technology has brought in auditing. It has been earned out to evaluate the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) in local authorities and in particular Bulawayo City Council (BCC). The research has been carried out to measure the improvements on the audit work in terms of coverage and quality of the audit reports since the use of CAATs by BCC internal audit section. It seeks to make comparisons between <b>manual</b> <b>auditing</b> and the use of CAATs. Theoretical and empirical literature review has been discussed outlining the use and application of CAATs acknowledging the works of other various authors on this subject matter. Information was gathered from both primary and secondary sources to give the researcher an understanding of the benefits brought by Information Technology compared to the traditional manner of carrying out audits. The findings highlighted {{that there has been a}} change in the manner in which auditors execute their duties due to use of CAATs. The research findings revealed that CAATs are necessary tools through which auditors can enhance their effectiveness and efficiency. Through use of CAATs the BCC auditors have been able to extract and analyse large volumes of data within a short time thereby reducing the time of completing the audit. CAATs improve audit coverage, quality of audit work and audit reports. There are challenges in the implementation and upgrading of the audit software due to financial constraints by Bulawayo City Council.

40|$|ABSTRACT Currently, the 33 {{regional}} audit {{courts are}} responsible {{to monitor the}} public financial management cycle for states and municipalities and to judge the compliance of governors’ acts to the laws regarding procurement and civil servants’ employment from more than 20, 000 governmental entities under their jurisdiction. This article aims to analyze the diversity of internal configuration of these regional audit courts and to discuss the potential associations with the financial auditing quality their teams usually run. We conducted interviews with external auditors and IT directors from 18 courts, followed by triangulation to official documents from the audit courts, such as <b>audit</b> <b>manuals</b> and activities reports. The audit quality drivers were identified within the governmental auditing literature, supporting the evidences collected by the interviews content analysis. Despite all regional auditing bodies in Brazil {{were based on the}} Napoleonic model, the analysis indicates the identified configurations vary according to the team’s organization and size, auditor rotation and use of data reporting systems. The discussion shows that dissimilarities on the courts’ configurations, as they are responsible to audit a specific country area, will contribute to a different coercion level on fiscal and accounting issues to state and municipalities, due a combination of characteristics which could mitigate or improve the audit quality. This paper additionally suggests some precautions, based on the organization alignment literature, for the use of proxies to control audit quality effects in the public finance studies in Brazil...|$|R

AIM: To complete audits at one general practice for infants requiring the primary series of immunisations (6 -week, 3 -month and 5 -month vaccines) over a 12 -month period and compare findings with the NIR <b>audit.</b> METHODS: A <b>manual</b> and electronic practice management system (PMS) audit were compared with identical NIR audit parameters for completion of the 5 -month vaccination from 1 February 2011 to 1 February 2012. All three results were then combined with further sub-audits of the total practice newborn population to produce a multifaceted audit, identifying further eligible patients. The NIR database query tool was used to corroborate data on partially immunised and unimmunised patients identified. RESULTS: All three initial audits produced different results for vaccinated and eligible patients: NIR 31 / 36; PMS audit 39 / 43; <b>manual</b> <b>audit</b> 41 / 48.
