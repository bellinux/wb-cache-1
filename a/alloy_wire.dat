Ti- 51 Ni(at%) and Ti- 40 Ni- 10 Cu(at%) <b>alloy</b> <b>wires</b> with diameters of 0. 3 mm, 0. 5 mm and 0. 7 mm were {{prepared}} by drawing the alloy ingots fabricated by vacuum induction melting.

Heating rate increased with increasing the amount of current, while cooling rate was kept constant. Both heating rate and cooling rate increased with decreasing diameter of wire. This suggested that high amount of current and small wire diameter were required for high heating and cooling rate. Comparing Ti- 50 Ni <b>alloy</b> <b>wires</b> with Ti- 40 Ni- 10 Cu <b>alloy</b> <b>wires,</b> heating rates of the latter was faster than that of the former, although cooling rates were almost same.

40|$|The present {{research}} proposes a micromechanical model for shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>wires,</b> taking the polycrystalline {{texture of the}} material into account. The texture is described by the list of crystalline orientations along with their volume fraction. Each crystalline orientation is characterized by two internal state variables: the volume fraction of self-accommodated martensite, and the volume fraction of the most favorably oriented martensitic variant (with respect to the loading direction). The influence of the 3 -dimensional texture is thus considered in the one-dimensional mechanical response of the wire in traction. This model can describe the specific thermomechanical behavior of shape memory <b>alloy</b> <b>wires,</b> such as superelasticity, self-accommodation and reorientation of martensite, {{as well as the}} one-way shape memory effect. Most crucially, the model is able to capture the nonlinear hardening that is often observed in the stress-strain response, both in the superelastic, high temperature regime, and in the low temperature regime.
