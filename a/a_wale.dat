Mosi Reeves from Spin criticized Gaga's [...] "wanna-be-M.I.A. cadences", calling it [...] "unnecessarily crass". Another review from Spin by Brandon Soderberg panned the song, saying that [...] "t wasn't <b>a</b> <b>Wale</b> song and it wasn't a Gaga song with Wale wedged in there somewhere, either. 'Chillin' became {{something of an}} Internet rap watershed moment". Sean Fennessey from Pitchfork Media described the song as [...] "much-maligned", adding that [...] "there won't be much to gain from ... This {{was the first step}} in Wale's multiple personality debacle and he seems to know as much—nothing else on Attention Deficit resembles the goofy sneakers-shouting writing here." [...] In another review, Ryan Dombal from the same website criticized Wale's repetition of his name and the usage of the samples calling it [...] "unnecessary". [...] Brian Howe from Paste described the track as [...] "flashy and hollow". The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap." [...] McBee believed that the songs did not represent {{the true nature of the}} album. Prefix magazine was also critical of the song saying that [...] "just when you think Wale understands the consequences of mindlessly horny partying... he gives us the dumb, cheaply agreeable Lady Gaga feature 'Chillin'." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called <b>a</b> <b>wale.</b> To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in <b>a</b> <b>wale,</b> one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in knitting machines) or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E

2500|$|In {{securing}} the previous stitch in <b>a</b> <b>wale,</b> the next stitch can {{pass through the}} previous loop from either below or above. [...] If the former, the stitch is denoted as a 'knit stitch' or a 'plain stitch;' if the latter, as a 'purl stitch'. The two stitches are related in that a knit stitch seen {{from one side of}} the fabric appears as a purl stitch on the other side.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> <b>wale</b> can {{split into}} two or more wales using increases, most {{commonly}} involving a yarn over. [...] Depending on how the increase is done, {{there is often a}} hole in the fabric at the point of the increase. [...] This is used to great effect in lace knitting, which consists of making patterns and pictures using such holes, rather than with the stitches themselves. [...] The large and many holes in lacy knitting makes it extremely elastic; for example, some Shetland [...] "wedding-ring" [...] shawls are so fine that they may be drawn through a wedding ring.|$|E
2500|$|Ordinarily, {{stitches}} are knitted in {{the same}} order in every row, and the wales of the fabric run parallel and vertically along the fabric. [...] However, this need not be so, since the order in which stitches are knitted may be permuted so that wales cross over one another, forming a cable pattern. [...] Cables patterns tend to draw the fabric together, making it denser and less elastic; Aran sweaters are a common form of knitted cabling. [...] Arbitrarily complex braid patterns can be done in cable knitting, with the proviso that the wales must move ever upwards; it is generally impossible for <b>a</b> <b>wale</b> to move up and then down the fabric. [...] Knitters have developed methods for giving the illusion of a circular wale, such as appear in Celtic knots, but these are inexact approximations. [...] However, such circular wales are possible using Swiss darning, a form of embroidery, or by knitting a tube separately and attaching it to the knitted fabric.|$|E
