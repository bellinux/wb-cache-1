This was a second attempt at <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after the water in the tanks froze solid. The last was similar to <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E

5|$|In 1629, Isaac Beeckman {{proposed}} <b>an</b> <b>experiment</b> {{in which}} a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6km) away. In 1638, Galileo Galilei proposed <b>an</b> <b>experiment,</b> with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid. In 1667, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about onemile, but no delay was observed. The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11 microseconds.|$|E
