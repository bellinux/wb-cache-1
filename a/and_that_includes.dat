25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> the Americans as well.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector {{product of the}} interacting fields. For calculating the torque {{it is necessary to}} know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a computer can do the many calculations needed.|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Thompson {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} CNN's YouTube debate despite assurances from Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney {{that they would not}} appear. Romney referenced the Democratic Party's YouTube debate, and commented that [...] "the presidency ought to be held at a higher level than having to answer questions from a snowman." [...] In response, Thompson's spokesman Steve Grubbs remarked: [...] "We'll answer questions from any American who wants to ask one <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> one dressed up like a snowman...Tommy Thompson is ready to take on all questions".|$|E
500|$|... "Lotto" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote highly {{of the serious}} dialogue in the episode, noting that [...] "if there's been a consistent element to Paul Lieberstein's work on this show ... it's that he understands what makes the main characters tick, {{and is able to}} use that for real emotional resonance ... When the show wants to give Jim, or Pam, or Dwight, or now Andy a quiet, emotional moment, it's usually still able to do so very well, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> most of Andy and Darryl's interaction here in 'Lotto. He was, however, more critical of the episode's humor, noting that many of gags had been done before. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt called the episode superior to the previous episode commenting that [...] "While perhaps not monumentally better than last week's outing and damaged by a weak B-story, 'Lotto' had a greater sense of purpose that holds greater value to the season as it moves forward". He also complimented the writers for not focusing too much on Andy. He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E

500|$|However, the {{above-mentioned}} historic process {{of determining the}} age and distance to globular clusters is not as robust as first thought, since the morphology and luminosity of globular cluster stars in color-magnitude diagrams are influenced by numerous parameters, {{many of which are}} still being actively researched. Certain clusters even display populations that are absent from other globular clusters (e.g., blue hook stars), or feature multiple populations. [...] The historical paradigm that all globular clusters consist of stars born at exactly the same time, or sharing exactly the same chemical abundance, has likewise been overturned (e.g., NGC 2808). [...] Further, the morphology of the cluster stars in a color-magnitude diagram, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> the brightnesses of distance indicators such as RR Lyrae variable members, can be influenced by observational biases. One such effect is called blending, and it arises because the cores of globular clusters are so dense that in low-resolution observations multiple (unresolved) stars may appear as a single target. [...] Thus the brightness measured for that seemingly single star (e.g., an RR Lyrae variable) is erroneously too bright, given those unresolved stars contributed to the brightness determined. [...] Consequently, the computed distance is wrong, and more importantly, certain researchers have argued that the blending effect can introduce a systematic uncertainty into the cosmic distance ladder, and may bias the estimated age of the Universe and the Hubble constant.|$|E
500|$|Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself, and not {{his love}} interests, was sexually {{objectified}} in this film. A moment where he {{rises from the}} sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in Dr. No; he feels [...] "skewered" [...] by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; [...] "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, {{that is exactly what}} happens to Bond in [...]" [...] So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, [...] "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market." [...] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of License to Thrill, who also notes Craig's Bond is [...] "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is [...] "humourless," [...] but is also different because [...] "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is [...] "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> even Sean Connery." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} anti-US sentiments {{would affect the}} film's box office, Feige said, [...] "Marvel is {{perceived}} pretty well around the world right now, and I think putting another uber-Marvel hero into the worldwide box office {{would be a good}} thing.... We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

500|$|... "Existence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". While offering a positive opinion {{in regards to}} the finale as a whole, he felt that [...] "Existence" [...] dragged more so than [...] "Essence", resulting in a less interesting episode. He also felt that the overarching mythology of the series had long ago become too convoluted to make sense, but that the [...] "human pieces of the show still work, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> Doggett." [...] Contra Costa Times columnists George Avalos and Michael Liedtke were pleased with the episode noting that the last scene was [...] "beautifully written". Avalos and Liedtke also reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene in the episode. Despite their praise, however, they stressed that [...] "Existence" [...] was not as exciting as the previous episode, [...] "Essence," [...] or the 1998 The X-Files feature film. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating, noting that [...] "season eight's finale goes out with a big fat juicy kiss between Mulder and Scully, at long last". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on".|$|E
500|$|When Saint-Saëns {{was brought}} back to Paris {{he lived with his}} mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he {{displayed}} perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, [...] "It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> Mozart." [...] The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, {{but it was not until}} he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly. From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach, which was then little known in France.|$|E

2500|$|While many {{scholars}} in cultural studies draw distinctions between affect, feeling, and emotion, Cvetkovich does not emphasize {{the differences between}} these categories. Rather she uses both affect and feeling “in a generic sense,” where affect is “a category that encompasses affect, emotion, and feeling, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>includes</b> impulses, desires, and feelings that get historically constructed {{in a range of}} ways.” She favours the term feeling, though, because it retains “the ambiguity between feelings as embodied sensations and feelings as psychic or cognitive experiences." ...|$|E
