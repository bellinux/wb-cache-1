500|$|After Florida {{came under}} the Kingdom of Great Britain's {{jurisdiction}} in 1763, Quaker father and son naturalists John and William Bartram explored {{the length of the}} river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by King George III to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward. William returned to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and wrote another journal about his travels, while he collected plants and befriended the Seminoles who called him [...] "Puc Puggy" [...] (flower hunter). William's visit took him as far south as Blue Spring, where he remarked on the crystal clear views offered by the spring water: [...] "The water is perfectly diaphanous, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>are</b> continually a prodigious number and variety of fish; they appear as plain as though lying on a table before your eyes, although many feet deep in the water." [...] Bartram's journals attracted the attention of such prominent Americans as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. The success of these journals inspired other naturalists such as André Michaux to further explore the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, sailing from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and gave names to some of the plants described by the Bartrams' journals. Michaux was followed by William Baldwin between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including John James Audubon, have carried William's Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida with them as a guide.|$|E
