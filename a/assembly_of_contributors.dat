40|$|Forensic {{scientists}} are routinely {{faced with the}} problem of assessing the total number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> while examining DNA mixtures. Inferential procedures can be biased, in particular when assessments of the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> are not made prior to considering the genotypic configuration of potential donors. Moreover, it might be observed that the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> is incompatible with the set of alleles observed in the profile of a mixed stain, given the genotype <b>of</b> a potential <b>contributor.</b> In such situations, procedures leading to a single and fixed number contributors as output can not be appropriate. In this work, two strategies to infer the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> in a mixed stain are presented and analyzed by considering mixtures in a qualitative way. One procedure is deterministic and searches the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> required to explain an observed set of alleles. The second procedure is Bayesian and provides a probability distribution for the set <b>of</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors.</b> Simulation studies and graphical models will be implemented to compare the performances of the proposed procedures...|$|R

In contrast to traditional production, this is strongly probabilistic, but is characterized by two quantitative nonlinear laws: a power-law bound to product size for increasing number <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> and the universal collapse of rescaled distributions. A variant of the random-energy model shows that both laws are due to the heterogeneity <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> and displays an intriguing finite-size scaling property with no equivalent in standard systems. The analysis uncovers the right intensive densities, enabling the comparison of projects with different numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> on equal grounds.

Our case study builds on extensive data sets from the project’s bug tracking platform bugzilla, to quantify the activity <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> and its mail archives, to quantify the emotions <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> by means <b>of</b> sentiment analysis. The Gentoo project is known for a period of centralization within its bug triaging community. This was followed by considerable changes in community organization and performance after the sudden retirement <b>of</b> the central <b>contributor.</b> We analyze how this event correlates with the negative emotions, both in bilateral email discussions with the central contributor, and {{at the level of the}} whole community <b>of</b> <b>contributors.</b> We then extend our study to consider the activity patterns on Gentoo contributors in general. We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> leaving the project. Our analysis opens new perspectives for measuring online contributor motivation by means of sentiment analysis and for real-time predictions <b>of</b> <b>contributor</b> turnover in Open Source Software projects. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{forensic}} examination of DNA mixtures, {{the question of}} how to set the total number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> (N) presents a topic of ongoing interest. Part of the discussion gravitates around issues of bias, in particular when assessments of the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> are not made prior to considering the genotypic configuration of potential donors. Further complication may stem from the observation that, in some cases, there may be numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> that are incompatible with the set of alleles seen in the profile of a mixed crime stain, given the genotype <b>of</b> a potential <b>contributor.</b> In such situations, procedures that take a single and fixed number contributors as their output can lead to inferential impasses. Assessing the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> within a probabilistic framework can help avoiding such complication. Using elements of decision theory, this paper analyses two strategies for inference on the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors.</b> One procedure is deterministic and focuses on the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> required to ‘explain’ an observed set of alleles. The other procedure is probabilistic using Bayes’ theorem and provides a probability distribution for a set <b>of</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> based on the set of observed alleles as well as their respective rates of occurrence. The discussion concentrates on mixed stains of varying quality (i. e., different numbers of loci for which genotyping information is available). A so-called qualitative interpretation is pursued since quantitative information such as peak area and height data are not taken into account. The competing procedures are compared using a standard scoring rule that penalizes the degree of divergence between a given agreed value for N, that is the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> and the actual value taken by N. Using only modest assumptions and a discussion with reference to a casework example, this paper reports on analyses using simulation techniques and graphical models (i. e., Bayesian networks) to point out that setting the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> to a mixed crime stain in probabilistic terms is, for the conditions assumed in this study, preferable to a decision policy that uses categoric assumptions about N...|$|R

5000|$|Shirky {{states that}} since many social systems follow the Pareto {{principle}} wherein 20% <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> account for 80% of contributions, traditional institutions lose {{out of the}} long tail <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> by turning only the few that dominate the distribution into employees. The cooperative infrastructure model escapes having to lose this resource. Shirky presents an institution as enabler and institution as obstacle concept. The relatively small number <b>of</b> high-volume <b>contributors</b> can be assimilated, as employees, into the old-style corporate model and thus can live in an [...] "institution-as-enabler world". The long tail <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> however, who make few and infrequent contributions, see institutions as an obstacle as {{they would never have}} been hired, therefore, disenfranchised. Shirky argues that an idea or contribution may be infrequent and significant. Furthermore, all of the long tail contributors, taken in aggregate, can be substantial.|$|R
