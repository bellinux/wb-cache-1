5|$|The west {{window was}} {{obscured}} by the organ until the 1860s when it was moved {{to make way for}} a depiction of the Annunciation which was designed by John Hardman Powell of Hardman & Co. and funded by Sholto Hare. Attempts to <b>achieve</b> <b>some</b> conformity with the installed work and subsequent designs lead to a further commissions for Clayton and Bell and Hardman & Co. generally as memorials to wealthy local dignitaries who had contributed to the restoration of the church.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, the {{emergency}} medicine systems (EMSs) in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore were largely mature, leading some practitioners {{to focus on}} developing the specialty in other countries. Thus, international emergency medicine as a subspecialty began in the 1990s, although some isolated efforts to <b>achieve</b> <b>some</b> of its goals {{had taken place in}} the late 1980s. There were several reasons for the heightened interest these practitioners had in developing emergency medicine abroad. One was the contrast between the EMSs of their countries and the EMSs of other countries. Another was the revolutions of 1989, overthrowing authoritarian regimes, which facilitated spread of new ideas, such as emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Daiei also {{hoped to}} find a foreign market for Warning from Space, though the company found {{difficulty}} in selling it. Nevertheless, the film played at both King Cinema in Rangoon, Burma and Tai Khoon Theatre in Sandakan, Malaysia, in 1958. The film did help Daiei <b>achieve</b> <b>some</b> success in the genre. It was passed for release, anglicized as Warning from Space, by the BBFC in the United Kingdom in 1957, {{and later in the}} United States in 1963. The film was also released as The Mysterious Satellite in some areas. It was shown in the U.S. by American International Television later in the 1960s as Warning From Space.|$|E

However the Germans secured the only qualification place in the group in their final match of the group with a late winner over Albania.

5|$|Rowley {{dismissed}} {{this idea}} given the shattered state of Africaine and instead towed the frigate back to Île Bourbon, shadowed by Astrée and Iphigénie {{on the return}} journey. The French frigates did <b>achieve</b> <b>some</b> consolation in pursuing Rowley from a distance, running into and capturing the Honourable East India Company's armed brig Aurora, sent from India to reinforce Rowley. On 15 September, Boadicea, Africaine and the brigs arrived at Saint Paul, Africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea, again seeking to drive away the French blockade but unable {{to bring them to}} action. Bouvet returned to Port Napoleon on 18 September, and thus was not present when Rowley attacked and captured the French flagship Vénus and Commodore Hamelin at the Action of 18 September 1810.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} touring in 1956, including to Toronto. In late February {{or early}} March, Powell and Rollins, traveling together near Philadelphia, {{were involved in}} a crash that destroyed Powell's car, but they were not seriously injured. The quintet recorded under the leadership of Rollins in March for Prestige; this was released as Sonny Rollins Plus 4. They also had live national CBS Radio broadcasts from the Basin Street club in April and May.

5|$|The middlegame is {{the part}} of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but {{typically}} the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to <b>achieve</b> <b>some</b> gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E

Michael yielded and sent Anna back to her brother with gifts. This gesture helped to secure the release of his general Alexios Strategopoulos.|$|E
