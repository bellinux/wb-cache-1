He <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> to pay a yearly tribute to the sultan and to support the Ottomans' military campaigns at the sultan's order. Before long, Murad II decided to invade Hungary and gathered his troops at Vidin.|$|E

Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, Searchlight {{reported}} that the party's membership had declined to around 1,000. Tyndall responded by trying to raise finances, calling for greater sales of their newspaper and increasing the price of membership by 50%. He <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> {{that he would make}} the BNP the largest extreme-right group in the UK and that he would establish a professional headquarters for the party. This was achieved in 1989, as a party headquarters was opened in Welling, Southeast London, an area chosen because it was a recipient of significant 'white flight' from inner London. That year also witnessed the BNP become the most prominent force on the British far-right as the NF collapsed amid internal arguments and schisms.|$|E

Daedelus was killed when Kratos united the labyrinth and left a message in blood encouraging Kratos to get even with Zeus for him. The character was voiced by Malcolm McDowell in God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Manuel {{sent his}} envoys to Antioch, proposing to {{recognize}} Raynald {{as the new}} prince if he launched a campaign against the Armenians of Cilicia, who had risen up against Byzantine rule.

After Raynald defeated the Armenians at Alexendretta in 1155, the Knights Templar seized {{the region of the}} Syrian Gates that the Armenians had recently captured.

The award was the largest single contract awarded in the initial construction of the system. Kawasaki <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> to supply $20.9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery. The loss of Contract 151 was a massive financial blow to Metro-Cammell, who were forced to reduce their workforce by half later that year.|$|E

They <b>also</b> <b>promise</b> to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time. The members of the congregation <b>also</b> <b>promise</b> the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community.

5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. Given {{the number of cases}} of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates who claimed to have been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III. Andrew {{emphasized}} that being under Ottoman suzerainty, Transylvania could not openly support Maximilian, but he <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> that Sigismund Báthory would not prevent the mustering of Transylvanian soldiers {{to fight in}} Poland. In the same month, Sigismund Báthory's plan to enable the Jesuits to return to Transylvania {{gave rise to a}} serious family conflict, because both Andrew and Balthasar refused to support the prince at the Diet. According to contemporaneous gossips, Andrew and his two brothers decided to dethrone Sigismund, replacing him with Balthasar. Pope Clement VIII sent a papal nuncio, Attilio Amalteo, to Transylvania to mediate a reconciliation.|$|E

5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was <b>also</b> <b>promised</b> half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her from city to city when the show toured.|$|E
5|$|Austrian {{troops were}} <b>also</b> <b>promised,</b> to be {{dispatched}} from the Austrian Army fighting the French in Northern Italy. These troops could only reach Toulon by sea, scheduled to embark {{from the city}} port of Genoa, capital of the Italian state of the Republic of Genoa, which {{at this stage of}} the war was officially neutral. Genoa was however, in common with other Northern Italian cities, in a state of political upheaval. The French Revolution had inspired similarly-minded revolutionaries in Italy to support Republican ideas, and there was a substantial Republican faction in the Genoese government which supported France's cause. Food supplies were regularly shipped from Genoa to the Republican armies in Southern France, and the demands of Francis Drake, Ambassador to Genoa, that this trade cease went unheeded.|$|E
