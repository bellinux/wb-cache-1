500|$|Mating {{takes place}} at {{different}} times of the year {{in different parts of the}} manta's range. Courtship is difficult to observe in this fast-swimming fish, although mating [...] "trains" [...] with multiple individuals swimming closely behind each other are sometimes seen in shallow water. The mating sequence may be triggered by a full moon and seems to be initiated by a male following closely behind a female while she travels at around [...] per hour. He makes repeated efforts to grasp her pectoral fin with his mouth, which may take twenty or thirty minutes. Once he has a tight grip, he turns upside-down and presses his ventral side <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> He then inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca where they remain for sixty to ninety seconds. The clasper forms a tube which channels sperm from the genital papilla; a siphon propels the seminal fluid into the oviduct. The male continues to grip the female's pectoral fin with his teeth for a further few minutes as both continue to swim, often followed by up to twenty other males. The pair then part. For some reason the male almost always grasps the left pectoral fin, and females often have scars that illustrate this.|$|E
60|$|He {{sank down}} on his knees beside her and put his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Sadie {{had learned}} to think more about others during those terrible days of schooling. Her arms were round Mrs. Belmont, and her cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|Imogene hid {{her face}} in her muff, and Effie Bowen bowed <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> Imogene's shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear!" [...] said Bessie, keeping Mary Enderby's hand, and {{pressing}} it between both of <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> her breast as they now stood face to face, [...] "do {{come up and}} have some tea!" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{singular}} prejudice of <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> dark {{people was}} a little annoying to me on personal grounds. It {{was a sort of}} reflection on my own taste. Between ourselves, the late Doctor Pratolungo was of a fine mahogany brown all over.|$|R
60|$|She lay still, thinking, whilst his arm was round her, {{his head}} against her shoulders, his body <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> just behind her. He was still asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} won't get Maria {{away from her}} very easy," [...] said Mr. Savor, laughing. His wife stood with the child's cheek pressed tight <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|She laughed, and, {{making a}} small, moaning noise, as if of weariness and helplessness, she sank {{her head on}} his chest. He put down his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He shook sober {{thought from}} his brain and {{returned}} to the bliss of memory, reaching his hand to another caress of his knee, his lips breathing again to the breathing of <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> them. He even reined Selim to a halt in order to gaze at the hollow resting place of his bent arm which she had filled.|$|R
60|$|The Story Girl leaned that brown head of <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> the fir trunk behind her, {{and looked}} up at the apple-green sky through the dark boughs above us. She wore, I remember, a dress of warm crimson, and she had wound around her head a string of waxberries, that looked like a fillet of pearls. Her cheeks were still flushed with the {{excitement}} of the evening. In the dim light she was beautiful, with a wild, mystic loveliness, a compelling charm that would not be denied.|$|R
50|$|The player's {{mercenary}} company initially {{takes on}} localized threats in certain planets {{far from the}} civil war. As the player's team takes on more missions, the assignments get tougher; at one point, Spectre may challenge a Jade Falcon group led by Asia Falcon to a duel. The Colonel - Asia Falcon - will join the player's team as a bondsman if the Falcons are defeated in this mission. It is a beach-side battle that pits 8 of Spectre's best <b>against</b> 10 of <b>hers.</b> That mission can be substituted for a mission to attack the Falcon's in a sneak attack where the battle is just as difficult. This direction leads {{to the death of}} Asia instead of her joining the team.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{pull you}} {{right out of}} this window," [...] he said, roughly, and then with his hot face pressed <b>against</b> <b>hers</b> tried to {{accomplish}} the thing he threatened.|$|E
6000|$|She {{rubs her}} cheek against his. Feeling {{that he does}} not rub [...] his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> OLIVE stands away, and looks from him to [...] her mother in wonder.|$|E
60|$|Her {{arms about}} his neck {{tightened}} their grip convulsively, forcing {{his head down}} until his face rested <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> And so they stood, rigid, while the two children stared with round eyes and whimpered unheeded.|$|E
50|$|Goneril {{discovers that}} she finds Edmund more {{attractive}} than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces with <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.|$|R
25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife.

6000|$|... "Nature says to man, 'Thou art free, and {{no power}} on earth can {{lawfully}} strip thee of thy rights:' Religion cries {{to him that}} he is a slave condemned by God to groan under the rod of God's representatives. Nature bids man to love the country that gave him birth, to serve it with all loyalty, to bind his interests to <b>hers</b> <b>against</b> every hand that might be raised upon her: Religion commands him to obey without a murmur the tyrants that oppress his country, to take their part against her, to chain his fellow-citizens under their lawless caprices. Yet if the Sovereign be not devoted enough to his priests, Religion instantly changes her tone; she incites the subjects to rebellion, she makes resistance a duty, she cries aloud that we must obey God rather than man.... If the nature of man were consulted on Politics, which supernatural ideas have so shamefully depraved, it would contribute far more than all the religion in the world to make communities happy, powerful, and prosperous under reasonable authority.... This nature would teach princes that they are men and not gods; that they are citizens charged by their fellow-citizens with watching over the safety of all.... Instead of attributing to the divine vengeance all the wars, the famines, the plagues that lay nations low, would it not have been more useful to show them that such calamities are due to the passions, the indolence, the tyranny of their princes, who sacrifice the nations to their hideous delirium? Natural evils demand natural remedies; ought not experience, therefore, long ago to have undeceived mortals as to those supernatural remedies, those expiations, prayers, sacrifices, fastings, processions, that all the peoples of the earth have so vainly opposed to the woes that overwhelmed them?... Let us recognise the plain truth, then, that it is these supernatural ideas that have obscured morality, corrupted politics, hindered the advance of the sciences, and extinguished happiness and peace even in the very heart of man." ...|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's silence. She {{felt his}} aloofness. It awoke in her {{some of the}} enthusiasm with which this mission itself had failed to inspire her. This man was {{measuring}} his strength <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} into his arms with a little laugh of happiness. Time and life itself stood still. Her feeble remonstrances were swept away in the tide of his passion. His lips hung burning <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{bent down}} and put his arm about her, laying his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> The little red spot where his kiss had fallen was now quite drowned out in the colour that rushed over her face.|$|E
60|$|As {{the outlaw}} lurched that way, Hare, {{with a start}} of recollection, took Mescal {{in his arms and}} leaned his head <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> He felt one of her hands lightly brush his {{shoulder}} and rest there, trembling.|$|E
60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, {{he put his}} arms around her neck, {{pressing}} his cheek close <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> and during what seemed a very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|E
60|$|Thuvia of Ptarth drew {{quite close}} to him. She felt safer with the feel of his arm <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> and with the contact of her the man took a new grip upon himself. With his old-time smile he turned toward her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{your hand}} out under your dust-cloak," [...] said Belmont, sidling his camel up <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> [...] "Don't miss your grip of it. There! Now hide {{it in your}} dress, and you'll always have a key to unlock any door." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{said this}} quizzically and with chagrin. And she became alert to him. It {{interested}} her. Whether he had brains or not, he was interesting. His directness attracted her, his independent motion. She {{was aware of}} the movement of his life over <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|The child, a {{handsome}} little fellow of some sixteen months, toddled across to his mother, waving {{his hands as}} he went, and laughing, while his large hazel eyes glowed with pleasure. His mother caught him, pushed the silken brown hair back from his forehead, and laid his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
60|$|His lips came {{steadily}} {{closer to}} hers. They had almost touched when {{a vision of}} Korak sprang like a miracle before her eyes. She saw Korak's face close to hers, she felt his lips hot <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> and then {{for the first time}} in her life she guessed what love meant. She drew away, gently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou hast no right," [...] she said, still {{speaking}} with outward calm, though her whole soul rebelled against {{the arrogance of}} this man who dared to thwart her will, to gainsay her word, and set up his dictates <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> [...] "thou hast no right thus to take the law in thine own hands." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Caddy hung {{upon her}} father and nursed his cheek <b>against</b> <b>hers</b> {{as if he were}} some poor dull child in pain. All this took place in the hall. Her father {{released}} her, took out his pocket handkerchief, {{and sat down on the}} stairs with his head against the wall. I hope he found some consolation in walls. I almost think he did.|$|E
6000|$|And if a chaste {{and pure}} woman did not {{disapprove}} {{of a game}} of primero among friends, what right had he to set up his own standard of right or wrong <b>against</b> <b>hers?</b> What right had he to condemn what she approved? To offend his generous employer, and to bring opprobrium and ridicule on himself which would of necessity redound against Sir Marmaduke also? ...|$|E
60|$|Jill {{had sunk}} {{back against the}} {{cushions}} of the cab. The touch of his body <b>against</b> <b>hers</b> always gave her a thrill, half pleasurable, half frightening. She had never met anybody who affected her in this way as Derek did. She moved a little closer, and felt for his hand. But, as she touched it, it retreated--coldly. Her heart sank. It was like being cut in public by somebody very dignified.|$|E
6000|$|Alan seized her by both wrists, {{and drew}} {{her down to}} his side. [...] "No, no, darling," [...] he {{answered}} low, laying his lips <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> [...] "I can never say good-bye. You have confessed you love me. When a woman says that, what can a man refuse her? From such a woman as you, I am so proud, so proud, so proud of such a confession; how could I ever cease to feel you were mine,--mine, mine, wholly mine for a lifetime?" ...|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{asked not}} a {{question}} about those days in Aberdeen, but he heard a little about them from Elspeth. Tommy had not excused himself to Elspeth, he had let her do as she liked with his head (this was a great treat to her), and while it lay pressed <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> she made remarks about Aberdeen professors which it would have done them good to hear. These she repeated to Aaron, {{who was about to}} answer roughly, and then suddenly put her on his knee instead.|$|E
60|$|Skrebensky {{went out}} in his wide-striped {{sleeping}} suit. He crossed the big dining hall, whose low firelight smelled of cigars and whisky and coffee, entered the other corridor and found Ursula's room. She was lying awake, wide-eyed and suffering. She was glad he had come, if only for consolation. It was consolation {{to be held in}} his arms, to feel his body <b>against</b> <b>hers.</b> Yet how foreign his arms and body were! Yet still, not so horribly foreign and hostile {{as the rest of the}} house felt to her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{listened with}} bowed head, then replied, very sadly--"I {{thank you for}} your gentle words, but, Leo Vincey, we do not part thus easily. You have summoned me to the Mountain, and even to the Mountain I shall follow you. Aye, and there I will meet its Spirit, as I have always known I must and as the Shaman here has always known I must. Yes, I will match my {{strength}} and magic <b>against</b> <b>hers,</b> as it is decreed that I shall do. To the victor be that crown for which we have warred for ages." ...|$|E
