5|$|Several {{ownership}} schemes {{were considered}} {{in the process of}} building <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> system. One plan, which named city officials as the owners and operators of the network, was scrapped because the city lacked the core competency to do it on its own, as well as the $25–30 million capital investment required for the initial construction. The plan which was ultimately adopted entailed a private company building <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> network. This plan met opposition from the Institute for Local Self Reliance, an organization that stated that it believed that the city should build the network itself, and then contract a private company to maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Brabham {{cars were}} also widely used by other teams, {{and not just}} in Formula One. Jack Brabham and Ron Tauranac called the company they set up in 1961 to design and build formula racing cars to {{customer}} teams Motor Racing Developments (MRD), and this company had a large portfolio of other activities. Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply {{and the use of the}} MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> length of the deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E

5|$|Often {{the most}} senior and {{responsible}} Patrol Leader is appointed as Troop Leader (TL), who no longer runs a Patrol but instead has other responsibilities such as enforcing discipline <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> weekly programme. Since a Troop Leader {{is not required to}} plan or run Patrol camps, or help Scouts through the advancement program many senior Scouts who are in their final year of school choose to become Troop Leaders to have more time to concentrate on their studies and on achieving the Springbok award.|$|E
5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> dance school.|$|E
5|$|Women and men {{religious}} {{engage in}} a variety of occupations, from contemplative prayer, to teaching, to providing health care, to working as missionaries. While Holy Orders are reserved for men, Catholic women have played diverse roles {{in the life of the}} church, with religious institutes providing a formal space for their participation and convents providing spaces for their self-government, prayer and influence through many centuries. Religious sisters and nuns have been extensively involved in developing <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> Church's worldwide health and education service networks.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, riots {{broke out}} {{following}} {{the election of}} Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted. The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes. Three National Parliament members, Charles Dausabea, Nelson Ne'e, and Patrick Vahoe, were arrested during or {{as a result of}} the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with Manasseh Sogavare as Prime Minister, quelling the riots <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> government. The army part of RAMSI was removed and rebuilding took shape.|$|E
5|$|In the teams' {{first meeting}} since 2010, Penn State visited TCF Bank Stadium {{to face a}} Minnesota team looking for their fourth {{consecutive}} Big Ten victory, and their eighth win of the season, {{which would have been}} their first time since the 2003 season. There was consensus among both Penn State's and Minnesota's SB Nation sites, as well as independent picks, that Minnesota would win a relatively close game. Minnesota's offense was one of the better rushing teams in the conference (20th in the nation), but Penn State's defense was also pretty good against the run, making it a good matchup. Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg in tandem with a running game that, in theory, was led by Bill Belton and supplemented by Zach Zwinak, and receivers Allen Robinson had potential to score a lot of points. Keys to the game included avoiding turnovers <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> football. Minnesota head coach Jerry Kill, recovering from seizures stemming from epilepsy, coached from the press box.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution was {{developed}} over eight months {{by a team}} of more than twenty people, most of whom joined just for Ridge Racer Revolution. The biggest difficulties were the link-up mode, rear-view mirror, <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> game at high speeds. Each member had worked on other console games, and they commented that the graphics detail showed the improvements in skill and technique. The team wanted players to enjoy a more in-depth game than the original, so rather than develop a port of Ridge Racer 2, as many features as possible were added. The early designs for the new courses were made in a 'free run' programme, and used to see how fast the cars went. The rear-view mirror was added primarily with the two player link-up mode in mind. The music was mostly taken from Ridge Racer 2, and as a result, the sound was finished more quickly than the game. Soundtrack composition involved four musicians, who composed for Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, and Rave Racer. The team kept exploring the PlayStation's capabilities to solve the high speed problem, although were confident it was possible. The designer, Hiroyuki Onada, commented that designing an original course was a challenge, and director Kazumi Mizuno believed that graphics quality would be degraded with a split-screen multiplayer mode, so the team decided to focus on the PlayStation's link-up instead.|$|E

25|$|With the Silver Creek Butterfly Conservation Area up <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>the</b> area {{population}} of Bay checkerspots increased markedly.
