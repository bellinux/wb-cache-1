5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better <b>average</b> <b>and</b> worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the <b>average</b> <b>and</b> worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E

We then calculated new sampled averages for each week, and used those in calculating the correlations between citizen and expert observations.
