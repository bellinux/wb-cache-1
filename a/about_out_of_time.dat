40|$|Time is money” {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular phrases in the world. Nowadays, human life depends on time as it is everything. According to history, the time creator was humans. After knowing how to count time, they became afraid <b>about</b> <b>time,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and they became aware about keeping time, saving time. Humans became selfish about time. Their ego made them want time to be faster or slower. They are afraid about their age, to be old, to be dead. Another wants to die, and some want it to come faster and soon. It is all because of their {{knowledge}} about time, after they know how to count it...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of his second season with Shattuck-Saint Mary's, Toews and teammate Kelsey Tessier left the team and school after being expelled for cheating. Toews received an old copy of a chemistry exam from a classmate to use as a study guide for an upcoming exam. When Toews wrote the exam, he was concerned <b>about</b> running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and wrote, verbatim, the answers from the old test. When his professor noticed the similarities between Toews' answers and those of the old test, he was expelled as he had already been on academic probation. As a result, both players moved to Superior, Colorado to play for the Colorado Outlaws midget [...] "AAA" [...] team of the Midwest Elite Hockey League, where they lived with their Shattuck-Saint Mary's teammate Brett Kostolansky's parents.|$|R

That summer, Kerbdog recorded their self-titled debut album at Rockfield Studios in Wales, {{during which time}} Sepultura were also there recording their 1993 album Chaos A.D. The album was produced by Jack Endino, who helped cement the Seattle grunge sound along with Sub Pop. [...] "If I remember right the whole thing took five weeks.

5000|$|Kerbdog (also {{sometimes}} {{known as}} 'Totally Switched' for the US release) is Kerbdog's eponymous debut album. The album {{was recorded in}} 1993 at Rockfield Studios in Wales and released on 28 March 1994 through Vertigo. Though the band had various indie influences, with bands like Sonic Youth and Big Black, the album ended up having a Metallica influenced proto-grunge sound. The band {{said that this was}} simply the result of getting professional equipment, and turning everything up as loud as they could. What also might account for this is the fact that grunge pioneer Jack Endino recorded the album."If I remember right the whole thing took five weeks.

[...] "Well, Buncombe {{took it in}} {{his head}} that, as {{there was no other}} clergyman about, bar Kanaka pastors, we ought to call in Father Galuchet, and have the old man {{administered}} and take the sacrament. It was all the same to me, you may suppose; but I said I thought Adams was the fellow to consult. He was jawing away about watered copra and a sight of foolery. 'Look here,' I said, 'you're pretty sick. Would you like to see Galoshes?' He sat right up on his elbow. 'Get the priest,' says he, 'get the priest; don't let me die here like a dog!' He spoke kind of fierce and eager, but sensible enough. There was nothing to say against that, so we sent and asked Galuchet if he would come. You bet he would. He jumped in his dirty linen at the thought of it. But we had reckoned without Papa. He's a hard-shell Baptist, is Papa; no Papists need apply. And he took and locked the door. Buncombe told him he was bigoted, and I thought he would have had a fit. 'Bigoted!' he says. 'Me bigoted? Have I lived to hear it from a jackanapes like you?' And he made for Buncombe, and I had to hold them apart; and there was Adams in the middle, gone luny again, and carrying on about copra like a born fool. It was good as the play, and I was <b>about</b> knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> with laughing, {{when all of a sudden}} Adams sat up, clapped his hands to his chest, and went into horrors. He died hard, did John Adams," [...] says Case, with a kind of a sudden sternness.|$|R
5000|$|Starfire is a Tamaranean {{and as such}} her {{physiology}} {{is designed}} to constantly absorb ultraviolet radiation. The radiation is then converted to pure energy, allowing her to fly at supersonic speeds. Originally, Starfire was capable of using this power to fly in space and even go fast enough to cross several solar systems in minutes to seconds. However, it is established in Red Hood and the Outlaws #2 and #27 that the rebooted Starfire is unable to fly without the effects of gravity, leaving her unable to travel in space unaided. This energy also gives her incredible superhuman strength and durability. This strength, combined with her fighting skills, allowed her to defeat the much stronger Donna Troy <b>about</b> two <b>out</b> <b>of</b> three <b>times</b> during purely hand to hand matches. She later proved strong enough to fight against Wonder Woman {{for a short period}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and, during a fit of rage, was so strong that Donna Troy was unable to restrain her without the help of Mon-El and in the TV series she was strong enough to shake the whole city with a single hit. After being experimented on by the alien Psions, Starfire gained the ability to release her absorbed energy into incredibly powerful blasts called [...] "starbolts" [...] colored bright green.|$|R
