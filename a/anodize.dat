50|$|Around {{this time}} heavy metal band <b>Anodize,</b> {{the most popular}} yet financially {{struggling}} indie band in Hong Kong decided to call it quit. All band members intended to retire from the music scene until they were approached by MC Yan and DJ Tommy, who were hoping to recruit Jimmy to play bass but were delighted when lead singer Wah and drummer/guitarist/keyboardist Davy decided to join too. A fourth <b>Anodize</b> member, Gary, joined the band as a part-time member. The addition of Anodize's former members added gravitas and musicianship to a group already loaded with talent. MC Yan decided to adopt the LMF name and the band was formally formed in 1998.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anodizing</b> {{could be}} used for bio-functionalization of the {{surfaces}} of titanium alloys. In this study, we use <b>anodizing</b> for creating nanotubes on the surface of porous titanium alloy bone substitutes manufactured using selective laser melting. Different sets of <b>anodizing</b> parameters (voltage: 10 or 20 V <b>anodizing</b> time: 30 min to 3 h) are used for <b>anodizing</b> porous titanium structures that were later heat treated at 500 °C. The nanotopographical features are examined using electron microscopy while the bioactivity of <b>anodized</b> surfaces is measured using immersion tests in the simulated body fluid (SBF). Moreover, the effects of <b>anodizing</b> and heat treatment on the performance of one representative <b>anodized</b> porous titanium structures are evaluated using in vitro cell culture assays using human periosteum-derived cells (hPDCs). It has been shown that while <b>anodizing</b> with different <b>anodizing</b> parameters results in very different nanotopographical features, i. e. nanotubes in the range of 20 to 55 nm, <b>anodized</b> surfaces have limited apatite-forming ability regardless of the applied <b>anodizing</b> parameters. The results of in vitro cell culture show that both <b>anodizing,</b> and thus generation of regular nanotopographical feature, and heat treatment improve the cell culture response of porous titanium. In particular, cell proliferation measured using metabolic activity and DNA content was improved for <b>anodized</b> and heat treated as well as for <b>anodized</b> but not heat-treated specimens. Heat treatment additionally improved the cell attachment of porous titanium surfaces and upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. <b>Anodized</b> but not heat-treated specimens showed some limited signs of upregulated expression of osteogenic markers. In conclusion, while varying the <b>anodizing</b> parameters creates different nanotube structure, it does not improve apatite-forming ability of porous titanium. However, both <b>anodizing</b> and heat treatment at 500 °C improve the cell culture response of porous titanium. status: publishe...|$|R

Alpha Wave Movement's musical style {{can be considered}} ambient, new-age, some space rock, the classic 1970s period German style electronic music otherwise known as Berlin school {{as well as the}} ambient aesthetics of Brian Eno, and Steve Roach. Releases such A Distant Signal and Terra have more ambient space elements than other Alpha Wave Movement releases. Beyond Silence has more space rock elements and has a more rhythmic feel in their overall music compositions. In 2007 Alpha Wave Movement released The Mystic & The Machine, a musical exploration of 1970's era romantic progressive rock performed on synthesizers with the addition of UK musician Steve Hillman on electric guitar. The influences of Genesis, Ozric Tentacles (1980s era), and Camel are quite obvious and intended and shows yet another side of Alpha Wave Movement's composition. Alpha Wave Movement's music is semi electronic-based, utilizing digital synthesizers and MIDI to create its sonic explorations. Aside from the music influences nature and natural landscapes are a continuous source of inspiration for compositions. Alpha Wave Movement has performed at the Ambient Ping Canada and at the Gathering Room USA. Alpha Wave Movement has released music on the Dutch label Groove Unlimited, Silent Records (USA), Waveform Records (USA), Spiralight (USA), <b>Anodize</b> (USA)and on the private label Harmonic Resonance Recordings. Alpha Wave Movement's other projects include Thought Guild, Open Canvas, Subtle Shift and a solo release as Gregory Kyryluk.The latest release from Alpha Wave Movement is entitled [...] "Soniq Variants"(2011). The release is based conceptually on the use of Ensoniq synthesizers solely for the compositions. Ensoniq was an American manufacturer that spearheaded early affordable synthesizer workstation's the first of which was the ESQ-1 in 1986. Music on this release was composed primarily on the ESQ-1, VFX-SD, SQ-R and a DP4 all of which were made by Ensoniq. Additional use of a Novation synthesizer was also incorporated to add some timbral variation.The year 2012 arrived with a new electronic music project by Gregory Kyryluk under the alias of Subtle Shift. This new project dives head into the ambient dub waterways. Featuring a more sublime percussive foundation, environmental soundscapes. Drawn on the influences of the Detroit and European creative pioneering spirits such as Rod Modell and Yagya, GAS as well as incorporating 1970s electro aesthetics.

Laser engraving metal plates are manufactured with a finely polished metal, coated with an enamel paint made to be [...] "burned off". At levels of 10-30 watts, excellent engravings are made as the enamel is removed quite cleanly. Much laser engraving is sold as exposed brass or silver-coated steel lettering on a black or dark-enamelled background. A wide variety of finishes are now available, including screen-printed marble effects on the enamel. Anodized aluminum is commonly engraved or etched with CO2 laser machines. With power less than 40W this metal can easily be engraved with clean, impressive detail. The laser bleaches the color exposing the white or silver aluminum substrate. Although it comes in various colors, laser engraving black anodized aluminum provides the best contrast of all colors. Unlike most materials engraving <b>anodize</b> aluminum does not leave any smoke or residue.Spray coatings can be obtained for the specific use of laser engraving metals, these sprays apply a coating that is visible to the laser light which fuses the coating to the substrate where the laser passed over.

This project involves the study of four <b>anodize</b> thicknesses ranges deposited on a 7050 -T 74 aluminum substrates. Through the use of rotary bend fatigue experiments and tensile cracking experiments, the effect of increasing <b>anodize</b> thickness has been examined. Scanning electron microscopy has also been used to relate the measured strengths to the cracking patterns observed at the failure surfaces.

The <b>anodized</b> film is fractured at an early stage of repeated tensile fatigue process, because it is too brittle to accommodate the substrate metal. Many cracks are induced to initiate at the substrate by flaws of the <b>anodized</b> film. It was pointed out through the study that the fatigue strength of <b>anodized</b> aluminum alloy is controlled by the crack initiation behavior in the substrate induced by the rupture of the <b>anodized</b> film, which is related to the deformation of substrate metal during fatigue process...|$|R

5000|$|Type 1 {{photosensitive}} <b>anodized</b> aluminum is <b>anodized</b> aluminum {{that has}} been impregnated with a silver compound which, when exposed to a light source, creates an activated latent image. [...] Upon development and fixing a black, silver-based image is formed inside of the metal. Type 1 photosensitive <b>anodized</b> aluminum is then sealed in boiling water similarly to common <b>anodized</b> aluminum. Sealing hydrates the aluminum oxide surface, trapping the image beneath the <b>anodized</b> layer. The combined benefits of UV stability and the high image resolution of silver photography along with the abrasion and corrosion resistance of <b>anodized</b> aluminum are used to advantage in applications where permanent product identification is critical such as equipment nameplates, IUID barcode labels, outdoor signage, safety/warning plates, machine control panels and fine art.|$|R
