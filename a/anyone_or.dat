25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church has {{differentiated}} between latria and dulia. A latria is the veneration due God, and latria to <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> {{anything other}} than God is doctrinally forbidden by the Orthodox Church; however dulia {{has been defined as}} veneration of religious images, statues or icons which is not only allowed but obligatory. This distinction was discussed by Thomas Acquinas in section 3.25 of Summa Theologiae.|$|E

A special status accrues to the thing suspended: a serpent, a victim of crucifixion or hanging, a rod, a fruit, mistletoe. Derivations of this idea find form in the Rod of Asclepius, an emblem of the medical profession, and in the caduceus, an emblem of correspondence and commercial professions. The staff in these emblems represents the axis mundi while the serpents act as guardians of, or guides to, knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) is insight or {{knowledge}} of {{the true nature of}} existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and saṃsāra. Prajñā is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the wisdom about the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> anything, and dependent origination.|$|E
500|$|Davison's {{purpose in}} {{attending}} the Derby and walking onto {{the course is}} unclear. She did not discuss her plans with <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> leave a note.

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Crash's sole offensive maneuvers were jumping onto his enemies and a distinctive technique in which he spins around like a tornado, kicking away <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> anything that he strikes.

The expanded abilities include a powerful splash, the ability to jump while in the air, the [...] "Death Tornado Spin" [...] (a variation of his spinning technique that allows him to hover through the air for a limited time), a bazooka that fires Wumpa Fruit, increased running speed, the ability to safely tip-toe on top of explosive crates, and the ability to jump at incredibly high heights. The games Crash of the Titans and [...] allow Crash to further expand his offensive abilities with new fighting moves learned from collecting a magical substance known as [...] "Mojo".

500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to know <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating <b>anyone</b> <b>or</b> [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E
