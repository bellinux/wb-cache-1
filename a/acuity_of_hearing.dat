40|$|The Infant Monitor {{of vocal}} Production (IMP) was {{conceived}} {{as an educational}} strategy to help parents understand the nature and pace of their baby's vocal development following neonatal diagnosis and amplification for hearing loss. The potential for other clinical applications emerged with use. The instrument presents {{as a series of}} parent–professional conversations that scaffold parent observation and evaluation of their baby's vocal development across the first 12 months of natural hearing ability/early device-aided hearing experience. A graphic representation of IMP results illustrates for parents and professionals the timeliness (or otherwise) of a baby's advancement through a hierarchy of vocal behaviours that demonstrate the emergence and integrity of an infant's audition-production loop—the mechanism whereby <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> guides nascent vocal productions to progressively ‘mirror’ the acoustic features of accessible speech. A pilot study showed that the IMP quantified typical infant vocal development as a function of chronological age/normal hearing experience (birth to 12 months). Further, it demonstrated that the instrument was sensitive to individual differences in rate of vocal development for infants, from birth to 12 months of device-assisted hearing age...|$|E
40|$|Across {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate species, non-linear active {{mechanisms are}} employed {{to increase the}} sensitivity and <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> <b>hearing.</b> In mosquitoes, the antennal hearing organs are known to use active force feedback to enhance auditory acuity to female generated sounds. This sophisticated form of signal processing involves active nonlinear events that are proposed {{to rely on the}} motile properties of mechanoreceptor neurons. The fundamental physical mechanism for active auditory mechanics is theorised to rely on a synchronization of motile neurons, with a characteristic frequency doubling of the force generated by an ensemble of motile mechanoreceptors. There is however no direct biomechanical evidence at the mechanoreceptor level, hindering further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of sensitive hearing. Here, using in situ and in vivo atomic force microscopy, we measure and characterise the mechanical response of mechanosensory neuron units during forced oscillations of the hearing organ. Mechanoreceptor responses exhibit the hallmark of nonlinear feedback for force generation, with movements at twice the stimulus frequency, associated with auditory amplification. Simultaneous electrophysiological recordings exhibit similar response features, notably a frequency doubling of the firing rate. This evidence points {{to the nature of the}} mechanism, whereby active hearing in mosquitoes emerges from the double-frequency response of the auditory neurons. These results open up the opportunity to directly investigate active cellular mechanics in auditory systems, and they also reveal a pathway to study the nanoscale biomechanics and its dynamics of cells beyond the sense of hearing...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a second-order motion system distinct from both the first-order and feature tracking motion systems remains controversial even though many consider it well established. In the present study, the texture contribution to motion was measured within and beyond the spatial <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> attention by presenting the stimuli in the near periphery where the spatial resolution of attention is low. The logic was that when moving elements are too close one to another for attention to individually select them (i. e., crowding), {{it is not possible}} to track them. To test the {{existence of}} a dedicated second-order motion system, the texture contribution to motion was measured when neutralizing both the feature tracking motion system and the contribution of the first-order motion system due to preprocessing nonlinearities introducing residual distortion products. When the contribution of distortion products was not neutralized, texture substantially contributed to motion for spatial frequencies within and beyond the spatial <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> attention. When neutralizing the contribution of distortion products, texture substantially contributed to motion for spatial frequencies within the spatial <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> attention, but not for spatial frequencies beyond the spatial <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> attention. We conclude that there is no dedicated second-order motion system; the texture contribution to motion is mediated solely by the first-order (due to residual distortion products) and feature tracking (at frequencies within spatiotemporal <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> attention) motion systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{report the}} case of a patient in whom {{simultaneous}} toric phakic intraocular lens removal and phacoemulsification with toric intraocular lens implantation were beneficial for reducing pre-existing astigmatism and acquiring good visual outcomes in eyes with implantable collamer lens-induced cataract and astigmatism. Case presentation A 53 -year-old woman had undergone toric implantable collamer lens implantation three years earlier. After informed consent was obtained, we performed simultaneous toric implantable collamer lens removal and phacoemulsification with toric intraocular lens implantation. Preoperatively, the manifest refraction was 0, - 0. 5 × 15, with an uncorrected visual <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> 0. 7 and a best spectacle-corrected visual <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> 0. 8. Postoperatively, the manifest refraction was improved to 0, - 0. 5 × 180, with an uncorrected visual <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> 1. 2 and a best spectacle-corrected visual <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> 1. 5. No vision-threatening complications were observed.

Thirty-three ears of 18 divers were included in statistical analyses. The average hearing deterioration in the divers in 5 years, after elimination of the aging effect, was 6. 6 dB (SD 4. 5) and was statistically significant.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} the effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on the hearing acuity in patients with Fabry disease. Materials. The study sample comprised 34 ears of 17 affected patients who underwent pure-tone audiometry before and after ERT. Methods. The patients were studied in relation to factors such as changes in <b>hearing,</b> presence <b>of</b> accompanying symptoms, status of renal and cardiac function, age, and gender. Data of pure-tone audiometry obtained before ERT and at the final examination were compared. Results. At the end of the follow-up period, no significant worsening <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>acuity</b> was noted {{at the end of the}} follow-up period. SSNHL was detected in 10 ears of 6 patients. Steroid therapy successfully cured the disease in 9 of the 10 ears. Conclusions. No significant worsening <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>acuity</b> was noted from the beginning to the end of ERT. The rate of improvement in SSNHL of Fabry disease was excellent in the treated patients.

50|$|Glossotherium {{had large}} ear ossicles, {{similar to those}} in elephants, which imply the loss <b>of</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>acuity</b> <b>of</b> higher frequencies, further {{implying}} an advantage for sensing low frequency sounds, infrasound, or bone-conducting seismic waves.

Sloths may have used low frequency sounds for communication in mating calls or other social interactions, or for long-range sound sensing as in predator-prey interactions or weather forecasting. Another possible explanation for hearing in low frequencies may be due to fossorial habits: low hearing frequencies coupled with a short interaural distance suggest that Glossotherium probably had very poor sound localization. This indicates evidence of an underground lifestyle since loss <b>of</b> high frequency <b>hearing</b> is common to fossorial mammals. Glossotherium’s huge nostrils were likely effective for sound emission, with expanded nares possibly related to emission of low frequency sounds up to 600 Hz.|$|R
