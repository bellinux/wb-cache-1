40|$|Gastric {{emptying}} in a {{group of}} 49 vomiting infants with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) was investigated using <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography.</b> Fourteen asymptomatic infants were also studied as a control group. A Dioralyte test feed (25 ml/kg/feed) was used for all the studies. The infants with IHPS were investigated before and at two, four, and seven days after an operation; the other infants were investigated once. The results show that the infants with IHPS have no or little gastric emptying before the operation and gradually return to normal emptying by the seventh day after the operation. A significant difference in gastric emptying was noted between the control infants and the infants with IHPS before and at two and four days after the operation.

40|$|<b>Applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> (APT) is a new, {{non-invasive}} technique that can yield sequential images {{of changes in}} the resistivity of gastric contents. Studies were performed to investigate the application of APT to measure gastric acid secretion. Experiments in 20 normal volunteers showed that changes in gastric resistivity were closely correlated with changes in the volume (r = 0. 80), the acidity (r = 0. 83) and the total conductivity of gastric contents (r = 0. 87). Studies in 13 patients referred for a pentagastrin test showed that changes in gastric resistivity before pentagastrin were closely correlated with basal acid output measured on a separate occasion (r = 0. 85, p less than 0. 001), while changes in gastric resistivity after pentagastrin were correlated with maximal acid output (r = 0. 58, p less than 0. 05). Ingestion of alcohol by six normal subjects decreased gastric resistivity markedly, probably due to alcohol induced gastric acid secretion as it was prevented by cimetidine. <b>Applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> is a safe non-invasive method of measuring gastric acid secretion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{consumption}} of coffee allegedly induces or aggravates gastrointestinal symptoms. In order {{to investigate the}} effect of coffee on gastrointestinal motility we studied the effect of coffee on gastric emptying and oro-caecal transit time. METHODS: In a randomised, controlled, cross-over study gastric emptying and oro-caecal transit time were studied in 12 healthy volunteers, using <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> and lactulose hydrogen breath test, respectively. After 1 day of coffee abstinence and an overnight fast, coffee or the control drink (water) was drunk and 10 min thereafter a liquid nutrient meal was ingested together with lactulose. During 150 min, recordings were made with <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> and breath samples were taken every 5 min. Lag-phase duration and gastric half-emptying time were determined by two blinded observers. RESULTS: The lag-phase duration after coffee (median 19. 8 min, range 6 - 47 min) was {{not significantly different from}} that after water (median 19. 3 min, range 11 - 37. 5), nor was the gastric half-emptying time (median 75. 7 min, range 56 - 157. 6 vs. median 83. 4 min, range 64. 6 - 148. 4). Likewise, coffee had no significant effect on oro-caecal transit time (median 135 min, range 60 - 270 vs. median 140 min, range 55 - 270). No significant correlation between any of these parameters and mean daily coffee intake was found. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee does not affect gastric emptying of a liquid meal or small bowel transi...|$|E
40|$|Absence of {{hydrostatic}} {{forces in}} the human cardiocirculatory system normally leads to an overall body fluid deficit. It was hypothesized that this is mainly due {{to a loss of}} interstitial fluid. An experiment was performed on board the Russian MIR station. Cuffs were positioned around both thighs and inflated up to suprasystolic values. This manoeuvre took place just before and immediately after a lower body negative pressure session (LBNP). The redistribution of fluids underneath the cuffs was assessed by means of cross-sectional impedance tomography (<b>Applied</b> <b>Potential</b> <b>Tomography,</b> APT). A micro-g induced loss of interstitial fluid was measured in all layers of the observed cross-section. The APT-readings changed significantly from 3. 0 at 1 g to 1. 7 at 0 g for the outer layer and from 2. 7 at 1 g to 2. 0 at 0 g for the middle layer (expressed in arbitrary units). The LBNP manoeuvre was able to fill the interstitial space but only at levels higher than - 15 mmHg LBNP. This suggests that the superficial tissues in the legs are as much affected as the deeper ones by changing g-conditions and LBNP can be used to counteract interstitial fluid loss in this area...|$|E
40|$|We {{wished to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that colonic loading with fecal material leads to delayed gastric emptying. Twelve healthy male volunteers were studied. Each of these subjects went through two randomized study periods of four days. In one of these, the subjects defecated upon urge, in the other period defecation was voluntarily suppressed. Gastric emptying of a semisolid meal (mashed potatoes) was measured with the noninvasive <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> technique. On day 3 no significant changes in gastric emptying were found, but on day 4 the emptying rate had decreased from 85. 8 +/- 11. 0 %/hr (mean +/- SEM) to 70. 3 +/- 10. 9 %/hr (P < 0. 05) and the T 50 had increased from 38. 5 +/- 3. 4 min to 46. 2 +/- 4. 0 min (P < 0. 025). The duration of the lag phase (4. 1 +/- 1. 5 min) was not significantly altered by suppression of defecation.

40|$|There {{are already}} {{excellent}} techniques for imaging {{the anatomy of}} the human brain, and changes in its functional state over seconds. Furthermore, {{the function of the}} individual neuron has been studied at time resolutions of less than a millisecond. There is, at present, no technique which combines this fine time resolution with tomographic imaging, although this may be essential if we are ever to understand the processing of information by the brain. The work described in this thesis used mathematical models and in-vivo measurement to investigate whether <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography</b> (APT), a recently-developed imaging technique, may be used for imaging neuronal depolarisation in the brain. Two factors suggest that APT may be suitable: first, it can acquire data sets at the required rate; second, there is known to be a decrease in the resistance of neuronal membranes, perhaps by up to a factor of 40, when they depolarise. The practicality of APT depends on whether there is corresponding measurable change in the macroscopic impedance of brain tissue. A mathematical model was used to estimate the magnitude and frequency-dependence of brain impedance changes in two tissues: crustacean peripheral nerve and mammalian cortex. The model predicted that at 30 kHz, a typical working frequency for APT, the resistivity change would be 600 times smaller than at DC, for which the predictions were 3. 70 / 0 for nerve and 0. 01...|$|E

Delayed gastric emptying is a another complication occurring in around 30 % of patients after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and causes prolonged hospital stay. The influence of octreotide on this complication is doubtful. AIMS: To assess the effect of octreotide, at the clinical dosage used after pancreatic surgery, on gastric emptying in healthy volunteers. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eight healthy male volunteers (mean age 22. 5 years) participated in this double blind, placebo controlled study. On day 1 subjects received 100 micrograms of octreotide or placebo subcutaneously, three times daily and on day 2, one hour after the fourth injection, gastric emptying, postprandial cholecystokinin (CCK) release, and mouth to caecum transit time (MCTT) were measured. This protocol was repeated after one week, in a crossover design. On the test day subjects received a liquid test meal (1. 57 MJ/ 300 ml) and gastric emptying measurements were performed with <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> <b>tomography,</b> an non-invasive, validated technique which measures gastric emptying through impedance differences. From the gastric emptying curves, lag time, t 50, and postlag emptying rate were measured. MCTT was measured using the hydrogen breath test. RESULTS: Lag time decreased from 29. 6 (6. 3) (mean (SEM)) to 12. 2 (4. 6) minutes (p < 0. 05) during octretide treatment; t 50 decreased from 87. 8 (12. 0) to 47. 5 (8. 2) minutes (p < 0. 02) {{and there was a}} trend towards an increased postlag emptying rate (0. 8 to 1. 6 % per minute; p = 0. 07).

The dependence of membrane specific capacitance on the chain-length of the alkane oil present in the bilayer is similar to that observed in black lipid membranes. In contrast to conventional artificial bilayers, DIBs are not confined by an aperture, which enables us to determine that the dependence of whole bilayer capacitance on <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> is predominantly a result of a spontaneous increase in bilayer area. This area change arises from the creation of new bilayer at the three phase interface and is driven by changes in surface tension with <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> that can be described by the Young-Lippmann equation.

We found that the photoelectrochemical behavior of the resulting PCA- and DNA-PCA-assembled TiO 2 nanotube electrodes, especially the photocurrent direction, could be modulated by the assembled molecules under the assistance of an <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> and excitation wavelength. Unlike bare TiO 2 nanotube electrodes, which generate only anodic photocurrents, those assembled with PCA molecules and ssDNA-PCA molecules were found to generate anodic or cathodic photocurrents depending on the <b>applied</b> <b>potential.</b> Moreover, TiO 2 nanotube electrodes assembled with dsDNA-PCA molecules generated either anodic or cathodic photocurrent depending on the specific <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> and the excitation wavelength. The related photoexcited charge transfer processes discussed herein {{are influenced by the}} assembled molecules...|$|R
40|$|Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo Collision (PIC/MCC) {{algorithms}} {{comprise a}} numerical model {{to assess the}} discharge characteristics of an RF plasma microthruster concept that exploits an RF capacitively coupled discharge (RFCCD) to heat a propellant. The effects of heat transfer between the discharge and the neutral species on microthruster performance are discussed. Heat transfer within the plasma discharge {{has been shown to}} greatly affect the discharge characteristics and thruster performance. Increasing the neutral temperature reduces the amount of power transmitted into the fluid through a reduction of the neutral density, and thus reduces effectiveness of the discharge. The PIC/MCC modeling showed that the power transmitted into the fluid increases faster than linear with respect to an increase in <b>applied</b> <b>potential,</b> but the total power absorbed increases on the order of a linear trend. The power transmission efficiency is found to be directly proportional to the <b>applied</b> <b>potential,</b> making the discharge more efficient at higher voltages. The theoretical specific impulse also increases as the <b>applied</b> <b>potential</b> or discharge pressure is increased...|$|R
