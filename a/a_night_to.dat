5|$|After Lord died in 2002, he bequeathed to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England {{his huge}} {{collection}} of manuscripts, original letters and Titanic memorabilia, {{which he had}} gathered during his life and used to write <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember. MacQuitty also donated items from his own collection of material related to the film. Items from the collection are {{on display at the}} museum and can be accessed by researchers.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember is a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord {{about the}} sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, and is still {{considered}} a definitive resource about the Titanic. Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs and articles that they had written. He authored a follow-up book, The Night Lives On, in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book {{but was a}} huge success, thanks {{in no small part}} to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|Nigel Kneale {{wrote the}} first draft of the {{screenplay}} in 1961, but difficulties in attracting interest from American co-financiers meant the film did not go into production until 1967. The director, Roy Ward Baker, was chosen because of his experience with technically demanding productions such as <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember; this was the first of six films that he directed for Hammer. Andrew Keir, playing Quatermass, found making the film an unhappy experience, believing Baker had wanted Kenneth More to play the role. Owing to a lack of space, the film was shot at the MGM studios in Elstree, Borehamwood rather than Hammer's usual home at the time, which was the Associated British Studios, also in Elstree.|$|E

However, after Dwane Casey's firing after the Twolves' 40th game (when they had a record of 20–20), the Twolves struggled, yet the young star played well when given minutes. In March, Foye saw nearly 24 minutes of playing time a night, and in April saw almost 27 minutes <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> perform.|$|E

25|$|As one of {{the best-known}} {{survivors}} of the disaster, Gracie has been featured as a character in many of the dramatizations of the Titanics sinking. For example, he was played by James Dyrenforth in <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember (1958) and by Bernard Fox in the film Titanic (1997) - in which - because the actor playing him was British - he speaks with a British accent, despite the real Gracie being American.|$|E
25|$|Titanic {{has gone}} {{down in history as}} the ship that was called unsinkable. For more than 100 years, she has been the {{inspiration}} of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking memorial postcards sold in huge numbers together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers, and even black mourning teddy bears. Several survivors wrote books about their experiences {{but it was not until}} 1955 the first historically accurate book <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember was published.|$|E
25|$|The {{first film}} about the disaster, Saved from the Titanic, was {{released}} only 29 days after the ship sank and had an actual survivor as its star—the silent film actress Dorothy Gibson. The British film <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember (1958) is still {{widely regarded as the}} most historically accurate movie portrayal of the sinking. The most financially successful by far has been James Cameron's Titanic (1997), which became the highest-grossing film in history up to that time, as well as the winner of 11 Oscars at the 70th Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron.|$|E

25|$|In 1957 More had {{announced}} that he would play the lead role of a captain caught up in the Indian Mutiny in Night Runners of Bengal but the film was never made. More turned down an offer from Roy Ward Baker to play a German POW in The One That Got Away (1957), but agreed to play the lead part of Charles Lightoller in the Titanic film for the same director, <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember (1958). This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films.|$|E
25|$|Caseros {{was used}} as a place to {{dismantle}} stolen cars during the 1990s. At the time there was also a mysterious episode in which two inmates were allowed out into the street for <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> go on a robbing spree. They shot and killed someone {{in the course of the}} night, and their faces were caught on camera. The next morning they were safely back in their cells, but the police identified them through the videotapes and began to investigate. Within the next three weeks, one of the inmates was found dead in his cell, apparently as a result of suicide. But his fellow inmates doubted the possibility of suicide, since he hadn't shown any signs of being suicidal. The guards who had let them out for a night in exchange for a cut of the booty were obvious suspects. Eventually all the guards were arrested as a part of the investigation, and held in custody for nearly a year. One guard was tried and found guilty of murder, receiving a sentence of twenty years in prison.|$|E

In Walter Lord's book <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember, which documents the fate of the RMS Titanic, a broad, lower-deck working corridor on E Deck, which ran the length of the ship, was referred to by officers as [...] "Park Lane" [...] (and by crew as [...] "Scotland Road").|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Quatermass and the Pit finally entered {{production}} Val Guest was occupied on Casino Royale (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) {{and he was}} best known for The One That Got Away (1957) and <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember (1958). Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963–64), The Saint (1962–69) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember and The One That Got Away enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism {{it needed to be}} convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was [...] "taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it." [...] He was also impressed with Hammer Films’ lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he {{was surprised to find that}} Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as “Roy Ward Baker”, having previously been credited as “Roy Baker”. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.|$|E
500|$|Steve Huey of Allmusic {{wrote that}} Diffie [...] "lent his {{traditional}} sensibilities to humorous, rock-tinged novelties and plaintive ballads." [...] His early albums for Epic mostly consisted of ballads, but starting with Honky Tonk Attitude, {{he began to}} include more up-tempo and novelty numbers. Starting with <b>A</b> <b>Night</b> <b>to</b> Remember, Diffie returned to a more ballad-oriented sound; Mike Kraski, then the {{senior vice president of}} sales for Sony Music Nashville, thought that the albums before it had over-emphasized his novelty releases.|$|E
