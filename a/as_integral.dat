5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the title Music of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> to the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} study prehistoric art is {{dependent}} on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and {{to a lesser extent}} wood), later pottery and metal, {{are more likely to be}} extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. Alexander Marshack argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, Paul Mellars suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.|$|E

5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now regarded <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> became {{incorporated into}} the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E
5|$|The UNPROFOR mandate was {{extended}} several times, in increments {{of up to}} six months, with consent {{of the government of}} Croatia. That changed in early 1995, when Croatian President Franjo Tuđman wrote to the Secretary-General of the United Nations informing him that Croatia would not accept further extensions of the mission once it expired on 31 March and asking that UNPROFOR leave Croatia by the end of June. At the time, it was established UN practice to seek consent of the country where its peacekeepers were deployed, and the letter effectively required UNPROFOR to withdraw completely from Croatia. Such action would also require abolishment of the UNPAs, which had been identified <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> parts of Croatia by United Nations Security Council Resolution 815 of 30 March 1993. Two days later, the Secretary-General reported to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that UNPROFOR was unable to implement important elements of the Vance plan, enforce a ceasefire, or protect its own vehicles against hijackings in the UNPAs.|$|E
5|$|Urban elites {{throughout}} the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals (paideia). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools {{of higher learning}} {{as an expression of}} cultural achievement. Young men from Rome who wished to pursue the highest levels of education often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and numeracy. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair of grammar. In the eastern empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted the assimilation of Greek and Roman social, educational, and aesthetic values, and the Greek proclivities for which Nero had been criticized were regarded from the time of Hadrian onward <b>as</b> <b>integral</b> to Imperial culture.|$|E
40|$|These lectures {{present a}} survey of recent {{developments}} {{in the area of}} random matrices (finite and infinite) and random permutations. These probabilistic problems suggest matrix integrals (or Fredholm determinants), which arise very naturally <b>as</b> <b>integrals</b> over the tangent space to symmetric spaces, <b>as</b> <b>integrals</b> over groups and finally <b>as</b> <b>integrals</b> over symmetric spaces. An important part of these lectures is devoted to showing that these matrix integrals, upon apropriately adding time-parameters, are natural tau-functions for integrable lattices, like the Toda, Pfaff and Toeplitz lattices, but also for integrable PDE’s, like the KdV equation. These matrix integrals or Fredholm determinants also satisfy Virasoro constraints, which combined with the integrable equations lead to (partial) differential equations for the original probabilities...|$|R
