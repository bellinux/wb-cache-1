The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two other prisoners, they hid inside <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, sprinkling the area with tobacco soaked in gasoline to fool the dogs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{characteristics}} of a structure supported by <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation. <b>A</b> centrifuge model test and its simulation analysis are discussed first, followed by a parameter survey based on the finite element analysis. In the centrifuge models test, structures supported by <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation and by <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> foundation were considered. A parameter survey was performed {{from the viewpoint of}} foundation types and types of connection conditions between the raft and the piles. It was found from this study that, although the effect of the pile head connection condition on the response characteristics of a superstructure is fairy small when compared to the type of the foundation, it does affect the load bearing characteristics of piles even when piles are not connected to the raft foundation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCyclic lateral-loading {{centrifuge}} {{tests were}} conducted on <b>a</b> new <b>pile</b> located {{at the center of}} 2 × 2 existing piles, to evaluate the effects of the existing piles on the new pile's lateral resistance when the <b>piles</b> of <b>an</b> old building are left derelict. Furthermore, two-dimensional FEM analyses of the horizontal cross sections of the pile–soil systems were carried out. The centrifuge test results show that the lateral resistance of <b>a</b> new <b>pile,</b> located among existing piles, shows slight increases. The existing piles increase the horizontal subgrade reaction of {{the upper part of the}} new pile, but slightly decrease that of the lower part of the new pile. Numerical analyses reveal that the key to whether <b>an</b> existing <b>pile</b> increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of <b>a</b> new <b>pile</b> or not, is the soil displacement at the location of the existing pile. An existing pile increases the horizontal subgrade reaction of <b>a</b> new <b>pile</b> when the existing pile displacement is less than the soil displacement caused by the new <b>pile.</b> Conversely, <b>an</b> existing <b>pile</b> decreases the horizontal subgrade reaction of <b>a</b> new <b>pile</b> when the existing pile displacement is greater than the soil displacement caused by the new pile...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} design of <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> foundation {{is based on}} a bearing capacity approach, and neglects the contribution of the raft. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> consequence, <b>piled</b> foundations are usually designed by overconservative criteria. With respect to the conventional approach, a more rational and economical solution could be obtained by accounting for the contribution of the raft toward the overall bearing capacity, but this potential is not exploited {{due to the lack of}} theoretical and experimental research on the behavior of piled rafts at failure. Based on both experimental evidence and three-dimensional finite element analyses, a simple criterion is proposed to evaluate the ultimate vertical load of <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft as <b>a</b> function of its component capacities, which can be simply evaluated by the conventional bearing capacity theories. The results presented in the paper thus provide a guide to assess the safety factor of <b>a</b> vertically loaded <b>piled</b> raft...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade piled raft {{foundations}} {{have been widely used}} around the world as intermediate foundation systems between piles and rafts to control the settlement of foundations. However, when those piles are structurally connected to rafts, relatively high axial stresses develop in relatively small numbers of piles, which are often designed to fully mobilize their geotechnical capacities. To avoid a concentration of stress at the head of <b>piles</b> in <b>a</b> traditional <b>piled</b> raft foundation, the raft is disconnected from the <b>piles,</b> and <b>a</b> cushion is introduced between them. Also, to tackle an unfavourable soil profile for <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft foundation, the conventional piled raft has been modified into <b>a</b> cushioned composite <b>piled</b> raft foundation, where piles of different materials are used. In the current study the behavior of cushioned foundation components, which transfer the load from the structure to the subsoil, are analyzed in detail, i. e., the thickness of the raft, the length of <b>a</b> long <b>pile</b> and the modulus of <b>a</b> flexible <b>pile...</b>|$|R
40|$|Simple {{numerical}} {{codes for}} the analysis of soil structure interaction in the case of piled raft foundations are available. A proper idealisation and geotechnical quantification of the subsoil profile is of main concern. Firstly, recent research work on the problem of piled foundations embedded in layered soils is reported. In {{the second part of the}} paper innovative design criteria for piled rafts are discussed. It is argued that for a proper application of innovative concepts the safety factor of <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft has to be defined. To this aim 3 D finite element predictions of the ultimate vertical load of <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft will be presented...|$|R

5|$|The video commences with {{shots of}} a {{construction}} site, where Ciara arrives {{in a large}} construction vehicle. Elliott raps her opening verse {{from the top of}} <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of large tires while Ciara makes her debut in a gray jumpsuit with square aviator sunglasses. She soon appears in a slender black leotard and walks seductively along a construction walkway. Ciara and her dancers move to a dune in front of the site, where they perform a group choreography. The dancers wear white tops, torn blue jeans, construction belts and goggles. The second verse features an intense dance and switches halfway through to Ciara in a turquoise PVC dress and black strap stilettos, dancing in front of <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> of tires. She and her dancers return to the dune and dance to Elliott's words. The video ends in the sand dune as Ciara and her dancers slowly drop to the ground and then get back up.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of centrifuge tests performed on piled raft foundation models. The model raft consisted of a circular very stiff plate; the model piles, embedded in loose saturated very fine sand, were non-displacement; some of them were instrumented with two load cells, the first at the pile head, the second at the tip or, alternatively, at mid-pile, to determine the distribution of load along the shaft. The fol-lowing models were tested: the rigid plate without <b>piles,</b> <b>an</b> isolated <b>pile</b> and the piled raft with 1, 3, 7 and 13 piles respectively. The results of the tests carried out have been analysed with the aim of investigating the raft-soil-pile interaction mechanisms and understanding how the load bearing behaviour of the piles as part of <b>a</b> <b>piled</b> raft changes compared to <b>an</b> isolated <b>pile.</b> The paper describes the details of experiments undertaken and some of the results...|$|R
5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into <b>a</b> <b>pile.</b> The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It remains on the screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E

5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, {{needle-like}} or sabre-like egg-laying organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
