40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Business Information Systems) [...] Tshwane University of Technology 2011. Information systems {{are defined as}} a group of {{interconnected}} components (people, organisation and technology) that function together to extract, regain, route, accumulate and distribute information, with the aim of business decision making and operational activities in an organisation and other business. As a result, nformation systems are being deployed by organisation to help assure that their daily activities are completed seamlessly. Thus, organisational stakeholders invest a vast amount of money in the deployment of these systems. Furthermore, volumes of organisational data stored within these systems increases on regular basis. As the volume of data and the complexity of information systems increase, business managers expect information systems auditors to become even more relevant and rigorous as these auditors have to ensure that possible risks that these nformation systems may inherent are mitigated. International Auditing standards and best practices emphasise the use of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by IS auditors, within their audit engagements. However, the level of compliance to these international auditing standards and best practices by the South African information systems auditors is still questionable. An empirical study conducted by Vasile-Daniel (2010) indicated that even if technology is accepted, few (if not all) of nformation systems auditors still deploy traditional audit methods within their audit engagements. Currently, auditors were observed to use Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> only to select random test samples but not necessarily to audit entirely using Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques.</b> That is, they often revert to executing their audit engagements following the traditional methods. To the preceding point, the present study sought to explore factors that could be influencing the nformation systems auditors not to utilize Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> fully. The study, underpinned by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), investigated the use or adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques</b> by information systems auditors within a financial institution. The study revealed that senior management support, availability of resources, personal growth, increased productivity, and lack of relevant training tend to be the main factors, amongst others, influencing the use and adoption of Computer Aided <b>Audit</b> <b>Techniques...</b>|$|R

As an <b>audit</b> <b>technique</b> largely used, in both its statistical and nonstatistical form, the method {{is very important for}} auditors. It should be applied correctly for a fair view of financial statements, to satisfy the needs of all financial users. In order to be applied correctly the method must be understood by all its users and mainly by auditors. Otherwise the risk of not applying it correctly would cause loose of reputation and discredit, litigations and even prison. Since there is not a unitary practice and methodology for applying the technique, the risk of incorrectly applying it is pretty high. The SWOT analysis is a technique used that shows the advantages, disadvantages, threats and opportunities. We applied SWOT analysis in studying the sampling method, from the perspective of three players: the audit company, the audited entity and users of financial statements. The study shows that by applying the sampling method the audit company and the audited entity both save time, effort and money. The disadvantages of the method are difficulty in applying and understanding its insight. Being largely used as an audit method and being a factor of a correct audit opinion, the sampling method’s advantages, disadvantages, threats and opportunities must be understood by auditors...|$|E
