5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
500|$|N.E.R.D {{produced}} a remix featuring Kanye West, Lupe Fiasco, and Pusha T, which was available as an iTunes and Zune Marketplace bonus track with {{the purchase of}} Seeing Sounds. When asked why the song was remixed, Hugo replied with, [...] "We wanted something with more of a straight-ahead, club-bumping beat, just a different take on it. We like to remix, dismantle, take apart shit {{and put it back}} together. It's just like a Rubik's Cube: When you can't solve it, you just break it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it back together." [...] Williams added, [...] "We think that 'Everyone Nose' in its current form already hits a certain demographic a certain way, so I just wanted to go and do something different." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsoukas {{initially}} {{planned the}} music video to visualize Beyoncé winning the contest, {{where she would}} {{realize that it was}} meaningless to her. However, Beyoncé suggested that an albino should serve as the contest's winner instead. Speaking to MTV News, Matsoukas elaborated: [...] "We thought it was really important and interesting to break those ideas of what the classic beauty standards would be and to do this with this beautiful albino woman, I thought was really great. And to show 'Yeah she's not perfect, she doesn't always win <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> your best foot forward and you may still lose.'" [...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the group's self-titled debut took place from September to December 1991. The album {{was released on}} March 31, 1992, on compact disc, vinyl, and audio cassette. Ice-T states that Body Count was intentionally different from his solo hip hop albums in that [...] "An Ice T album has intelligence, and at times it has ignorance. Sometimes it has anger, sometimes it has questions. But Body Count was intended to reflect straight anger. It {{was supposed to be}} the voice of the angry brother, without answers. [...] If you took a kid <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> him in jail with a microphone and asked him how he feels, you'd get Body Count: 'Fuck that. Fuck school. Fuck the police.' You wouldn't get intelligence or compassion. You'd get raw anger." [...] From the album, [...] "There Goes The Neighborhood" [...] was released as a single, while [...] "Body Count's in the House" [...] was featured in the film Universal Soldier.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Brooklyn office, Giles and O'Keefe tell a loan {{counselor}} {{they want}} to buy a house, and that an abusive pimp is [...] "aggressively" [...] pursuing Giles. She [...] "wanted to leave because it is scary being subjected to a huge man who has control over your life." [...] The ACORN counselor advises her [...] "you get a tin if [...] is going to come beat you... you get a tin and bury it down in there <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the money right in <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> grass over it and you don't tell a single soul." [...] When discussing getting a house and Giles' earnings, O'Keefe says that Giles is very honest and an ACORN counselor replies, [...] "honest {{is not going to get}} you the house that is why you probably been denied cause you probably going in saying." [...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E
2500|$|A {{commitment}} {{to hold a}} referendum in 2010 {{was part of the}} SNP's election manifesto when it contested the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. The press were largely hostile towards the SNP, with a headline for The Scottish Sun in May 2007 stating – along with an image of a hangman's noose – [...] "Vote SNP today <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> Scotland's head in the noose". As a result of that election, the SNP became the largest party in the Scottish Parliament and formed a minority government led by the First Minister, Alex Salmond.|$|E
2500|$|Songs began {{appearing}} in fragments, often while on stage during the Under the Pink tour. After {{a trip to}} Hawaii during which Amos learned about legendary volcano goddess Pele, the album began taking shape; Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her {{life as well as}} a journey to finding her own fire as a woman. From there, Amos explained, the songs just came. [...] "Sometimes the fury of it would make me step back, I began to live these songs as we separated. The vampire in me came out. You're an emotional vampire, with blood in the corner of your mouth, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> on matching lipstick so no one knows." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z {{expressed}} his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: [...] "It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and you want people to go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life. You take parts of your life <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [...]|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> the gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment."
