500|$|Gail Wynand is {{a wealthy}} {{newspaper}} mogul who rose from a destitute childhood in the ghettoes of New York to control {{much of the}} city's print media. While Wynand shares many of the character qualities of Roark, his success is dependent upon his ability to pander to public opinion. Rand presents this as a tragic flaw that eventually leads to his downfall. In her journals Rand described Wynand as [...] "the man who could have been" [...] a heroic individualist, contrasting him to Roark, [...] "the man who can be and is". Some elements of Wynand's character were inspired by real-life newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, including Hearst's yellow journalism and mixed success in attempts to gain political influence. Wynand ultimately fails in his attempts to wield power, losing his newspaper, his wife, and his friendship with Roark. The character has been interpreted as {{a representation of the}} master morality described by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche; his tragic nature illustrates Rand's rejection of Nietzsche's philosophy. In Rand's view, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>like</b> Wynand, who seeks power over others, is as much a [...] "second-hander" [...] as a conformist such as Keating.|$|E

2500|$|Alternatively, {{it could}} be argued that [...] "Oroonoko" [...] is a {{homophone}} for the Orinoco River, along which the English settled, and it is possible to see the character as an allegorical figure for the mismanaged territory itself. Oroonoko, and the crisis of values of aristocracy, slavery, and worth he represents to the colonists, is emblematic of the new world and colonisation itself: <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>like</b> Oroonoko is symptomatic of a place like the Orinoco.|$|E

2500|$|Traditions {{have also}} {{connected}} Maudgalyāyana with {{the symbol of}} the Wheel of Becoming ( [...] , [...] ). Accounts in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya and the Divyāvadāna relate that Ānanda once told the Buddha about Maudgalyāyana's good qualities as a teacher. Maudgalyayana was a very popular teacher, and his sermons with regard to afterlife destinations were very popular. The Buddha said that in the future, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>like</b> him would be hard to find. The Buddha then had an image painted on the gate of the Veluvaḷa monastery to honor Maudgalyāyana, depicting the Wheel of Becoming. This wheel showed the different realms of the cycle of existence, the three poisons in the mind (greed, hatred and delusion), and the teaching of dependent origination. The wheel was depicted as being in the clutches of Māra, {{but at the same time}} included the symbol of a white circle for Nirvana. The Buddha further decreed that a monk be stationed at the painting to explain the law of karma to visitors. Images of the Wheel of Becoming are widespread in Buddhist Asia, some of which confirm and depict the original connection with Maudgalyāyana.|$|E
