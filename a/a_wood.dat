5|$|It {{is common}} to reduce <b>a</b> <b>wood</b> sample to just the {{cellulose}} component before testing, but since this can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well.

5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{was given the}} {{binomial}} name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783.

5|$|The most usual {{explanation}} for {{the origin of the}} name Widnes is that it comes from the Danish words vid, meaning wide, and noese, meaning nose and that it refers to the promontory projecting into the River Mersey.

Earlier spellings of the name have been Vidnes, Wydnes and Wydness.|$|E
