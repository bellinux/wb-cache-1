However, Inzamam-ul-Haq continued his dominance over England's attack, and only left the crease due to a hand injury. Mohammad Yousuf also built on his good form, and profited from being dropped on 16. In fact, he would eventually bat through the entire third day, which was <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> one for England where their only success was the wicket of the nightwatchman, Shoaib Akhtar, and that was only after {{he had made a}} score of 38.|$|E

It seemed like the old Stars were back, as through {{the first half of the}} season, they went 30–15–6. But after the All-Star Game, the Stars went into a slump, going on numerous losing streaks and blowing games. Through this though, the Stars still remained in the playoff picture. On the day of the trade deadline, the Stars traded James Neal and Matt Niskanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Alex Goligoski. After <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> second half, the Stars still had a chance to make the playoffs by winning all their games in April. They won all of them except for last, as they lost to the Minnesota Wild 5–3, costing them a playoff spot.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 1991–92 season, the Flyers {{acquired}} Rod Brind'Amour from St. Louis. Brind'Amour led the Flyers in goals (33), assists (44) {{and points}} (77) {{in his first}} season with the club. With Ron Sutter gone to St. Louis in the Brind'Amour trade, Rick Tocchet was named team captain. As the Flyers continued to flounder, Paul Holmgren was fired midway through the season and replaced by Bill Dineen, father of Flyer Kevin Dineen. On February 19, the Flyers and Pittsburgh made a major five-player deal which featured Tocchet – who never grew comfortably into the role of captain – heading to Pittsburgh and Mark Recchi coming to Philadelphia. Recchi recorded 27 points in his first 22 games as a Flyer, but the team missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, {{due in large part to}} <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> road record (10–26–4). With Tocchet traded, the Flyers remained without a captain until Kevin Dineen was named to the post in 1993–94, and instead went with three alternate captains.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E

25|$|In {{the wildest}} and largest ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team was <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E
25|$|Alan Davidson (5/25) and Bobby Simpson {{combined}} to ruin England's reply. Beginning at medium pace ‘Davo’ was chopped onto the stumps by <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> looking stroke from Geoff Pullar and tormented Ted Dexter, who played and missed his first four balls. Dexter was out, {{caught in a}} superb leaping dive by Simpson off the shoulder of his bat and David Sheppard followed a ball and edged it into Simpson's willing hands. Richie Benaud (1/29) brought himself on before tea and Colin Cowdrey became Simpson's third victim to leave England 37/4. Ken Barrington (21) and Peter Parfitt (28) hung until Barrington was bowled by Garth McKenzie (3/26). The England batsmen had now given up making runs and made only 49 from the last 31 overs of the day. Fred Titmus stayed in for 44 minutes for 6 runs until caught by Brian Booth off Norm O'Neill (1/7). John Murray {{came in with a}} strapped shoulder and bravely batted out the day to 86/6. He continued the following morning to make 3 not out in 100 minutes with effectively one hand. McKenzie and Davidson sportingly bowled straight to the injured keeper and settled the matter at the other end. McKenzie dismissing Pullar, caught by O'Neill, and Trueman, caught behind by Barry Jarman. Davidson clean bowled Brian Statham and had Len Coldwell lbw and England were out for 104. It was their lowest score at the Sydney Cricket Ground since 1901-02 and gave them a lead of only 64.|$|E
25|$|After {{his victory}} in the {{qualification}} race, Vernay started from pole position with Ericsson starting alongside, with Mortara and Bottas on row two. Due to damage inflicted in his spectacular accident the previous day, Boyd did not start, thus leaving the grid at 28 cars. Once again, Ericsson made <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> getaway, with Bottas and Mortara both slotting in behind a fast-starting Vernay. Into Lisboa, Ricciardo got alongside Ericsson as they battled for fourth with the Australian brushing {{the wall and the}} two continued side-by-side into San Francisco, with Ricciardo again nudging the wall. Behind them, Vanthoor left his braking far too late for Lisboa, and mounted over Chilton, which caused the teenage Briton to retire on the spot. Ricciardo's clip with the wall caused a left-rear puncture, but he managed to carry on up the hill, until he crashed {{at the entrance to the}} Solitude Esses. His car rebounded off the wall, and into direct line of the rest of the field. No less than half a dozen cars impacted with the stricken car, and blocked the track which ultimately led to a red flag, and a race suspension. Also taken out in the incident were the third Carlin of Hartley, the Premas of Coletti and Zampieri, the Fortecs of Rosenzweig and McKenzie, and Ho. Imperatori was also involved, returning to the pits for a lengthy period, but returned to complete three laps towards the end. Vanthoor, with a damaged front wheel after his collision with Chilton, stopped just short of the accident site, and was thus able to continue in the race.|$|E

25|$|The Phillies were 47–58, 15 {{games behind}} the first-place Nationals, and 10 games behind the second wild card after their {{series against the}} Nationals on August 2. The Phillies started the month by taking 2 of 3 from the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game 3 victory was huge for Ryan Howard, who had {{struggled}} since coming off his injury. After getting booed by striking out when the game was tied in the 8th inning {{with the bases loaded}}, Ryan Howard came through by hitting an RBI single with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to win the game and the series. The victory also put them out of last place in the NL East {{for the first time since}} June 27. The Phillies then took 1 of 3 from the Braves, a team that they got swept by in the past 2 series. In game 1 of the series, the Phillies saw their sellout streak end when the Phillies did not have a sell-out crowd. This ended their streak at 257 games, the third-longest sellout streak in MLB history. The Phillies then took 2 of 3 from the St. Louis Cardinals and came back from 3 runs down to win game 3 in extra innings. The Phillies then also took 2 of 3 from the Miami Marlins. The Phillies then split the series at 2–2 against the Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds. After their game 4 win against the Reds, the Phillies moved up to third place in the division for the first time since April 12. The Phillies then pulled off a three-game sweep of the Nationals, marking their second three-game sweep of the season. The Phillies would however take just 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. To finish the month, the Phillies would pull off a comeback win against the Braves in game 1 on August 31. The Phillies ended up taking 2 of 3 from that series. They could have swept the series, but the Phillies blew a 7–3 lead in the bottom of the 9th inning in game 3. The Phillies finished August by going 17-12, their best month of the season overall so far. However, Carlos Ruiz, who had been the star of the Phillies with his remarkable performance this season, had to sit out for 4–6 weeks because of a fractured knee that took a beating throughout the month. Ruiz was replaced by Erik Kratz due to catcher Brian Schneider also suffering an injury. This month also saw a huge improvement by Kyle Kendrick. After Charlie Manuel got really disappointed in <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> outing by Kyle in a 12-6 loss when he allowed 6 runs, he has been the hottest Phillies's pitcher since. Right away in his next outing, he shut the Miami Marlins out, allowing no runs. He did the same in his next outing against a normally strong Milwaukee Brewers offense. Although in his next outing Kyle allowed a 2-run home run against the Washington Nationals, Kendrick received his 3rd win in a row when the Phillies won 4-2. Kendrick picked up his fourth win in a row when the Phillies won 3-2 against the New York Mets.|$|E
