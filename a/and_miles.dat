The character has also appeared in various literature based on Smallville, an internet series, and was then later adapted back into the original Superman comics which inspired Smallville.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} in Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E

5|$|The 1500m <b>and</b> <b>mile</b> run {{events have}} {{historically}} been {{some of the most}} prestigious track and field events. Swedish rivals Gunder Hägg and Arne Andersson broke each other's 1500m <b>and</b> <b>mile</b> world records {{on a number of occasions}} in the 1940s. The prominence of the distances were maintained by Roger Bannister, who (in 1954) was the first to run the long-elusive four-minute <b>mile,</b> <b>and</b> Jim Ryun's exploits served to popularise interval training. Races between British rivals Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram characterised middle-distance running in the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, North Africans such as Noureddine Morceli of Algeria and Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco came to dominate the 1500 <b>and</b> <b>mile</b> events.|$|R

5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh marcher lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally {{on opposite sides of the}} succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Frank and {{the group}} reach the sub, and they take control of it. After betraying the Man in Black, Widmore's men attack, but they manage to submerge.

The {{explosion}} causes the submarine to sink, and Frank is knocked out after a door hits him. Frank revives and makes it {{to the surface of the}} water. He is found by Richard <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> as they head for Hydra Island to blow up the Ajira plane. Frank convinces them to steal the plane and let him fly it. After much repair work and picking up Kate, Claire, and Sawyer, the plane takes off and heads for home.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who in {{turn was}} the son of Walter de Lacy who died in 1085.

5|$|He {{spoke to}} Harold Howitt {{when he was}} {{thinking}} of leaving the BTC and was informed that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice would turn down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would be similar to the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|Heublein {{promoted}} Michael A. Miles to run {{the chain}} in 1977 <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> is credited with saving the ailing company by instituting its back-to-basics formula. Miles refurbished the stores, and introduced indoor seating and drive-thru windows. Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories and profit and loss statements, so that problems could be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business. Subsequent changes resulted in 30 months of consecutive per store sales increases by late 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 1940 Horrocks {{commanded}} a battalion during the Battle of France, {{the first time}} he served under Bernard Montgomery, the most prominent British commander of the war. Montgomery later identified Horrocks as one of his most able officers, appointing him to corps commands in both North Africa and Europe. In 1943, Horrocks was seriously wounded and took more than a year to recover before returning to command a corps in Europe. It is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion; his contemporary corps commanders in North Africa, Oliver Leese <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> Dempsey, went on to command at army level and above. Horrocks' wound caused continuing health problems and led to his early retirement from the army after the war.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941, No. 450 Squadron {{personnel}} were separated from No. 260 Squadron, when the latter received its own ground crew. No. 450 Squadron moved to Rayak airfield, Lebanon, {{where it was}} allocated Hurricanes <b>and</b> <b>Miles</b> Magister trainers. A batch of 20 trainee Australian, British and Canadian pilots—the majority being Australian—were posted to the squadron in early October, and it began duties as an Operational Training Unit. A fortnight later these pilots were posted out and, lacking trained pilots, the squadron's aircraft were re-allocated. On 20 October, the squadron moved to Burg El Arab, Egypt, and began operating as an advanced repair, salvage and service unit, {{taking part in the}} North African Campaign.|$|E
