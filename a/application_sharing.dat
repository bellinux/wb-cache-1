2500|$|Based on the ITU-T T.128 <b>application</b> <b>sharing</b> {{protocol}} (during draft {{also known}} as [...] "T.share") from the T.120 recommendation series, {{the first version of}} RDP (named version 4.0) was introduced by Microsoft with [...] "Terminal Services", as a part of their product Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition. The Terminal Services Edition of NT 4.0 relied on Citrix's MultiWin technology, previously provided as a part of Citrix WinFrame atop Windows NT 3.51, in order to support multiple users and login sessions simultaneously. Microsoft required Citrix to license their MultiWin technology to Microsoft in order to be allowed to continue offering their own terminal-services product, then named Citrix MetaFrame, atop Windows NT 4.0. The Citrix-provided DLLs included in Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Services Edition still carry a Citrix copyright rather than a Microsoft copyright. Later versions of Windows integrated the necessary support directly. The T.128 <b>application</b> <b>sharing</b> technology was acquired by Microsoft from UK software developer Data Connection Limited.|$|E
