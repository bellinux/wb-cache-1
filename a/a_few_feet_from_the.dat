5|$|Back at school, Skinner's {{dress code}} demoralizes the {{students}} until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color {{to be washed}} out, revealing tie-dye colors that make the playful spirit of the children return. At the bowling alley, before the championship game begins, Burns gives the team new shirts. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn. Otto tips over a vending machine and the vibrations help the Pin Pals win by knocking down the pins. As the team celebrates their win, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Cheered on by his teammates, Homer attempts {{to break into the}} mansion and recover the trophy; however, this ends disastrously when the hounds are released and catch Homer <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gate, mauling him severely.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners at Soledad State Prison in California, each hugging {{a visiting}} family member, with each couple {{standing}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> next, taken on Christmas 1971.|$|E
25|$|The coffin {{was then}} interred {{in the far}} western end of the Nave, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> entrance, in soil brought {{from each of the}} main battlefields, and covered with a silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of {{thousands}} of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of catharsis for collective mourning on a scale not previously known.|$|E

25|$|Belmont had {{disdain for}} the nouveau riche who, in splashy {{displays}} of wealth, built ostentatious mansions between Bellevue Avenue and the Atlantic coast. As a result, guests entered Belcourt through an entrance on Ledge Road, a short road which runs parallel to Bellevue Avenue. This entrance is <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> curb and the effect was that the back of Belcourt was turned to the nouveau riche on Bellevue Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Roan High Knob is {{the highest}} point on Roan Mountain, rising to 6,285feet (1,916m) between Carver's Gap and Tollhouse Gap. The Tennessee-North Carolina border crosses its summit. High Knob {{is the highest}} point in Tennessee outside of the Great Smoky Mountains, and the 17th-highest peak in the eastern United States. The Appalachian Trail crosses High Knob's western slope, with a well-marked spur trail leading to the summit. The Roan High Knob Shelter is <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> summit.|$|E
25|$|At first, the seven-core cables {{were carried}} inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated {{to the sight of}} {{telegraph}} wires against the sky line, {{across the top of the}} viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.|$|E

60|$|Next second {{there was}} a kind of scuffle <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> me, {{followed}} by a stifled yell, and I saw the shadow retreating in the direction from which it had come.|$|R
25|$|The attack {{turned into}} a disaster. A landing party of 38 seamen and marines from all three vessels, under Lieutenant Spearing, succeeded in {{capturing}} a lower battery with few losses and spiking six guns. An attack on the upper fort failed, with Spearing being killed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French ramparts. When the British withdrew to their boats the French captured them. In all, the British lost seven killed and 30 wounded, all the dead {{and most of the}} wounded being from Subtle. The French lost one man wounded.|$|E
25|$|The GAO {{report also}} {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which are just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building {{is too small to}} accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency has leased space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in multi-tenant buildings. The FBI admitted its internal security forces are not stationed at these leased spaces, but merely patrol them periodically.|$|E
25|$|Upon examination, the {{military}} surgeons determined that no one's neck {{had been broken}} by the fall. The manacles and cloth bindings were removed but not the white execution masks, and the bodies were placed into the pine coffins. The name of each person was written {{on a piece of}} paper by acting Assistant Adjutant R. A. Watts, and inserted in a glass vial, which was placed into the coffin. The coffins were buried against the prison wall in shallow graves, just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gallows. A white picket fence marked the burial site. The night that she died, a mob attacked the Surratt boarding house and began stripping it of souvenirs until the police stopped them.|$|E
50|$|Close to or in Sunnydale {{is an old}} quarry {{house built}} beside a deep lake, located <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cliff edge. In addition, there is a {{hydroelectric}} dam {{in the vicinity of}} Sunnydale.|$|R
60|$|I, too, crept {{nearer to}} it.--About a yard away {{there was a}} {{projection}} of the front. I stole into the deep corner and waited. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> me I knew that she too was waiting.|$|R
60|$|They {{came to a}} halt in {{the broad}} carpeted way only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> him. Lady Carey, in a {{wonderful}} green gown, her neck and bosom ablaze with jewels, seemed to be making her farewells.|$|R
25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E
25|$|Woods {{made his}} next {{appearance}} at the Dubai Desert Classic, an event he had previously won twice and always ended inside the top five, in six previous appearances. Woods, ranked #3 in the world, was grouped with #1 Lee Westwood and #2 Martin Kaymer {{for the first two}} rounds. Woods started with 71 and scored 6-under 66 in round two to move into contention, and stayed in the hunt with 72 for round three, but struggled on Sunday with 75, to end in a tie for 20th, at 4-under 284, seven shots back of winner Álvaro Quirós. During the final round of that competition, Woods spat on the ground <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hole, after missing a putt at the 12th green. The incident was shown on televised coverage worldwide. Woods apologized for the incident in which he breached the European Tour's code of conduct; he will be fined an undisclosed sum. Later starters had to play across the area where Woods spat. Sportswriter John Feinstein stated on Golf Channel {{a few days after the}} incident that Woods is in fact the most-fined player in the history of the PGA Tour.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} wave of raids across Northern Ireland, 342 people were arrested. Many of those arrested {{reported}} that they and their families were assaulted, verbally abused and threatened by the soldiers. There were claims of soldiers smashing their way into houses without warning and firing baton rounds through doors and windows. Many of those arrested also reported being ill-treated during their three-day detention at the holding centres. They complained of being beaten, verbally abused, threatened, harassed by dogs, denied sleep, and starved. Some reported being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-wielding soldiers, being forced to run an 'obstacle course', having their heads forcefully shaved, being kept naked, being burnt with cigarettes, having a sack placed over their heads for long periods, having a rope kept around their necks, having the barrel of a gun pressed against their heads, being dragged by the hair, being trailed behind armoured vehicles while barefoot, and being tied to armoured trucks as a human shield. Some were hooded, beaten and then thrown from a helicopter. They were told they were hundreds of feet in the air, but were actually only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
5000|$|A {{window was}} smashed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Tancredo. Two protesters held a sign reading [...] "No Dialogue with Hate" [...] {{in front of}} Tancredo's face. Tancredo was {{eventually}} escorted {{out of the room}} by the police.|$|R
50|$|Patrick Garrett {{killed the}} outlaw Billy the Kid at Maxwell's Fort Sumner home in 1881, {{which was then}} owned by Pete Maxwell, son of Lucien Maxwell. Billy was later buried <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Lucien Maxwell in Fort Sumner, New Mexico.|$|R
50|$|After his death, {{a stained}} glass window {{was given by}} the people of Liberton Kirk, and stands only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> where he always sat in the East Gallery. To date, this is the only stained glass window in the church.|$|R
25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured ignition system was contained in a weather-proof box buried <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the ignition system only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance {{was provided by the}} Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the ignition system. An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E
500|$|As the 4th Light Horse Regiment {{approached}} the fortifications {{directly in front}} of them, their leading squadron jumped the advance trenches at the gallop and the main , [...] trenches, defended by Ottoman soldiers. The leading squadron then dismounted in an area of tents and dugouts in the rear, where they were joined by a troop of the 12th Light Horse Regiment. While the led horses were galloped to cover, the troopers launched a dismounted attack on the trenches and dugouts, killing between 30 and 40, before the remainder surrendered. The defenders [...] "fought grimly, and a considerable number were killed", while four Gallipoli veterans were shot dead as they dismounted <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman trenches.|$|E
500|$|When Taft entered office, Mexico was {{increasingly}} restless under {{the grip of}} longtime dictator Porfirio Díaz. Many Mexicans backed his opponent, Francisco Madero. There {{were a number of}} incidents in which Mexican rebels crossed the U.S. border to obtain horses and weapons; Taft sought to prevent this by ordering the US Army to the border areas for maneuvers. Taft told his military aide, Archibald Butt, that [...] "I am going to sit on the lid and it will take a great deal to pry me off". He showed his support for Díaz by meeting with him at El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, the first meeting between a U.S. and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president visited Mexico. The day of the summit, Frederick Russell Burnham and a Texas Ranger captured and disarmed an assassin holding a palm pistol only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two presidents. Before the election in Mexico, Díaz jailed opposition candidate Madero, whose supporters took up arms. This resulted in both the ousting of Díaz and a revolution that would continue for another ten years. In the U.S.'s Arizona Territory, two citizens were killed and almost a dozen injured, some as a result of gunfire across the border. Taft was against an aggressive response and so instructed the territorial governor.|$|E
50|$|Margaret died in 1878 {{just before}} the chapel was complete. The first {{ceremony}} held in the yet unfinished chapel was Margaret's funeral service. In 1880, the church was moved to its current location, only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> where Lewis and Margaret are buried.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War, Constable {{served in}} the Sherwood Foresters for two years, but he {{suffered}} severe shell shock when a shell exploded in <b>a</b> trench <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> him, burying him alive. He then spent a long period {{in a nursing home}} while recovering.|$|R
50|$|MacDonald {{pulled a}} similar prank later during the 1960 presidential {{campaign}} when John F. Kennedy was the featured speaker {{at a rally}} at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. MacDonald faked his way onto the stage where the youthful prankster was seated <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> JFK.|$|R
2500|$|A famous {{feature is}} the {{naturally}} formed [...] "Armchair" [...] (now sometimes called [...] "Devil's Pool"), {{near the edge of}} the falls on Livingstone Island on the Zambian side. When the river flow is at a certain level, usually between September and December, a rock barrier forms an eddy with minimal current, allowing adventurous swimmers to splash around in relative safety <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point where the water cascades over the falls. Occasional deaths have been reported when people have slipped over the rock barrier.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{not until}} February 1831 that the Geological Society of London conferred on Smith the first Wollaston Medal in {{recognition}} of his achievement. It was on this occasion that the President, Adam Sedgwick, referred to Smith as [...] "the Father of English Geology". Smith travelled to Dublin with the British Association in 1835, and there unexpectedly received an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LL.D.) from Trinity College. In 1838 he was appointed {{as one of the}} commissioners to select building-stone for the new Palace of Westminster. He died in Northampton, and is buried <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west tower of St Peter's Church, Marefair. The inscription on the grave is badly worn but the name [...] "William Smith" [...] can just be seen.|$|E
2500|$|After the battle, {{with many}} {{wounded in the}} retreat, McClary {{immediately}} procured a horse and rode five miles north to Medford and returned with bandages and other supplies for the wounded. He then prepared to go back across Charlestown Neck to observe any further British movement at Bunker Hill. He was cautioned by his son and other men not to embark on such a risky effort, but McClary exclaimed, [...] "The ball is not yet cast that will kill me!". Upon returning while crossing the Neck to rejoin his men, a shot from a frigate passed through his body. [...] He leaped <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground, keeled over and fell dead on his face. Later McClary would be carried to Medford, and interred with military honors.|$|E
50|$|The town lies on National Route 9, 340 {{kilometres}} {{northeast of}} the capital, Montevideo, and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> Brazil's Route BR 471.

60|$|Next {{to obtain}} was a stock of ammunition,—an easy matter, though I had {{to enter the}} {{steerage}} companion-way to do it. Here the hunters stored the ammunition-boxes they carried in the boats, and here, but <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>feet</b> <b>from</b> their noisy revels, I took possession of two boxes.|$|R
