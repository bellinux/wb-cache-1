5|$|At 2:00a.m. on 30 July, the Pashtuns {{launched}} another attack, {{during which}} Costello, and the Pashtun Mullah, were both wounded; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent. That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet {{charge of the}} 45th Sikhs. The following morning, on 31 July, {{the remainder of the}} 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid, bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291,600 rounds of ammunition. But with their <b>attention</b> <b>now</b> drawn towards the nearby British outpost of Chakdara, attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether. Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded, seven sepoy officers wounded, and 153 non-commissioned officers killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South.|$|E

25|$|In 1578, Abbas' father became Shah of Iran. Abbas' mother {{soon came}} to {{dominate}} the government, but she had little time for Abbas, preferring to promote the interests of his elder brother Hamza. The queen consort antagonised leaders of the powerful Qizilbash army, who plotted against her and murdered her on 26 July 1579, reportedly for {{having an affair with}} Adil Giray, brother of the Crimean Tatar khan who was held captive in Qazvin. Mohammad was a weak sovereign, incapable of preventing Iran's main rivals, the Ottoman Empire, but also the Uzbeks, from invading the country or stopping factional feuding among the Qizilbash. The young prince, Hamza, was more promising and led a campaign against the Ottomans, but he was murdered suspiciously in 1586. <b>Attention</b> <b>now</b> turned to Abbas.|$|E
25|$|Singh's <b>attention</b> <b>now</b> {{turned to}} his trial, where he was to face a Crown {{prosecution}} team comprising C. H. Carden-Noad, Kalandar Ali Khan, Jai Gopal Lal, and the prosecuting inspector, Bakshi Dina Nath. The defence was composed of eight lawyers. Prem Dutt Verma, the youngest amongst the 27 accused, threw his slipper at Gopal when he turned and became a prosecution witness in court. As a result, the magistrate ordered that all the accused should be handcuffed. Singh and others refused to be handcuffed and were subjected to brutal beating. The revolutionaries refused to attend the court and Singh {{wrote a letter to}} the magistrate citing various reasons for their refusal. The magistrate ordered the trial to proceed without the accused or members of the HSRA. This was a setback for Singh as he could no longer use the trial as a forum to publicise his views.|$|E
500|$|By {{this stage}} of the battle, Scharnhorst had a slight list to port and was about a meter lower in the water. Her third funnel had been shot away. Gneisenau was briefly {{obscured}} by smoke, which led both battlecruisers to target Scharnhorst. By 16:00, Spee ordered Gneisenau to attempt to escape while he reversed course and attempted to launch torpedoes at his pursuers. The port list had increased significantly by this point and she was well down by the bow, with only [...] of freeboard. At 16:17, the ship finally capsized to port and sank; the British, their <b>attention</b> <b>now</b> focused on Gneisenau, made no attempt to rescue the crew. All 860 officers and men on board, including Spee, went down with the ship. Gneisenau, Leipzig, and Nürnberg were also sunk. Only Dresden managed to escape, but she was eventually tracked to the Juan Fernandez Islands and sunk. The complete destruction of the squadron killed about 2,200 German sailors and officers, including two of Spee's sons.|$|E

On 1December, Godwin-Austen {{was concerned about the}} exposed British position at Ed Duda, as were the staff of 70th Division, who believed the area had become untenable. Infantry had reinforced the captured ground, the 14th Infantry Brigade holding a line from Ed Duda to roughly [...] to the north-east. The Essex were still dug in at Ed Duda, with the 19th New Zealand Battalion to their north-east, then the 4th Border Regiment, the 18th New Zealand Battalion to their east and the 1st Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment to their north at Bir (Magen) Belhamed and the captured Axis strong point known as [...] "Leopard". The commanding officer of the 1st Essex reported that the position was well prepared and he was confident of repelling any assault. Scobie sent word stating [...] "Well done, I admire your spirit".|$|E
500|$|Expansion {{abruptly}} {{stopped in}} the 1910s and {{was followed by a}} period of population decline, {{due in large part to}} Spokane's slowing economy. Control of regional mines and resources became increasingly dominated by national corporations rather than local people and organizations, diverting capital outside of Spokane and decreasing growth and investment opportunities in the city. During this time of stagnation, unrest was prevalent among the area's unemployed, who became victimized by [...] "job sharks", who charged a fee for signing up workers in the logging camps. Job sharks and employment agencies were known to cheat itinerant workers, sometimes paying bribes to periodically fire entire work crews, thus generating repetitive fees for themselves. Crime spiked in the 1890s and 1900s, with eruptions of violent activity involving unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), or [...] "Wobblies" [...] as they were often known, whose free speech fights had begun to garner national <b>attention.</b> <b>Now,</b> with grievances concerning the unethical practices of the employment agencies, they initiated a free speech fight in September 1908 by purposely breaking a city ordinance on soapboxing. With IWW encouragement, union members from many western states came to Spokane to take part in what had become a publicity stunt. Many Wobblies were incarcerated, including feminist labor leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, who published her account in the local Industrial Worker.|$|E
500|$|In the lead-up to {{the match}} against Worcestershire, photographers and cameramen {{constantly}} followed Lindwall, {{trying to capture}} visual evidence of an illegal drag when he was bowling in the practice nets. Bradman {{tried to stop the}} [...] journalists from taking photographs of the crease as Lindwall came in to bowl, and deflected media questions about his bowler's drag. The spectators and media were keenly observing the position of his foot in the tour opener, but Lindwall was not no-balled in the first match at Worcester, and complaints about his drag faded away {{for the rest of the}} tour. The hosts elected to bat first, and Lindwall took 2/41 in the first innings, bowling and trapping his victims leg before wicket before delivering three wicketless overs for 19 runs in the second innings. Lindwall took a wicket with his second ball in England, trapping Don Kenyon for a duck to leave the hosts at 1/0. He was promoted to No. 4 as Bradman rotated his batting order and he scored a quickfire 32 from 34 balls with six boundaries before Australia completed an innings victory. According to former Australian Test batsman and journalist Jack Fingleton, Lindwall [...] "took things very quietly...The fast bowler is very wise who builds up his speed match by match". With the media and public <b>attention</b> <b>now</b> focused on actual bowling, Lindwall's classical bowling action evoked almost as much interest as his captain's batting.|$|E

2500|$|By late May 1941, the Clark {{opposition}} {{group had}} successfully organized {{in advance of}} municipal elections and replaced all township leaders responsible for bringing the Winfield Park project to Clark. <b>Attention</b> <b>now</b> turned to stopping the mutual housing project, or at least transferring most of its costs and impact to someone else. [...] Opposition leaders carefully studied the publicity surrounding the earlier construction of the Audubon Park Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Project just outside Camden, New Jersey. [...] The community in that case had followed an unsuccessful strategy of attempting to stop the project with building codes and local ordinances. [...] All of these attempted blocks to construction were overturned by courts sympathetic to the powers given to the [...] by the Lanham Act. [...] The Clark opposition developed a new and innovative opposition strategy. [...] They would attempt to have the entire Winfield Park Mutual Housing project declared as a separate municipality by the New Jersey State Legislature. [...] As a separate municipality all costs for public services and facilities would be {{the responsibility of the}} residents of Winfield Park, and not the residents of Clark. [...] With Winfield Park Township established as a separate municipality, opponents believed the project would be killed because the federal government and potential residents would shy away from the overwhelming expenses and confusing legalities of this new governmental structure. Immediately Westbrook and other project supporters reacted to this strategy by declaring that the opposition was attempting the sabotage the entire national defense program. [...] In defiance, Westbrook declared that he was sure the project would not only survive this attack, but would actually outlive its surrounding communities.|$|E

2500|$|This {{document}} format has been revised in 2010 {{to include an}} easy to assimilate format for the reader. [...] The problem with the earlier format often reported to RICS by clients in receipt of the previous 'Homebuyer's Survey and Valuation' was that the structure did not easily distinguish the faults from the main description.
