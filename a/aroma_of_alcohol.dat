Once this process is done the wort is first distilled on a 1000-liter pot still and afterwards on a 600-liter pot still. Following the double-destillation the new spirit is ready. The alcohol percent is no between 68 and 69 and is diluted to 63.5 percent before it is put on oak casks where it matures {{for a minimum of}} 3 years before it is finally bottled as whisky. When new whisky is distilled, it is a colorless liquid and has only taste and <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> and grain. It is from aging in charred oak barrels the whisky gets its color, complexity and flavor.|$|E
50|$|Zivania or zivana (ζιβανία, ζιβάνα) is a Cypriot pomace brandy {{produced}} from {{a mixture of}} grape pomace and local dry wines made from Xynisteri and Mavro grapes.Zivania stills {{are similar to those}} used for tsikoudia in Crete. Zivania is colorless and alcoholic with a light <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> raisins. Its <b>alcohol</b> content varies, with 45% by volume being the typical value. Zivania contains no sugars and has no acidity.|$|R
50|$|Cider {{is said to}} {{be light}} when it {{contains}} 7% <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> or less, strong when it contains 7% to 13%, and apéritif when between 13% to 20%. Flavoured cider, perfumed with <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> berries, honey or maple, generally contains less than 10% alcohol.|$|R

50|$|Isoprenoid monoterpens {{are present}} in grape, above all acyclic linalool, geraniol, nerol, citronellol, homotrienol and {{monocyclic}} α-terpineol, mostly occurring as glycosides. Carotenoids accumulate in ripening grape berries. Oxidation of carotenoids produces volatile fragments, C13-norisoprenoids. These are strongly odoriferous compounds, such as β-ionone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> viola), damascenone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> exotic fruits), β-damascone (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> rose) and β-ionol (<b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> flowers and fruits). Tetrahydro-β-carbolines are indole alkaloids occurring in grape to a low amount and contributing to its antioxidant power. Melatonin, an alkaloid, has been identified in grape.|$|R
50|$|Anise-flavored tsipouro is also available, {{produced}} {{especially in}} Macedonia and Thessaly. Anise-flavored tsipouro and ouzo have almost identical taste but vary enormously in their method <b>of</b> production. The <b>alcohol</b> {{used to produce}} ouzo is 96% ABV ethyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>of</b> agricultural origin (rectified spirit obtained from agricultural products) and therefore does not retain the flavours of the primary distilled products, whereas the lower degree of distillation of tsipouro allows it to retain the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the pomace.|$|R
50|$|In the {{alcoholic}} beverages industry, congeners are substances, {{other than the}} desired type <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> ethanol, produced during fermentation. These substances include small amounts of chemicals such as methanol and other alcohols (known as fusel alcohols), acetone, acetaldehyde, esters, tannins, and aldehydes (e.g. furfural). Congeners are {{responsible for most of}} the taste and <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> distilled alcoholic beverages, and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks. It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a hangover. Congeners are also used by forensic toxicologists to determine what a person drank in a sub-discipline called alcohol congener analysis.|$|R
50|$|The <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> {{the leaves}} can be {{described}} as a pungent combination <b>of</b> the <b>aromas</b> <b>of</b> oregano, thyme and turpentine. The taste of the leaves is described as being similar to the one of oregano but with a sharp mintlike pepperiness.|$|R
40|$|Esters are {{important}} {{contributors to the}} <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> numerous flowers and fruits. Acetate esters such as geranyl acetate, phenylethyl acetate and benzyl acetate are generated {{as a result of}} the action <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> acetyltransferases (AATs). Numerous homologous AATs from various plants have been characterized using in-vitro assays. To study the function <b>of</b> rose <b>alcohol</b> acetyltransferase (RhAAT) in planta, we generated transgenic petunia plants expressing the rose gene under the control of a CaMV- 35 S promoter. Although the preferred substrate of RhAAT in vitro is geraniol, in transgenic petunia flowers, it used phenylethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol to produce the corresponding acetate esters, not generated by control flowers. The level <b>of</b> benzyl <b>alcohol</b> emitted by the flowers of different transgenic lines was ca. three times higher than that <b>of</b> phenylethyl <b>alcohol,</b> which corresponded to the ratio between the respective products, i. e. ca. three times more benzyl acetate than phenylethyl acetate. Feeding of transgenic petunia tissues with geraniol or octanol led to the production of their respective acetates, suggesting the dependence of volatile production on substrate availability...|$|R
40|$|A {{validated}} {{method for}} identification and quantification of volatile compounds in wine was developed using liquid-liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (Ivanova et al., 2012 a, 2012 b). Dichloromethane {{was used as}} an extraction solvent, with good repeatability and reproducibility (RSD < 10 %). The correlation coefficients (R 2) ranged from 0. 9951 to 0. 9992, showing linear calibration curves of the used reference compounds (2 -phenyl ethanol, ethyl nonanoate, butyrolactone and tyrosol). The developed method was applied for characterization of the volatile components making the <b>aroma</b> profile <b>of</b> the Kékfrankos red wines produced from the grape variety grown in the Villány wine region in Hungary. Compounds determined in the wines belonged to the group <b>of</b> <b>alcohols,</b> esters, lactones, fatty acids, furans and nitrogen compounds, the first two groups being the dominant ones influencing the main <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wine. Overall, Kékfrankos wines presented higher content <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> compared to other wines, such as Cabernet Sauvignon wines from Changli County (China) and Tempranillo wines, but lower amount compared to Albarello and Brancellao wines as well as, from the varieties Ribolla Gialla and Malvasia Istriana.

40|$|Strawberry {{is one of}} {{the most}} valued fruit worldwide. Modern {{cultivated}} varieties (Fragaria × ananassa) exhibit large fruits, with intense color and prolonged shell life. Yet, these valuable traits were attained at the cost of the intensity and the variety <b>of</b> the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the berry, two characteristics highly appreciated by consumers. Wild species display smaller fruits and reduced yield compared with cultivated varieties but they accumulate broader and augmented blends of volatile compounds. Because of the large diversity and strength <b>of</b> <b>aromas</b> occurring in natural and domesticated populations, plant breeders regard wild strawberries as important donors of novel scented molecules. Here we report a comprehensive metabolic map <b>of</b> the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the wild strawberry Profumata di Tortona (PdT), an ancient clone of F. moschata, considered as one of the most fragrant strawberry types of all. Comparison with the more renowned woodland strawberry Regina delle Valli (RdV), an aromatic cultivar of F. vesca, revealed a significant enrichment in the total level <b>of</b> esters, <b>alcohols</b> and furanones and a reduction in the content of ketones in in the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> PdT berries. Among esters, particularly relevant was the enhanced accumulation of methyl anthranilate, responsible for the intensive sweetish impression of wild strawberries. Interestingly, increased ester accumulation in PdT fruits correlated with enhanced expression <b>of</b> the Strawberry <b>Alcohol</b> Acyltransferase (SAAT) gene, a key regulator of flavor biogenesis in ripening berries. We also detected a remarkable 900 -fold increase in the level of mesifurane, the furanone conferring the typical caramel notes to most wild species...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Honeybush (Cyclopia spp.) is {{indigenous}} to South Africa {{and consists of}} more than 20 species of which only a few are {{used to make a}} herbal tea with a unique aroma and sweet taste. The <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unfermented and fermented honeybush tea differs considerably, indicating that changes take place in the chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>aroma</b> during the fermentation process. Using a sample enrichment probe (SEP) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unfermented and fermented C. genistoides, was analyzed and the resulting aroma profiles were compared. A total of 74 compounds were identified in the unfermented honeybush aroma, comprising, inter alia, a large number of saturated and unsaturated alcohols, aldehydes and methyl ketones that were found to be either absent, or present in lower relative concentrations, in the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> fermented honeybush. Most of these compounds, including 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, identified as one of the major constituents of unfermented honeybush, are probably responsible for its grassy, hay-like aroma. In the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> fermented honeybush 70 compounds were identified, of which 36 were found to be terpenoids. These compounds are probably responsible for the pleasant sweet <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the fermented honeybush. For instance, the major aroma constituent in the fermented honeybush, α-terpineol, is known to have a delicately floral and sweet odour. Other terpenoids occuring in significant quantities in the fermented honeybush, are linalool, cis and trans linalool oxide, nerol, geraniol, 2, 6 -dimethyl- 1, 7 -octadien- 3, 6 -diol, hexahydrofarnecyl acetone and phytol. These terpenoids are known to have sweet, sweet-woody en floral odours that probably contribute to the overall sweet <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the fermented honeybush. In the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the unfermented honeybush a total of 25 terpenoids was identified, of which geranyl acetone, β-ionone, and dihydroactinidiolide are the most significant, since they are present in higher relative concentrations compared to the same terpenoids in the fermented honeybush. These three terpenoids have overall woody and even slightly green odours which contribute to the typical <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> the unfermented honeybush. The terpenoids present in the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unfermented and fermented honeybush belong to the following compound classes: • Terpenes • Terpene alcohols • Terpene aldehydes • Ketoterpenes • Terpene ethers • Terpene lactones Apart from the terpenoids present in the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unfermented and fermented honeybush, the following classes of compounds are also present: • Aliphatic hydrocarbons (saturated) • Aliphatic alcohols (saturated and unsaturated) • Phenols • Aliphatic aldehydes (saturated and unsaturated) • Aliphatic ketones (saturated and unsaturated) • Aliphatic carboxylic acids (saturated) • Esters (methyl esters, ethyl and higher esters and aromatic esters) • Furane compounds • Lactones The present research was done to compare the chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>aroma</b> <b>of</b> unfermented and fermented honeybush of one particular species, namely C. genistoides, to obtain an understanding of the evolution and/or disappearance of volatile compounds during fermentation that ultimately could help to identify compounds or compound types and their precursors responsible for its unique sweet aroma...|$|R
