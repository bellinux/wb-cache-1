Despite this artificial boost, the pace of growth has slowed since 2011. Moreover, in terms of publications per capita, the country trails both the more dynamic emerging market economies and advanced economies, even if it is ahead of most of its neighbours.

But even if she's not being totally honest here, it's still more so than many of her pop peers." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media criticized the songs she perceived were tailor-made for Top 40 radio, calling them [...] "unremarkable" [...] saying they [...] "fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits". But she praised [...] "the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both.

[...] In a mixed review, Theon Weber of Spin commented, [...] "n creating a schism between her punkish pep and her new-wave nostalgia, it leaves the former stranded and the latter generic."
