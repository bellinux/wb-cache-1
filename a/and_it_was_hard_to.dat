5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 turret was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no turret ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> rotate the turret manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 turret. The turret was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 turret.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> break them down, but hard work pays off in the end." ...|$|E

[...] A wire service account of the game noted, [...] "Both played crafty football, the fumbling that tended to mar the game being more than offset by swift, dashing interception of passes while {{the work of the}} linesmen on both sides was at top form." [...] The Michigan Alumnus summarized the game thus: [...] "Never surely was a game more lacking in spectacular features and thrills.

[...] The game featured few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan made only three substitutions, and Vanderbilt not a one. Michigan completed 5 out of 16 passes for 90 yards. Vanderbilt completed just 1 of 5 for a 9-yard gain. A diagram of the game says this one pass was from Kuhn to Bomar.|$|E

Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks as carefully as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar."

Hoddle stated in interviews that he wanted McManaman to take up the licence to be the bridge between David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne, and often spoke highly of McManaman's ability, but noted that McManaman's best position was [...] "floating" [...] dangerously <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> fit him into a system to suit the team and so he often selected Paul Merson and the rising Beckham instead. When McManaman (and Fowler) opted out of Le Tournoi in 1997 to choose to undergo non-urgent medical operations ahead of international duty, it was noted that this reportedly lost them their team spots as Hoddle though angered at losing them, found a winning team in their absence, and this made it even harder for McManaman to regain his place later. McManaman made a total of four appearances under Hoddle, and only one appearance at the 1998 World Cup against Colombia, as a substitute for Paul Scholes.|$|E
