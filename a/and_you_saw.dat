25|$|It {{gave you}} {{some sense of}} {{perspective}} of past, present and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States {{and put it on}} another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul, it opened my mind.|$|E
500|$|At age 25, Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} triple world champion of the sport, six years younger than Ayrton Senna had been in 1991. On drawing level with Senna, Vettel commented: [...] "To win that third title here, where one of my greatest idols, Ayrton Senna, was from, {{it is very difficult}} to imagine I join him and other great names by winning three successive titles". Red Bull's team principal Christian Horner praised his driver, saying [...] "Sebastian has driven better than ever this season and has fought his way back into this championship, he's never given up <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> that in today's race".|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you might be a bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the way he has developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E

2500|$|McCartney remembered of the song's composition, [...] "We did {{the whole}} thing like an Alice In Wonderland idea, being in a boat on the river... Every so often it broke off <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> Lucy in the sky with {{diamonds}} all over the sky. This Lucy was God, the Big Figure, the White Rabbit." [...] He later recalled helping Lennon finish the song at Lennon's Kenwood home, specifically claiming he contributed the [...] "newspaper taxis" [...] and [...] "cellophane flowers" [...] lyrics; Lennon's 1968 interview with Rolling Stone magazine confirmed McCartney's contribution.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{guided tours}} {{in the cave}} were in 1894 run by the Lynches. They lasted 8 hours and were by candle or lantern. Visitors climbed through the sink hole on a [...] ladder down {{to the top of}} the pile. Then you were {{instructed}} to slide down the pile to the bottom. You received a candle to guide your way. The tours included the Egyptian Room (now the Shoe Room), the Lakes Passage, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> formations such as the Great White Throne (now the Liberty Bell), and the Spring Room Sentinel (now just the Sentinel). After the Hershends started tours in 1950, they removed the wooden stairs, and added concrete stairs and paths through the cave. Current tours last for about an hour, and are limited to 60 people.|$|E

6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, bending even {{a little}} further toward the woman, who was leaning forward now from her chair, as though eager or {{compelled}} to hear {{what was being said}} to her. [...] "A month--six weeks--some time ago, you were with Henry Rochester, a few minutes after his accident. He was shot--or he shot himself. He was shot by design or by misadventure. You were the first to find him. You came round the corner of the wood, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> him there, lying upon the grass. You heard a shot just before--two shots.
