5|$|Before {{the opening}} of Melbourne <b>Airport,</b> Melbourne's main <b>airport</b> was Essendon <b>Airport</b> which was officially {{designated}} an international <b>airport</b> in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon <b>Airport</b> and the limitations of Essendon <b>Airport</b> were beginning to become apparent. Essendon Airport's facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle the then new jet airliners and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers, by the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. Due to the encroachment of the urban boundary, the <b>airport</b> had become surrounded by residential housing, meaning that expansion of Essendon <b>Airport</b> was not possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Volcanic {{activity}} has caused significant hazards to numerous <b>airports</b> world-wide, with local to far-ranging effects on travelers and commerce. Analysis {{of a new}} compilation of incidents of <b>airports</b> impacted by volcanic activity from 1944 through 2006 reveals that, at a minimum, 101 <b>airports</b> in 28 countries were affected on 171 occasions by eruptions at 46 volcanoes. Since 1980, five <b>airports</b> per year on average {{have been affected by}} volcanic activity, which indicates that volcanic hazards to <b>airports</b> are not rare on a worldwide basis. The main hazard to <b>airports</b> is ashfall, with accumulations of only a few millimeters sufficient to force temporary closures of some <b>airports.</b> A substantial portion of incidents has been caused by ash in airspace in the vicinity of <b>airports,</b> without accumu-lation of ash on the ground. On a few occasions, <b>airports</b> have been impacted by hazards other than ash (pyroclastic flow, lava flow, gas emission, and phreatic explosion).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{efficiency}} of Italian <b>airports</b> applying a DEA model to 34 <b>airports.</b> We find that large <b>airports</b> are more efficient than domestic and regional ones, i. e. small <b>airports</b> have spare capacity since they are more distant from the frontier than large <b>airports.</b> The Tobit regression on the estimated DEA scores shows that efficiency is positively related with the hub premium and with privatisation. Hence we suggest that privatisation incentives to invest in large <b>airports</b> (close to saturation) and development plans to improve the small <b>airports</b> may form the benchmarks of Italian short-run air transportation policy. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{efficiency}} of European <b>airports</b> by applying a DEA model to 57 <b>airports.</b> The sample covers 95 % of all the <b>airports</b> with a traffic of at least 5 millions passengers (yearly). We find that largest <b>airports</b> (with more than 10 millions passengers) are more efficient, while <b>airports</b> classified by the European Commission as national have spare capacity and should improve their performances. Largest <b>airports</b> have decreasing returns to scale, while national ones will get a reduction in their average costs if they increase their size of operation. Moreover we investigated the determinants of the estimated efficiency scores. The Tobit regression shows that efficiency is positively related with <b>airport’s</b> connectivity index in the European network (i. e. <b>airports</b> with better connections at the network are more efficient) and with the intensity of competition between <b>airports</b> (i. e. <b>airports</b> with nearby competitors on several destinations {{tend to be more}} efficient). These results imply that policy makers (in regulating airports’ fares and subsidizing development plans) and managers (in evaluating their assets utilization) should take into account that a well connected destinations map and the presence of indirect competition coming from other <b>airports</b> can improve the performances in the management of European <b>airports.</b> air trasportation, efficiency, connectivy, airports’ competition...|$|R
