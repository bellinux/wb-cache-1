An <b>apparent</b> <b>slope,</b> however steep, so that it does not overpass the vertical, may be a horizontal line; but the moment it can be shown literally to overhang, it must be one of two things,--either an actually pendant face of rock, as at a, Fig. 77, or the under edge of an overhanging cornice of rock, b. Of course the latter condition, on such a scale as this of the Matterhorn, would be the more wonderful of the two; but I was anxious to determine which of these it really was.|$|E

30|$|Given {{the above}} conclusions, {{the reason for}} the {{superior}} performance of the Type B model (Equation  3) becomes <b>apparent.</b> The <b>slope</b> (a) parameter of this model is a function of elevation and latitude which, in combination, account for temperature. A change in SI with latitude and elevation remaining constant would represent a change in productivity resulting from a site variable other than temperature. This situation produces behaviour similar to that of an anamorphic family of curves (Figure  2 c). However, if the change in SI is caused by temperature (associated with a corresponding alteration in elevation and/or latitude), the resultant behaviour is closer to that of a common-asymptote than an anamorphic family of curves. This can be seen by comparing the model behaviour for two hypothetical sites at latitude 400 S, one a warm, lower elevation site with high SI, and the other a cool, elevated site with low SI (Figure  2 d).|$|R

40|$|The spirit-levelling–based British {{vertical}} datum (Ordnance Datum Newlyn) implies a south–north <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> in {{mean sea level}} of up to 53 [*]mm deg– 1 latitude, due to the datum falling on heading northwards. Although this <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> has been investigated since the 1960 s, explanations of its origin have remained inconclusive. It has also been suggested that, rather than a slope, the British {{vertical datum}} includes a step of about 240 [*]mm affecting all sites north of about 53 °N. In either case, the British vertical datum may be of limited use for any study requiring accurate heights or changes in heights, such as testing geoid models, groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction, the calibration and validation of satellite-based digital terrain models, and the unification of vertical datums internationally. Within the last decade, however, based on an apparent reduction in the slope to only − 12 [*]mm deg– 1 latitude with respect to recent geoid models, it has been claimed that the British vertical datum does provide a physically meaningful surface for use in scientific applications. In this paper, we reinvestigate the presence of apparent south–north sea slopes around Britain and reported slopes in the vertical datum, using the EGM 2008 global gravitational model, together with mean sea level and GPS data from British tide gauges, GPS ellipsoidal heights of 178 fundamental benchmarks across mainland Britain, and vertical deflection observations at 192 stations. We demonstrate a south–north slope in the British vertical datum of −(20 – 25) [*]mm deg– 1 latitude with respect to both mean sea level (corrected for the ocean's mean dynamic topography and the inverse barometer response to atmospheric pressure loading) and the EGM 2008 quasigeoid model, while EGM 2008 is shown to exhibit a negligible slope of (2 ± 4) [*]mm deg– 1 with respect to mean sea level. It is clear, therefore, that the slope can only arise from systematic errors in the levelling, although {{we are unable to}} isolate their exact origin. Using an offset detection method based on a penalized likelihood maximization using the Schwarz Information Criterion, we do not detect a step in the vertical datum affecting all sites north of 53 °N, but do identify regional distortions that we attribute to the inhomogeneity in both the levelling data used and the least squares adjustment procedures used to realize the datum.

Subjects with severe chronic renal failure (CRF) have higher plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP) than normal subjects, and some develop severe thirst. Eight patients with CRF and seven matched controls underwent hypertonic saline infusion to explore the relationship of thirst and plasma AVP with plasma osmolality. Differences in urea concentration {{between the two groups}} were controlled for by correcting measured osmolality to a urea of zero. Linear regression analysis of the relationships between plasma AVP and thirst with plasma osmolality (corrected for urea) was performed.

The open time histogram was reasonably well expressed {{by a single}} exponential function with a time constant, which was about 1 msec and almost voltage-independent {{in the range of}} membrane potential studied (- 20 to + 40 mV).

The tentative conclusion is that the channel enters the activated state with voltage-dependent and relatively slow kinetics, and then flickers between open and closed states with substantially faster and relatively voltage-independent kinetics.

40|$|The Author(s) 2013. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> of a hill, termed geographical slant perception, is overestimated in explicit awareness. Proffitt (2006) argued that overestimation allows individuals {{to manage their}} locomotor resources. Increasing age, fatigue, and wearing a heavy back pack will reduce the available resources and result in steeper reports for a particular hill. In contrast, Durgin and colleagues have proposed an alternative explanation for these effects based on experimental design— particularly, the potential effects of experimental demand. Proffitt’s resource-based model would predict that pedes-trians with reduced resources should avoid climbing a hill that would further deplete their resources if the opportunity arose. Within the built environment, stairs are the man-made equivalent of relatively steep hills (20 °– 30 °). In many public access settings, pedestrians can avoid climbing the stairs by opting for an adjacent escalator. Observations of pedestrian behavior in shopping malls reveal that 94. 5 % do so. This article summarizes the effects of demographic grouping on avoidance of stairs in public health research. Observations in shopping malls (n = 355, 069) and travel contexts (n = 711, 867) provide data consistent with Proffitt’s resource model. Women, the old, and those carrying excess body weight or large bags avoid the stairs more than do their comparison groups. Discussion focuses on differences in physiology that may underlie avoidance of stair climbing in order to highlight the pedestrian behavior that psychology needs to explain...|$|E
40|$|In {{classical}} {{theories of}} radiobiological action, cell killing {{is viewed as}} an inevitable consequence of the accumulation of some given number of physical "hits" in sensitive, intracellular targets. Shoulders on survival curves are attributed {{to the need for}} more than one hit to produce the observed effect, and to the random distribution of these hits among the cells in an irradiated population. Such curves start with zero slope at very low doses, and, at high doses, they approach, asymptotically, exponential slopes that are inversely proportional to the dose required for one hit, or to inactivate a single target. Unfortunately, these simple ideas provide no credible explanation for the dramatic changes in <b>apparent</b> final <b>slope,</b> and the total abolition of shoulders, that are observed in many radiation-sensitive mutants. The damage-repair hypothesis asserts that the surviving fraction of cells in a mutagen-treated population is proportional to the number of potentially lethal lesions that are not removed by any repair process. Evidence indicates that these repairable lesions are located in DNA; however, this fact is irrelevant to the mathematical development of dose-response equations under the damage-repair hypothesis. The survival curves for repair-proficient cells generally exhibit a shoulder which reflects a decline in the efficiency of repair with increasing dose.

The sample includes 10 nearby spiral galaxies, in which structures at sub-kpc scales are spatially resolved. Combined with the star formation rate surface density traced by Hα and 24 μm images, CO(J = 1 - 0) data provide a super-linear slope of N = 1. 3. The slope becomes even steeper (N = 1. 8) when the diffuse stellar and dust background emission is subtracted from the Hα and 24 μm images. In contrast to the recent results with CO(J = 2 - 1) that found a constant star formation efficiency (SFE) in many spiral galaxies, {{these results suggest that}} the SFE is not independent of environment, but increases with molecular gas surface density. We suggest that the excitation of CO(J = 2 - 1) is likely enhanced in the regions with higher star formation and does not linearly trace the molecular gas mass.

We found that the time-averaged continuum energy spectrum between 1 keV and 40 keV can be approximated with a spectral model composed of the direct power-law component, its reflection component, two warm absorbers with different ionization states, and neutral absorption. We have taken two approaches to study its spectral variation at various timescales: The first approach is to make intensity-sliced spectra and study correlation between the intensity and spectral shape. The second approach is to study spectral changes between the intervals when the source flux is above ("bright state") and below ("faint state") the average for fixed time-intervals. In both approaches, we found a clear correlation between the intensity in the 6 [...] 10 keV band and the spectral ratio of 0. 5 [...] 3. 0 keV/ 6. 0 [...] 10 keV. Such a spectral variation requires change of the <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> of the direct component, whereas the shape and intensity of the reflection component being invariable.

Duplicate measurements were made on all states. These data yielded radial distribution and direct correlation functions which were then used to compute the pair potential using the Percus-Yevick equation. The potential minima are in the range of - 105 to - 120 °K and appear to substantiate current theoretical estimates of the effective pair potential {{in the presence of a}} weak three-body force. The data analysis procedure used was new and does not distinguish between the coherent and incoherent absorption factors for the cell scattering which were essentially equal. With this simplification, the argon scattering estimate was compared to the gas scattering estimate on the laboratory frame of reference and the two estimates coincided, indicating the data normalized. The argon scattering on the laboratory frame of reference was examined for the existence of the peaks in the structure factor and the existence of an observable third peak was considered doubtful. Numerical studies of the effect of truncation, normalization, the subsidiary peak phenomenon in the radial distribution function, uncertainties in the low angle data relative to errors in the direct correlation function and the distortion phenomenon are presented. The distortion phenomenon for this experiment explains why the Mikolaj-Pings argon data yielded pair potential well depths from the Percus-Yevick equation that were too shallow and an <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> with respect to density that was too steep compared to theoretical estimates. The data presented for each measurement are: empty cell and cell plus argon intensity, absorption factors, argon intensity, smoothed argon intensity, smoothed argon intensity corrected for distortion, structure factor, radial distribution function, direct correlation function and the pair potential from the Percus-Yevick equation. ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional Type Ia {{supernova}} (SN Ia) cosmology analyses currently use {{a simplistic}} linear regression of magnitude versus color and light curve shape, {{which does not}} model intrinsic SN Ia variations and host galaxy dust as physically distinct effects, resulting in low color-magnitude slopes. We construct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of extinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a intrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust reddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude (M_B vs. B-V) slope β_int differs from the host galaxy dust law R_B, this convolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude vs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from β_int in the blue tail to R_B in the red tail of the apparent color distribution. The conventional linear fit approximates this effective curve near the average apparent color, resulting in an <b>apparent</b> <b>slope</b> β_app between β_int and R_B. We incorporate these effects into a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and analyze a dataset of SALT 2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z < 0. 10. The conventional linear fit obtains β_app≈ 3. Our model finds a β_int = 2. 3 ± 0. 3 and a distinct dust law of R_B = 3. 8 ± 0. 3, consistent with the average for Milky Way dust, while correcting a systematic distance bias of ∼ 0. 10 mag in the tails of the apparent color distribution. Finally, we extend our model to examine the SN Ia luminosity-host mass dependence in terms of intrinsic and dust components.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{constructed}} chimeras {{of the rat}} [32 and [34 neuronal nicotinic subunits {{to locate}} the regions that contribute to differences between the acetylcholine (ACh) dose-response relationships of the cx 3132 and cx 3134 receptors. Expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the r receptor displays an ECs 0 for ACh ~ 20 -fold less than the ECs 0 of the ct 3134 receptor. The <b>apparent</b> Hill <b>slope</b> (napp) of ~t 3132 is near one whereas the ct 3134 receptor displays an nap p near two. Substitutions within the first 120 residues convert the EC 50 for ACh from one wild-type value to the other. Exchanging just [32 : 104 - 120 for the corresponding region of [34 shifts the ECs 0 of ACh dose-response relationship in the expected direction but does not completely convert the ECs 0 of the dose-response relationship from one wild-type value to the other. However, substitutions in the [32 : 104 - 120 region do account for the relative sensitivity of the ~t 3132 receptor to cytisine, tetramethylammonium, and ACh. The expression of [34 -like (strong) cooperativity requires an extensive region of [34 ([34 : 1 - 301). Relatively short [32 substitutions ([32 : 104 - 120) can reduce cooperativity to [32 -like values. The results suggest that amino acids within the first 120 residues of [32 and the corresponding region of [34 contribute to an agonist binding site that bridges the et and [3 subunits in neuronal nicotinic receptors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Power density spectra (PDSs) of long gamma-ray bursts {{provide useful}} {{information}} on GRBs, indicating their self-similar temporal structure. The best power-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T 90 > 100 s) {{in which the}} range of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts have <b>apparent</b> PDS <b>slopes</b> more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations. The underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging the PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power-law has a slope α ≈ − 5 / 3 and a sharp break at ∼ 1 Hz. The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate energy channels. The PDS flattens in the hard channel (hν> 300 keV) and steepens in the soft channel (hν < 50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light curves approximately follows the − 5 / 3 law. We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find {{a strong correlation between}} the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This correlation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim bursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is probably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a cosmological redshift. Finally, we test the internal shock model against the observed PDS. We demonstrate how the model can reproduce the − 5 / 3 power law. 1...|$|R
40|$|The angular {{dependence}} of seafloor acoustic backscatter,measured with a 12 ‐kHz multi narrow‐beam echo‐sounder at two {{sites in the}} central North Pacific with water depths of 1500 and 3100 m, respectively, has been determined for incidence angles between 0 ° and 20 °. The acoustic data consist of quadrature samples of the beamformed echoes received {{on each of the}} 16 2. 66 ° beams of a Sea Beam echo‐sounder. These data are subjected to adaptive noise cancelling for sidelobe interference rejection, and the centroid of each echo is determined. After corrections for the ship’s roll and raybending effects through the water column, the angles of arrival are converted to angles of incidence by taking athwartships <b>apparent</b> bottom <b>slopes</b> into account. For each beam, the mean echo power received is normalized by the corresponding insonified area that depends on the transmit and receive beam patterns, the ship’s roll angle and the local bottom slope. For lack of system calibration, the data are presented as relative mean energy levels in 1 ° bins. Comparison of these results with theoretical {{angular dependence}} functions, based on the Helmholtz–Kirchhoff model for backscatter from a rough surface, indicates that a good fit is obtained in the angular sector from 5 ° to 20 ° incidence. In the near‐nadir sector (0 ° to 5 °), the data suffer from high variance making the estimate unreliable. The data processing methods presented constitute one of the elements necessary to compile a map of seafloor acoustic backscatter from acoustic measurements made with a multinarrow beam echo‐sounder. The angular dependence function obtained will ultimately be used to normalize the backscattermeasurements in the athwartships direction...|$|R
