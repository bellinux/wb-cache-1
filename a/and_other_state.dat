Housing the Indiana General Assembly, {{the office of the}} Governor of Indiana, the Supreme Court of Indiana, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> officials, it is located in the state capital Indianapolis at 200 West Washington Street. Built in 1888, it is the fifth building to house the state government.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians were caught in the ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> security personnel.|$|E

FEMA agents also went door-to-door in Tallahassee to ask residents about damage to their property.|$|E

5|$|NY365 is {{the only}} post-1930 state route that once entered Hamilton County, but no longer does. When it was {{assigned}} , the route entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County, overlapping with NY28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY28 and onto NY10 (later NY30) and NY28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY28N split off from both NY10 and NY365. The two highways continued northward, leaving Hamilton County and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY365 <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.|$|E
5|$|Swisher {{subsequently}} {{organized the}} Main Street Building Company, which became responsible for building the Strand Building, {{a business and}} commercial block in Morgantown. He established and incorporated the Howard L. Swisher Company in November 1914. He also organized the Morgantown Building Association in November 1918 with an authorized capital of $250,000 and himself serving as its general manager. The Morgantown Building Association undertook extensive construction of residences in the city. In December 1914, following its organization in Parkersburg, Swisher was named the secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association. The association was formed {{in cooperation with the}} West Virginia Department of Agriculture <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> agencies for the promotion and development of the states's agricultural resources, real estate, and investments.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} litany of complaints about the state's first constitution. Some {{believed that it was}} undemocratic because it required electors to choose the governor and state senators and many offices were appointive rather than elective. Others opposed life terms for judges <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E

In August 2013, the PHPDA announced a 30-year lease with the Washington State Department of Commerce for 13 stories of Pacific Tower. Six of the stories will be subleased to Seattle Central Community College for its healthcare training programs. Multiple nonprofits are prospective tenants. Chopp <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> lawmakers planned on consolidating several district offices into the location. The state capital budget allocated $20 million for the tower's renovation, but the cost increased to $54.3 million {{by the time it}} was completed in 2016 due to unexpected water damage and new city energy-use regulations.|$|E
5|$|While some 700,000–1,000,000 Iraqis came to Jordan {{following}} the Iraq War in 2003, most have returned. Many Iraqi Christians (Assyrians/Chaldeans) however settled temporarily or permanently in Jordan. Immigrants also include 15,000 Lebanese who arrived {{following the}} 2006 Lebanon War. Since 2010, over 1.4 million Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan {{to escape the}} violence in Syria. The kingdom has continued to demonstrate hospitality, despite the substantial strain the flux of Syrian refugees places on the country. The effects are largely affecting Jordanian communities, as {{the vast majority of}} Syrian refugees do not live in camps. The refugee crisis effects include competition for job opportunities, water resources <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>state</b> provided services, along with the strain on the national infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>State</b> Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a reciprocity treaty with Mexico in 1882.|$|E
