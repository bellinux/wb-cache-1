The valuation over a set of objects is the maximum value that can be achieved by optimally assigning them to various roles. <b>Assignment</b> <b>messages</b> can also be applied to resource allocation without money; see, for example, the problem of course allocation in schools, as analyzed by Budish, Che, Kojima, and Milgrom (2013).

30|$|When the TR phase completes, the AP {{processes}} the received TRs {{and schedules}} the subsequent ST phase. Transmission in the ST phase is contention free {{and can be}} from one station to the AP or to another station. The contention free transmission may be done in several ways. A simple method is to assign all subcarriers to one station and schedule stations in the time domain (i.e., OFDM with time domain multiplexing). In this mode, either a transmission schedule (TS) for stations is broadcasted, or individual TO <b>assignment</b> <b>messages</b> are sent to stations at appropriate times. The other option for the ST phase is to utilize OFDMA to allow concurrent data transmission by multiple stations. In this mode, a subchannel assignment (SA) map is broadcasted to inform the stations of their assigned subchannels. The SA map may include downlink transmissions by the AP, and therefore it is not equivalent to the uplink map (UL Map) in other standards. Utilizing OFDMA in the ST phase incurs great complexity in scheduling stations and may lead to inefficiency if a schedule that fills all subchannels at all times is not feasible. In this article, we only consider the former case where OFDMA {{is used in the}} TR phase and the ST phase uses controlled CSMA.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of Distributed Constraints satisfaction algorithms must {{be measured by}} concurrent performance measures. In Previous studies we have proposed the count of non concurrent logical steps as an asynchronous measure. This measure is independent of the specific implementation and is not affected by the level of concurrency of the performing algorithm. The method of counting non-concurrent constraints-checks (NCCCs) was later extended {{to the case of}} systems with message delays. The method inherently assumes that each message received by an agent triggers some computation. In some DisCSP algorithms, such as AW C and ABT DO, agents receive <b>assignment</b> <b>messages</b> from lower priority agents which do not cause a computation. The present paper proposes a generalization of the method of counting non-concurrent logical steps as run-time measure for distributed search algorithms. Logical time counters carried by messages do not immediately update the receiving agent’s logical counter. Instead, the agent stores the data carried by the message and tags it with the logical time carried by the message. Only when the agent uses the stored information for the first time, the logical counter of the delivering message is considered. The proposed method ensures that the reported solution does not include logical computation steps that could have been performed concurrently. The proposed general method is presented in detail, demonstrated on the relevant DisCSP algorithms and its correctness is proven...|$|R

40|$|The {{degrees of}} freedom (DoF) number of the fully {{connected}} K-user Gaussian interference channel {{is known to be}} K/ 2. In [1], the DoF for the same channel model was studied while allowing each message to be available at its own transmitter as well as M- 1 successive transmitters. In particular, it was shown that the DoF gain through cooperation does not scale with the number of users K for a fixed value of M, i. e., the per user DoF number is 1 / 2. In this work, we relax the cooperation constraint such that each message can be assigned to M transmitters without imposing further constraints on their location. Under the new constraint, we study properties for different <b>message</b> <b>assignments</b> in terms of the gain in the per user DoF number over that achieved without cooperation. In particular, we show that a local cooperation constraint that confines the transmit set of each message within a o(K) radius cannot achieve a per user DoF number that is greater than 1 / 2. Moreover, we show that the same conclusion about the per user DoF number holds for any <b>assignment</b> of <b>messages</b> such that each message cannot be available at more than two transmitters. Finally, for the case where M > 2, we do not know whether a per user DoF number that is greater than 1 / 2 is achievable.

40|$|Degrees {{of freedom}} (DoF) gains are studied in {{wireless}} networks with cooperative transmission under a backhaul load constraint that limits {{the average number}} of messages that can be delivered from a centralized controller to the basestation transmitters. The backhaul load is defined as the sum of all the messages available at all the transmitters per channel use, normalized by the number of users. For Wyner's linear interference network, where each transmitter is connected to the receiver having the same index as well as one succeeding receiver, the per user DoF is characterized and the optimal scheme is presented. When the backhaul load is constrained to an integer level B, the asymptotic per user DoF is shown to equal (4 B- 1) /(4 B). Furthermore, it is shown that the optimal <b>assignment</b> of <b>messages</b> to transmitters is asymmetric and satisfies a local cooperation constraint, and that the optimal coding scheme relies only on one-shot zero-forcing transmit beamforming. The results are then extended to locally connected linear interference networks and the more practical hexagonal sectored cellular networks. Our main conclusion for all the studied network models is that by allowing for cooperative transmission and a flexible <b>message</b> <b>assignment</b> that is constrained only by an average backhaul load, one can deliver the rate gains promised by information-theoretic upper bounds with practical one-shot schemes that incur little or no additional load on the backhaul.

40|$|In this work, {{we explore}} the {{potential}} and optimal use of transmitter cooperation in wireless interference networks with deep fading conditions. We consider a linear interference network with K transmitter-receiver pairs, where each transmitter can {{be connected to}} two neighboring receivers. Long-term fluctuations (shadow fading) in the wireless channel can lead to any link being erased with probability p. Each receiver is interested in one unique message that can be available at two transmitters. The considered rate criterion is the average per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) as K goes to infinity. Prior to this work, the optimal <b>assignment</b> of <b>messages</b> to transmitters were identified in the two limits as p goes to 0 and as p goes to 1. We identify new schemes that achieve average puDoF values that are higher than {{the state of the}} art for a significant part of the range 0 < p < 1. The key idea to our results is to understand that the role of cooperation shifts from increasing the probability of delivering a message to its intended destination at high values of p, to interference cancellation at low values of p. Our schemes are based on an algorithm that achieves the optimal DoF value in any network realization, when restricted to a given <b>message</b> <b>assignment</b> as well as the use of zero-forcing schemes.

40|$|Wireless {{networking}} {{is becoming}} increasingly important for ubiquitous access to the Internet and the Web. However, wireless networks exhibit significant reliability and performance problems, with frequent disconnections, congestions, and packet losses. For these reasons, the traditional TCP/IP suite, designed for wired networks, offers poor performance and inadequate communication semantics in this scenario. There are several research efforts in both protocols and communication infrastructures aimed at producing solutions better suited to wireless network characteristics. This paper presents Mockets, a novel communications middleware specifically designed for wireless networking scenarios. The Mockets middleware permits a communication endpoint to be moved from one node to another without interrupting the communication session. In addition, Mockets provides several delivery services with different communication semantics, semantic classification of data, cancellation/replacement of enqueued data, and priority/lifetime <b>assignment</b> to <b>messages.</b> Initial experimental results in a wireless network scenario show that the Mockets middleware achieves better performance levels than traditional TCP-based infrastructure...|$|R

This paper aims to investigate the effects and benefits of providing dynamic travel time information to drivers via variable message signs at the expressway network.
