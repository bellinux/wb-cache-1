6000|$|We were greeted, on {{reaching}} the gate, {{not by a}} warder, but by the growl and bark of a ferocious mastiff, {{who would have been}} more in keeping at his post near a henroost, than at the portal of a princely castle.

Ivy is invited out by best friend Sam Strickland (Leslie Odom, Jr.) and the Bombshell cast for her birthday, but keeps it from Tom.

60|$|That very evening Hemmings {{delivered}} {{himself of}} his reproof. He had sat unusually silent; Scorrier, indeed, had thought him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>drunk,</b> so portentous was his gravity; suddenly, however he rose. It was {{hard on a}} man, he said, in his position, with a Board (he spoke as {{of a family of}} small children), to be kept so short of information. He was actually compelled to use his imagination to answer the shareholders' questions. This was painful and humiliating; he had never heard of any secretary having to use his imagination! He went further--it was insulting! He had grown grey {{in the service of the}} company. Mr. Scorrier would bear him out when he said he had a position to maintain--his name in the City was a high one; and, by George! he was going to keep it a high one; he would allow nobody to drag it in the dust--that ought clearly to be understood. His directors felt they were being treated like children; however that might be, it was absurd to suppose that he (Hemmings) could be treated like a child...!

60|$|I lay {{one night}} with the out-pickets in Castile. We were in close touch with the enemy; the usual orders had been issued against smoking, fires, and talk, and both armies lay as quiet as mice, when I saw the English {{sentinel}} opposite making a signal by holding up his musket. I repeated it, and we both crept together in the dry bed of a stream, which made the demarcation of the armies. It was wine he wanted, of which {{we had a good}} provision, and the English had quite run out. He gave me the money, and I, as was the custom, left him my firelock in pledge, and set off for the canteen. When I returned with a skin of wine, behold, it had pleased some uneasy devil of an English officer to withdraw the outposts! Here was a situation with a vengeance, and I looked for nothing but ridicule in the present and punishment in the future. Doubtless our officers winked pretty hard at this interchange of courtesies, but doubtless {{it would be impossible to}} wink at so gross a fault, or rather so pitiable a misadventure as mine; and you are to conceive me wandering in the plains of Castile, benighted, charged with a wine-skin for which I had no use, and with no knowledge whatever of the whereabouts of my musket, beyond that it was somewhere in my Lord Wellington's army. But my Englishman was either a very honest fellow, or else extremely thirsty, and at last contrived to advertise me of his new position. Now, the English sentry in Castile and the wounded hero in the Durham public-house were one and the same person; and if he had been <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less <b>drunk,</b> or myself less lively in getting away, the travels of M. St. Ives might have come to an untimely end.|$|R
60|$|To the toils and {{perils of}} this journey {{it would require}} a pen more elegant than mine to do full justice. The reader must {{conceive}} for himself the dreadful wilderness which we had now to thread; its thickets, swamps, precipitous rocks, impetuous rivers, and amazing waterfalls. Among these barbarous scenes we must toil all day, now paddling, now carrying our canoe upon our shoulders; and at night we slept about a fire, surrounded by the howling of wolves and other savage animals. It was our design to mount {{the headwaters of the}} Hudson, to the neighbourhood of Crown Point, where the French had a strong place in the woods, upon Lake Champlain. But to have done this directly were too perilous; and it was accordingly gone upon by such a labyrinth of rivers, lakes, and portages as makes my head giddy to remember. These paths were in ordinary times entirely desert; but the country was now up, the tribes on the war-path, the woods full of Indian scouts. Again and again we came upon these parties when we least expected them; and one day, in particular, I shall never forget how, as dawn was coming in, we were suddenly surrounded by five or six of these painted devils, uttering a very dreary sort of cry, and brandishing their hatchets. It passed off harmlessly, indeed, as did the rest of our encounters; for Chew was well known and highly valued among the different tribes. Indeed, he was a very gallant, respectable young man; but even with the advantage of his companionship, you must not think these meetings were without sensible peril. To prove friendship on our part, it was needful to draw upon our stock of rum--indeed, under whatever disguise, that is the true business of the Indian trader, to keep a travelling public-house in the forest; and when once the braves had got their bottle of scaura (as they call this beastly liquor), it behoved us to set forth and paddle for our scalps. Once they were <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>drunk,</b> good-bye to any sense or decency; they had but the one thought, to get more scaura. They might easily take it in their heads to give us chase, and had we been overtaken, I had never written these memoirs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lovin'-hearted!" [...] Yes! And {{what was}} he doing? What were his intentions--as they say towards this loving-hearted girl? The thought dogged him, {{wandering}} through fields bright with buttercups, where the little red calves were feeding, and the swallows flying high. Yes, the oaks were before the ashes, brown-gold already; every tree in different stage and hue. The cuckoos and a thousand birds were singing; the little streams were very bright. The ancients believed in a golden age, {{in the garden of}} the Hesperides!... A queen wasp settled on his sleeve. Each queen wasp killed meant two thousand fewer wasps to thieve the apples which would grow from that blossom in the orchard; but who, with love in his heart, could kill anything on a day like this? He entered a field where a young red bull was feeding. It seemed to Ashurst that he looked like Joe. But the young bull took no notice of this visitor, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>drunk</b> himself, perhaps, on the singing and the glamour of the golden pasture, under his short legs. Ashurst crossed out unchallenged to the hillside above the stream. From that slope a for mounted to its crown of rocks. The ground there was covered with a mist of bluebells, and nearly a score of crab-apple trees were in full bloom. He threw himself down on the grass. The change from the buttercup glory and oak-goldened glamour of the fields to this ethereal beauty under the grey for filled him with a sort of wonder; nothing the same, save the sound of running water and the songs of the cuckoos. He lay there a long time, watching the sunlight wheel till the crab-trees threw shadows over the bluebells, his only companions a few wild bees. He was not quite sane, thinking of that morning's kiss, and of to-night under the apple tree. In such a spot as this, fauns and dryads surely lived; nymphs, white as the crab-apple blossom, retired within those trees; fauns, brown as the dead bracken, with pointed ears, lay in wait for them. The cuckoos were still calling when he woke, {{there was the sound of}} running water; but the sun had couched behind the tor, the hillside was cool, and some rabbits had come out. 'Tonight!' he thought. Just as from the earth everything was pushing up, unfolding under the soft insistent fingers of an unseen hand, so were his heart and senses being pushed, unfolded. He got up and broke off a spray from a crab-apple tree. The buds were like Megan--shell-like, rose-pink, wild, and fresh; and so, too, the opening flowers, white, and wild; and touching. He put the spray into his coat. And all the rush of the spring within him escaped in a triumphant sigh. But the rabbits scurried away.|$|E

50|$|The single {{received}} favourable reviews. Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph professed her {{admiration for}} Paul’s vocal and production by writing; “Gentle, angelic falsettos sing curses and threaten warnings while a sparkling dub-bass jolts and plays {{tug of war}} with electro-soul synths. Paul brings in different elements of his orchestra, the saxophone, alto voices and ploppy drums to support and boy, it works”. These sentiments were echoed in the US with American blog The Wounded Jukebox writing that “Paul fits 10 tons of pop and funk into a {{three and a half}} minute lambasting. There’s a deceptive sensitivity within the words, but it’s betrayed and assimilated quickly by a sinister kind of undercurrent”. Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork observed Paul’s style of meshing pop music with underground sensibilities by stating that “BTSTU” is “an off-kilter pop tune that's automatically raw, bright, new. The palm-slap beat is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dirty and <b>drunk</b> as it recalls the unmistakable lope of one J Dilla”. A number of publications included “BTSTU” in their end-of-year lists in 2011 including Pitchfork, The Fader, and Pigeons and Planes. The Washington Post mentioned “BTSTU” in their ‘Singles File: Best of 2011’ describing it as “a precursor to the entire career of James Blake”.|$|R
