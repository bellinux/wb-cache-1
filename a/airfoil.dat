5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size <b>airfoil</b> and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a local street to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the <b>airfoil</b> instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous <b>airfoil</b> designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the <b>airfoil</b> flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E

5|$|After a {{company-wide}} {{contest to}} name the aircraft, the initial prototype received the name Pirate and made its first flight on 2 October 1946. Flight testing revealed severe aerodynamic problems, mostly caused by the <b>airfoil</b> section and thickness of the wing. The vertical stabilizer also had to be redesigned to smooth out the airflow {{at the intersection of}} the horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Other changes included the addition of dive brakes {{on the sides of the}} fuselage and the replacement of the Metalite panels near the engine's exhaust with stainless steel ones.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has played}} an enormous role in refining the wings, control and sensory systems, {{and anything else}} that affects aerodynamics or kinematics. One noteworthy trait is wing twist. Most insect wings are twisted, as are helicopter blades, with a higher angle of attack at the base. The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees. In addition to this twist, the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins {{in such a way that}} the cross-section of the wings approximates an <b>airfoil.</b> Thus, the wing's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack. Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt, stiffness, and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax (below). Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight, but play a role in something else, such as mating or protection.|$|E
25|$|A {{supercritical}} <b>airfoil</b> is an <b>airfoil</b> designed, primarily, {{to delay}} the onset of wave drag on aircraft in the transonic speed range.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of blunt trailing edge <b>airfoils</b> (also called flatback <b>airfoils)</b> for the inboard region of large {{wind turbine blades}} has been proposed. Blunt trailing edge <b>airfoils</b> would not only provide a number of structural benefits, such as increased structural volume and ease of fabrication and handling, but they have also been found to improve the lift characteristics of thick <b>airfoils.</b> Therefore, the incorporation of blunt trailing edge <b>airfoils</b> would allow blade designers to more freely address the structural demands without having to sacrifice aerodynamic performance. These <b>airfoils</b> do have the disadvantage of generating high levels of drag {{as a result of}} the low-pressure steady or periodic flow in the near-wake of the blunt trailing edge. Although for rotors, the drag penalty appears secondary to the lift enhancement produced by the blunt trailing edge, high drag levels are of concern in terms of the negative effect on the torque and power generated by the rotor. Hence, devices are sought that mitigate the drag of these <b>airfoils.</b> This report summarizes the literature on bluff body vortex shedding and bluff body drag reduction devices and proposes four devices for further study in the wind tunnel...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} extend the useful range of Reynolds numbers of <b>airfoils</b> {{designed}} {{to take advantage of}} the extensive laminar boundary layers possible in an air stream of low turbulence, tests were made of the NACA 2412 - 34 and 1412 - 34 sections in the NACA low-turbulence tunnel. Although the possible extent of the laminar boundary layer on these <b>airfoils</b> is not so great as for specially designed laminar-flow <b>airfoils,</b> it is greater than that for conventional <b>airfoils,</b> and is sufficiently extensive so that at Reynolds numbers above 11, 000, 000 the laminar region is expected to be limited by the permissible 'Reynolds number run' and not by laminar separation as is the case with conventional <b>airfoils.</b> Drag measurements by the wake-survey method and pressure-distribution measurements were made at several lift coefficients through a range of Reynolds numbers up to 11, 400, 000. The drag scale-effect curve for the NACA 1412 - 34 is extrapolated to a Reynolds number of 30, 000, 000 on the basis of theoretical calculations of the skin friction. Comparable skin-friction calculations were made for the NACA 23012. The results indicate that, for certain applications at moderate values of the Reynolds number, the NACA 1412 - 34 and 2412 - 34 <b>airfoils</b> offer some advantages over such conventional <b>airfoils</b> as the NACA 23012. The possibility of maintaining a more extensive laminar boundary layer on these <b>airfoils</b> should result in a small drag reduction, and the absence of pressure peaks allows higher speeds to be reached before the compressibility burble is encountered. At lower Reynold numbers, below about 10, 000, 000, these <b>airfoils</b> have higher drags than <b>airfoils</b> designed to operate with very extensive laminar boundary layers...|$|R
