50|$|In February 1886 Isambard Kingdom Brunel's famous ship, SS Great Britain, in her {{new role}} as a coal ship {{departed}} from Penarth Docks towards Panama. It was, however, to be her final voyage when, after a fire on board she was diverted to the Falkland Islands and remained there until 1937 as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b>|$|E
50|$|After that, Margaret was {{no longer}} issued orders to put to sea, and instead served as {{accommodation}} for her crew and as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> During this period, a Gunner's Mate Davis, serving as petty officer of the watch aboard Margaret, heard cries for help from the harbor and dived in to rescue {{a man who had}} attempted to swim from another boat to shore and became fatigued. Davis received a letter of commendation for his action.|$|E
50|$|The machine, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} 1920s, remains similar in function and design to the combine harvester. Essentially <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> on a truck with a mechanical extension, the machine cuts the stalks at the base, strips the leaves off, and then cuts the cane into segments. These are then deposited into either the on-board container, or a separate vehicle traveling alongside. Waste material is then ejected back onto the field, where it acts as fertilizer.|$|E
50|$|Where a {{space-heating}} {{water boiler}} is employed, the traditional arrangement in the UK {{is to use}} boiler-heated (primary) water to heat potable (secondary) water contained in a cylindrical vessel (usually made of copper)—which is supplied from <b>a</b> cold water <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> or container, usually in the roof space of the building. This produces a fairly steady supply of DHW (Domestic Hot Water) at low static pressure head but usually with a good flow. In most {{other parts of the}} world, water heating appliances do not use <b>a</b> cold water <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> or container, but heat water at pressures close to that of the incoming mains water supply.|$|R

5000|$|In 2008, the diesel-fired {{generating}} plant {{was replaced by}} a natural gas-fired plant for utilization of natural gas from the field. This reduced production cost on the fields. <b>A</b> new <b>storage</b> <b>vessel,</b> MT Bonsu, was purchased for storage of oil from the field. [...] It replaced the previously leased <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> MT African Wave, which had become dangerous to operate. [...] By other sources, the reason for termination of the leasing contract was the inability of SOPCL to pay its outstanding bills.|$|R
50|$|First BP unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to close the}} blowout preventer valves on the wellhead with remotely operated underwater vehicles. Next it placed a 125-tonne (280,000 lb) containment dome over the largest leak and piped the oil to <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> While this technique had worked in shallower water, it failed here when gas combined with cold water to form methane hydrate crystals that blocked the opening {{at the top of}} the dome. Pumping heavy drilling fluids into the blowout preventer to restrict the flow of oil before sealing it permanently with cement ("top kill") also failed.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to stop the}} oil spill were to use remotely operated underwater vehicles to close the blowout preventer valves on the well head; however, all these attempts failed. [...] The second technique, placing a 125 t containment dome (which had worked on leaks in shallower water) over the largest leak and piping the oil to <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> on the surface, failed when gas leaking from the pipe combined with cold water formed methane hydrate crystals that blocked the opening {{at the top of}} the dome.|$|E
50|$|As {{the crisis}} subsided, Abiqua was {{returned}} to the Maritime Administration and struck from the Navy list on 30 September 1957. Following her deactivation, Abiqua returned to the Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Co., Mobile, Ala. The afterpart of Abiqua was joined to the forepart of SS Windsor (formerly Bear Paw) to form a dry cargo ship which retained the name Abiqua. The old forepart of Abiqua was joined to the afterpart of Windsor to form <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> which was renamed Bear Paw.

40|$|A {{survey of}} {{transfer}} equipment and <b>storage</b> <b>vessels</b> available at JRP-partners with such facilities has been undertaken. Two {{different approaches to}} transferring mass artefacts in vacuum or inert gas were identified.

50|$|The drum line {{consists}} of a floating drum (a barrel) with two lines attached to it. One line is attached to an anchor on the sea floor, while the other features a large baited shark hook. The drum is filled with a rigid polyurethane foam, which keeps it buoyant and prevents it from being stolen for use as <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel.</b> To attract sharks, the hooks are baited with red mullet and false jacopever. Since {{the objective of the}} drum line is to prevent sharks from approaching popular beaches (and not to attract them) only about 500 grams of bait is added to each hook. Thus sharks are only attracted to the baits from the immediate vicinity.|$|E
5000|$|Liddell and Scott give a {{standard}} derivation from Greek rhein, [...] "to flow", which, according to Julius Pokorny, is from Indo-European *sreu-, [...] "flow". As rhutos is [...] "stream", the neuter, rhuton, {{would be some}} sort of object associated with pouring, which is equivalent to English pourer. Many vessels considered rhytons featured a wide mouth at the top and a hole through a conical constriction at the bottom from which the fluid ran. The idea is that one scooped wine or water from <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> or similar source, held it up, unstoppered the hole with one's thumb, and let the fluid run into the mouth (or onto the ground in libation) {{in the same way that}} wine is drunk from a wineskin today.|$|E
50|$|At {{sufficient}} depths, methane complexes {{directly with}} water to form methane hydrates, as was observed during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. BP engineers developed and deployed a subsea oil recovery system over oil spilling from a deepwater oil well 5000 ft below sea level to capture escaping oil. This involved placing a 125 t dome over {{the largest of the}} well leaks and piping it to <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> on the surface. This option had the potential to collect some 85% of the leaking oil but was previously untested at such depths. BP deployed the system on May 7-8, but it failed due to buildup of methane clathrate inside the dome; with its low density of approximately 0.9 g/cm3 the methane hydrates accumulated in the dome, adding buoyancy and obstructing flow.|$|E
5000|$|Milk {{coming from}} the cow is transported to <b>a</b> nearby <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> by the airflow leaking around the cups on the cow or by a special [...] "air inlet" [...] (5-10 l/min free air) in the claw. From there it is pumped by a {{mechanical}} pump and cooled by a heat exchanger. The milk is then stored in a large vat, or bulk tank, which is usually refrigerated until collection for processing.|$|R
50|$|A {{vacuum flask}} (also {{known as a}} Dewar flask, Dewar bottle or thermos) is <b>an</b> {{insulating}} <b>storage</b> <b>vessel</b> that greatly lengthens the time over which its contents remain hotter or cooler than the flask's surroundings. Invented by Sir James Dewar in 1892, the vacuum flask consists of two flasks, placed one within the other and joined at the neck. The {{gap between the two}} flasks is partially evacuated of air, creating a near-vacuum which significantly reduces heat transfer by conduction or convection.|$|R

50|$|A wine {{decanter}} is a glass serving vessel {{into which}} an entire {{bottle of wine}} is poured. They are used to remove sediment, aerate the wine, facilitate pouring, and provide elegant presentation. Decanters are important when serving older vintages which {{are more likely to}} accumulate potassium bitartrate crystal sediment in the process of aging; these can be removed both by filtering when pouring into the decanter - so that the wine in the decanter is sediment-free - or due to the shape of the decanter (flared bottom), which catches sediment. Decanters promote the aeration of wine by having a flared bottom, hence large surface area of wine, maximising the wine-air interface, thereby introducing more oxygen which changes the wine's bouquet and taste - it also allows the evaporation of undesirable organic compounds, particularly sulfides and sulfites; this use is controversial, and some argue that this is unnecessary and harmful, with swirling the wine in the glass being sufficient and preferable. Because they are a serving vessel, not <b>a</b> <b>storage</b> <b>vessel,</b> they also can make wine pouring easier by preventing dribbling, and elegantly display the wine's color in clear glass, rather than the green glass used for storage.|$|E
