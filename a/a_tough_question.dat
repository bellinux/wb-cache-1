40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the propensity of large donors {{to give to}} competing candidates or competing party organizations during the same election cycle – for example, giving money to both Bush and Kerry during the 2004 presidential race – a practice here termed 2 ̆ 7 bet-hedging. 2 ̆ 7 Bet-hedging is analyzed in strategic and game-theoretic terms. The paper explores the prevalence of bet-hedging, the possible motivations behind the practice, and the informational concerns surrounding it. The paper argues that bet-hedging, out of all donation practices, carries with it a uniquely strong implication of ex post favor-seeking: if a donor prefers one side over the other, by bet-hedging {{it is at least}} partially cancelling out its own contribution. If the donor has no preference, there is no rational reason to give its money to either side unless it seeks some kind of recognition, in the form of increased access or influence or in the avoidance of retaliation for not giving, by the eventual victor.

In providing its consumption smoothing recommendations, ESPlanner makes the highly detailed tax and Social Security benefit calculations needed to compare retirement account options. In particular, ESPlanner can determine how different retirement account options affect different households' living standards under different assumptions about future tax policy. Our main findings are these: Absent future tax changes, middle-income, single-parent households benefit slightly more from Roth accounts; other single and married households generally fare better with a regular 401 (k). Future tax changes, however, can dramatically change this horse race. In the case of low- and middle-income households, Regular 401 (k) accounts under-perform Roth accounts in terms of long-run living standards assuming income taxes will rise by 30 percent in retirement. But the Roth falls far short of the regular 401 (k) if taxes in retirement are assessed on consumption rather than on income and the transition to consumption taxation exempts 401 (k) withdrawals from income taxation. ...|$|E

London/New York: Continuum, 230 – 250. In {{this paper}} I present {{an overview of}} the spectrum of available online English language dictionaries, and then offer some general comments on a few selected key issues. Given the current explosion of web content, it is quite pointless to try to list every single dictionary available. It makes better sense to identify the salient categories of online dictionaries and selectively focus on their prominent and typical representatives. The first notable category, so important to the many learners of English worldwide, are the famous British monolingual learners' dictionaries (the Big Five). Here, it is interesting to observe the gradual transition to the online medium in what has sometimes been called the freemium approach. Quality general English dictionaries aimed at the native speaker are not so well represented, but there are a wide choice of specialized (subject) dictionaries of varying quality and provenance. Special-purpose dictionaries include pronouncing dictionaries and onomasiological dictionaries. Diachronic dictionaries have also established a presence on the internet. As one guise of the Web 2. 0 experience, we witness the emergence of bottom-up (or user-involvement) lexicography, with such prominent exemplars as the Urban Dictionary or Wiktionary. Hyperlinking is a fundamental feature of the web, but it is, arguably, overused in the so called dictionary aggregators: dictionary portals which put together entries from several online dictionaries. This creates highly redundant assemblages of lexicographic data. How to tap the richness of the Web but present the results in a user-friendly manner without laborious human intervention is <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>question.</b> Another issue that still awaits satisfactory answers is the organization of access to data in online dictionaries. Even in highly respected dictionaries, there remain basic problems of access, such as with locating multi-word units, notwithstanding the upbeat tone of metalexicographers who often just pronounce the problem as essentially solved in the electronic medium. Other issues related to new technologies are the use of graphics, multimedia and alternative presentation modes, and these receive some attention. Finally, I play with the idea of the dictionary as an advanced query system sitting on top of a text corpus. Using collocation dictionaries as an example, I demonstrate that the difference between a sophisticated corpus query system and a more traditional lexicographic product may soon become something of a technical subtlety...|$|E
40|$|Does it pay to work? Given {{the number}} and {{complexity}} {{of federal and state}} tax and transfer systems, this is <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> to answer. The problem is greatly {{compounded by the fact that}} what one earns in one year alters not just current taxes and transfer payments in that year, but in future years as well. Thus, understanding the net effective tax on work and the changes in this taxation associated with policy reforms requires an intertemporal model capable of carefully determining tax and transfer payments at each stage of the life cycle. This study uses ESPlanner, a financial planning software program, to study the net work tax levied on workers with different earnings capacities. ESPlanner smooths households' living standards subject to their capacities to borrow. In so doing, it makes highly detiled, year-by-year federal and state income tax and Social Security benefit calculations. To produce a comprehensive net work tax measure, we added to ESPlanner all other major transfer programs. We focus on lifetime average and marginal net work-tax rates, which are measured by comparing the present values of lifetime spending from working through retirement both in the presence and in the absence of all tax-transfer programs. We form these tax rates for young stylized married workers. We report seven findings. First, our fiscal system is highly progressive. Households earning the minimum wage receive 18 cents in benefits net of taxes for every dollar they earn. In contrast, households with million dollar salaries pay 54 cents in taxes net of benefits pe r dollar earned. Second, progressively is primarily restriced to the bottom end of the income distribution. Average net work tax rates of middle class households are relatively high compared with those of the rich. Third, while the poor face negative average taxes, they face significant positive marginal net taxes on working. Indeed, a minimum wage household that chooses to work is forced to surrender 34 cents of every dollar earned in net taxes. Those with earnings that exceed 1. 5 times the minimum wage face marginal net taxes on full-time work above 50 percent. Fourth, low-wage workers face confiscatory tax rates on switching from part-time to full-time work. Fifth, the same is true of secondary earnings spouses in low- wage households with low incomes. Six, the marginal net tax on working is particularly high for young households with low incomes. Seventh, average and marginal net work tax rates are relatively insensitive to the assumed rate of real wage growth and the discount rate. And eighth, major tax reforms, such as switching from income to consumption taxation, can have an significant affect on the fiscal system's overall progressivity. ...|$|E
40|$|Poterba for helpful comments. The views stated herein are {{the authors}} and not {{necessarily}} those of Boston Who gains, and by how much from government saving incentives? This is <b>a</b> very <b>tough</b> <b>question</b> to answer because the tax code has myriad interacting provisions, {{many of which are}} difficult to appreciate fully. Take workers who contribute to 401 (k) plans. They lower their current taxes, but they also raise their future ones. How much their taxes decline when young and rise when old depends on their tax brackets when young and old. But these brackets can change dramatically in response to the size of 401 (k) contributions and withdrawals. Changes in tax brackets will, in turn, change the tax savings from mortgage interest payments and other tax deductions. In addition, the level of withdrawals can trigger higher federal income taxation of Social Security benefits and the phase out of itemized deductions under the federal income tax. Clearly, measuring the net gains from tax-favored saving requires a model of lifetime saving, spending, and tax payments. It also requires detailed federal income, state income, and payroll tax calculators, since all three taxes are potentially altered by contributions to tax-favore...|$|R
