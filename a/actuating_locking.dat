50|$|Rubicon: The Wrangler Rubicon (named for {{the famed}} Rubicon Trail in the Sierra Nevada Mountains) was {{introduced}} in the summer of 2002. It featured front and rear air <b>actuated</b> <b>locking</b> Dana 44 axles with the Rock-Trac NV241 4:1 ratio transfer case, diamond plate rocker panels, 16-inch alloy wheels, and Goodyear MTR P245/75-R16 tires. From 2003 and 2004 featured a standard New Venture Gear NV3550 five-speed manual transmission, which changed in 2004 (2005 model) to the NSG370, a Mercedes-sourced six-speed. The optional 42RLE four-speed automatic transmission was available from 2003 to 2006.|$|R
50|$|Electric locks use magnets, solenoids, or motors to <b>actuate</b> the <b>lock</b> {{by either}} {{supplying}} or removing power. Operating the lock {{can be as}} simple as using a switch, for example an apartment intercom door release, or as complex as a biometric based access control system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Criterion-Based Role-Based Access Control {{model in which}} secure permissions (SP), secure operations (SOp), secure objects (SOb), and secure users (SU) are introduced. The security criterion expressions (SCE) embedded in SOb work as locks and the common elements of the security criterion subsets (SCSS) in SOp and SU work as keys. To support web-based applications, the remote secure user-role assignment is done based on user’s digital credential(s), and Compact-Secure-Role-SCSS cookies are adopted to simplify the subsequent transactions. The multilayer access control is achieved by <b>actuating</b> <b>locks</b> with the relevant keys. The proposed model, an extension of traditional RBAC, efficiently supports both multilayer access control and non-multilayer access control on the web.

5000|$|All 4-cylinder {{models are}} {{available}} in PZEV configurations. V6 PZEV models include only i-VTEC VCM engines with 5-speed automatic transmissions. PZEV engines include 2 modes of exhaust valve operation. At Below 2500 rpm, only 1 exhaust valve operates, creating a strong rotational flow in the exhaust gases that creates a [...] "thermal reactor" [...] effect to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. Above 2500 rpm where exhaust flow increases, a hydraulically <b>actuated</b> pin <b>locks</b> the rockers for both exhaust valves together so they operate in unison, following a single cam profile.|$|R
30|$|Skid {{resistance}} is a {{property of the}} pavement which creates enough surface friction for vehicles to maintain control, especially during wet conditions. Although skid {{resistance is}} also {{a function of the}} driver and vehicle characteristics, surface conditions such as bleeding or polished asphalt or smooth macro-texture are used as indicators to identify the potential for skid resistance hazards. Skid resistance of a road is typically measured with a locked wheel trailer procedure where the trailer is pulled at a certain constant speed while the braking system of the test tire is <b>actuated</b> to <b>lock</b> the tire on a wet road surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The direct {{position}} analysis (DPA) of a manipulator is the computation of the end-effector poses (positions and orienta-tions) compatible with assigned {{values of the}} actuated-joint vari-ables. Assigning the actuated-joint variables corresponds to con-sidering the <b>actuated</b> joints <b>locked,</b> which makes the manipulator a structure. The solutions of the DPA of a manipulator one-to-one correspond to the assembly modes of the structure that is gener-ated by locking the actuated-joint variables of that manipulator. Determining the assembly modes of a structure means solving the DPA of a large family of manipulators since the same structure can be generated from different manipulators. This paper pro-vides an algorithm that determines all the assembly modes of two structures with the same topology which are generated from two families of mechanisms: one planar and the other spherical. The topology of these structures is constituted of nine links (one qua-ternary link, four ternary links and four binary links) connected through twelve revolute pairs to form four closed loops. ...|$|R
50|$|A car key or an {{automobile}} key {{is a key}} used to open and/or start {{an automobile}}. Modern key designs are usually symmetrical, and some use grooves on both sides, rather than a cut edge, to <b>actuate</b> the <b>lock.</b> It has multiple uses for the automobile with which it was sold. A car key can open the doors, as well as start the ignition, open the glove compartment and also open the trunk (boot) of the car. Some cars come with an additional key known as a valet key that starts the ignition and opens the driver's side door, but prevents the valet from gaining access to valuables that {{are located in the}} trunk or the glove box. Some valet keys, particularly those to high-performance vehicles, {{go so far as to}} restrict the engine's power output to prevent joyriding. Recently, features such as coded immobilizers have been implemented in newer vehicles. More sophisticated systems make ignition dependent on electronic devices, rather than the mechanical keyswitch. A number of these systems, such as KeeLoq and Megamos Crypto have been demonstrated to be weak and vulnerable to cryptanalytic attacks.|$|R
40|$|Micromirror arrays are {{promising}} components for generating reflective slit masks in future multiobject spectrographs. The micromirrors, 100 μm times 200 μm in size, are etched in bulk single crystal silicon, whereas a hidden suspension is realized by surface micromachining. The micromirrors are actuated electrostatically by electrodes {{located on a}} second chip. The use of silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers for both mirror and electrode chip ensures thermal compatibility for cryogenic operation. A system of multiple landing beams has been developed, which latches the mirror at a well-defined tilt angle when actuated. Arrays of 5 times 5 micromirrors have been realized. The tilt angle obtained is 20 deg at a pull-in voltage of 90 V. Measurements with an optical profiler showed that the tilt angle of the <b>actuated</b> and <b>locked</b> mirror is stable with a precision of 1 arcmin over a range of 15 V. This locking system makes the tilt angle independent from process variations across the wafer and, thus, provides uniform tilt angle over the whole array. The surface quality of the mirrors in actuated state is better than 10 -nm peak to valley and the local roughness is about 1 -nm root mean square...|$|R

The direct {{position}} analysis (DPA) of a manipulator is the computation of the end-effector poses (positions and orientations) compatible with assigned {{values of the}} actuated-joint variables. Assigning the actuated-joint variables corresponds to considering the <b>actuated</b> joints <b>locked,</b> which makes the manipulator a structure. The solutions of the DPA of a manipulator one-to-one correspond to the assembly modes of the structure that is generated by locking the actuated-joint variables of that manipulator. Determining the assembly modes of a structure means solving the DPA of a large family of manipulators since the same structure can be generated from different manipulators. This paper provides an algorithm that determines all the assembly modes of two structures with the same topology which are generated from two families of mechanisms: one planar and the other spherical. The topology of these structures is constituted of nine links (one quaternary link, four ternary links and four binary links) connected through twelve revolute pairs to form four closed loops.

40|$|A Seat Track Attach Mechanism (SAM) is a multiple-use {{clamping}} device {{intended for use}} in mounting various objects on the standard seat tracks used on the International Space Station (ISS). The basic SAM design could also be adapted to other settings in which seat tracks are available: for example, SAM-like devices {{could be used as}} universal aircraft-seat-track mounting clamps. A SAM (see figure) is easily installed by inserting it in a seat track, then <b>actuating</b> a <b>locking</b> lever to clamp the SAM to the track. The SAM includes an over-center locking feature that prevents premature disengagement that could be caused by some inadvertent movements of persons or objects in the vicinity. A SAM can be installed in, or removed from, any position along a seat track, without regard for the locations of the circular access holes. Hence, one or more SAM(s) can be used to mount an object or objects on a track or a pair of tracks in an infinite number of preferred configurations. A SAM can be incorporated into a dual swivel device, so that two of the SAMs can be made to lock onto two side-by-side seat tracks simultaneously, as would be the case in a standard ISS rack bay where two side-by-side racks reside. The main benefit to using two SAMs in a side-by-side arrangement is to provide a coupled load. By picking up load points on two seat tracks, a coupled loading is created, improving the stability and strength since the load is spread to two seat tracks at a short distance...|$|R
40|$|A {{probe and}} socket {{assembly}} for {{serving as a}} mechanical interface between structures is presented. The assembly comprises a socket having a housing adapted for connection to a first supporting structure and a probe which is readily connectable to a second structure and {{is designed to be}} easily grappled and manipulated by a robotic device for insertion and coupling with the socket. Cooperable automatic locking means are provided on the probe shaft and socket housing for automatically locking the probe in the socket when the probe is inserted a predetermined distance. A second cooperable locking means on the probe shaft and housing are adapted for actuation after the probe has been inserted the predetermined distance. Actuation means mounted on the probe and responsive to the grip of the probe handle by a gripping device, such as a robot for conditioning the probe for insertion and are also responsive to release of the grip of the probe handle to <b>actuate</b> the second <b>locking</b> means to provide a hard lock of the probe in the socket...|$|R
50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making further rotation impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch <b>actuated</b> by the <b>locking</b> pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|R
