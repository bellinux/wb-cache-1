30|$|Microbial species grow on a {{wide variety}} of {{surfaces}}, i.e., inert or living. Inert surfaces include piping systems (biofilms on noncellular materials), medical devices (biofilms composed of microorganisms with blood components) and living tissues, which have served as surfaces for the development of biofilms and consist of single or mixed populations of microorganisms. Single species of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermides and enterococci) and gram-negative (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Vibrio cholerae) bacteria were widely reported for biofilm formation. However, multiple species populations of microorganisms have been reported preponderantly in biofilms (O’Toole et al. 2000; Prakash et al. 2003). Microorganisms that form biofilms show elaborate growth by increasing their antibiotic resistance through gene regulation. Microorganisms reflect unique inhabitance in biofilms with enhanced defense mechanisms against therapeutic agents and drugs, and they relieve their survival under sessile conditions (osmotic stress, desiccation, UV radiation and pH changes) (Prakash et al. 2003; Sharma et al. 2015; Bogino et al. 2013; Simoes et al. 2010). Some dyes are used to visualize biofilm formation, i.e., safarinin and crystal violet. The term surface <b>attachment</b> <b>defective</b> (sad) is used for the group of mutant microorganisms unable to form biofilms (O’Toole et al. 2000). Heterogeneity of the biofilm matrix is one of the distinctive features that maintain the nutritional requirement of biofilms. The matrix is composed of polysaccharides, macromolecules and water, which provide heterogeneity and form enclosed exopolysaccharides in cells; these structures protect the biofilms from the external environment (O’Toole et al. 2000; Prakash et al. 2003). In biofilms, microorganisms are hugely differentiated compared to free-swimming organisms and form multicellular (microcolony) complex structures with interstitial voids (Sivan et al. 2006). Microorganisms are present on the upper layer of biofilms and actively dividing compared to microbes in proximity to the surface and also differ in metabolism. Interstitial voids (water channels) in the matrix help to separate the microbial colonies and facilitate diffusion of nutrients, water, gases, enzymes, waste, signals, etc., throughout the biofilms. The heterogeneity in a matrix is visible in both kinds of biofilms, i.e., single species populations of microbial biofilms and mixed species populations of microbial biofilms (Prakash et al. 2003; Bogino et al. 2013). The structural components, i.e., curli fimbriae, extracellular polymeric substances, outer membrane proteins, flagella and pili, hugely participate and are important for biofilm formation. The relieve form biofilms of flagellated motile bacteria compared to non-motile bacteria and other structural components such as curli and mannose sensitive type I, IV pili (TfP) encoding genes also play an important role in cell-cell or cell-surface attachments. Type IV pili play a significant role in bacterial motility on the surface and are important for quorum sensing. OmpR is reported to be a functional gene that promotes biofilm formation (Prakash et al. 2003; O’Toole et al. 2000; Bogino et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) may have great {{potential}} for cell-based therapies of osteoarthritis. However, after injection in the joint, only few cells adhere to defective articular cartilage and contribute to cartilage regenera-tion. Little {{is known about the}} molecular mechanisms of MSC <b>attachment</b> to <b>defective</b> articular cartilage. Here, we developed an ex vivo attachment system, using rat osteochondral explants with artificially created full-thickness cartilage defects in combination with genetically labeled MSC isolated from bone marrow of human pla-cental alkaline phosphatase transgenic rats. Binding of MSC to full-thickness cartilage lesions was improved by serum, but not hyaluronic acid, and was dependent on the presence of divalent cations. Additional in vitro tests showed that rat MSC attach, in a divalent cation-dependent manner, to collagen I, collagen II, and fibronectin, but not to collagen XXII or cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). RGD peptides partially blocked the ad-hesion of MSC to fibronectin in vitro and to cartilage lesions ex vivo. Furthermore, the attachment of MSC to col-lagen I and II in vitro and to cartilage lesions ex vivo was almost completely abolished {{in the presence of a}} b 1 integrin blocking antibody. In conclusion, our data suggest that attachment of MSC to ex vivo full-thickness car-tilage lesions is almost entirely b 1 integrin-mediated, whereby both RGD- and collagen-binding integrins are in-volved. These findings suggest a key role of integrins during MSC <b>attachment</b> to <b>defective</b> cartilage and may pave the way for improved MSC-based therapies in the future.

In 1981, at a Sloan Conference in Amherst, Kennedy pointed out that although this equivalence between re-inspection and syntactic correction seems plausible, it also involves a paradox. This can be illustrated by considering a sentence such as: ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryProper {{chromosome}} segregation in mitosis relies on correct kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) interactions. The KT initially {{interacts with the}} lateral surface of a single MT (lateral attachment) extending from a spindle pole and is subsequently anchored at the plus end of the MT (end-on attachment) [1]. The conversion from lateral to end-on attachment is crucial because end-on attachment is more robust [2 – 4] and thought to be necessary to sustain KT-MT attachment when tension is applied across sister KTs upon their biorientation [1]. The mechanism for this conversion is still elusive. The Ndc 80 complex is {{an essential component of}} the KT-MT interface [1, 5], and here we studied a role of the Ndc 80 loop region, a distinct motif looping out from the coiled-coil shaft of the complex [6], in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With deletions or mutations of the loop region, the lateral KT-MT attachment occurred normally; however, subsequent conversion to end-on <b>attachment</b> was <b>defective,</b> leading to failure in sister KT biorientation. The Ndc 80 loop region was required for Ndc 80 -Dam 1 interaction and KT loading of the Dam 1 complex, which in turn supported KT tethering to the dynamic MT plus end [3, 7]. The Ndc 80 loop region, therefore, has {{an important role in the}} conversion from lateral to end-on attachment, a crucial maturation step of KT-MT interaction...|$|R
40|$|Defects in chromosome-microtubule {{attachment}} trigger spindle-checkpoint activation {{and delay}} mitotic progression(1, 2). How microtubule attachment is sensed and {{integrated into the}} steps of checkpoint-signal amplification is poorly understood. In a functional genomic screen targeting human kinases and phosphatases, we identified a microtubule affinity-regulating kinase kinase, TAO 1 (also known as MARKK) as an important regulator of mitotic progression, required for both chromosome congression and checkpoint-induced anaphase delay. TAO 1 interacts with the checkpoint kinase BubR 1 and promotes enrichment of the checkpoint protein Mad 2 at sites of <b>defective</b> <b>attachment,</b> providing evidence for a regulatory step that precedes the proposed Mad 2 -Mad 1 dependent checkpoint- signal amplification step(3). We propose that the dual functions of TAO 1 in regulating microtubule dynamics and checkpoint signalling may help to coordinate the establishment and monitoring of correct congression of chromosomes, thereby protecting genomic stability in human cells...|$|R
40|$|Microtubules play {{multiple}} {{roles in}} a wide range of cellular phenomena, including cell polarity establishment and chromosome segregation. A number of microtubule regulators have been identified, including microtubule-associated proteins and kinases, and knowledge of these factors has contributed to our molecular understanding of microtubule regulation of each relevant cellular process. The known regulators, however, are insufficient to explain how those processes are linked to one another, underscoring the need to identify additional regulators. To find such novel mechanisms and microtubule regulators, we performed a screen that combined genetics and microscopy for fission yeast mutants defective in microtubule organization. We isolated approximately 900 mutants showing defects in either microtubule organization or the nuclear envelope, and these mutants were classified into 12 categories. We particularly focused on one mutant, kis 1, which displayed spindle defects in early mitosis. The kis 1 mutant frequently failed to assemble a normal bipolar spindle. The responsible gene encoded a kinetochore protein, Mis 19 (also known as Eic 1), which localized to the interface of kinetochores and spindle poles. We also found that the inner kinetochore proteins Mis 6 /CENP-I and Cnp 1 /CENP-A were delocalized from kinetochores in the kis 1 cells and that kinetochore-microtubule <b>attachment</b> was <b>defective.</b> Another mutant, mis 6, also displayed similar spindle defects. We conclude that Kis 1 is required for inner kinetochore organization, through which Kis 1 ensures kinetochore-microtubule attachment and spindle integrity. Thus, we propose an unexpecte...|$|R
30|$|For {{synthesis}} of CNTs, sample is heated from room temperature to 775  °C {{in the presence}} of argon gas, and at required growth temperature achieved, hydrocarbon sources are supplied inside the chamber. We supplied argon gas to prevent the catalyst from oxidization [25]. Since iron oxides do not benefit CNTs growth, therefore, precaution was also taken to avoid any deposition of oxides on the metal surface. Even if there is any oxide layer deposited on the iron catalyst surface before loading in CVD chamber, it gets cleaned during heating process {{in the presence of}} argon atmosphere. At the time of investigation of catalyst particles by HRSEM, HRTEM and EDX, we unloaded the samples subjected to different temperature increasing rates in argon atmosphere without providing hydrocarbon source. After unloading for investigation, these catalyst particles come in open atmosphere and, hence, become oxidized due to oxygen <b>attachment</b> on the <b>defective</b> sites on the top surface of the iron catalyst particles.|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{cultures}} of mouse L-cells {{are similar to}} those of normal cells in showing contact inhibition of movement and topoinhibition of growth. In mixed cultures with untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, their parent strain, however, L cells are able to form colonies above the monolayer of normal fibroblasts, i. e., they have a property characteristic of transformed cells. Analysis of microcinematographic data suggests that the behavior of L cells in mixed cultures is a result of their <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> to the substratum. Scanning electron microscopy showed that attachment of a normal fibroblast was accompanied by the formation of a wide ring of flattened cytoplasm spread on the substratum (lamellar cytoplasm). This structure was observed to disintegrate in newly attached L cells. The structure of the lamellar cytoplasm remained abnormal in the fully spread L cells. The mean area of lamellar cytoplasm was 3 - to 4 -times less in L cells than in normal fibroblasts...|$|R
40|$|Particles of most {{virus species}} {{accurately}} package a single genome, {{but there are}} indications that the pleomorphic particles of parainfluenza viruses incorporate multiple genomes. We characterized a stable measles virus mutant that efficiently packages at least two genomes. The first genome is recombinant and codes for a <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> protein with an appended domain interfering with fusion-support function. The second has one adenosine insertion in a purine run that interrupts translation of the appended domain and restores function. In that genome, a one base deletion in a different purine run abolishes polymerase synthesis, but restores hexameric genome length, thus ensuring accurate RNA encapsidation, which is necessary for efficient replication. Thus, the two genomes are complementary. The infection kinetics of this mutant indicate that packaging of multiple genomes does not negatively affect growth. We also show that polyploid particles are produced in standard infections at no expense to infectivity. Our results illustrate how the particles of parainfluenza viruses efficiently accommodate cargoes of different volume, and suggest a mechanism by which segmented genomes may have evolved...|$|R
40|$|Kinetochores (KTs) {{assemble}} on centromeric DNA, bi-orient paired sister chromatids on spindle microtubules (MTs) {{and control}} cell-cycle progression via the spindle assembly checkpoint. Genetic and biochemical studies in budding yeast have established that three ‘linker' complexes, MIND, COMA and NDC 80, play essential but distinct roles in KT assembly and chromosome segregation. To determine whether similar linker activities are present at human KTs, we have compared {{the functions of}} Nnf 1 R and Mcm 21 R, recently identified MIND and COMA subunits, and Nuf 2 R, a well-characterized NDC 80 subunit. We find that the three proteins bind to KTs independent {{of each other and}} with distinct cell-cycle profiles. MT–KT attachment is aberrant in Nnf 1 R- and Mcm 21 R-depleted cells, whereas it is lost in the absence of Nuf 2 R. <b>Defective</b> <b>attachments</b> in Nnf 1 R-depleted cells prevent chromosome congression, whereas those in Mcm 21 R-depleted cells interfere with spindle assembly. All three human KT proteins are necessary for correct binding of spindle checkpoint proteins to KTs. The differing functions and KT-binding properties of Nnf 1 R, Mcm 21 R and Nuf 2 R suggest that, like their yeast counterparts, the proteins act independent of each other in KT assembly, but that their combined activities are required for checkpoint signaling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe unique {{cell wall}} of {{mycobacteria}} {{is essential to}} their viability and the target of many clinically used anti-tuberculosis drugs and inhibitors under development. Despite intensive efforts to identify the ligase(s) responsible for the covalent attachment {{of the two major}} heteropolysaccharides of the mycobacterial cell wall, arabinogalactan (AG) and peptidoglycan (PG), the enzyme or enzymes responsible have remained elusive. We here report on the identification of the two enzymes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CpsA 1 (Rv 3267) and CpsA 2 (Rv 3484), responsible for this function. CpsA 1 and CpsA 2 belong to the widespread LytR-Cps 2 A-Psr (LCP) family of enzymes that has been shown to catalyze a variety of glycopolymer transfer reactions in Gram-positive bacteria, including the attachment of wall teichoic acids to PG. Although individual cpsA 1 and cpsA 2 knock-outs of M. tuberculosis were readily obtained, the combined inactivation of both genes appears to be lethal. In the closely related microorganism Corynebacterium glutamicum, the ortholog of cpsA 1 is the only gene involved in this function, and its conditional knockdown leads to dramatic changes in the cell wall composition and morphology of the bacteria due to extensive shedding of cell wall material in the culture medium as a result of <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> of AG to PG. This work marks an important step in our understanding of the biogenesis of the unique cell envelope of mycobacteria and opens new opportunities for drug development...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of Agrobacterium tumefaciens mutants with Tn 5 insertions in chromosomal DNA {{showed that the}} chromosome of A. tumefaciens codes for a specific ability of this bacterium to attach to plant cells. This ability is associated with tumorigenesis by A. tumefaciens, the ability of avirulent A. tumefaciens to inhibit tumorigenesis, {{and the ability to}} adsorb certain phages. A second class of chromosomal mutations affects tumorigenesis without altering the ability to attach to plant cells. The attachment of A. tumefaciens to plant cells was assayed by mixing radiolabeled bacteria with suspensions of tobacco tissue culture cells or freshly isolated Zinnia leaf mesophyll cells. Under the conditions of this assay, an avirulent Ti plasmid-cured strain attached to the same extent as the same strain containing pTiB 6806. Six of eight avirulent mutants with Tn 5 insertions in chromosomal DNA showed <b>defective</b> <b>attachment,</b> whereas two retained wild-type attachment ability. In contrast to the strains showing wild-type attachment, the attachment-defective mutants failed to inhibit tumorigenesis when inoculated onto Jerusalem artichoke slices before inoculation of a virulent strain and also showed a loss of sensitivity to two Agrobacterium phages. The loss of phage sensitivity appeared to be due to a loss of ability to adsorb the phages. Staining with Calcofluor indicated that the mutants retained the ability to synthesize cellulose fibrils, which have been implicated in the attachment process. Southern filter hybridizations demonstrated that each mutant contained a single Tn 5 insertion, and genetic linkage between the Tn 5 insertion in one mutant and the attachment phenotype has also been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{described in}} this thesis have investigated the mitotic function of a protein complex called the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC). The CPC {{is required for the}} detection and correction of defective (non bi-oriented) microtubule-kinetochore attachments, spindle checkpoint function and cytokinesis. First, a specific role for the CPC-subunit Survivin within the complex was found. Survivin, through binding to the NH 2 -terminus of INCENP, directs the CPC to the centromeres and central spindle during mitosis. As such, Survivin {{plays an important role in}} localising the enzymatic core of the CPC, the Aurora-B kinase, at the right place at the right time during mitosis to allow it to function properly. Additionally, it was found that the CPC plays two separatable roles in response to <b>defective</b> <b>attachments.</b> First, it destabilises such attachments and creates unattachments and second, it is required to strengthen the checkpoint signal to sustain an efficient arrest. Importantly, a specific domain in INCENP is required for the second function of the CPC. Finally, experimental evidence is provided that restriction of the CPC from the kinetochore upon bi-orientation of chromosomes is required for checkpoint silencing and mitotic progression. By fusing INCENP to the centromeric protein CENP-B, the CPC could not be separated from the kinetechore upon bi-orientation. Additionally, the CPC is normally partially displaced from bi-oriented chromosomes during metaphase. This displacement is impaired upon expression of the fusion. Thus, partial displacement and spatial restriction cooperatively act to restrict CPC activity upon bi-orientation to allow spindle checkpoint silencing during metaphase and mitotic progression...|$|R
40|$|The ancient {{bacterial}} lineage Thermus spp has {{a primitive}} form of outer membrane {{attached to the}} cell wall through SlpA, a protein that shows intermediate properties between S-layer proteins and outer membrane (OM) porins. In E. coli and related Proteobacteria, porins are secreted through the BAM (b-barrel assembly machinery) pathway, whose main component is BamA. A homologue to this protein is encoded in all the Thermus spp so far sequenced, so we wondered if this pathway could be responsible for SlpA secretion in this ancient bacterial model. To analyse this hypothesis, we attempted to get mutants on this BamA th of T. thermophilus HB 27. Knockout and deletion mutants lacking the last 10 amino acids were not viable, whereas its depletion {{by means of a}} BamA antisense RNA lead <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> to the cell wall of its OM-like envelope. Such defects were related to defective folding of the SlpA protein that was more sensitive to proteases than in a wild-type strain. A similar phenotype was found in mutants lacking the terminal Phe of SlpA. Further protein–protein interaction assays con-ﬁrmed the existence of speciﬁc binding between SlpA and BamA th. Taking together, these data suggest that SlpA is secreted through a BAM-like pathway in this ancestral bacterial lineage, supporting an ancient origin of this pathway before the evolution of the Proteobacteria.

40|$|Although {{the genetic}} {{regulation}} of vertebrate myogenesis during early {{development has been}} well studied, the intrinsic mechanisms controlling muscle fiber-type specification and maturation are much less understood. Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) are potent regulators of myoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro. However, their in vivo functions in myogenesis {{have yet to be}} fully elucidated. This study was prompted by the discovery of Fgf 10 expression in adult mouse skeletal muscles. Using an Fgf 10 -nLacZ reporter line, I set out to characterize this novel expression pattern in order to learn more about Fgf 10 ’s putative function/s. I have shown that intriguingly Fgf 10 is only expressed in a subset of adult muscles, which are predominantly fasttwitch. The expression begins during late embryonic development, but is subsequently conserved and restricted to the same muscles throughout adult life. Moreover, within each positive muscle, only a subset of myofibers expresses Fgf 10. Immunolabeling with Pax 7 antibodies showed that a subpopulation of Fgf 10 -expressing myonuclei expresses this satellite stem cell marker. To delineate the function of Fgf 10, I examined the limbs of newborn Pax 3 - Cre::Fgf 10 (flox/-) double transgenic mice, and I discovered that myofiber growth was impaired in Fgf 10 -expressing muscles. Moreover, the distal myofiber organization was severely disorganized in certain muscles, indicating <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> to the bone. This suggested that Fgf 10 might also be regulating tendon development. Collectively, these studies suggest that Fgf 10 plays diverse roles in the developing musculoskeletal system, including the formation and maturation of fast fibers, and also in tendon development. Fgf 10 may also play a role in muscle regeneration in response to injury, however this 3 remains to be tested in physiological challenge and regeneration paradigms in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii is a metabolically {{versatile}} pathogen {{that causes}} severe infections in compromised patients. However, {{little is known}} about the genes and factors involved in its basic physiology and virulence properties. Insertion mutagenesis was used to initiate the identification and characterization of some of these factors and genes in the prototype strain 19606. The utilization of the pLOFKm suicide delivery vector, which harbors a suicide mini-Tn 10 derivative, proved to be unsuccessful for this purpose. The EZ::TN 〈R 6 Kγori/KAN- 2 〉 Tnp transposome system available from Epicentre was then used in conjunction with electroporation to generate isogenic insertional derivatives of A. baumannii 19606. Replica plating showed that 2 % of the colonies that grew after electroporation on agar plates without antibiotics also grew in the presence of 40 μg of kanamycin per ml. DNA hybridization proved that all of the kanamycin-resistant derivatives contained the EZ::TN 〈R 6 Kγori/KAN- 2 〉 insertion element, which was mapped to different genomic locations. Replica plating on Simmons citrate agar and microtiter plate-plastic tube assays identified growth- and biofilm-defective derivatives, respectively. The location of the insertion in several of these derivatives was determined by self-ligation of NdeI- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA and electroporation of Escherichia coli TransforMax EC 100 D (pir+). Sequence analysis of the recovered plasmids showed that some of the A. baumannii 19606 growth-defective derivatives contain insertions within genes encoding activities required for the generation of energy and cell wall components and for the biosynthesis of amino acids and purines. A gene encoding a protein similar to the GacS sensor kinase was interrupted in four derivatives, while another had an insertion in a gene coding for a hypothetical sensor kinase. A. baumannii 19606 derivatives with <b>defective</b> <b>attachment</b> or biofilm phenotypes had insertions within genes that appear to be part of a chaperone-usher transport system described for other bacteria. DNA hybridization experiments showed that the presence of strain 19606 genes encoding regulatory and attachment or biofilm functions is widespread among other A. baumannii clinical isolates...|$|R
