6000|$|There {{seem to be}} two {{distinct}} ways of answering {{the first of the}} questions I have noted. They do not necessarily contradict each other. Of course the war is being largely paid for immediately out of the accumulated private wealth of the past. We are buying off the [...] "hold-up" [...] of the private owner upon the material and resources we need, and paying in paper money and war loans. This is not in itself an impoverishment of the community. The wealth of individuals is not the wealth of nations; the two things may easily be contradictory when the rich man's wealth consists of land or natural resources or franchises or privileges the use of which he reluctantly yields for high prices. The conversion of held-up land and material into workable and actively used material in exchange for national debt may be indeed a positive increase in the wealth of the community. And what is happening in all the belligerent countries is the taking over of {{more and more of the}} realities of wealth from private hands and, in exchange, the contracting of great masses of debt to private people. The nett tendency is towards the disappearance of a reality holding class and the destruction of realities in warfare, and the appearance of a vast rentier class in its place. At the end of the war much material will be destroyed for evermore, transit, food production and industry will be everywhere enormously socialised, and the country will be liable to pay every year in interest, a sum of money exceeding the entire national expenditure before the war. From the point of view of the state, and disregarding material and moral damages, that annual interest is the <b>annual</b> <b>instalment</b> of the price to be paid for the war.|$|E
6000|$|A further sum of uncertain, but {{substantial}} amount, {{would go}} to [...] the Irish exchequer from another source, to which we have now to [...] turn. With the proposals for self-government were coupled [...] proposals for a settlement of the land question. The ground-work [...] was an option offered to the landlords of being bought out under [...] {{the terms of the}} Act. The purchaser was to be an Irish state [...] authority, as the organ representing the legislative body. The [...] occupier was to become the proprietor, except in the congested [...] districts, where the state authority was to be the proprietor. The [...] normal price was to be twenty years’ purchase of the net rental. [...] The most important provision, in one sense, was that which [...] recognised the salutary principle that the public credit should [...] not be resorted to on such a scale as this merely for the benefit [...] of a limited number of existing cultivators of the soil, without [...] any direct advantage to the government as representing the [...] community at large. That was effected by making the tenant pay an [...] <b>annual</b> <b>instalment,</b> calculated on the gross rental, while the state [...] authority would repay to the imperial treasury a percentage [...] calculated on the net rental, and the state authority would pocket [...] the difference, estimated to be about 18 per cent. on the sum [...] payable to the selling landlord. How was all this to be secured? [...] Principally, on the annuities paid by the tenants who had [...] purchased their holdings, and if the holdings did not satisfy the [...] charge, then on the revenues of Ireland. All public revenues [...] whatever were to be collected by persons appointed by the Irish [...] government, but these collectors were to pay over all sums that [...] came into their hands to an imperial officer, to be styled a [...] receiver-general. Through him all rents and Irish revenues [...] whatever were to pass, and not a shilling was to be let out for [...] Irish purposes until their obligations to the imperial exchequer [...] had been discharged.|$|E
