Real time and non-real time data created for various purposes, present in different formats has to be exploited and fused. The Coalition Shared Data (CSD) concept makes the interoperable sharing of ISR {{data and information}} possible. The concept itself and a technical approach for it were developed within the multinational projects CAESAR, MAJIIC and MAJIIC 2 and tested in coalition exercises. The interfaces of software systems providing <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>CSD</b> data must allow the user to intuitively use the system and form a substantial part with regard to user acceptance. We describe different systems and approaches we designed and developed <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>CSD</b> data that can locate and present the data to the user based on his specific demands. Visualization forms {{an important part of}} these systems which share the common challenge of representing data and information with spatial and temporal attributes. The visualization of data and information has to be designed in a manner that supports efficient access, discovery and optionally additional processing (such as filtering and sorting). Given the large amount of data and information that may be available, visualization taking into account their quality and inherent uncertainty is an additional challenge. This publication provides an overview of the systems and approaches we developed <b>to</b> present <b>CSD</b> data and identifies challenges common to these systems.

40|$|NoThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} whether or not spreading depression (CSD) propagates symmetrically along the anteroposterior axis of the cortex of mice, and <b>to</b> determine where <b>CSD</b> should be elicited to achieve a uniform exposure of the cortex to this phenomenon. Experiments were performed in halothane-anesthetized mice, with three different locations aligned 1. 5 mm from the midline used for either KCl elicitation of CSD or the recording of its propagation. Our results demonstrated that, at least in the mouse cortex, CSD propagated much more effectively from posterior to anterior regions than in the opposite direction. This feature was due to a different efficacy of propagation in the two opposite directions, and not to a reduced susceptibility of occipital regions <b>to</b> <b>CSD</b> elicitation. Heterogeneous CSD propagation constitutes a potential pitfall for neurochemical studies of post-CSD changes in mice, as brain tissue samples collected for this purpose should be uniformly exposed <b>to</b> <b>CSD.</b> Occipital sites for CSD induction are clearly optimal for this purpose. If CSD propagation is confirmed to be more effective from posterior to anterior regions in other species, this may be relevant to the pathophysiology of classical migraine because the most frequent aura symptoms (i. e., visual disturbances) originate in the occipital cortex...|$|R

40|$|Migraine is {{a common}} {{disabling}} brain disorder. A subtype of migraine with aura (familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 : FHM 2) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in α 2 Na(+),K(+) ATPase (α 2 NKA), an isoform almost exclusively expressed in astrocytes in adult brain. Cortical spreading depression (CSD), the phenomenon that underlies migraine aura and activates migraine headache mechanisms, is facilitated in heterozygous FHM 2 -knockin mice with reduced expression of α 2 NKA The mechanisms underlying an increased susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>CSD</b> in FHM 2 are unknown. Here, we show reduced rates of glutamate and K(+) clearance by cortical astrocytes during neuronal activity and reduced density of GLT- 1 a glutamate transporters in cortical perisynaptic astrocytic processes in heterozygous FHM 2 -knockin mice, demonstrating key physiological roles of α 2 NKA and supporting tight coupling with GLT- 1 a. Using ceftriaxone treatment of FHM 2 mutants and partial inhibition of glutamate transporters in wild-type mice, we obtain evidence that defective glutamate clearance can account {{for most of the}} facilitation of CSD initiation in FHM 2 -knockin mice, pointing to excessive glutamatergic transmission as a key mechanism underlying the vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>CSD</b> ignition in migraine...|$|R

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are known to}} be comorbid with migraine, and cortical spreading depression (CSD) is the most likely cause of the migraine aura. To search for possible correlations between susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>CSD</b> and anxiety we used the open field test in male Sprague-Dawley rats chronically treated with the preventive anti-migraine drugs valproate or riboflavin. Animals avoiding the central area of the open field chamber and those with less exploratory activity (i. e. rearing) were considered more anxious. After 4 weeks of treatment CSDs were elicited by application of 1 M KCl over the occipital cortex and the number of CSDs occurring over a 2 h period was compared to the previously assessed open field behavior. Higher anxiety-like behavior was significantly correlated with a higher frequency of KCl-induced CSDs. In saline-treated animals, fewer rearings were found in animals with more frequent CSDs (R=- 1. 00). The duration of ambulatory episodes in the open field center correlated negatively with number of CSDs in the valproate group (R=- 0. 83; p< 0. 005) and in riboflavin treated group (R=- 0. 69; p< 0. 05) as well as total time spent in the open field center in both groups (R=- 0. 75; p< 0. 05 and R=- 0. 58; p< 0. 1 respectively).

40|$|Cortical {{spreading}} depression (CSD) is {{a wave of}} transient intense neuronal firing {{leading to}} a long lasting depolarization block of neuronal activity. It is a proposed pathological mechanism of migraine with aura. Some molecular/cellular mechanisms of migraine with aura and of CSD have been identified studying a rare mendelian form: familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM). FHM type 1 & 2 are caused by mutations of the CaV 2. 1 Ca 2 + channel and the glial Na+ / K+ pump, respectively, leading <b>to</b> facilitation of <b>CSD</b> in mouse models mainly because of increased glutamatergic transmission/extracellular glutamate build-up. FHM type 3 mutations of the SCN 1 A gene, coding for the voltage gated sodium channel NaV 1. 1, cause gain of function of the channel and hyperexcitability of GABAergic interneurons. This leads to the counterintuitive hypothesis that intense firing of interneurons can cause <b>CSD</b> ignition. <b>To</b> test this hypothesis in silico, we developed a computational model of an E-I pair (a pyramidal cell and an interneuron), in which the coupling between the cells in not just synaptic, but takes into account also {{the effects of the}} accumulation of extracellular potassium caused by the activity of the neurons and of the synapses. In the context of this model, we show that the intense firing of the interneuron can lead <b>to</b> <b>CSD.</b> We have investigated the effect of various biophysical parameters on the transition <b>to</b> <b>CSD,</b> including the levels of glutamate or GABA, frequency of the interneuron firing and the efficacy of the KCC 2 co-transporter. The key element for CSD ignition in our model was the frequency of interneuron firing and the related accumulation of extracellular potassium, which induced a depolarization block of the pyramidal cell. Our model can be used to study other types of activities in microcircuits and of couplings between excitatory and inhibitory neurons...|$|R
