5|$|After Van Leer's death, Paul Weber served <b>as</b> <b>acting</b> {{president}} from January 1956 to August 1957, while {{still holding the}} title of Dean of Faculties; {{it was difficult to}} find a permanent replacement due to discriminatory state laws and the looming issue of integration, along with a salary gap between Georgia Tech and comparable institutions. Weber's short tenure <b>as</b> <b>acting</b> president saw significantly increased enrollment standards, efforts by the Georgia Tech Foundation to increase faculty salaries, and further campus expansion including the Alexander Memorial Coliseum, which was completed and dedicated on October 27, 1956. Weber left larger organizational changes and integration for his eventual successor. After the selection of a replacement in the University of Toledo's Dean of Engineering, Edwin D. Harrison, Weber remained a Georgia Tech administrator and was named Vice President for Planning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served <b>as</b> <b>acting</b> governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served <b>as</b> <b>acting</b> governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
