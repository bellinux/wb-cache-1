In the figure below the different valuation methods are classified by principle. The valuation of empty <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> from an income perspective is difficult, because the <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> do not generate income. It is unrealistic to use “fictive cash flows” when valuating empty <b>office</b> <b>buildings</b> on locations where there is no market demand for <b>office</b> <b>buildings.</b> Furthermore, there is one principle that is based on comparing transactions and values.
