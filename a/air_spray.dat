40|$|Background: Household {{cleaning}} products {{are associated with}} adverse respiratory health outcomes, but the cardiovascular health effects are largely unknown. Objective: We determined if long-term use of household sprays and scented products at home was associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of autonomic cardiac dysfunction. Methods: We recorded 24 -hr electrocardiograms in a cross-sectional survey of 581 Swiss adults, 1, 1 - 3, or 4 - 7 days/week, unexposed (reference) ] of using cleaning <b>sprays,</b> <b>air</b> freshening <b>sprays,</b> and scented products. Results: Decreases in 24 -hr SDNN and TP were observed with frequent use of all product types, but the strongest reductions were associated with <b>air</b> freshening <b>sprays.</b> Compared with unexposed participants, we found that using <b>air</b> freshening <b>sprays</b> 4 - 7 days/week was associated with 11 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : - 20 %, - 2 %] and 29 % (95 % CI: - 46 %, - 8 %) decreases in 24 -hr SDNN and TP, respectively. Inverse associations of 24 -SDNN and TP with increased use of cleaning <b>sprays,</b> <b>air</b> freshening <b>sprays,</b> and scented products were observed mainly in participants with obstructive lung disease (p > 0. 05 for interactions). Conclusions: In predominantly older adult women, long-term frequent use of household spray and scented products was associated with reduced HRV, which suggests {{an increased risk of}} cardiovascular health hazards.

40|$|In {{the present}} work it is {{shown that the}} {{lifetime}} of <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> thermal barrier coatings systems with high velocity oxyfuel bondcoats can be substantially extended by application of a thin <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> “flashcoat” layer onto the base, high velocity oxyfuel bondcoat. This approach allows improvement of the bondcoat roughness profile to the extent typically obtained by optimized vacuum plasma spraying. The oxidation resistance of the flashcoat strongly depends on the spray parameters used. Deviation from {{the set of the}} optimized spray parameters was found to result in early catastrophic oxidation of the flashcoat and corresponding very rapid thermal barrier coating-failure. In order to explain the thermal barrier coating lifetime variations between the various bondcoat morphologies, the roughness profiles of high velocity oxyfuel, vacuum plasma <b>sprayed</b> and <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> bondcoats were evaluated using fractal analysis. It is suggested that such an approach provides better correlation between the bondcoat morphology and thermal barrier coating-lifetime than the calculation of the arithmetic mean roughness (Ra) of the bondcoat frequently used in industrial practice...|$|R
40|$|Micro arc {{oxidation}} (MAO) layer (as bond coat) {{was successfully}} deposited on Mg- 1 %Ca alloy in KF + NaAlO 2 electrolyte. In {{order to improve}} the corrosion resistance of the conventional MAO coated Mg- 1 %Ca alloy, <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> (APS) nanostructure TiO 2 coating (as top coat with bimodal structure) was successfully applied on the aforementioned bond coat.

The positive effect of the <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> nanostructure TiO 2 coating was attributed to its mechanical isolation against aggressive medium to the MAO coating and Mg matrix.

40|$|Molybdenum {{electrical}} interconnects for thermoelectric modules {{were produced}} by <b>air</b> plasma <b>spraying</b> a 30 %CE%BCm size molybdenum powder through a laser-cut Kapton tape mask. Initial feasibility demonstrations {{showed that the}} molybdenum coating exhibited excellent feature and spacing retention (~ 170 %CE%BCm), adhered to bismuth-telluride, and exhibited electrical conductivity appropriate {{for use as a}} thermoelectric module interconnect. A design of experiments approach was used to optimize <b>air</b> plasma <b>spray</b> process conditions to produce a molybdenum coating with low electrical resistivity. Finally, a molybdenum coating was successfully produced on a fullscale thermoelectric module. After the addition of a final titanium/gold layer deposited on top of the molybdenum coating, the full scale module exhibited an electrical resistivity of 128 %CE%A 9, approaching the theoretical resistivity value for the 6 mm module leg of 112 %CE%A 9. Importantly, <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> molybdenum did not show significant chemical reaction with bismuth-telluride substrate at the coating/substrate interface. The molybdenum coating microstructure consisted of lamellar splats containing columnar grains. <b>Air</b> plasma <b>sprayed</b> molybdenum embedded deeply (several microns) into the bismuth-telluride substrate, leading to good adhesion between the coating and the substrate. Clusters of round pores (and cracks radiating from the pores) were found immediately beneath the molybdenum coating. These pores are believed to result from tellurium vaporization during the spray process where the molten molybdenum droplets (2623 %C 2 %B 0 C) transferred their heat of solidification to the substrate at the moment of impact. Substrate cooling during the molybdenum deposition process was recommended to mitigate tellurium vaporization in future studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} the {{electric}} and emission characteristics of two handheld <b>air</b> plasma <b>spray</b> generators are presented. The plasma is generated by 60 Hz periodic discharges between two concentrically cylindrical electrodes. A ring magnet is used to rotate arc discharges, which sprays outward by an air flow. The rotation of arc discharges keeps the generated plasma in non-equilibrium state and at relatively low temperature (< 55 °C). The plasma effluent yet contains high energy electrons which dissociate molecular oxygen into atomic oxygen. The emission spectroscopy of the plasma plume reveals that the plasma effluent, which carries abundant atomic oxygen, extends from the cap of the plasma spray by about 25 to 30 mm. Tests on blood droplets and smeared blood samples revealed the effectiveness and mechanism of low temperature air plasma on clotting blood. Tests on oral pathogens show that air plasma creates a zone of microbial growth inhibition in each of six treated samples, including those of grampositive bacteria and fungi, and on a cultivating biofilm sample of Streptococcus mutans UA 159. The medical applications of the <b>air</b> plasma <b>sprays</b> for 1) bleeding control, 2) wound healing, and 3) dental disinfection, are then illustrated and discussed.
