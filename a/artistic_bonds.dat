Farnham: Ashgate, forthcoming, 2014. My {{intentions}} {{in this chapter}} are to examine the ideologies that historically emerged from biographies of some of Western art-music’s most treasured personages precisely by marginalising the secondary characters that Catherine Peters has described as being those ‘lived {{in the shadow of}} the main subject, often paralleling or contrasting with it’. I aim not to question the portrayal of the principal protagonists so much as that of specific females with whom they were associated, and whose union was presented as deriving from shared <b>artistic</b> <b>bonds,</b> with the woman assuming the role of the composer’s ‘muse’. Though silenced and largely invisible throughout much of the text, these ancillary figures typically came into view at critical junctures in the biographies, as signifiers of the productivity and increasing creative power of their accompanying male composer; moreover, they were depicted as having inspired that person to acts of artistic greatness. While in some respects, such practices may reflect the generic expectation for biography to provide an engaging, novelistic reading experience, in the field of music – in which female ‘heroes’ were very few and far between, and little cultural space existed for anything more than a select handful of exalted men – an ideologically-loaded pattern developed in the course of the nineteenth century over and above that recognisable in other disciplines. This is the model to which I refer as the ‘myth of the muse’ or, to repeat a term I have used elsewhere, the ‘muse paradigm’. Following the lead of recent scholarship on mythology, in this context the word ‘myth’ is used not to denote a widely-held misconception with limited factual basis, so much as the ways in which information has been selected and reported to facilitate the dissemination, perpetuation and elaboration of cherished narratives that functioned to reinforce particular cultural values within their interpretive communities...|$|E

40|$|The text forms {{a part of}} a {{recently}} published novel by Marek Sołtysik, Roman Maciejewski. Dwa życia jednego artysty (Roman Maciejewski. Two lives of one artist). The presented chapter Droga do Karola Szymanowskiego (Road to Karol Szymanowski) tells about the relationship between Szymanowski and Roman Maciejewski, a Polish composer, virtuoso pianist and the former’s student, expelled from the Warsaw Academy of Music for his support for Szymanowski, the then rector of the Academy. During his stay in Geneva at home of his would-be father-in-law, Ludwik Rajchman, Maciejewski, already an acclaimed musician, is informed about the approaching death of terminally ill Szymanowski and rushes to Lausanne to the latter’s deathbed. His own health problems prevent him from arriving earlier than several hours after Szymanowski’s demise. The untimely, although predictable, loss of a friend, mentor and source of inspiration evokes numerous recollections of the deceased, with whom Maciejewski has formed a strong <b>artistic</b> <b>bond.</b> Zeszyty Naukowe TDU...|$|R

50|$|Born in Peoria, Illinois, Kluesing {{lived in}} various {{locations}} in the Midwest during her formative years. Her parents, Byron and Ginger, had two other later offspring, John and Nancy. The near Kluesing family was composed of siblings John, Alvin, Peter, Olga and Herman. Byron, Cherie's father, was a child of John's first wife along with Alvin and Millie. Cherie often mentioned the childhood influences of her great uncle Herman Kluesing, great aunt Olga Ryan and aunt Marylin Duke (daughter of Peter). Herman, an interior designer, created a sketch of World War I that is reputedly part of the Louvre's collection. Childless, Herman spent time with Marylin Duke, as well as John's other stepchildren Connie Springborn and Lucy Ihrcke. Olga was a milliner (hat designer) and Marylin Duke was a costume designer. Connie Springborn worked briefly for Marylin Duke who influenced her to attend art school at McMurry College. She later completed her studies at the Museum School at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. Cherie and her aunt Connie met later (c1983) and formed a familial and <b>artistic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|R
40|$|Finger of a Frenchman explores looking, {{and writing}} about looking: looking at {{surfaces}} and beyond them, at what is depicted and what is hidden in shadow, at how a transient chemistry of light may be fixed in colour and words. Kinloch’s poems are portraits of artists and reflections on art through five centuries of the <b>artistic</b> <b>bond</b> between Scotland and France. John Acheson, Master of the Scottish Mint, takes Mary, Queen of Scots’ portrait for the Scottish coinage, Esther Inglis paints the first self-portrait by a Scottish artist; Jean-Jacques Rousseau ticks off his portrait painter, Allan Ramsay, and Eugene Delacroix offers David Wilkie a brace of partridge for tea in Kensington. The Glasgow Boys, the Scottish Colourists and Charles Rennie Mackintosh bring the gallery into the twentieth century, where Kinloch considers the hybrid art of figures such as Ian Hamilton Finlay, Alison Watt and Douglas Gordon in analytical prose-poems. In the book’s second part, a mini-epic of a seventeenth-century priest’s Grand Tour offers a reflection {{on the nature of}} Collection itself, whether of paintings or poems, the composing of fragments into a whole...|$|R
5000|$|When {{shooting}} is finished, the director can then turn {{his or her}} full attention to collaborating with the editor and further refining the cut of the film. This is the time that is set aside where the film editor's first cut is molded to fit the director's vision. In the United States, under {{the rules of the}} Directors Guild of America, directors receive a minimum of ten weeks after completion of principal photography to prepare their first cut. While collaborating on what {{is referred to as the}} [...] "director's cut", the director and the editor go over the entire movie in great detail; scenes and shots are re-ordered, removed, shortened and otherwise tweaked. Often it is discovered that there are plot holes, missing shots or even missing segments which might require that new scenes be filmed. Because of this time working closely and collaborating [...] - [...] a period that is normally far longer and more intricately detailed than the entire preceding film production [...] - [...] many directors and editors form a unique <b>artistic</b> <b>bond.</b>|$|R
5000|$|George {{was thought}} of by his contemporaries as a prophet and a priest, {{while he thought}} of himself as a messiah of a new kingdom that would be led by {{intellectual}} or <b>artistic</b> elites, <b>bonded</b> by their faithfulness to a strong leader. In his memoirs, Albert Speer claims to have seen George in the early 1920s and that his elder brother, Hermann, was a member of his inner circle: George [...] "radiated dignity and pride and a kind of priestliness... there was something magnetic about him." ...|$|R
40|$|Conceived {{in memory}} of late Professor of Musicology of Estonian Academy of Music Urve Lippus (1950 – 2015), to honour her {{contribution}} to music history research, the article analyses transcultural relations {{and the role of}} cultural capitals to the discipline at its early phase in the university context. The focus is on the early French contacts of the founder of the institutional Finnish musicology, University of Helsinki Professor Ilmari Krohn (1867 – 1960) and his pupils. The analysis of Krohn’s mobility, networking and interaction is based on his correspondence and documentation concerning his early congress journeys to London (1891) and to Paris (1900). Two French correspondents stand out for this early phase of his career as a musicologist: Julien Tiersot in the area of comparative research on traditional music, and Georges Houdard concerning Gregorian chant and neume notation. By World War I Krohn was quite well-read in French-language musicology. But Paris was for him also a stronghold for international networking more generally. Accomplished musicians, Krohn and his musicology students Armas Launis, Leevi Madetoja and Toivo Haapanen even had an <b>artistic</b> <b>bond</b> with French repertoires. My results contradict the claim that early Finnish musicology was an exclusive domain of German influences...|$|R
50|$|In November 2009, <b>Artistic</b> Director Jez <b>Bond</b> and Creative Director Melli Marie {{acquired}} a disused three-storey office building at 11-13 Clifton Terrace. Planning permission was granted in October 2010. The theatre {{was designed by}} David Hughes.

50|$|Myanmar is {{the focus}} of a broader <b>artistic</b> {{initiative}} by <b>Bond</b> Street Theatre involving ongoing creative work with Burmese refugees in Bangladesh and Thailand. Prolonged conflict between the Myanmar government and many internal ethnic groups has resulted in mass-migrations to neighboring countries. Bond Street Theatre created a play with the Gitameit Music School combining traditional and modern forms of Burmese theatre with its own physical-visual theatre style to perform in Myanmar and in the surrounding refugee areas.|$|R
50|$|Nothing {{is known}} of <b>Bond's</b> <b>artistic</b> career until 1761, when he {{exhibited}} a landscape drawing after Claude Joseph Vernet at the Society of Artists in London. Between 1762 and 1769 he exhibited over 30 landscapes at the rooms of the Free Society of Artists, exhibiting further works in 1775 and 1780. He won 25 guineas in 1764 for the second best landscape in the exhibition, and in 1765 he won 50 guineas for the first prize.|$|R
40|$|Esta pesquisa propõe o entendimento de registro em dança como um possível ato coreográfico capaz de ações ativadoras/atualizadoras da memória da dança a partir dela mesma. Este estudo deseja ainda perceber a ação do registro coreográfico como uma prática politicamente implicada em seu contexto e em sua história, tendo em vista suas escolhas estéticas e procedimentais. Para o uso da noção de coreografia, bem como para as discussões contemporâneas sobre registro nas artes, foram acessados principalmente textos dos autores Luís Cláudio Costa (2009), Jacques Rancière (2005), Giorgio Agamben (2009) e André Lepecki (2007 / 2010 / 2013). Estes conceitos se desenvolvem na análise da obra “Retrospectiva” (2012) do coreógrafo Xavier Le Roy, que reorganizou os seus solos já realizados em uma nova construção compositiva. Metodologicamente, a análise dessa obra vale-se de parâmetros teóricos desenvolvidos pela pesquisadora sérvia Bojana Cvejić (2013), para quem é possível desmembrar a noção de {{performance}} em três processos de diferentes durações - o criar, o performar e o assistir - que acarretam experiências distintas entre si. A escolha da criação de Le Roy como foco central desta dissertação se respalda também no fato de o autor desta pesquisa ter se relacionado com a citada obra nas três dimensões propostas por Cvejić - o criar, o performar e o assistir -, sendo possível, nessa perspectiva, potencializar o vínculo teórico e artístico da análise aqui realizada. This research {{proposes to}} understand documentation in dance {{as a possible}} choreographic act able of activate/actualize dance memories using itself as media. his study. This study also seeks to understand the action of choreographic documentation as a politically involved practice within their context and in its history, considering its aesthetic and procedural choices. For {{the use of the}} concept of choreography, as well as contemporary discussions on documentation in arts, I especially used texts from the authors Luís Cláudio Costa (2009), Jacques Rancière (2005), Giorgio Agamben (2009) e André Lepecki (2007 / 2010 / 2013). These concepts are developed in the analysis of the work "Retrospective" (2012), by Xavier Le Roy, who reorganized his preview solo works in a new compositional construction. Methodologically, the analysis of this work draws on theoretical parameters developed by the researcher Bojana Cvejic (2013), for whom it is possible to split the notion of performance in three modes of different durations - Creating, Performing and Attending - which lead to different experiences. The choice of having the Le Roy's work as the central focus of this dissertation is also supported {{by the fact that the}} author of this research have experienced this work in the three modes proposed by Cvejic - Creating, Performing and Attending - and it is possible, in this perspective, to enhance the theoretical and <b>artistic</b> <b>bond</b> of analysis invested here...|$|R
