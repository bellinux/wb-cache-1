In 2015 it resulted in 3.2 million deaths, up from 2.4 million deaths in 1990. More than 90% of these deaths occur in the developing world. The number of deaths is projected to increase further because of higher smoking rates in the developing world, and <b>an</b> <b>aging</b> <b>population</b> in many countries.

5000|$|The {{economic}} {{effects of}} <b>an</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>population</b> are considerable. Older people have higher accumulated savings per head than younger people, but spend less on consumer goods. Depending {{on the age}} ranges at which the changes occur, <b>an</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>population</b> may thus result in lower interest rates and the economic benefits of lower inflation. Because elderly people are more inflation averse, countries with more elderly tend to exhibit lower inflation rates [...] Some economists (Japan) see advantages in such changes, notably the opportunity to progress automation and technological development without causing unemployment. They emphasize a shift from GDP to personal well-being.|$|R

CBO estimated that under current law, the deficit would total $514 billion in fiscal year 2014 or 3.0% GDP. Deficits would then slowly begin rising again through 2024 due primarily to the pressures of <b>an</b> <b>aging</b> <b>population</b> and rising healthcare costs per person. The debt to GDP ratio would remain stable for much of the decade then begin rising again toward the end of the 10-year forecast window, from 74% in 2014 to 79% in 2024.|$|E
