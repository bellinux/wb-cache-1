50|$|Media {{interest}} in the association has changed over time. Although members of the BPA have previously had their actions featured on the BBC Consumer Affairs Programme Watchdog, media interest on the private parking profession has decreased since {{the introduction of the}} BPA's <b>Approved</b> <b>Operator</b> Scheme and launch of POPLA. The BPA regularly contribute to TV and radio broadcasts when private parking is debated. Consumer help websites including MoneySavingExpert.com forums, Pepipoo, Consumer Action Group also provide their own opinion on the profession.|$|R
30|$|An {{estimate}} of {{the contribution of the}} remaining parts of a mobile <b>operator’s</b> <b>organisation</b> to energy and carbon footprint can, for example, be based on corporate social responsibility reports by Vodafone and O 2, which state that the network accounts for around 80 % to 90 % of an operator’s energy consumption [29, 30] and constitutes a similar portion of its GHG emissions [31]. The GSMA Mobile Green Manifesto report [32] makes similar assumptions. We assume that these ratios also apply to the OCI network and networks of other operators in Cote d’Ivoire.|$|R

50|$|On 30 August 2012 Combined Parking Solutions (CPS) was {{suspended}} from accessing the DVLA database for three months.The suspension {{was put in}} place as a result of CPS breaking the DVLA's rules on signage for privately issued parking tickets. The rules state(s) that parking companies must not make reference to liability by anyone other than the driver. On 14 June this year, the DVLA sent a memo to the BPA about this issue and instructed them to put out a warning to their members, download here. However, CPS was subsequently found to be in breach of this instruction on at least three separate occasions, and this resulted in their suspension.Being suspended from accessing the DVLA's registered keeper database will have a major effect upon how CPS operates. Private parking companies use this database to find out who the registered keeper is of vehicles they wish to issue a ticket to so that they can send out demands for payment. Without this data, they have no way of trying to chase payment where the driver has not identified themselves (e.g. via an appeal). Further to this, the DVLA has confirmed that CPS {{will not be able to}} retrospectively gather this data after the suspension ends or via another parking company. Furthermore, shortly before CPS {{was suspended}}, the British Parking Association had only just recently appointed a Combined Parking Solutions representative to the Board of its <b>Approved</b> <b>Operator</b> Scheme. They continue to be represented on the AOS Board and no further issues have since been reported. Combined Parking Solutions ceased to be a member of the BPA in November 2014. As part of the BPA's new Governance, the AOS Board ceased to exist in 2014. <b>Approved</b> <b>Operator</b> Scheme members are now represented on the BPA's Council of Representatives.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{being open}} to foreigners, the {{government}} is {{acutely aware of the}} environmental impact tourists can have on Bhutan's unique and virtually unspoiled landscape and culture. Therefore, they have restricted the level of tourist activity from the start, preferring higher quality tourism. Until 1991, the Bhutan Tourism Corporation (BTC), a quasi-autonomous and self-financing body, implemented the government's tourism policy. The Bhutanese government, however, privatised the Corporation in October 1991, facilitating private sector investment and activity. As a result, today over 75 licensed tourist companies operate in the country. All tourists (group or individual) must travel on a planned, prepaid, guided package tour or custom designed travel program. Most foreigners cannot travel independently in the kingdom. The arrangements must be made through an officially <b>approved</b> tour <b>operator,</b> either directly or through an overseas agent.|$|R
