30|$|It is {{well-known}} that welfare programs {{in developed countries}} may have unintended effects on labor supply (Ashenfelter 1983; Moffitt 2002). Conditional Cash Transfer programs <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> However, empirical evidence from Latin American countries {{does not seem to}} be consistent with the income effect predicted by the standard model of labor supply. Evidence drawn from experimental and quasi-experimental evaluation methods is associated with the long term effects of program participation on adult labor supply. Although these empirical approaches allow researchers to accurately identify average treatment effects of welfare programs on different set of outcomes, it does not come without its drawbacks. In the specific case of adult labor supply, particular concerns should be given to general equilibrium effects potentially introduced by program’s benefits, and indirect effects generated by the reduction in child labor.|$|E

In addition, the pyridine moiety plays a significant role in many biological processes [3, 4]. Methyl-substituted pyridines, i.e., picolines, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> in the list of important biologically active substances [5]. The observed increase of biological activity with the introduction of methyl group into the heterocyclic pyridine ring inspires synthetic chemists to find new methods for the preparation of derivatives with picoline fragment [6 – 11], and biologists for the detail investigations of biological mechanisms with the use of tritium markers [12 – 14]. Elaborated nuclear-chemical method opens the horizons for synthesis of unknown and hardly available organic compounds. Presence of tritium labeling allows one-step preparation of radioactive markers for the investigation of chemical and biological processes.|$|E

40|$|Aging is {{a natural}} process {{characterized}} by a progressive functional impairment and reduced capacity to respond adaptively to environmental stimuli. Aging is associated with increased susceptibility {{to a variety of}} chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer, and neurological diseases. Lung pathologies <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception,</b> and the prevalence of several interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), primarily idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, has been found to increase considerably with age. Although our understanding of the biology of aging has advanced remarkably in the last 2 decades, the molecular mechanisms linking aging to ILD remain unclear. Immunosenescence, oxidative stress, abnormal shortening of telomeres, apoptosis, and epigenetic changes affecting gene expression have been proposed to contribute to the aging process, and aging-associated diseases. Here, we review the emerging concepts highlighting the putative aging-associated abnormalities involved in some human ILDs...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{interest}} in developing devices that can be implantable or wearable requires the identification of suitable materials for the components of these devices. Electrochemical supercapacitors <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> in this trend, and identifying electrode materials that can be not only suitable for the capacitive device but also biocompatible {{at the same time}} is important. In addition, it would be advantageous if physiological fluids could be used instead of more conventional (and often corrosive) electrolytes for implantable or wearable supercapacitors. In this study, we assess the biocompatibility of films of anodized TiO 2 nanotubes subjected to the subsequent annealing in Ar atmosphere and evaluate their capacitive performance in a physiological liquid. A biocompatibility test tracking cell proliferation on TiO 2 nanotube electrodes and electrochemical tests in 0. 01 M phosphate-buffered saline solution are discussed.

Developing countries <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception.</b> However, {{in the context of}} developing countries, the benefit of energy efficiency improvement need to be measured against a broad range of development indicators. Using a general equlibrium model of the Indonesian economy, we simulate various different energy efficiency scenarios and compare its impact not only on the amount of emissions reduction, but also on other relevant development indicators such as employment creation, poverty incidence and income distribution. The result suggests that energy efficiency improvement which leave more resource available for output expansion is employment-generating, poverty-reducing and can have a favorable distributional implication. For Indonesia, improving fuel efficiency in public road transportation and improving energy efficiency of the energy-intensive manufacturing sector has come out as the key priority areas where energy efficiency strategy should focus on.

40|$|Various {{studies have}} empirically {{shown that the}} {{majority}} of Java and Android apps misuse cryptographic libraries, causing devastating breaches of data security. Therefore, it is crucial to detect such misuses early in the development process. The fact that insecure usages <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> but the norm precludes approaches based on property inference and anomaly detection. In this paper, we present CrySL, a definition language that enables cryptography experts to specify the secure usage of the cryptographic libraries that they provide. CrySL combines the generic concepts of method-call sequences and data-flow constraints with domain-specific constraints related to cryptographic algorithms and their parameters. We have implemented a compiler that translates a CrySL ruleset into a context- and flow-sensitive demand-driven static analysis. The analysis automatically checks a given Java or Android app for violations of the CrySL-encoded rules. We empirically evaluated our ruleset through analyzing 10, 001 Android apps. Our results show that misuse of cryptographic APIs is still widespread, with 96 % of apps containing at least one misuse. However, we observed fewer of the misuses that were reported in previous work. Comment: 11 page...|$|E
