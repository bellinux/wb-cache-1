5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} her sentence, lengthened it. The three-man superior court which heard her case overturned one <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and increased her sentence from ten to thirteen years, saying that her original sentence {{had been too}} lenient.|$|E
5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way {{because she was a}} woman. This <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life and career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|While Carey's {{new musical}} {{direction}} caused tension {{between her and}} Columbia, it began to severely strain {{her relationship with her}} husband at the time, Tommy Mottola. Mottola had always been involved in Carey's career, because he was the head of Sony Music, the parent company of her label. Since the time of Carey's debut, Mottola had controlled nearly every <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career, keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle-of-the-road pop music, despite her interest in hip hop.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{creative}} team {{did not want}} the X-Men to have an all-male lineup, editor Roy Thomas suggested that Cockrum make his character Typhoon, originally designed as a male, into the woman of the group. Cockrum liked the idea, and outfitted Typhoon with The Black Cat's costume, a cape, and a new haircut with white hair. His collaborators feared that Storm’s white hair would make her look like a grandmother, but Cockrum, confident that he could consistently draw the character so that she would appear young, insisted on this <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> appearance.|$|E

25|$|Part of Cruzado's {{governing}} {{style is}} {{to seek out the}} views of others. In her first year in office, she held meetings across the state to solicit citizen views on the university. She also met one-on-one with many of the state's agricultural leaders. In September 2010 Cruzado began holding monthly luncheon meetings open to any who wished to attend, to solicit input on a variety of ideas. An example of this <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> governance style is her football stadium listening session. When she proposed spending several million dollars to expand the MSU football arena, she held a two-hour session with students to obtain their views and ensure it was what they wanted.|$|E
25|$|According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Corby {{flew out}} of Sydney {{on the same day}} (8 October 2004) as a large {{shipment}} of cocaine was shipped out of the airport by a drug ring involving corrupt baggage handlers. During the week of 9 May 2005, several arrests occurred in Australia related to cocaine smuggling through Sydney airport. Her defence claimed that the cannabis was planted in her bag by mistake by baggage handlers. However, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner, Mick Keelty, stated that a key <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> defence was not supported by the available intelligence and that the cocaine-smuggling ring which had been discovered involved the reception of shipments of drugs from overseas, not the transportation of drugs domestically.|$|E

25|$|Three {{important}} aspects of Máté's life at this time were to affect her later life and work. Firstly, she discovered her aptitude for story-telling, and often used this skill at school. Secondly, Máté formed a close friendship with a beautiful Jewish girl, Maria, who, with her raven hair, white skin and red lips, became linked in Máté's vivid imagination, alternately with Snow White and the female heroines of the Bible. It was through her association with Maria, whose family disappeared in 1938, that Máté was personally confronted with Aryan racism. The families of the two girls shared a connection with the Viennese Opera. A passionate love of song and dance was to remain with Máté all her life and influence the rhythm of her poetry. The third important aspect of this time was {{the death of her}} beloved uncle, who she nursed through his last illness, doing her homework at his desk by his bedside. This event brought her to a sudden realisation of the reality of death, {{and the fact that she}} herself would die. This was later to become an <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> poetry.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they and everyone who worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

George called her character [...] "broken", and opined that her outgoing personality is meant to cover up something else. George stated that the way she portrayed Harris was influenced by the outspokenness of Lisa Rowe, a sociopathic character from Girl, Interrupted (1999) played by Angelina Jolie.|$|E

Her performance won her widespread acclaim; Hal Hinson of The Washington Post saw Pfeiffer's role as [...] "the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used makes it seem an <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> spirituality". She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.|$|E
