5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can become law, the royal <b>assent</b> (the monarch's approval) is required. In theory, <b>assent</b> can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 <b>assent</b> has always been granted.|$|E
5|$|Before the Royal <b>Assent</b> by Commission Act of 1541 became law, <b>assent</b> {{was always}} {{required}} to be given by the sovereign in person before Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In Commonwealth realms {{other than}} the UK, royal <b>assent</b> is granted or {{withheld}} either by the realm's sovereign or, more frequently, by {{the representative of the}} sovereign, the governor-general. In federated realms, <b>assent</b> in each state, province, or territory is granted or withheld by the representatives of the sovereign. In Australia, this is the governors of the states, administrators of the territories, or the governor-general in the Australian Capital Territory. For Canada, this is the lieutenant governors of the provinces. A lieutenant governor may defer <b>assent</b> to the governor general, and the governor general may defer <b>assent</b> to federal bills to the sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Independently of {{the method}} used to signify royal <b>assent,</b> it is the {{responsibility}} of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the <b>assent</b> has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that <b>assent</b> has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the <b>assent</b> was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the <b>assent</b> was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E
5|$|Royal <b>assent</b> or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such <b>assent</b> makes the act law (promulgation) while in other nations <b>assent</b> is distinct from promulgation. In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal <b>assent</b> (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal <b>assent</b> was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|When {{the act is}} assented to by the {{sovereign}} in person, or by empowered Royal Commissioners, royal <b>assent</b> is considered given {{at the moment when}} the <b>assent</b> is declared in the presence of both houses jointly assembled. When the procedure created by the Royal <b>Assent</b> Act 1967 is followed, <b>assent</b> is considered granted when the presiding officers of both houses, having received the letters patent from the king or queen signifying the <b>assent,</b> have notified their respective house of the grant of royal <b>assent.</b> Thus, if each presiding officer makes the announcement at a different time (for instance because one house is not sitting on a certain date), <b>assent</b> is regarded as effective when the second announcement is made. This is important because, under British Law, unless there is any provision to the contrary, an act takes effect on the date on which it receives royal <b>assent</b> and that date is not regarded as being the date when the letters patent are signed, or when they are delivered to the presiding officers of each house, but the date on which both houses have been formally acquainted of the <b>assent.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{both state}} and federal realms in Australia, <b>assent</b> is used as the means of {{enforcing}} a referendum that is required. This is done by providing {{that it will not}} be lawful to even submit the law for viceregal <b>assent</b> unless and until it has been approved by the required percentage of the voting populace at a referendum.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, the {{traditional}} ceremony for granting <b>assent</b> in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long {{after it had}} been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived {{as part of a}} string of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal <b>assent</b> personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal <b>Assent</b> Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting <b>assent</b> in writing, with each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal <b>Assent),</b> was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal <b>assent</b> is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and for at least one other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal <b>assent</b> is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ {{the traditional}} ceremony where required.|$|E
5|$|In Commonwealth realms, <b>assent</b> may {{be granted}} by the {{sovereign}} in person, by the governor-general in person, or by a deputy acting for the governor-general. In all of the realms, however, <b>assent</b> is more often granted or signified outside the legislature, with each house being notified separately.|$|E
5|$|In some monarchies—such as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Thailand—promulgation is {{required}} {{as well as}} royal <b>assent.</b> In other monarchies—such as Sweden—the government officially promulgates laws. In both cases, however, the process of royal <b>assent</b> is usually a formality, whether by constitutional convention or by an explicit provision of the constitution.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a bill is {{presented}} for royal <b>assent</b> {{after it has}} passed all the required stages in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Commons may, under certain circumstances, direct that a bill be presented for <b>assent</b> despite lack of passage by the House of Lords. Officially, <b>assent</b> is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.|$|E

5|$|Royal <b>assent</b> is {{sometimes}} associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal <b>assent</b> has been granted {{at a ceremony}} held at the Palace of Westminster for this purpose. However, royal <b>assent</b> is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give <b>assent</b> either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament {{of his or her}} agreement to the bill.|$|E

Before the lordship of the Island was purchased by the British Crown in 1765 (the Revestment), the <b>assent</b> of the Lord of Mann to a bill was signified by letter to the governor. After 1765, {{the equivalent of the}} royal <b>assent</b> was at first signified by the letter from the Secretary of State to the governor; but, during the British Regency, the practice began of granting the equivalent of the royal <b>assent</b> to Manx legislation by Orders in Council, which continues to this day, though limited to exceptional cases since 1981.|$|E
5|$|The Act was {{repealed}} {{and replaced}} by the Royal <b>Assent</b> Act of 1967. However section 1(2) of that Act does not prevent the sovereign from declaring <b>assent</b> in person {{if he or she}} so desires.|$|E
