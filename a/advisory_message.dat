30|$|Altogether 205 <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> {{are issued}} {{on the six}} trips on the test track; on average 48 <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> per trip, which {{translates}} to one piece of driving advice per 2  km.|$|R
30|$|ViDCo issues <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> to {{the driver}} only when his {{operating}} behavior deviates from optimum behavior. An optimum driver would not receive any system messages at all. This strategy of fostering learning is called negative reinforcement {{in the theory of}} operant conditioning [30]. As this concept of imparting knowledge does neither aim nor expect the driver to intentionally produce <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> and thus to learn actively, it may be concluded that ViDCo aims on inducing knowledge implicitly {{to the driver}} [31, p. 49].|$|R
30|$|ViDCo’s driving {{errors and}} the {{corresponding}} <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> are categorized. Two categories of driving errors are specifically important with regard to processing in the algorithms: the type of driving error and the time-wise detectability.|$|R

The aircraft landed at a speed of 134 kn (compared to the 108 kn recommended by the manufacturer); the required stopping distance at this speed would have been more than 600 m. It struck an earthen bank and became briefly airborne again before coming to a rest in the car park of a British Car Auctions facility, directly adjacent to Blackbushe Airport.

30|$|Furthermore, {{the module}} detects and filters refusal by the driver. If a {{specific}} <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> is ignored repeatedly, {{it must be}} assumed that the driver {{is not willing to}} follow this kind of driving advice. Therefore, this <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> will be blocked and not be displayed on the current trip anymore.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, an <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> {{will only}} be given if the drop in {{velocity}} during the coasting phase is significant. This avoids driving advice which would lead to only small fuel savings while putting the driver’s acceptance at risk.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, many {{advertising}} campaigns {{attempt to}} persuade people {{to perform a}} specific behavior. In response to such messages, people can comply and adapt their behavior in the proposed direction. However, people can also experience psychological reactance, which {{may lead to the}} complete opposite of the target behavior. In the present study, we were interested in the social nature of psychological reactance. According to Social Agency Theory [12], more social cues lead to more social interaction. We suggest that this also holds for psychological reactance. We argue that there is a positive relation between the level of social agency of the source of a message and the level of psychological reactance that this message can arouse. In an online study, participants received low-controlling or high-controlling advice about energy conservation. This advice was delivered either solely as text, as text with a still picture of a robotic agent, or as text with a brief film clip of the same robotic agent. Results showed that a high-controlling <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> resulted in more reactance than a low-controlling <b>advisory</b> <b>message.</b> Confirming our expectancies, stronger social agency of the messenger led to more psychological reactance.

40|$|The {{experiment}} is an initial investigation of pilot performance when auditory <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> are presented dichotically, either {{with or without}} a concurrent pursuit task requiring visual/motor dexterity.

30|$|Tactical driving errors {{can further}} be {{classified}} into tactical-predictive and tactical-retrospective driving errors. While tactical-retrospective errors {{are not connected}} to any specific event, tactical-predictive errors are related to infrastructure objects (e.g., speed limits, downhill gradient). Therefore, retrospective advice can only be given after the occurrence of the error, whereas predictive <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> are capable of correcting the driver’s misbehavior {{in the process of}} conducting the error.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the design of an EDAS for heavy commercial vehicles—the Virtual Driving Coach (Ger. Virtueller Fahrtrainer; ViDCo)—which is capable of detecting sub-optimal driving behavior in a situation-specific manner and for some scenarios also predictively (Section  5). If ViDCo detects a state of sub-optimal driving, it outputs an <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> to the driver {{by means of a}} message on a display unit and a synthesized voice message. Since the Virtual Driving Coach continuously monitors and supports drivers during their transport assignments, this mode of assistance may be called system-based on-the-job training.|$|E
30|$|Without {{any kind}} of {{filtering}} module, the Virtual Driving Coach would issue an <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> via the display unit for each and every detected state of suboptimal driving. If a driver causes several such detections within {{a short period of}} time, she or he would be confronted with numerous messages. In order to keep the information flow from the EDAS to the driver within acceptable limits, a filtering and prioritization module (FPM) is developed. A limitation of additional mental workload is expected to {{have a positive impact on}} three aspects which therefore act as distinctive design objectives during the development process of the filtering and prioritization module (FPM): system safety, user acceptance, and system impact on learning.|$|E
40|$|Following the Alaska {{earthquake}} the Seismic Sea Wave Warning System {{issued a}} first <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> indicating {{the possibility of}} a tsunami not quite 1 1 / 2 hours after the earthquake, and a formal tsunami warning just over 3 hours after the earthquake. By the time the initial <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> was issued, all affected Alaskan communities had already been struck by the locally generated tsunamis or the initial waves of the major tsunami. Unofficial warnings led to some saving of life; more lives could have been saved if the earthquake itself or initial waves had been perceived as warnings, but at some places the waves arrived too soon for any warning to be effective. SSWWS warnings were received early enough at affected communities outside of Alaska to have induced appropriate response (except in Canada which {{was not part of the}} system). The responses varied greatly, however, from community to community, depending on the experience and understanding of system officials and of the public. Fatalities from the tsunamis totaled 103 in Alaska and 15 elsewhere. This brief summary of the warning of tsunamis associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake and of human responses to these warnings, is not intended to be comprehensive or particularly detailed. Its focus is on the general description of the range of warnings and of responses among the several communities in Alaska and elsewhere that were struck by the tsunamis or warned of possible tsunami effects. Greater detail may be found in Geography volume of this series, in which Norton and Haas (in press) have discussed the warnings and responses in various Alaskan communities and Anderson (in press) has compared the warnings and responses at Crescent City, California, and Hile, Hawaii...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} data using multiple-choice questionnaires {{to learn}} how drivers respond to traffic information {{in the form of}} <b>advisory</b> <b>messages.</b> Two experiments, comprising 112 participants, were conducted using the same technique and yielding similar results. The traffic information messages presented to participants varied in three respects; quantitativeness of information, imperativeness of advice, and timeliness of information. Two additional factors were examined; the amount of traffic congestion stated to be directly observable on the route and the stated accuracy of messages received in the past. Results obtained from the questionnaires indicate that the structure of the traffic message did influence the driver behavior. The propensity to depart from the planned route ahead of schedule was greater when respondents had; few exit options remaining, been told traffic levels were high, received accurate traffic information in the past, and had received messages which contained quantitative and/or imperative information. Traffic controllers with this knowledge of driver behavior could act to further reduce trip times and congestion by using the control tools currently available to them. The major conclusion we can draw from this study is that when possible and appropriate, <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> should contain accurate, timely, quantitative and imperative information.

30|$|The {{filter module}} ensures {{only a single}} driving error is {{forwarded}} to the output and timing module. The filter blocks driving errors regardless of the priority assigned by the prioritization module. In general, blocked errors are saved in the data memory. The data memory thus enables the FPM to issue <b>advisory</b> <b>messages</b> even though the error was committed {{in the past and}} is not active anymore. However, a delayed submission makes only sense within a restricted time period after the detection. The filtering therefore also eliminates errors which are considered inactive for too long without writing these to the data memory.|$|R

30|$|The {{priority}} of the driving errors is determined dynamically by the prioritization module. It receives active errors from the driving error detection and reads saved ones from the data memory. An algorithm assigns a rating score to each error. The higher the score, the higher the {{priority of}} the error. The rating score consists of a constant term, which is specific for each driving error, and a dynamic term. While the constant term reflects {{the importance of the}} driving error with regard to its influence on fuel consumption as well as its criticality regarding a transmission in a timely manner, the dynamic term of the score will increase over time. The dynamic rating of a saved driving error is set to an even higher score, when its status changes from active to inactive (i.e., the very same error is not detected by the driving error detection anymore). By doing so, newly inactive, saved errors are handled with a higher priority in comparison to active driving errors and are thus more likely to be issued to the driver before expiration. Only after the <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> of a corresponding driving error has been submitted to the display unit or the error has been considered inactive for too long, the driving error is removed from the data memory. As a result, the rating score is reset to its constant value.|$|E
40|$|This study {{introduces}} a Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V 2 I) architecture to enhance driver awareness at signalized intersections. The main objectives are to (i) provide a proof-of-concept field experiment {{on the use}} of V 2 I communication architecture at a signalized intersection and (ii) evaluate the impact of V 2 I communication on improving driver performance while crossing the intersection. The proposed V 2 I communication application will relay an advisory auditory message to the driver regarding the status of the traffic signal. It is expected that driver behaviour is going to change {{as a result of the}} in-vehicle audible message. Consequently, the proposed application will collect additional driver performance indicators which include information on average speed, maximum speed, and the acceleration profiles. To understand the impact of the <b>advisory</b> <b>message</b> on changing driver behaviour, a comparison was performed between the indicators with and without the in-vehicle message. Driver behavior was investigated under two scenarios, namely; as the driver heads towards a green signal and as the driver heads towards a red signal. For both scenarios, the results show that the average speed of the driver have changed significantly after turning “on” the in-vehicle messages. In addition, the maximum speed distribution shifted towards a lower value indicating decreases in maximum speeds. Moreover, the difference between the acceleration profiles near the intersection when driving with and without the message, while heading towards a red signal, was found to be significant. These preliminary results show that the proposed V 2 I communication application can have promising impacts on improving driver awareness at signalized intersections...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{explore the}} “problem of knowledge” in {{epistemology}} {{from a new}} angle. Rather than proposing conditions for when it is true or false that someone’s belief constitutes knowledge, I take as my challenge the problem of explaining why we use the words “know” and “knowledge” {{in the ways that}} we do. Ever since Edmund Gettier’s 1963 paper “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?”, epistemologists have uncovered many puzzling aspects of how we use these two words. In Chapter 2, I hypothesize that our human ancestors developed a word to urge others to be certain (or not) of particular facts. Because this word was understood to invoke objective reasons, the message conveyed was not only “I advise us to be certain that such-and-such” but also (at least implicitly) “I would advise anyone in a position similar to ours to do likewise”. I suggest that our word “know” is the descendant of this ancestral word, and continues to carry a “prospective” <b>advisory</b> <b>message.</b> I show that this hypothesis accounts for several features of our word “know”, such as that we apply it only when truth, certainty, and justification are present. In Chapters 3 and 4, I use the hypothesis to explain why philosophers have the verdicts they do on many puzzling cases of “true belief without knowledge” that have been discussed in the epistemology literature. In Chapter 5, I use my hypothesis to explain the results of several recent experiments conducted to test non-philosophers’ judgments about these same cases. In Chapter 6, I conclude that my hypothesis is the best available explanation for all of the puzzling features of our modern-day uses of “know”. We should thereby provisionally accept that my hypothesis (or something like it) gives the truth about the development and functioning of our word “know”. Although my hypothesis belongs to the domains of evolutionary biology and social-cognitive psychology, I argue that it also counts as a piece of philosophy: It helps us to understand puzzling features of our lives, not for any instrumental reason but simply for the sake of understanding...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of the Met Office global model in the prediction of tropical cyclone tracks was first evaluated in 1988. At that time the representation of most tropical cyclones in the model was fairly poor due to the low model resolution (about 150 km in the horizontal at mid-latitudes) and the sparsity of data over the tropical oceans. Hence, a simple scheme was introduced to help initialise tropical cyclones in the global model. The system was used {{at the discretion of}} the forecaster and was based on information available from tropical cyclone <b>advisory</b> <b>messages.</b> The forecaster entered a value of mean sea-level pressure and wind speed at 850 hPa.
