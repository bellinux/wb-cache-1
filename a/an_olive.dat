5|$|During these inaugural Olympics, {{winners were}} given a silver medal and <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch, while runners-up {{received}} a copper medal and a laurel branch. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time two brigades of dragoons and Werlé's {{infantry}} brigade showed themselves on Godinot's left, advancing out of <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> wood in front of Blake's position to Alten's right. With a large concentration of French troops now menacing the village, the Allied commanders took the bait exactly as Soult had planned, and sent reinforcements to Alten's aid.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on the stem. B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of the stem, a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on the stem in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> tinge on the tubes.|$|E

5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> green when FeSO4 is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|PS90 Standard: The PS90 Standard is {{the current}} model of the PS90 offered by FN Herstal. It {{features}} a MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail fitted {{to the top of}} the receiver, which allows the shooter to mount their preferred optical sight. The rail includes a set of integrated iron sights, as backup in case the primary sight is damaged. The PS90 Standard is available with either <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> drab or black frame.|$|E
5|$|Parc Richelieu, {{a garden}} behind the war memorial, {{was built in}} 1862 on the old city ramparts and {{redesigned}} in 1956. It contains a statue designed by Yves de Coëtlogon in 1962, remembering both world wars with an allegorical figure, representing Peace, which clutches <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch to her breast. Another monument in the Parc Richelieu, erected on 23 April 1994, marks the approximate site of Emma, Lady Hamilton's last resting place. She died in Calais on 15 January 1815.|$|E

2500|$|Tractate Pesachim in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, and Babylonian Talmud {{interpreted}} {{the laws of}} the Passover in [...] and [...] And elsewhere, the Mishnah in tractate Zevahim taught that intent to eat the Passover offering raw (violating the commandment of [...] ) or to break the bones of the offering (violating the commandment of [...] ) did not invalidate the offering itself. The Mishnah in tractate Challah taught that anyone who eats <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk of unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah) on Passover has fulfilled the obligation of [...] and interpreted [...] to teach that anyone who eats <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk of leavened bread ( [...] , chametz) on Passover is liable to being cut off from the Jewish people. Similarly, the Mishnah in tractate Beitzah reported that the House of Shammai held that <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk of leavening or a date's bulk (which is more than <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk) of leavened bread in one's house made one liable, but the House of Hillel held that <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk of either made one liable. The Gemara noted that the command in [...] to eat unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah) on the first night of Passover applies to women (as did the command in [...] for all Israelites to assemble), even though the general rule is that women are exempt from time-bound positive commandments. The Gemara cited these exceptions to support Rabbi Johanan's assertion that one may not draw inferences from general rules, for they often have exceptions.|$|R

5|$|The First World War {{memorial}} in Grove Park, containing a sculpture by Alfred Drury, was unveiled in 1922, with additions by Walter Cave for the Second World War. It contains {{the names of}} 402 men from the area who fell in the First World War. It consists of a winged allegorical figure of Victory holding <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch, which stands on an octagonal column. The memorial is a grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} is the {{national}} bird of the United States of America. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the Roman Republic, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the Continental Congress adopted the design for the Great Seal of the United States depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 arrows and <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch with its talons.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of a church dedicated to Saint George during the 6th century CE indicates that by this time Jifna, now under Byzantine rule, had become a Christian town. Besides the church, other remains from this era are located in Jifna, including a Jewish tomb, a tower (Burj Jifna) once used by the Ottomans as a prison, a Roman villa, <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> oil press and a winery.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} [...] forbade a nazirite three things: ritual defilement, cutting of hair, and {{products}} of the vine. The Mishnah taught that all {{products of the}} vine could be measured together, {{and that there was}} no penalty for violation of the nazirite's vow unless the nazirite ate <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk of grapes or drank a quarter of a log of wine. Rabbi Akiva said that there was a penalty even if the nazirite soaked bread in wine and enough was absorbed to make up <b>an</b> <b>olive's</b> bulk.|$|R

5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays brightly colored plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|A {{lithography}} in the 1858 {{edition of}} the Greek akolouthia shows the saint wearing a crown with a double lily wreath, his right foot on a sword. He holds a cross, a sceptre, and <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch in his right hand, while his crowned severed head is in his left hand. He wears an ermine cloak and a robe with floral designs, adorned with large gems surrounded by pearls. The Greek text beneath the illustration names the saint as Jovan Vladimir, the pious Emperor of all Albania and Bulgaria, the graceful Wonderworker and Great Martyr, and true Myrrh-gusher. In his hagiography included in the Synaxarium of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, the saint {{is referred to as}} Emperor of the Serbs (τῶν Σέρβων βασιλεύς).|$|E
5|$|After the Vichy French {{defeat in}} Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{relocated}} to Tripoli, Lebanon where it headquartered itself in <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> grove while carrying out training and garrison duties {{over the next}} four months. During November, the battalion was moved to Qatana in Syria, but with the entry of Japan into the war in late 1941, the 1st Australian Corps including the 6th and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the Netherlands East Indies for service in the Pacific theatre. In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT Orcades for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time.|$|E
50|$|The Salonenque, {{carrying}} {{the name of}} Salon-de-Provence, is <b>a</b> cultivar of <b>olives</b> grown primarily in Provence. Though it is used for producing oil, and gives a good yield, it is valued primarily as <b>a</b> table <b>olive.</b> It is produced as <b>a</b> so-called cracked <b>olive,</b> {{which means that the}} fruit is cracked to speed up the curing process.|$|R

5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, Smith and Strong flew to Lisbon via Gibraltar in {{civilian}} clothes, where {{they met with}} Generale di Brigata Giuseppe Castellano at the British embassy. While Castellano had hoped to arrange terms for Italy to join the United Nations against Nazi Germany, Smith was empowered to draw up an armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, but {{he was unable to}} negotiate political matters. On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, in a simple ceremony beneath <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> tree at Cassibile, Sicily. In October, Smith traveled to Washington for two weeks to represent Eisenhower in a series of meetings, including one with President Roosevelt at Hyde Park, New York, on 10 October.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the spring}} molt is complete, {{the body of}} the male is a {{brilliant}} lemon yellow, a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside with a yellow bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> tinge evident only on close viewing.|$|E

The black reticle consists of a tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E

5|$|The Minoan {{eruption}} {{is a key}} {{marker for}} the Bronze Age chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean world. It provides a fixed point for aligning the entire chronology of the second millennium BCE in the Aegean, {{as evidence of the}} eruption is found throughout the region. Despite the evidence, the exact date of the eruption has been difficult to determine. Archaeologists have traditionally placed it at approximately 1500 BCE. Radiocarbon dates, including analysis of <b>an</b> <b>olive</b> branch buried beneath a lava flow from the volcano that gave a date between 1627 BCE and 1600 BCE (95% confidence interval), suggest an eruption date more than a century earlier than suggested by archaeologists. Thus, the radiocarbon dates and the archaeological dates are in substantial disagreement.|$|E
