5|$|Even where metal {{objects such}} as bowls <b>and</b> <b>dishes</b> {{do not seem to}} have {{geometric}} decoration, still the designs, such as arabesques, are often set in octagonal compartments or arranged in concentric bands around the object. Both closed designs (which do not repeat) and open or repetitive patterns are used. Patterns such as interlaced six-pointed stars were especially popular from the 12thcentury. Eva Baer notes that while this design was essentially simple, it was elaborated by metalworkers into intricate patterns interlaced with arabesques, sometimes organised around further basic Islamic patterns, such as the hexagonal pattern of six overlapping circles.|$|E
5|$|Rose or mint {{water is}} a drink {{commonly}} added to Palestinian sweets <b>and</b> <b>dishes.</b> However, {{it is also a}} popular drink on its own, and is seen as refreshing in the heated summers. Herbs such as sage can also be boiled with water to create a drink that is sometimes used for medicinal purposes. A warm drink made from sweetened milk with salep garnished with walnuts, coconut flakes and cinnamon, is known as sahlab and is primarily served during the winter season.|$|E
5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} <b>and</b> <b>dishes</b> {{have been}} imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced transhumance, moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E

5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, <b>and</b> <b>dishes</b> that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, the solder in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present. People who eat animals hunted with lead bullets {{may be at risk}} for lead exposure. Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu <b>and</b> <b>dishes</b> from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The coastal lowlands, {{particularly}} surrounding Charleston and New Orleans {{and which}} also included {{much of the}} Acadian French regions of Louisiana and the surrounding area, more varied diet was heavily influenced by Africans and Caribbeans, {{as well as the}} French. Rice played a large part in the diet. In addition, unlike the uplands, the lowlands' protein came mostly from coastal seafood and game meats. Much of the diet involved the use of peppers, as it still does today. Although the English had an inherent disdain for French food as well as many of the native foods, the French had no such disdain for indigenous foodstuffs. In fact, they expressed an appreciation for native ingredients <b>and</b> <b>dishes.</b>|$|E

5|$|While most of {{the damage}} from the Gorda Basin {{earthquake}} was considered light, there were some exceptions. In Eureka, effects included broken windows <b>and</b> <b>dishes,</b> fallen chimneys, and merchandise that fell from store shelves. In Fields Landing, King Salmon, Loleta, and Big Lagoon areas, the strongest effects included surface cracks on the ground, soil liquefaction, small landslides and rockfalls, and numerous slumps along the Eel River. Similar effects occurred along the Old Coast Highway near Trinidad and Moonstone, where the roadway was reduced to one lane of travel in some areas. Several homes were knocked off their foundations and a highway overpass collapsed in Fields Landing. Seismic wave amplification, poor design, or inadequate construction style {{may have contributed to}} losses there.|$|E

25|$|A linear Fresnel {{reflector}} {{power plant}} uses {{a series of}} long, narrow, shallow-curvature (or even flat) mirrors to focus light onto one or more linear receivers positioned above the mirrors. On top of the receiver a small parabolic mirror can be attached for further focusing the light. These systems aim to offer lower overall costs by sharing a receiver between several mirrors (as compared with trough and dish concepts), while still using the simple line-focus geometry with one axis for tracking. This {{is similar to the}} trough design (and different from central towers <b>and</b> <b>dishes</b> with dual-axis). The receiver is stationary and so fluid couplings are not required (as in troughs <b>and</b> <b>dishes).</b> The mirrors also do not need to support the receiver, so they are structurally simpler. When suitable aiming strategies are used (mirrors aimed at different receivers at different times of day), this can allow a denser packing of mirrors on available land area.|$|E
