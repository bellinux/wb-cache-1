After dissolution and thermal treatment of three technical <b>lignins</b> (organosolv, <b>alkali</b> and alkali low sulphonate) with an array of ILs, it was shown that these solvents behave as either reactants or catalysts, significantly reducing the molecular mass of these macromolecules and altering their structure. The degree of lignin structural modification is shown to be primarily influenced by the anion. Lignin fragmentation mechanisms were defined and a fragmentation hierarchy of the lignin macromolecule {{as a function of the}} IL anion was established. It was determined that sulfates > lactate > acetate > chlorides > phosphates in terms of the relative impact on reducing lignin molecular weight, with evidence of different anions causing cleavage of different linkages within the lignin. Of the ILs studied, sulfate based ionic liquids most comprehensively broke down the largest lignin molecules, resulting in fragments > 1000 – 3000 u (by polysaccharide calibration). The lactate anion, while appearing less capable of breaking down the largest lignin molecules, causes the formation of significant quantities of the smallest sized fragments observed (2000 – 500 u).

It is synthesized by higher plants, reaching levels of 20 - 30 % of the dry weight of woody tissue, next to cellulose, {{is the second most}} abundant compound in plant biomass and a partial decay of lignin provides numerous aromatic monomers such as ferulic and vanillic acids. These aromatic compounds have attracted attention as renewable resources for the production of chemicals traditionally derived from petroleum. An Isolation and identification environmental friendly bacteria for lignin degradation becomes an essential, because all the previous researches concentrated on using fungal treatments. The importance of ligninolytic bacteria raised, because lignin-degrading bacteria have wider tolerance of temperature, pH and oxygen limitation than fungi. In addition, the application of fungi in bioleaching of raw pulp is not feasible due to its structural hindrance caused by fungal filament. One bacterial strain isolated from Egyptian soil in Kafr El-Dawar (latitude 31. 1397 and longitude 30. 1292) area was molecularly and physiologically identified. Potential aerobic bacterial strains KafAH 19 was found capable to effectively degrade synthetic <b>lignin</b> (<b>lignin</b> <b>Alkali)</b> and utilize it as a sole carbon source.

40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HS) and chromophoric dissolved {{organic matter}} (CDOM) are ubiquitous, widely impacting environmental processes, yet despite decades of study the link between structure and the unique optical properties evident in HS/CDOM remains elusive. Model compounds derived from a solely microbial source, as well as terrestrial sources from both aquatic environments and soil systems, exhibit {{many of the same}} optical properties despite their disparate methods of generation and sources. All show a pH dependent absorbance, exhibit increasing absorbance as wavelength decreases and a loss of absorbance upon borohydride reduction. The link between colored humic substances is their ability to form electronic interactions that extend long wavelength absorbance. The underlying processes by which charge transfer bands or electronic interactions in HS/CDOM are generated are investigated by optical and potentiometic titrations of untreated and borohydride reduced material. Borohydride reduction targets carbonyl functional groups such as aromatic ketones and quinones. The reduction of these groups affects the optical properties by reducing long wavelength absorbance and causing a blue shift in the fluorescence emission spectra. A direct comparison of divergent sources of fulvic and humic acids including an aquatic fulvic acid, Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) and a microbial source of fulvic acid, Pony Lake Fulvic Acid (PLFA), the soil derived humic acids, Elliott (EHA) and Leonardite Humic Acids (LHA), an aquatic humic acid Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) as well as <b>Lignin</b> <b>Alkali</b> Carboxylate (LAC) highlights differences between sources of humic material as exemplified by borohydride induced optical changes such as absorbance intensity in the UV and visible range, difference (DA), fractional difference, spectral slope (S), fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEMS), and differential emission spectra (DF) as well as quantum yield. Traditional Raman spectroscopy, although capable of providing relevant chemical functional group information, cannot be applied to untreated CDOM because of high fluorescence background. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) provides the capability of overcoming the florescence background, thus providing useful Raman spectral data. SERS spectra of model compounds and CDOM were collected using roughened silver electrodes. Functional groups were identified from selected borohydride reduced CDOM SERS spectra...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{composition}} of the primary cell wall of Pinus radiata has been undertaken. 1. Preliminary work with hypocotyl tissue showed that hemicelluloses of hypocotyl consisted of a xylan (probably (4 -O-methylglucurono) xylan) and a xyloglucan. Acidic sugars examined, showed that galacturonic acid was the main component, and that 4 -O-MeGlcA was present. 2. Cell walls were prepared from callus tissue either by wet sieving in 80 % ethanol (Batch 1) or by disruption in a French Pressure cell and washing with aqueous potassium phosphate buffer; (Batch 2). Each batch was submitted to a series of extractions with different reagents in order to investigate the mode of bonding of polymers within the walls. The polysaccharide and protein components of each fraction were studied by monosaccharide and amino acid analysis. Fractions of Batch 1 were assayed for lignin and selected fractions from both batches were studied by methylation analysis. 3. The results of investigations led to the following major conclusions. The non-cellulosic components recognised in the wall preparations were: - a) A(1 → 3) -linked galactan and an arabino- 3, 6 -galactan which were largely extractable from the cell walls by hot water and may be only loosely bound in the cell wall. b) The pectic components consisting of; i) pectin, a galacturonate polymer containing a linear (1 → 4) -galacturonan back bone interspersed with branched rhamnose residues, ii) branched (1 → 5) -arabinan and iii) linear (1 → 4) -galactan, which occurred together in cell wall fractions and were not all extracted by classical extractants (such as hot aqueous EDTA), some being tightly bound in the cellulosic residue after alkali extraction. c) A fucogalactoxyloglucan some of which was extracted by water or EDTA, but the majority was extracted by subsequent treatment with either alkali or in part by a strong chaotropic reagent (6 M GTC). Thus the fucogalactoxyloglucan was probably bound in the cell wall by strong hydrogen bonding. Some other bonding may be involved in the GTC-resistant fraction. d) A branched xylan which was removed by GTC and alkali, the larger level being removed by GTC. e) A galactoglucomannan, identified only by 4 -linked mannose residues in hot water extracts and strong alkali fractions. f) Hydroxyproline-containing protein which was extracted from the cell wall by a variety of reagents but hydroxyproline-rich protein remains tighly bound after <b>alkali</b> extraction. g) <b>Lignin</b> which was tentatively identified in the cell wall. It appeared likely that cross-linking with lignin would be responsible for the non-extractability of some polysaccharides and protein from the walls. A mild acid chlorite treatment followed by alkali extraction removed most of the residual pectic components, xylan and protein from the walls. A basis has been laid for the further investigation of the wall structure and isolation of polysaccharides...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} focuses {{mainly on}} investigating the aging mechanisms and degradation kinetics of sisal fiber, {{as well as}} the approaches to mitigate its degradation in the matrix of cement composites. In contrast to previous works reported in the literature, a novel approach is proposed in this study to directly determine the fiber's degradation rate by separately studying the composition changes, mechanical and physical properties of the embedded sisal fibers. Cement hydration is presented to be a crucial factor in understanding fiber degradation behavior. The degradation mechanisms of natural fiber consist of mineralization of cell walls, <b>alkali</b> hydrolysis of <b>lignin</b> and hemicellulose, {{as well as the}} cellulose decomposition which includes stripping of cellulose microfibrils and alkaline hydrolysis of amorphous regions in cellulose chains. Two mineralization mechanisms, CH-mineralization and self-mineralization, are proposed. The degradation kinetics of sisal fiber in the cement matrix are also analyzed and a model to predict the degradation rate of cellulose for natural fiber embedded in cement is outlined. The results indicate that the time needed to completely degrade the cellulose in the matrix with cement replacement by 30 wt. % metakaolin is 13 times longer than that in pure cement. A novel and scientific method is presented to determine accelerated aging conditions, and to evaluating sisal fiber's degradation rate and durability of natural fiber-reinforced cement composites. Among the static aggressive environments, the most effective approach for accelerating the degradation of natural fiber in cement composites is to soak the samples or change the humidity at 70 ºC and higher temperature. However, the dynamic wetting and drying cycling treatment has a more accelerating effect on the alkali hydrolysis of fiber's amorphous components evidenced by the highest crystallinity indices, minimum content of holocellulose, and lowest tensile strength. Based on the understanding of degradation mechanisms, two approaches are proposed to mitigate the degradation of sisal fiber in the cement matrix. In order to relieve the aggressive environment of hydrated cement, cement substitution by a combination of metakaolin and nanoclay, and a combination of rice husk ash and limestone are studied. Both metakaolin and nanoclay significantly optimize the cement hydration, while the combination of these two supplementary cementitious materials validates their complementary and synergistic effect at different stages of aging. The presented approaches effectively reduce the calcium hydroxide content and the alkalinity of the pore solution, thereby mitigating the fiber degradation and improving both the initial mechanical properties and durability of the fiber-cement composites. The role of rice husk ash in cement modification is mainly as the active cementitious supplementary material. In order to improve the degradation resistance of sisal fiber itself, two novel, simple, and economical pretreatments of the fibers (thermal and sodium carbonate treatment) are investigated. Both thermal treatment and Na 2 CO 3 treatment effectively improve the durability of sisal fiber-reinforced concrete. The thermal treatment achieves improvement of cellulose's crystallization, which ensures the initial strength and improved durability of sisal fiber. A layer consisting of calcium carbonate sediments, which protects the internals of a fiber from the strong alkali pore solution, is formed and filled in pits and cavities on the Na 2 CO 3 treated sisal fiber's surface...|$|R
