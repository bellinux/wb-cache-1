On the basis of experimental results obtained under different reaction durations, a possible formation mechanism of WS 2 nanosheets is proposed. The tribological performance of ultrathin WS 2 nanosheets as additives in the 500 SN base oil was tested by an UMT- 2 ball-on-disc tribotester, and the worn surface of the steel disc was investigated by a non-contact optical profile testing instrument and SEM.
