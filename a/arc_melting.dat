All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth.

Field relations, micro-textures, bulk and mineral chemistry document melt-rock reactions producing dunites {{at the expense of}} meta-harzburgites, and a consecutive olivine-clinopyroxenite formation from the same melt type. The association of mesa-gabbros, dunites, and pyroxenites is interpreted as a crust-mantle transition zone produced by the percolation of highly depleted primitive <b>arc</b> <b>melt.</b> The meta-harzburgites represent large portions of refractoty mantle that have suffered melt extraction and metasomatism prior to their interaction with the dunite-forming primitive <b>arc</b> <b>melt</b> and the establishment of the crust-mantle transition zone. Uncommon vein assemblages in the dunites that include Cr-clinochlore, calcite and olivine document a late percolation of slab-related, volatile-rich fluids. Taking into account the highly refractory composition of the Sapat mantle, its structural position, the evidence for interaction with highly depleted <b>arc</b> <b>melts</b> and the sub-solidus interaction with volatile-rich arc fluids, the Sapat ultramafic rocks are interpreted as being derived from the frontal Kohistan arc, representing a crust-mantle transition formed by arc magmatism...|$|R

30|$|F {{concentrations}} of Iwate melt inclusions {{are in the}} same range as those reported for MORB melt inclusions (Gakkel from 146 to 166  ppm, Shaw et al. 2010; EPR from 18 to 342  ppm; and Juan de Fuca from 62 to 123  ppm, Wanless and Shaw 2012). Cl concentrations in the Iwate melt inclusions are systematically higher than MORB melt inclusions by approximately an order of magnitude (Figure  2). The enrichment of fluid-mobile elements has been interpreted as a mixing of slab input to the melting region (e.g., Gill 1981; Tatsumi and Eggins 1995). Cl enrichment in <b>arc</b> <b>melt</b> inclusions is observed in multiple studies (Hamada and Fujii 2007; Shaw et al. 2008; Kelley et al. 2010; Rose-Koga et al. 2012; and see review by Wallace 2005). Iwate melt inclusions have a much lower Cl concentration compared to other <b>arc</b> <b>melt</b> inclusions.

40|$|Primary <b>arc</b> <b>melts</b> may form through fluxed or {{adiabatic}} decompression melting in {{the mantle}} wedge, or via {{a combination of}} both processes. Major limitations {{to our understanding of the}} formation of primary <b>arc</b> <b>melts</b> stem from the fact that most arc lavas are aggregated blends of individual magma batches, further modified by differentiation processes in the sub-arc mantle lithosphere and overlying crust. Primary melt generation is thus masked by these types of second-stage processes. Magma-hosted peridotites sampled as xenoliths in subduction zone magmas are possible remnants of sub-arc mantle and magma generation processes, but are rarely sampled in active arcs. Published studies have emphasised the predominantly harzburgitic lithologies with particularly high modal orthopyroxene in these xenoliths; the former characteristic reflects the refractory nature of these materials consequent to extensive melt depletion of a lherzolitic protolith whereas the latter feature requires additional explanation. Here we present major and minor element data for pristine, mantle-derived, lava-hosted spinel-bearing harzburgite and dunite xenoliths and associated primitive melts from the active Kamchatka and Bismarck arcs. We show that these peridotite suites, and other mantle xenoliths sampled in circum-Pacific arcs, are a distinctive peridotite type not found in other tectonic settings, and are melting residues from hydrous melting of silica-enriched mantle sources. We explore the ability of experimental studies allied with mantle melting parameterisations (pMELTS, Petrolog 3) to reproduce the compositions of these arc peridotites, and present a protolith (‘hybrid mantle wedge’) composition that satisfies the available constraints. The composition of peridotite xenoliths recovered from erupted arc magmas plausibly requires their formation initially via interaction of slab-derived components with refractory mantle prior to or during the formation of primary <b>arc</b> <b>melts.</b> The liquid compositions extracted from these hybrid sources are higher in normative quartz and hypersthene (i. e., they have a more silica-saturated character) in comparison with basalts derived from prior melt-depleted asthenospheric mantle beneath ridges. These primary <b>arc</b> <b>melts</b> range from silica-rich picrite to boninite and high-Mg basaltic andesite along a residual spinel harzburgite cotectic. Silica enrichment in the mantle sources of arc-related, subalkaline picrite-boninite-andesite suites coupled with the amount of water and depth of melting, are important for the formation of medium-Fe (‘calc-alkaline’) andesite-dacite-rhyolite suites, key lithologies forming the continental crust...|$|R

30|$|The {{variations}} in volatile and trace elements composition are commonly explained by a compositional {{variation of the}} metasomatic agent (e.g. Straub et al. [2004]; Le Voyer et al. [2008]; Sadofsky et al. [2008]; Bouvier et al. [2010]; Sorbadere et al. [2011]). The composition of the metasomatic agent is usually calculated from mass balance assuming a mixing between the depleted mantle (DMM) and this agent, either a slab aqueous fluid or a slab melt (e.g. Grove et al.

Considering that seawater is about 20, 000 times richer in Cl than F (e.g. Straub and Layne [2003]) and that Cl is highly soluble in slab aqueous fluids (e.g. Brenan [1993]), a Cl/F > 1 in <b>arc</b> <b>melt</b> inclusions is expected.
