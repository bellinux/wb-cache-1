5|$|Eventually the {{leadership}} of the SRRC and the TNG were reconciled, and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was formed in 2004 by Somali politicians in Nairobi.

President Yusuf requested that the <b>African</b> <b>Union</b> deploy military forces in Somalia. However, as the AU lacked the resources to do so, Yusuf brought in his own militia from Puntland. Along with the U.S. funding the ARPCT coalition, this alarmed many in south-central Somalia, and recruits flocked to the ascendant Islamic Courts Union (ICU).|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union {{splintered}} {{into several}} different factions.
