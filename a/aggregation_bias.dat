Recent research is skeptical of the conclusion drawn by the Dillingham Commission. One study finds that [...] "major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses." ...|$|E

5000|$|Automotive Manufacturers spend a {{substantial}} amount of their marketing budgets on dealer advertising, which may not be accurately measurable if not modeled at the right level of aggregation. If modeled at the national level or even the market or DMA level, these effects may be lost in <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias.</b> On the other hand going {{all the way down to}} dealer-level may overestimate marketing effectiveness as it would ignore consumer switching between dealers in the same area. The correct albeit rigorous approach would be to determine what dealers to combine into 'addable' common groups based on overlapping 'trade-areas' determined by consumer zip codes and cross-shopping information. At the very least 'Common Dealer Areas' can be determined by clustering dealers based on geographical distance between dealers and share of county sales. Marketing-mix models built by 'pooling' monthly sales for these dealer clusters will be effectively used to measure the impact of dealer advertising effectively.|$|E

The feature {{of this paper is}} the introduction of individual heterogeneity. It allows to examine how the good will diffuse among the different subpopulations depending on their receptivity degree.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine whether the {{estimation}} of labor demand can be affected by individual behavior heterogeneity. We shall consider an error-components model with variable-coefficients, where the coefficients are random and vary accross firms according to the values of time-constant explanatory variables and to a random firm-specific effect. The specification of labor demand which stems from the variable coefficients hypothesis is estimated by the generalized method of moments on a panel of 810 French manufacturing firms. Heterogeneities appear to be strongly significant. When the share of skilled workers is higher, the ajustment speed is lower and the influence of wages on labor demand decreases (in absolute value) as well as that of sector demand shocks. Moreover, a higher market-share leads to a smaller adjustment speed and to an increased influence of wages and industry demand on employment. Our estimates reveal strongly significant heterogeneities in labor demand behavior. However, the study of <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases</b> leads to the conclusion that they are very small. In fact our individual coefficients are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables, and this is a sufficient condition for the absence of <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|TFP {{is often}} {{interpreted}} as a rough average measure of productivity, more specifically the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and organisational innovation. (OECD 2008,11). The most famous description is that of Solow’s (1957): ”I am using the phrase ’technical change’ as a shorthand expression {{for any kind of}} shift in the production function. Thus slowdowns, speed ups, improvements in the education of the labor force and all sorts of things will appear as ’technical change’ ”. The original MFP model (Solow 1957) involves several assumptions: that there is a stable functional relation between inputs and output at the economy-wide level of aggregation, that this function has neoclassical smoothness and curvature properties, that inputs are paid the value of their marginal product, that the function exhibits constant returns to scale, and that technical change has the Hicks’n neutral form (Hulten, 2009,5). In practice, TFP is [...] "a measure of our ignorance", as Abramovitz (1956) put it, precisely because it is a residual. This ignorance covers many components, some wanted (like the effects of technical and organizational innovation), others unwanted (measurement error, omitted variables, <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias,</b> model misspecification) (Hulten 2000,11). Hence the relationship between TFP and productivity remains unclear.|$|E

For Canada's provinces, 1992 - 2003, incidence is on average some five times higher for sellers than for buyers. Sellers' incidence falls over time due to specialization, despite constant gravity coefficients.

40|$|The {{traditional}} way of assessing the impact of currency depreciation on the trade balance has been to estimate the elasticity of trade volume to relative prices. To this end, most previous studies used aggregate trade data. To avoid <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases</b> potentially hidden in aggregate data, recent studies have relied on bilateral trade data. Since import and export price data is not available on bilateral level, this study proposes an alternative way of assessing the impact of currency depreciation on bilateral trade flows.

It finds that this trade has been overestimated in previous studies due to geographical and <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases.</b> The nature of IIT is predominantly vertical, where Colombia is found to produce higher quality varieties. As for the regions, the “center” provinces of each region explain the largest part of the sector composition {{of the most significant}} IIT flows with the AC. This result evidences the strong relationship between IIT and regional development, which is found to be more relevant than other factors such as geographical proximity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the quantitative importance of temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> in distorting parameter estimates and hypothesis tests. Our {{strategy is to}} consider two empirical examples in which temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> {{has the potential to}} account for results which are widely viewed as being anomalous from the perspective of particular economic models. Our first example investigates the possibility that temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> can lead to spurious Granger causality relationships. The quantitative importance of this possibility is examined in the context of Granger causal relations between the growth rates of money and various measures of aggregate output. Our second example investigates the possibility that temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> can account for the slow speeds of adjustment typically obtained with stock adjustment models. The quantitative importance of this possibility is examined {{in the context of a}} particular class of continuous and discrete time equilibrium models of inventories and sales. The different models are compared on the basis of the behavioral implications of the estimated values of the structural parameters which we obtain and their overall statistical performance. The empirical results from both examples provide support for the view that temporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> can be quantitatively important in the sense of significantly distorting inference. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses an Italian firm-level panel {{data-set}} {{over the}} period 1994 - 2006 to investigate the nexus between corporate taxation and investment. Studying the effects of corporate taxation on investment at the micro level has two advantages. Firstly, investment is free of <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases</b> and secondly, the firm-level dimension allows asking whether the effects of corporate taxation differ across firms with different characteristics. In the empirical analysis, we employ a Generalized Method of Moments estimator, which permits us to handle not only the dynamic structure of the model and of the predetermined or endogenous explanatory variables, but also firm-specific factors, heteroskedasticity, and autocorrelation of individual observations. We find that corporate taxes distort investment decisions. The results are robust to the inclusion of many controls...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} many studies that examine the {{relationship}} between income and pollution with multi-country, macro-level panel data sets are sensitive to the number and type of countries included in the analysis as well as to model specification.

Using 1990 count data at the census tract level for the United States, we find relationships between household income and carbon monoxide, ground level ozone, and coarse particulate matter pollution that are robust with respect to changes in model assumptions and data measurement. Our results suggest that the income level at which households are willing to reduce their exposure to pollution depends on the nature of pollution...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{empirical}} studies revolving around the NBD-Dirichlet Theory of buying behaviour, there is little research into the stability of the parameters of the model’s distributions. We focused on two aspects of parameters’ stability: temporal stability and <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias.</b> We fitted the model repeatedly for each available month over nearly three years of panel data for two categories, and also for successive quarters, half years and years. Results showed that the parameters are indeed stable, showing very low coefficients of variation. <b>Aggregation</b> <b>bias</b> was minimal, besides a reasonable scale effect arising with longer periods of analysis. Therefore, the market stability claimed by the NBD-Dirichlet can be extended to the model’s parameters too, with little or no <b>aggregation</b> <b>bias.</b> ...|$|E

In addition, the results testing the hypothesis {{of the possibility of}} aggregating all crop products in a single group was positive when we excluded sesame, cotton, and water melon from the list.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the effects of}} right-to-carry laws on crime requires particular distributional and structural considerations. First, because of the count nature of crime data and the low number of expected instances per observation in the most appropriate data, least-squares methods yield unreliable estimates. Second, use of a single dummy variable as a measure of the nationwide effect of right-to-carry laws is likely to introduce geographical and intertemporal <b>aggregation</b> <b>biases</b> into the analysis. In this paper, we use a generalized Poisson process to examine the geographical and dynamic effects of right-to-carry laws on reported homicides, rapes, and robberies. We find that the effects of such laws vary across crime categories, U.

By differentiating between secular and cyclical elasticities, the paper recognizes that trade responses to secular expansions and to domestic bottlenecks {{need not be}} the same. Finally, by relying on spectral analysis, the paper isolates the secular and cyclical components of the data and thus avoids the drawbacks of time-domain analyses where a time trendproxies secular factors. To emphasize the usefulness of bilateral trade elasticities, the analysis re-examines the asymmetry in income elasticities noted by Houthakker and Magee and evaluates the loss of information associated with relying on multilateral trade data. ...|$|R
