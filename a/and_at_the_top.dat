5|$|Above {{the window}} is the album title <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover {{is that of a}} 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles <b>and,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette range was still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956. As the new model caught on, Simca was able to increase production from the 150daily achieved during Ford's ownership of the factory to 250cars a day.|$|E
5|$|At 15:15 Lalor {{left the}} defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There {{he joined a}} group from the 2nd Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell's Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead's and Lalor's men, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Malone's Gulley were {{the survivors of the}} 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th Battalions. Once Stewart's men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.|$|E

The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} of the 703 {{was entirely}} ply skinned, tapering gently from a blunt {{nose to the}} tail. There, a small, ply skinned fin carried a largely fabric covered, rounded, wide chord, balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The straight tapered tailplane, also largely fabric covered, was set forward of the fin <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the fuselage, so the elevators required only a small cut-out for the rudder to move in. The pilot sat upright {{just ahead of the}} wing leading edge under a multi-piece canopy which merged into the aft fuselage. The 703 had no landing wheel but just a sprung skid from the nose to behind the cockpit, on the deepest part of the fuselage. It was assisted by a tail bumper.|$|E

25|$|Municipal {{were close}} to repeating the CONCACAF success of 1974 when the Champion's Cup finals were played in the Mateo Flores in Guatemala City in December 1993. The team faced Mexican club León, Saprissa of Costa Rica and Robinhood of Suriname in a single {{round-robin}} tournament. High expectations preceded those matches, as Municipal was in good form in the local tournament, unbeaten <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the table; however, the team fell short of the title as all three matches between Municipal, Saprissa and León ended in draws, and Saprissa, who played against the weak Robinhood in the last matchday, beat the Surinamese team 9–0 and won the title on goal differential. Still, a fifth league championship in seven years came {{at the end of}} the 1993–94 season, under Argentine coach Horacio Cordero.|$|E
25|$|Following the All-Star Break the Brewers {{went on the}} road, {{splitting}} {{a four-game}} series against the Cincinnati Reds before losing two of three against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates win on July 20 snapped the Brewers 17-game winning streak against Pittsburgh in a game marred by a disputed beanball thrown at Pirates pitcher Jeff Karstens, reportedly in retribution for an incident in April where Karstens hit Ryan Braun with a pitch, that caused both benches to empty during the eighth inning. On July 19, second baseman Felipe López was acquired from the Arizona Diamondbacks for minor league players Cole Gillespie and Roque Mercedes; the acquisition of Lopez was expected to fill the hole at second <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the lineup left by Rickie Weeks' May injury.|$|E

25|$|Building 3 or the Blue Temple {{has some}} {{features}} that set it {{apart from other}} pyramids at the site. Except for six benches on the staircase <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the balustrades, probably later additions, there are no niches. The seven stories of the pyramid are composed of gently sloping walling divided into panels of varying widths. The unreconstructed north side has a large indentation made by looters before the site was protected by guards. No sculpture {{is known to have}} come from this building and nothing of the temple at the top remains. The building was covered in cement several times over its history, and each layer of this cement was painted in blue rather than the more common red. Remnants of this paint can be seen on part of the stairway and on the side facing east toward Building 23. Blue is most often associated with the rain god but there is no other evidence to support this.|$|E
25|$|The pyre was sixty metres high, {{square in}} shape and built in stepped levels. The first level was {{decorated}} with two hundred and forty ships with golden prows, each of these adorned with armed figures with red banners filling the spaces between. On the second level were torches with snakes at the base, golden wreaths in the middle <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top,</b> flames surmounted by eagles. The third level showed a hunting scene, and the fourth a battle of centaurs, all done in gold. On the fifth level, also in gold, were lions and bulls, and on the sixth the arms of Macedon and Persia. The seventh and final level bore sculptures of sirens, hollowed out to conceal a choir who would sing a lament. It {{is possible that the}} pyre was not burnt, but that it was actually intended as a tomb or lasting memorial; if so, it is likely that it was never completed, as there are references to expensive, uncompleted projects at the time of Alexander's own death.|$|E
25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, sitting under a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue.
