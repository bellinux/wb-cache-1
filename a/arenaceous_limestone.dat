50|$|The Traverse Group {{outcrops}} in Emmet and Charlevoix counties {{along the}} northwestern shore of Michigan's lower peninsula. Its formations are Gravel Point, Charlevoix Limestone, Petoskey, and Whiskey Creek. The Gravel Point Formation {{consists of a}} lithographic gray to brown limestone with shale beds up to 0.5 meters thick; it also includes chert nodules and bioherms (fossilized reef mounds). The Charlevoix Limestone is a mildly argillaceous limestone with interbedded coquina. The Petoskey Formation is an <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> named for its locale (Petoskey, Michigan), and contains the eponymous Petoskey stones. The Whiskey Creek Formation is a limestone.|$|E
40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. 4. 3. 143 - 157 This paper {{introduces}} the petrographic characteristics and depositional environment of Middle Miocene rocks of the Thien Ung - Mang Cau {{structure in the}} central area of Nam Con Son Basin {{based on the results}} of analyzing thin sections and structural characteristics of core samples. Middle Miocene sedimentary rocks in the studied area can be divided into three groups: (1) Group of terrigenous rocks comprising greywacke sandstone, arkosic sandstone, lithic-quartz sandstone, greywacke-lithic sandstone, oligomictic siltstone, and bitumenous claystone; (2) Group of carbonate rocks comprising dolomitic limestone and bituminous limestone; (3) Mixed group comprising calcareous sandstone, calcarinate sandstone, <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestone,</b> calcareous claystone, calcareous silty claystone, dolomitic limestone containing silt, and bitumen. The depositional environment is expressed through petrographic characteristics and structure of the sedimentary rocks in core samples. The greywacke and arkosic sandstones are of medium grain size, poor sorting and roundness, and siliceous cement characterizing the alluvial and estuarine fan environment expressed by massive structure of core samples. The mixed calcareous limestone, arenaceous dolomitic limestone, and calcareous and bituminous clayey siltstone in the core samples are of turbulent flow structure characterizing shallow bay environment with the action of bottom currents. The dolomitic limestones are of relatively homogeneous, of microgranular and fine-granular texture, precipitated in a weakly reducing, semi-closed, and relatively calm bay environment. </p...|$|E
2500|$|In the Triassic the Ceratite beds, {{named after}} the ammonite ceratite, consist of <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestones,</b> calcerous {{sandstones}} and marls. The Jurassic consists of two distinct units. The Kioto limestone, extends from the lower the middle Jurassic with a thickness [...] to [...] The upper Jurassic {{is represented by the}} Spiti black shales, and stretches from the Karakoram to Sikkim. Cretaceous rocks cover an extensive area in India. In South India, the sedimentary rocks are divided into four stages; the Niniyur, the Ariyalur, the Trichinopoly(a district in the Madras Presidency, covering present-day districts of Tiruchirappalli, Karur, Ariyalur and Perambalur), and the Utatur stages. In the Utatur stage the rocks host phosphatic nodules, which constitute an important source of phosphates in the country. In the central provinces, the well developed beds of Lameta contain fossil records which are helpful in estimating the age of the Deccan Traps. This sequence of basaltic rocks was formed {{near the end of the}} Cretaceous period due to volcanic activity. These lava flows occupy an area of [...] These rocks are a source of high quality building stone and also provide a very fertile clayey loam, particularly suited to cotton cultivation.|$|R
40|$|Calcareous {{dunes and}} eolian limestones are {{considered}} by many to be genetically related to rapid glacio-eustatic fluctuations of sea level. However, while these deposits are widespread along Pleistocene and Holocene low-latitude coasts, older analogs are either extremely rare, or misinterpreted as subaqueous in origin. Medium- to large-scale crossbedded <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Pennsylvanian Callville Limestone of southern Nevada, and the correlative Manakacha and Wescogame Formations (Supai Group) and the Permian Pakoon Limestone of western Grand Canyon, although considered marine by earlier workers, contain several diagnostic structures indicative of an eolian origin. They are composed chiefly of thin, inverse-graded laminae produced by the migration and climb of wind ripples. Many are bimodal with the coarse mode never exceeding two millimeters. Sets of cross-strata commonly have irregular upper surfaces produced by differential wind erosion of damp or lightly cemented laminae. Southward-dipping cross-strata in these rocks are the earliest record of a paleowind system that persisted in this region well into Jurassic time. ^ Marine beds that are cyclically interbedded with the eolian deposits did not undergo early lithification. Petrographic evidence includes mechanical breakage of shells, fitted fabrics, and microstylolites. Field evidence includes load casts, desiccation cracks, and deflation lags at the contacts between wackestones and eolian grainstones. Where marine units underwent extensive early lithification, there are no interbedded eolian deposits. ^ The marine units are interpreted as the source of the sediment comprising the eolianites. During eustatic highstands, onshore winds drove beach sediments landward. In contrast to Quaternary examples, the eolian deposits of this study do not cap shallowing upward sequences; beach facies are generally absent. During low-stands, most quartz-rich beach facies were removed by deflation; that material too coarse to be wind-transported accumulated as laterally-persistent gravel lags. Deflation was facilitated by the lack of widespread sea floor cementation (hardgrounds), and an arid paleoclimate which limited the extent of meteoric diagenesis. ...|$|R
40|$|Coquina, {{also known}} locally as marl or shell rock is a medium to very {{coarsely}} grained fossiliferous sand to <b>arenaceous</b> fossiliferous <b>limestone</b> composed of broken shells, corals, and other organic debris. It has a very limited distribution in southeastern North Carolina. The best known and perhaps the only well documented outcrop is located in southern New Hanover County, North Carolina near Fort Fisher. This paper will attempt to map its distribution, and discuss the distribution of coquina in the southern coastal region of North Carolina, discuss its use as a building material of Colonial Period residences, and finally discuss both past and present mining practices. Brief attention will be directed toward the preservation of structures assembled with Coquina. The {{purpose of this paper}} is threefold: first it will map the distribution and briefly discuss the distribution of coquina in the southern coastal region of North Carolina; second it will discuss, utilizing several examples, its use in North Carolina as a Colonialera building material; and finally it will review both past and present mining practices and current use. However, before beginning it is important to point out that the identification, distribution, use as a building material, and preservation practices of coquina in North Carolina is in its infancy. Indeed, during the course of researching and preparing this study it became readily apparent that there are several definition of coquina; the geologist's definition, the architectural historian and/or preservation planner definition, and the laypersons definition and many times they are not the same. For example a careful perusal of the relevant literature and conversations with homeowners finds the terms, marl, shell rock, tabby, and coquina used intercha [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Lede {{stone is}} an <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> which occurs in marine sandy {{deposits}} (Lede Formation, Eocene, Tertiary; Belgium). Its framework consists of quartz grains, micro- and macrofossils, glauconite {{and a low}} percentage of dense minerals such as apatite and zircon. It is commonly characterized by a microsparitic cement of calcite. Since Roman times the Lede stone {{was used as a}} building material and is dominantly present in Gothic architecture. Nowadays, huge amounts of this stone are found in the Belgian built cultural heritage, thus being the subject of many restoration and renovation works. Since it has an substantial carbonate content, the stone is sensitive to sulphation. This causes formation of a gypsum crust and the dissolution of calcite cement towards the inside of the stone. At the same time cracks can develop during long-time atmospheric exposure. In this way, the subsurface can be divided in several zones, each with their degree of alteration. When a stone surface is cleaned during restoration works, {{it is important to know}} the structure of the gypsum crust and the cracks, the depth of the affected area and the stability conditions of each of the subsurface zones. A multidisciplinary case-study was performed on a Lede stone with a thin gypsum crust. The structure and composition of the superficial crust as well as the subsurface were studied with different techniques (X-ray tomography/radiography, X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy) to determine the degree of weathering. Chemical alteration shows to be the most ‘common’ zonation with a superficial black crust layer, a second thicker gypsum alteration zone and the sound stone in the deeper part of the stone. Sub-horizontal cracks are present within both the gypsum crust and the sound stone...|$|E
40|$|The {{uppermost}} Ordovician (Hirnantian) of the Oslo Region {{has been}} studied at three selected outcrops in the Husbergøya, Langøyene and Solvik formations on the islands Hovedøya, Rambergøya and Langøyene in the inner Oslofjord. The outcrops have been logged in detail, from the uppermost part of the Husbergøya Formation, trough Langøyene Formation {{up to the first}} meters of the Silurian Solvik Formation. Representative samples have been collected from all three sections, and various laboratory and microscope techniques have been performed. The uppermost very fine-grained sandstone beds with brown colour in weathered outcrops in the Husbergøya Formation are capped by clean sand layers {{at the base of the}} Langøyene Formation. The Langøyene Formation is subdivided in a lower and upper part along a major unconformity. The lower part consists of mudstone and thin limestone layers interbedded with sand layers, forming a generally upwards coarsening succession. The erosional unconformity that cuts the lower succession reveals a relief of at least 35 m and is draped by a matrix-supported conglomerate with intrabasinal clasts up to boulder size. Imbricated clasts indicate a transport direction to the southeast. The infill succession above the lower erosional boundary contains two additional erosional unconformities with associated infill successions. Sedimentary structures and lithologies indicate a shallow, high energy, marine epicontinental sea during deposition of the lower part of the Langøyene Formation, terminated by the first major erosional surface as a subaerial, fluvial unconformity. The upper part of the Langøyene Formation is interpreted as deposited in three superimposed incised valleys, each defined by a lower subaerial unconformity and overlying sand-rich fluvial to estuarine marine high-energy infill succession. The uppermost unconformity and infill succession is interpreted laterally equivalent to a karstic surface on top of an oolithic Langøyene <b>arenaceous</b> <b>limestone</b> capped by a flooding surface beneath brown mudstone, and shale and nodular limestone of the Silurian Solvik Formation. The study favours that three events of fall in sea level took place during the Hirnantian; these are most likely connected to eustacy as a result of the glaciation of the Gondwana continent...|$|E
6000|$|At ST. FE BAJADA, in Entre Rios, the cliffs, {{estimated}} at between sixty and seventy feet in height, expose an interesting section: {{the lower half}} consists of tertiary strata with marine shells, and {{the upper half of}} the Pampean formation. The lowest bed is an obliquely laminated, blackish, indurated mud, with distinct traces of vegetable remains. (M. d'Orbigny [...] "Voyage" [...] Part. Geolog. page 37, has given a detailed description of this section, but as he does not mention this lowest bed, it may have been concealed when he was there by the river. There is a considerable discrepancy between his description and mine, which I can only account for by the beds themselves varying considerably in short distances.) Above this there is a thick bed of yellowish sandy clay, with much crystallised gypsum and many shells of Ostreae, Pectens, and Arcae: above this there generally comes an <b>arenaceous</b> crystalline <b>limestone,</b> but there is sometimes interposed a bed, about twelve feet thick, of dark green, soapy clay, weathering into small angular fragments. The limestone, where purest, is white, highly crystalline, and full of cavities: it includes small pebbles of quartz, broken shells, teeth of sharks, and sometimes, as I was informed, large bones: it often contains so much sand as to pass into a calcareous sandstone, and in such parts the great Ostrea Patagonica chiefly abounds. (Captain Sulivan, R.N., has given me a specimen of this shell, which he found in the cliffs at Point Cerrito, between twenty and thirty miles above the Bajada.) In the upper part, the limestone alternates with layers of fine white sand. The shells included in these beds have been named for me by M. d'Orbigny: they consist of:-- ...|$|R
