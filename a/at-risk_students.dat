One of the more prevalent changes pertains to the necessary use of evaluative, outcome research that demonstrates the applicability and evidence of treatment interventions with “at-risk ” student populations. In fact, the recent demands asserted by state officials, school administrators and building principals have emphasized the importance of uncovering interventions that empower, enhance and sustain the social, behavioral and academic ability of <b>at-risk</b> <b>student</b> populations across the United States. As a result of these escalating demands, emphasis in many school settings is now placed on how well treatment interventions impact the “bottom-line ” and result in what many refer to as “hard-data. ” More importantly, indices of hard-data for many school social workers now reside out of necessity and accountability, and how well the various interventions they practice impact the standardized tests, attendance records, and grades of <b>at-risk</b> <b>student</b> populations.

As of summer 2013, more than 2,400 Duke students had volunteered through DukeEngage in 75 nations on six continents. Duke students have created more than 30 service organizations in Durham and the surrounding area. Examples include a weeklong camp for children of cancer patients (Camp Kesem) and a group that promotes awareness about sexual health, rape prevention, alcohol and drug use, and eating disorders (Healthy Devils). The Duke-Durham Neighborhood Partnership, started by the Office of Community Affairs in 1996, attempts to address major concerns of local residents and schools by leveraging university resources. Another community project, [...] "Scholarship with a Civic Mission," [...] is a joint program between the Hart Leadership Program and the Kenan Institute for Ethics. Another program includes Project CHILD, a tutoring program involving 80 first-year volunteers; and an after-school program for <b>at-risk</b> <b>students</b> in Durham that was started with $2.25 million grant from the Kellogg Foundation in 2002. Two prominent civic engagement pre-orientation programs also exist for incoming freshmen: Project CHANGE and Project BUILD. Project CHANGE is a free weeklong program co-sponsored by the Kenan Institute for Ethics and the Duke Women's Center with the focus on ethical leadership and social change in the Durham community; students are challenged {{in a variety of ways}} and work closely with local non-profits. Project BUILD is a freshman volunteering group that dedicates 3,300 hours of service to a variety of projects such as schools, Habitat for Humanity, food banks, substance rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters.
