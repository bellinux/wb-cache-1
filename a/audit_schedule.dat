40|$|BACKGROUND: Problems {{with the}} {{provision}} of palliative care have been reported. Audit is one means of improving care. Earlier audits of primary care palliative care have been initiated by general practitioners (GPs) and are predominantly retrospective record reviews. Widely applicable methods for the audit of primary care palliative care do not exist. AIM: To develop relevant palliative care standards and to devise an <b>audit</b> <b>schedule</b> (the Cambridge palliative <b>audit</b> <b>schedule,</b> CAMPAS) suitable for monitoring palliative care in diverse primary care settings. METHOD: Primary health care team (PHCT) members collaborated at all stages. Reasonable outcomes and acceptable interventions for PHCTs were identified and standards developed. Each standard was constructed to ensure uniform interpretation, and CAMPAS was structured to collect data necessary for determining whether the standards were met. RESULTS: Over 50 % of PHCTs (n = 20) in the health district were recruited and trained to use CAMPAS. A total of 876 contacts with 29 patients was recorded by PHCTs using CAMPAS. Considerable inter- and intra-PHCT variation {{was found in the}} achievement of the standards. CONCLUSIONS: The favourable participation rate suggests commitment to audit and improvement in patient care. Overall, the standards were reported to be suitable. Although 100 % achievement of some standards may be unrealistic, the level of attainment for many suggests that it is possible. CAMPAS has been reported to be a useful structure for recording assessments and monitoring care, as well as a usable <b>audit</b> <b>schedule.</b> As an audit tool, it identified areas in need of improvement and facilitated feed-back to participants. Future audit is required to determine whether improvements in care have been effected...|$|E
40|$|Auditor travel can {{significantly}} complicate the scheduling process {{and have an}} important impact on audit cost, especially for audits of multinational companies. This paper formulates an optimization model that specifically incorporates auditor travel time and costs in {{the determination of the}} overall optimal <b>audit</b> <b>schedule.</b> From a more theoretical perspective, this research extends the method of cost control by proposing a method by which a sequence-dependent setup cost (i. e., travel cost) and an associated variable cost (i. e., out-of-town cost) can be programmed into an optimization process for audit planning. The proposed model provides an optimal schedule considering such costs in a multiple nonidentical manpower (i. e., different auditors) environment. Previous research on manpower scheduling has not dealt with sequence-dependent travel costs. The out-of-town time and cost elements are unique for manpower scheduling and not applicable for machine scheduling. An implementation of the model to an actual empirical audit is presented...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{has had a}} {{well-established}} quality audit system for universities since {{the establishment of the}} Australian Universities Quality Agency (AUQA) in 2000. The inclusion of the non-self-accrediting (non-university) higher education providers (NSA-HEPs) in these national auditing activities since 2006 has brought about considerable professionalization of Quality Assurance (QA) in that sector. Three aspects of this professionalization are evident. The first is the inclusion of these institutions in the national <b>audit</b> <b>schedule,</b> bringing a consistent and co-ordinated approach to audit, and ready public availability of audit results and themes. The second is the improved professional development of managers from the NSA-HEPs through workshops, guidelines and audit training and participation. While these two aspects have been predominantly driven from AUQA, the third response is from the sector itself to undertake its own improvement, through a key benchmarking study initiated by one of the sector organizations. It is clearly evident that the professionalization of the NSA-HEP sector has not only resulted from the professionalism of AUQA but has itself further stimulated the professionalization of the agency, as demonstrated by the appointment of specialist staff. It is anticipated that this professionalization of quality assurance will spread further from higher education to other sectors of post-secondary education. The imminent formation of a new agency, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), will further develop an integrated and professionalized approach to quality assurance across all of Australian tertiary education, including the vocational sector...|$|E

Although downstream contaminant dispersal patterns showed that at low flow the brook was less successful in absorbing contaminants at polluted surface water outfall (PSWO) entry points than it was at high flow (supporting the low flow strategy of contemporary audit schedules), this effect was found to vary downstream in response to reoxygenation from less polluted outfalls. Additionally, temporal variations in suspended solids, Escherichia coli counts, sediment-bound and soluble pollutant concentrations at low flow, and during two sampled storms, revealed that significant pollutant transfer was concentrated in the ‘first flush’ of storm events. A downstream survey of sediment-bound lead (Pb) found that concentrations in the bed sediments, which {{were likely to be}} mobilised during a first flush, were significantly higher than in solution. So, a complex pattern of downstream contaminant dispersal emerges, which varies with differing antecedent conditions, and through storms.

40|$|All {{world class}} {{manufacturing}} organizations have shop floor management in place. Shop floor management principles and tools are utilised {{to plan and}} to react in out of control conditions. Shop floor management is also utilised to involve people in decision making and to encourage continuous improvement. Various shop floor management principles exist and are applied differently depending {{on the nature of}} the business, however all these principles are present in all the companies researched. SA Canopy currently applies very little or no shop floor management principles. To be able to achieve its objectives and mission set by the new shareholders, shop floor excellence must be achieved. The objective of the study was to establish shop floor management principles utilised by the automotive industry as well as best in class organizations. To achieve this, a comprehensive literature study was performed on shop floor management. A questionnaire and <b>audit</b> <b>schedule</b> was designed based on guidelines in the literature study in order to establish what shop floor management principles are being utilised in the industry. The researcher used random sampling methods in distributing the questionnaire. An internal audit of the companies was conducted to support the responses in from the questionnaires. The opinions of the various respondents were compared with the guidelines provided in the literature survey in order to indentify shop floor management principles which would be suitable for SA Canopy. The following main recommendations were made: In order for SA canopy to achieve its objectives the company needs to develop a mission statement for everyone to work towards; SA Canopy needs to become more customer and supplier orientated. This will improve the overall performance of the business in respect of cost, quality and output; It is important that SA Canopy promotes teamwork so as to create a culture of continuous improvement; Problem solving skills need to be developed in the organization; Roles of Supervision need to be clearly defined and development programmes need to be put in place for supervision; A management process similar to the “Plan, Do, Check, Action “needs to be put in place to ensure effective actioning and monitoring of improvements and performance of stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|A {{recurring}} {{problem in}} project management involves {{the allocation of}} scarce resources to the individual jobs comprising the project. In many situations such as <b>audit</b> <b>scheduling,</b> the resources correspond to individuals (skilled labour).

In this paper we consider the nonpreemptive variant of a resource-constrained project job-assignment problem, where job durations as well as costs depend upon the assigned resource. Regarding precedence relations as well as release dates and deadlines, the question arises, to which jobs resources should be assigned {{in order to minimize}} overall costs.

In the west of Scotland, audit projects have been chosen as the format for practical work. A valid and reliable marking schedule for such projects is needed. AIM. A study was undertaken to develop a criterion-referenced marking schedule for assessing registrars' audit projects for summative assessment. METHOD. Medical and non-medical professionals, {{in a series of}} workshops, compiled a list of essential elements of good audit. These features were tested and refined using registrars' audit projects. All trainers in the west of Scotland were then sent a list of 14 criteria and asked to indicate whether each criterion was an essential or desirable component of a registrar's audit project for summative assessment. A final workshop was held to develop an <b>audit</b> marking <b>schedule.</b> RESULTS. Of 155 trainers in the west of Scotland, 135 replied to the list of criteria for registrar audit projects (87 %). Ten criteria were deemed essential or desirable by 80 % or more of the respondents.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple, two-period specialization model {{to analyze the}} effect of start-up costs on auditing competition. Audit firms in the model make strategic specialization and pricing decisions. Through specialization, an audit firm achieves a comparative cost advantage over its competitors for all clients whose characteristics are closer to its area of specialization. This comparative cost advantage is further fortified {{by the presence of}} start-up costs. As a result, each audit firm obtains some market power and is able to price-discriminate across clients by offering "specialization-and-relationship-specific" <b>audit</b> fee <b>schedules.</b> This paper demonstrates that the practice of "low-balling" is a natural consequence of competition among audit firms. However, low-balling occurs only in a certain market segment where audit firms compete fiercely. This paper also shows that a policy of banning low-balling acts as a substitute for the commitment of the audit firms to partially collude their pricing policies and results in increased profits for audit firms and increased fees. However, it also results in audit firms choosing specializations in a more efficient way, thereby reducing total auditing costs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Violence in {{and around}} {{premises}} licensed for the on-site sale and consumption of alcohol continues to burden the NHS with assault-related injuries. Trial design A randomised controlled trial with licensed premises as the unit of allocation, with additional process and cost-effectiveness evaluations. Methods: Premises were eligible (n[*]=[*] 837) if they were licensed for on-site sale and consumption of alcohol, were within 1 of the 22 local authorities (LAs) in Wales and had previously experienced violence. Data were analysed using Andersen–Gill recurrent event models in an intention-to-treat analysis. An embedded process evaluation examined intervention implementation, reach, fidelity, dose and receipt. An economic evaluation compared costs of the intervention with benefits. Intervention Premises were randomised to receive a violence-reduction intervention, Safety Management in Licensed Environments (SMILE), which was delivered by an environmental health practitioner (EHP; the agent). SMILE consisted of an initial risk audit to identify known risks of violence, a follow-up <b>audit</b> <b>scheduled</b> to enforce change for premises in which serious risks had been identified, structured advice from EHPs on how risks could be addressed in premises and online materials that provided educational videos and related material. Objective: To develop intervention materials that are acceptable and consistent with EHPs’ statutory remit; to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} SMILE intervention in reducing violence; to determine reach, fidelity, dose and receipt of the intervention; and to consider intervention cost-effectiveness. Outcome: Difference in police-recorded violence between intervention and control premises over a 455 -day follow-up period. Randomisation: A minimum sample size of 274 licensed premises per arm was required, rounded up to 300 and randomly selected from the eligible population. Licensed premises were randomly assigned by computer to intervention and control arms in a 1 [*]:[*] 1 ratio. Optimal allocation was used, stratified by LA. Premises opening hours, volume of previous violence and LA EHP capacity were used to balance the randomisation. Premises were dropped from the study if they were closed at the time of audit.

The study measured fire and smoke door maintenance compliance by undertaking a statistical random audit of 160 doors in 22 nursing homes in Western Australia, demonstrating a non-compliance level of 87 % on the audited doors with a total of 935 failures identified. As a result of the study’s findings, assumptions were able to be drawn such as a lack of suitably qualified staff, a lack of industry-focused skills and knowledge, the absence of any recognised licensing regime or legislative directives and the fire industry’s inability to provide a level of self governance to supervise practitioners. The study demonstrated that despite the requirement for nursing homes to be Government accredited and audited, supported with Australian national standards, there are still high levels of non-compliance...|$|R
40|$|Without much preparation, Indonesia, in 2000, at {{a stroke}} {{replaced}} the previous system of centralized government and development planning {{with a wide}} range of decentralization programs. The reforms gave greater authority, political power, and financial resources directly to regencies and municipalities, bypassing the provinces. The powers transferred include those of executing a wide range of responsibilities in the areas of health, primary and middle-level education, public works, environment, communication, transport, agriculture, manufacturing, and other economic sectors. At the same time, the government replaced the antiquated cash-based, single-entry system of public finance with a modern double-entry accounting system that uses a single treasury account; is performance based; and has transparent management of the public treasury, tight expenditure and financial controls with performance indicators, computerized reporting, and a tightly <b>scheduled</b> <b>auditing</b> system. On the positive side, unlike in many developing and transition countries, the decentralization program in Indonesia has not caused major political or economic problems. However, the decentralization program was ill prepared and not carried out in a logical order for two reasons. First, the capacity of subnational governments to produce public and private goods, increase productivity and employment, and promote economic growth in their jurisdictions, was not increased. Because of the long tradition of centralization, local government never built the capacity to carry out economic planning and undertake initiatives to promote local economic growth. Before the reform, the local governments had mainly functioned as implementing agencies of national policies and programs. Second, the number of good financial managers, as required by the new laws of public treasury and auditing, was also limited and needed to be trained. The rising revenues of local governments do not follow their increasing government functions to promote economic development that could potentially cause fiscal imbalances...|$|R
40|$|Late {{cancellation}} of scheduled operations {{is a major}} cause of inefficient use of operating-room time and a waste of resources. We studied elective operating theatre bookings in general surgical discipline. On the day of surgery the intended list was noted and a list of cancellations with the reason was noted by the attending anaesthesiologist. 1590 patients were scheduled for elective surgical procedures in 458 operation rooms. 30. 3 % patients were cancelled on the day of surgery. Of these, 59. 7 % were cancelled due to lack of availability of theatre time, 10. 8 % were cancelled because of medical reasons and 16. 2 % did not turned up on the day of surgery. In 5. 4 % patients, surgery was cancelled by surgeons due to a change in the surgical plan, 3. 7 % were cancelled because of administra-tive reasons, and 4. 2 % patients were postponed because of miscellaneous reasons. We believe that many of the on-the-day surgery cancellations of elective surgery were potentially avoidable. We observed that cancellations due to lack of theatre time were not only a scheduling problem but were mainly caused by surgeons underestimating the timeneeded for the operation. The requirement of the instruments necessary for scheduled surgical listshould be discussed a day prior to planned OR list and arranged. The non-availability of the surgeon should be informed in time so that another case is substituted in that slot. All patients who have met PACU discharge criteria must be discharged promptly to prevent delay in shifting out of the operated patient. Day care patients should be counseled adequately to report on time. Computerized scheduling should be utilized to create a realistic elective <b>schedule.</b> <b>Audit</b> should be carried out at regular intervals to find out the effective functioning of the operation theatre...|$|R
40|$|This FY 1996 Office of Inspector General (OIG) Annual Work Plan is {{a summary}} and {{distillation}} of {{information contained in}} annual work plans, and includes audits and inspections that are carried over from FY 1995 as well as <b>audits</b> and inspections <b>scheduled</b> to start during FY 1996. Audits and inspections included in this consolidated OIG Annual Work Plan will be performed by OIG staff. Specialized expertise available through a Certified Public Accounting firm {{will be used to}} assist in auditing the Department`s financial statements. As part of the OIG Cooperative Audit Strategy, additional audit coverage of the Department`s programs is provided by internal auditors of the Department`s integrated contractors. Through the Cooperative Audit Strategy, the OIG ensures that the internal auditors satisfy audit standards, provides planning guidance to the internal auditors, coordinates work to avoid duplication, and tracks the work of internal auditors to ensure that needed audits are performed. Applicable portions of the four annual work plans issued for Fiscal Year 1996 by the Deputy/Assistant Inspectors General have been combined to form a major part of this overall OIG Annual Work Plan. Also included are portions of the most recent OIG Semiannual Reports to Congress to give an overview of the OIG`s mission/organization, resource status, and the environment in which the OIG currently operates. The OIG Annual Work Plan also lists ongoing and planned audits and inspections, and it presents investigative statistics which have been previously reported in the two OIG Semiannual Reports to Congress which cover Fiscal Year 1995. Furthermore, included in this work plan are descriptions of several innovations developed by the OIG to streamline its operations and to conserve as much efficiency and economy as possible in a time of resource reductions...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In connection with fulfilling our requirement to audit the financial statements of the U. S. government, we audited and reported on the Schedules of Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003. As part of these audits, we performed {{a review of the}} general and application information security controls over key BPD financial systems. As we reported in connection with our <b>audit</b> of the <b>Schedules</b> of Federal Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, BPD maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control, including general and application information security controls, relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt related to financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations as of September 30, 2004, that provided reasonable assurance that misstatements, losses, or noncompliance material in relation to the Schedule of Federal Debt would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We found matters involving information security controls that we do not consider to be reportable conditions, but that nevertheless warrant BPD management's attention and action. This report presents the results of our fiscal year 2004 testing of the general and application information security controls that support key BPD automated financial systems relevant to BPD's Schedule of Federal Debt and the results of our follow-up on the status of BPD's corrective actions to address recommendations that were contained in our prior years' audits and open as of September 30, 2003. In a separately issued Limited Official Use Only report, we communicated detailed information regarding our findings to BPD management. We also assessed the general and application information security controls over key BPD financial systems that the Federal Reserve Banks (FRB) maintain and operate on behalf of BPD. We have communicated the results of such testing to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ...|$|R
40|$|An audit is {{the process}} used by {{independent}} professional accountants to gather evidence to express an opinion on the financial statements of an entity, usually a company. Even though audits are customarily done for shareholders, they are often conducted for third parties such as lenders and potential investors. Companies that require audited financial statements need annually to purchase audit services.;A substantial amount of {{research has focused on}} the way auditors perform their tasks but this thesis focuses on the way clients manage the audit process. The audit process consists of work which is done by the auditors, the client and work that could be performed by either party. It is this last category which is identified in this thesis as the 2 ̆ 2 tradeoff zone 2 ̆ 2. Within this tradeoff zone the thesis identifies and labels three types of client strategies: 2 ̆ 2 major buyers 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 in-transit 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 major doers 2 ̆ 2. Data was gathered using a combination of in-depth interviews and questionnaires. One chartered accountancy firm and 15 of its clients were used as a sample. Clients were small and medium-sized, non-listed organizations which were privately owned and Canadian controlled.;The data indicates that in recent years, particularly, the desire to control audit fees has been a major determinant of the client 2 ̆ 7 s choice of strategy. It was found that clients in the same category tended to prepare the same type of <b>schedules.</b> <b>Audit</b> strategies were used more deliberately by major doers than by the other two categories. Major doers also tended to be companies of larger size. Other major factors which affected the strategy used by a client were the controller 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge in accounting and auditing, and the president 2 ̆ 7 s and the controller 2 ̆ 7 s attitude towards the audit process.;The data suggests that clients in each of the strategic categories can improve their management of the audit process. These improvements appear to be more significant for the in-transit category, because of the savings available. Hopefully, the information in this thesis will assist both clients and auditors to improve their effectiveness and productivity...|$|R
