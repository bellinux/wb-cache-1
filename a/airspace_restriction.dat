40|$|We {{present a}} large-scale, {{airspace}} planning and collaborative decision-making model(APCDM) {{to enhance the}} management of the U. S. National Airspace System (NAS). Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight as prompted by various <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction</b> scenarios imposed by dynamic severe weather systems or space launch special use airspaces (SUA), we develop a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air traffic control workload, and airline equity constraints. The model includes a three-dimensional probabilistic conflict analysis, the derivation of valid inequalities, the development of air traffic control workload metrics, and the consideration of equity among airline carriers in absorbing costs related to rerouting, delays, and possible cancellations. The resulting APCDM model has potential use for both tactical and strategic applications, such as air traffic control in response to severe weather phenomena or spacecraft launches, FAA policy evaluation (separation standards, workload restrictions, sectorization strategies), Homeland Defense contingency planning, and military air campaign planning. The model can also serve a useful role in augmenting the FAA’s National Playbook of standardized flight profiles in different disruption-prone regions of the national airspace. The present paper focuses on the theory and model development; Part II of this paper will address model parameter estimations and implementation test results. 1...|$|E
40|$|Air {{route network}} optimization, {{one of the}} {{essential}} parts of the airspace planning, is {{an effective way to}} optimize airspace resources, increase airspace capacity, and alleviate air traffic congestion. However, little has been done on the optimization of air route network in the fragmented airspace caused by prohibited, restricted, and dangerous areas (PRDs). In this paper, an air route network optimization model is developed with the total operational cost as the objective function while <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction,</b> air route network capacity, and non-straight-line factors (NSLF) are taken as major constraints. A square grid cellular space, Moore neighbors, a fixed boundary, together with a set of rules for solving the route network optimization model are designed based on cellular automata. The empirical traffic of airports with the largest traffic volume in each of the 9 flight information regions in mainland China is collected as the origin-destination (OD) airport pair demands. Based on traffic patterns, the model generates 35 air routes which successfully avoids 144 PRDs. Compared with the current air route network structure, the number of nodes decreases by 41. 67 %, while the total length of flight segments and air routes drop by 32. 03 % and 5. 82 % respectively. The NSLF decreases by 5. 82 % with changes in the total length of the air route network. More importantly, the total operational cost of the whole network decreases by 6. 22 %. The computational results show the potential benefits of the model and the advantage of the algorithm.

40|$|This note {{proposes a}} series of {{exercises}} concerning the assurance of safety-related systems involving E/E/PE components using the principles of IEC 61508. The exercises have been commented by others in a mailing-list format. References to those comments in the mailing list archive are given. I don't consider {{that any of the}} questions posed have yet been answered adequately. The Situation Suppose my customer has a large area of ground for critical infrastructure, say a square kilometer, which she wishes to maintain under constant surveillance with video and infrared sensing. The spatial geometry of the area with its structures is complex enough that fixed-base surveillance is impractical; also she judges that potential attackers could too easily survey and selectively disable ground-based sensing. She has decided for aerial surveillance and obtained the necessary <b>airspace</b> <b>restriction,</b> airspace over her domain, extending a further half kilometer beyond the boundary in each direction, in which flight is prohibited, except for her surveillance devices, under 2, 500 ft altitude. This infrastructure lies in a built-up area (it didn't when it was originally built, but the city has grown up around it) and includes containers holding dangerous bioactive substances that must not be released into the atmosphere. She has bought aircraft which were originally personal transports but have been modified as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a variant of the proven-in-use automated flight systems (AFS) of the Boeing 737, the world's most highly-flown jet airliner, with of course the flight parameters adjusted for the rather smaller, slower surveillance vehicle. The autothrottle of this airliner has a mode called RETARD, into which it passes when the aircraft is to flare on landing. In RETARD mode, the autothrottle closes the throttles to idle. Its sensors are radio altimeters (also known as radar altimeters), RAs. The Boeing 737 slaves the autothrottle to just one RA, but since RAs are not sufficiently reliable, three are included in the drone and a 2 oo 3 voting module has been added to the autothrottle software. This modification is similar to what some safety experts suggested after the Turkish Airline...|$|E

Transatlantic flights between US and Europe constitute {{one of the}} busiest oceanic airspace regions in the world. This paper examines the benefits of a wind-optimal trajectory concept with a strategic de-confliction component compared to the current flight planning using the North Atlantic Tracks. The methodology generates a wind-optimal route for each aircraft and a strategic reduction in the potential conflicts between aircraft by a combination of small adjustments to departure times and rerouting. The de-confliction is achieved by optimization techniques involving simulated annealing with local gradient searching. The fuel burn for the tracks in today’s Organized Track System are compared with the corresponding quantities for the wind-optimized routes to evaluate the potential benefits of flying wind-optimal routes in North Atlantic Airspace. The analysis is based on air traffic between US and Europe during July 2012.
