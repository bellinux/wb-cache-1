5|$|Across Florida, Gordon's winds damaged {{power lines}} and knocked down trees and traffic signals; about 425,000people lost power due to the storm. The rains caused {{flooding}} in Dade and Collier counties, which damaged $275million worth of crops, mostly to vegetables and sugar cane. In some locations, the crop damage was worse than during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, due to fewer crops being planted when Andrew struck the state. Along Elliott Key, Gordon damaged the coral reef system {{to a greater extent}} than Andrew. Inland flooding damaged buildings due to fast-rising water and roof collapses. In Volusia County, floods entered 1,236buildings, causing $26million in damage. Flooding caused dozens of roads to close, some of which were washed out. In the Everglades, flooding killed several deer. Statewide, two people drowned in separate instances after driving into flooded areas. Three people drowned along beaches, including one man who died in a rip current while attempting to rescue his son. In Hillsboro Inlet, two people drowned after their boat was overturned by high waves. Throughout Florida, Gordon directly killed eight people, and injured 43people. There were also three indirect deaths; two were from traffic accidents, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> related to a heart attack after a person pushed a stalled car in a flooded road. Statewide damage was estimated at $400million (1994 USD, $ USD).|$|E
5|$|Against this, the Japanese force, {{commanded}} personally by Horii, {{was built}} around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting {{since the start of}} the campaign, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75mm guns, two 37mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle.|$|E
