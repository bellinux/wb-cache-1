40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} {{is at the}} heart of clinical dermatology and dermatopathology. Yet, while every practitioner of the art of dermatological diagnosis recognizes the supreme value of diagnostic cues provided by defined patterns of 'efflorescences', few contemplate on the biological basis of pattern formation in <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions.</b> Vice versa, developmental and theoretical biologists, who would be best prepared to study skin lesion patterns, are lamentably slow to discover this field as a uniquely instructive testing ground for probing theoretical concepts on pattern generation in the human system. As a result, we have at best scraped the surface of understanding the biological basis of pattern formation of skin lesions, and widely open questions dominate over definitive answer. As a symmetry-breaking force, pattern formation represents one of the most fundamental principles that nature enlists for system organization. Thus, the peculiar and often characteristic arrangements that skin lesions display provide a unique opportunity to reflect upon – and to experimentally dissect – the powerful organizing principles at the crossroads of developmental, skin and theoretical biology, genetics, and clinical dermatology that underlie these – increasingly less enigmatic – phenomena. The current 'Controversies' feature offers a range of different perspectives on how pattern formation of skin lesions can be approached. With this, we hope to encourage more systematic interdisciplinary research efforts geared at unraveling the many unsolved, yet utterly fascinating mysteries of dermatological pattern formation. In short: never a dull pattern...|$|E
40|$|Acanthamoeba spp. are the causative {{agents of}} Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} (AK), which mainly occurs in contact lens wearers, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions,</b> granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), and disseminating diseases in the immunocompromised host. AK therapy {{is complex and}} irritating for the eye, skin lesions are difficult to treat, {{and there is no}} effective treatment for GAE. Therefore, new anti-Acanthamoeba drugs are needed. We investigated the anti-Acanthamoeba activity of N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild antiseptic. It was shown that NCT has amoebicidal qualities, both in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and in amoebic culture medium. After 6 h of treatment with 10 mM NCT in PBS, the levels of trophozoites of all strains investigated already showed at least a 2 -log reduction. When the trophozoites were treated with 20 mM NCT in culture medium, they showed a 2 -log reduction after 24 h. The addition of NH 4 Cl to NCT led to a faster decrease in the numbers of living cells, if tests were carried out in PBS. A delay of excystation was observed when cysts were treated with 55 mM (1 %) NCT in culture medium. A complete failure of excystment was the result of treatment with 1 % NCT plus 1 % NH 4 Cl in PBS. Altogether, NCT clearly demonstrated amoebicidal activity at concentrations well tolerated by human tissues and might be useful as a topical drug for the treatment of Acanthamoeba infections. The addition of ammonium chloride can be considered to enhance the activity...|$|E

We report herein a clinical {{presentation of}} sarcoid-like PCM, initially diagnosed as tuberculoid leprosy.
