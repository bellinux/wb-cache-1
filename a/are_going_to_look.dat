2500|$|The imprint {{will not}} publish books written by Riordan, [...] "whose role will {{be closer to}} curator". In an {{interview}} with the Iowa Gazette, Riordan said, [...] "instead of me writing all of the mythologies we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for authors who already are writing about that stuff. If I feel like I can recommend them ... we’re going to have them out here in the spotlight." [...] A focus will be placed on [...] "diverse, mythology-based fiction by new, emerging, and under-represented authors". Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans, without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year.|$|E
2500|$|... "I am too demotivated {{and knocked}} back to {{continue}} investing," [...] said Álvaro Noboa to {{one member of}} the press who asked him about the reasons for his decision. [...] The former candidate stated that [...] "In Ecuador there are so many problems that we have slowed down investment a bit. [...] Now we <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at continuing development of agricultural production, but in other countries like China, Macedonia, India, and various regions of Africa.

2500|$|Rowling allowed Cuarón to make {{minor changes}} to the book, on the {{condition}} that he stuck to the book's spirit. She allowed him to place a sundial on Hogwarts' grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then unreleased sixth book. Rowling said she [...] "got goosebumps" [...] when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated [...] "people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues." [...] When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had [...] "been the two sweetest years of my life," [...] and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.|$|E

[...] On the same day, Vaz told reporters that they would [...] "regret" [...] their behaviour once {{the facts of the}} case were revealed. [...] "Some of you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> very foolish when this report comes out. Some of the stuff you said about Peter, and about others and me, you'll regret very much when the facts come out", he said. When asked why the passport application of one of the Hinduja brothers had been processed more quickly than normal, being processed and sanctioned in six months when the process can take up to two years, he replied, [...] "It is not unusual." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; that's {{just the}} point. It's so {{fortunate}} they were frank about it.
