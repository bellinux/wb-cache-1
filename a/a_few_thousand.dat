5|$|<b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> of {{the first}} {{circulation}} strikes, {{as well as a}} handful of proof coins, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces. Although specimens of the two-cent piece, being of base metal, were not set aside for testing by the annual Assay Commission, Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time Crimean Tatars devastated Russian territories and burned and looted Moscow during the Russo-Crimean Wars. Drought and {{epidemics}} had fatally affected the Russian economy while oprichnina had thoroughly disrupted the government. Following the defeat of Crimean and Nogai forces in 1572, oprichnina was wound down {{and with it the}} way Russian armies were formed also changed. Ivan IV had introduced a new strategy whereby he relied on tens of thousands of native troops, Cossacks and Tatars instead of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> skilled troops and mercenaries, as was the practice of his adversaries.|$|E

5|$|By {{the next}} day, the revolt was rapidly growing. The villagers spread the news across the region, and John Geoffrey, a local bailiff, rode between Brentwood and Chelmsford, {{rallying}} support. On 4 June, the rebels gathered at Bocking, where their future plans {{seem to have}} been discussed. The Essex rebels, possibly <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> strong, advanced towards London, some probably travelling directly and others via Kent. One group, under the leadership of John Wrawe, a former chaplain, marched north towards the neighbouring county of Suffolk, with the intention of raising a revolt there.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E

5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of the}} PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Gaddafi {{was ready}} now for an {{offensive}}. The decisive offensive began in June, when a 3,000-strong GUNT force invested Faya-Largeau, the main government stronghold in the North, which fell on 25 June. The GUNT force rapidly proceeded towards Koro Toro, Oum Chalouba and Abéché, assuming {{control of the}} main routes towards N'Djamena. Libya, while helping with recruiting, training, and providing the GUNT with heavy artillery, only committed <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> regular troops to the offensive, {{and most of these}} were artillery and logistic units. This may have been due to Gaddafi's desire that the conflict be read as a Chadian internal affair.|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys {{is known}} only from Fernando de Noronha, a small {{archipelago}} of volcanic origin off northeastern Brazil, {{consisting of a}} main island and several associated smaller islands. The formation of the archipelago, which has never been connected to the mainland, began about 11million years ago; active vulcanism ceased about 2million years ago. Remains of Noronhomys were found in association with remains of various reptiles, birds, and snails, several of which are also restricted to the archipelago, in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island. The age of the deposits is unknown, but is likely late Holocene, at most <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> years old.|$|E

Their empire collapsed after the Spanish era as their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera in the late 1840s; the population plunged from 20,000 to just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> by the 1870s.
