The divergence of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>million</b> years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic.

5|$|In 1977, Charles Kowal {{discovered}} 2060 Chiron, an icy planetoid with {{an orbit}} between Saturn and Uranus.

5|$|The oldest volcano in the chain, Meiji Seamount, {{perched on}} the edge of the Aleutian Trench, formed 85 million years ago.

It is unknown whether the seamount chain has been subducting under the Eurasian Plate, and whether the hotspot is older than Meiji Seamount, as any older seamounts have since been destroyed by the plate margin. It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E
5|$|Whenever {{the ratio}} of an object's mass to its radius becomes {{sufficiently}} large, general relativity predicts {{the formation of a}} black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>million</b> to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have {{played an important role in}} the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Associative Processor (AP) {{combines}} {{data storage}} and data processing, and functions simultaneously as a massively parallel array SIMD processor and memory. Traditionally, AP {{is based on}} CMOS technology, similar to other classes of massively parallel SIMD processors. The main component of AP is a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) array. As CMOS feature scaling slows down, CAM experiences scalability problems. In this work, we propose and investigate an AP based on resistive CAM- the Resistive AP (ReAP). We show that resistive memory technology potentially allows scaling the AP from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>millions</b> to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred <b>millions</b> of processing units on a single silicon die. We compare the performance and power consumption of a ReAP to a CMOS AP and a conventional SIMD accelerator (GPU) and show that ReAP, although exhibiting higher power density, allows better scalability and higher performance...|$|R

5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>million</b> years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>million</b> light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time taken for the {{extinction}} to occur is a controversial issue, because some theories about the extinction's causes require a rapid extinction over {{a relatively short period}} (from a few years to a few thousand years) while others require longer periods. The issue is difficult to resolve because of the Signor–Lipps effect; that is, the fossil record is so incomplete that most extinct species probably died out long after the most recent fossil that has been found. Scientists have also found very few continuous beds of fossil-bearing rock that cover a time range from several million years before the K–Pg extinction to <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>million</b> years after it. The sedimentation rate and thickness of K-Pg clay from three sites suggest short duration of event, perhaps less than ten thousand years.|$|E
