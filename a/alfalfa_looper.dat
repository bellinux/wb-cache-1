50|$|The <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper</b> (Autographa californica) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} from Southern British Columbia to Baja California and to Manitoba, South Dakota, Colorado and New Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The most studied {{baculovirus}} is Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The {{virus was}} originally {{isolated from the}} <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper</b> (a lepidopteran) and contains a 134-kbp genome with 154 open reading frames (ORF). The major capsid protein VP39 together with some minor proteins forms the nucleocapsid (21 nm x 260 nm) that encloses the DNA with p6.9 protein.|$|E
40|$|Some minor {{defoliators}} {{have been}} noted in soybean this growing season, including caterpillars, beetles, and grasshoppers. Specifically, soybean defoliators observed include green cloverworm, soybean <b>looper,</b> <b>alfalfa</b> caterpillar, imported longhorn weevil, Japanese beetle, and Iowa colaspis beetle. It {{is important to remember}} that soybean can tolerate as much as 40 % defoliation during vegetative growth stages, and 20 % during pod-forming and pod-fillings stages before yield loss occurs. If defoliation is observed during scouting, it is important to identify the insect or combination of insects...|$|R
40|$|The {{baculovirus}} {{from the}} lepidopteran host Autographa californica (<b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper)</b> {{was shown to}} replicate in a dipteran cell line without the production of characteristic polyhedral inclusion bodies. The low level of replication could not be detected by 50 % tissue culture infective dose titrations, but was apparent by [3 H]thymidine labeling of the viral genome. Immunoprecipitation of the radioactive product confirmed baculovirus production...|$|E
40|$|Moths {{and other}} insects at flowers of Oregongrape (Berberis aquifolium [Mahonia aquifolium]) were sampled with traps during April and May 2001 in Yakima, Washington, USA. Moths {{captured}} were predominantly the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper</b> (Autographa californica; 43 %), and the gooseberry fruitworm (Zophodia grossulariella; 26 %) with {{small numbers of}} 14 other species in the families Noctuidae and Geometridae. Analyses of samples made from the air around blooms of Oregongrape shrubs revealed the consistent presence of alpha -pinene, beta -pinene, sabinene, E- beta -ocimene, beta -myrcene, limonene, benzaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde. Greatest amounts released per flower per hour were 124. 5 +or- 40. 8 ng phenylacetaldehyde, 87. 6 +or- 6. 7 ng alpha -pinene, 54. 4 +or- 17. 8 ng E- beta -ocimene, and 43. 9 +or- 7. 0 ng limonene. Phenylacetaldehyde and benzaldehyde are known attractants for some moths, including the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper.</b> The odour produced by Oregongrape blooms may attract feeding moths for pollination of flowers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phenylacetaldehyde is {{a flower}} {{volatile}} and attractant for many nectar-seeking moths. Acetic acid is a microbial fermentation {{product that is}} present in insect sweet baits. It is weakly attractive to some moths and other insects, but can be additive or synergistic with other compounds to make more powerful insect lures. RESULTS: Acetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde presented together in traps made a stronger lure than either chemical alone for moths of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper</b> Autographa californica (Speyer) and the armyworm Spodoptera albula (Walker). However, this combination of chemicals reduced captures of the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni (H ¨ ubner), the silver Y moth Autographa gamma (L.), MacDunnoughia confusa (Stephens) and the soybean looper moth Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) by comparison with phenylacetaldehyde alone. CONCLUSION: These results indicate {{both positive and negative}} interactions of acetic acid, a sugar fermentation odor cue, and phenylacetaldehyde, a floral scent cue, in eliciting orientation responses of moths. This research provides a newtwo-component lure for the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper</b> A. californica and for the armyworm S. albula for potential use in pestmanagement...|$|E
40|$|IMPROVEMENT of {{biological}} pesticides through genetic modification has enormous potential and the insect baculoviruses are particularly amenable to this approach 1, 2. A key aim {{of genetic engineering}} is to increase their speed of kill, primarily by the incorporation of genes which encode arthropod or bacterially derived insect-selective toxins 3 – 11, insect hormones 12, 13 or enzymes 14, 15. We report here the first, to our knowledge, field trial of a genetically improved nuclear polyhedrosis virus of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper,</b> Autogmpha californica (AcNPV) that expresses an insectselective toxin gene (AaHIT) derived from the venom of the scorpion Androclonus australisl 6 – 18. Previous laboratory assays with the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, demonstrated a 25 % reduction in time to death compared to the wild-type virus, but unaltered pathogenicity 6 and host range 19. In the field, the modified baculovirus killed faster, resulting in reduced crop damage and it appeared to reduce the secondary cycle of infection compared to the wild-type v...|$|E
40|$|Temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants were {{isolated}} from the baculovirus Autographa californica (<b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper)</b> MNPV, grown in Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm) cells {{in the presence of}} N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. Of 567 plaque isolates screened, 27 were temperature sensitive (ts), representing a mutation frequency of 4. 8 %. Ten ts mutants were studied in detail: six failed to yield nonoccluded virus at 33 °C (NOV mutants), whereas the other four produced nonoccluded virus but were restricted in formation of polyhedra at 33 °C (Poly mutants). One of the six NOV mutants failed to synthesize viral DNA. Reversion and leak frequencies were determined, and the mutants were assorted into complementation groups based on the yield of polyhedrin synthesis in cells coinfected with pairs of mutants at 33 °C, as measured by radioimmunoassay. For NOV mutants, complementation indexes were also based on virus yield and were consistent with those based on polyhedrin synthesis. Nine mutants were assorted into five complementation groups. One mutant remained unclassified...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Behavioral and {{ecological}} {{aspects of the}} field and developmental biology of Apanteles yakutatensis (Ashm.), a primary larval parasite of the <b>alfalfa</b> <b>looper,</b> Autographa californica (Speyer), were investigated in 1980 and 1981. Populations of A. yakutatensis were found in commercial peppermint, alfalfa and crimson clover fields involving two areas (Willamette Valley, Great Basin) with very different climatic regimes. Second instar host larvae appeared to be the most commonly attacked stage in the field. There was no relationship between the numbers of host larvae collected in any one sample and the proportion of hosts parasitized in that sample. Thus, in peppermint fields, A. yakutatensis did not appear to respond in a dependent manner to changes in host density. Requirements for larval development and adult longevity were investigated in the laboratory. When fed a thirty percent honey water solution, A. yakutatensis females lived an average of 18 days and males lived an average 16. 5 days. When provided with water only, males and females lived an average of 2. 5 days. The larvae of A. yakutatensis required 162 degree days above 10. 5 °C to complete development, and pupae required 85 degree days above 9. 4 °C. Larvae of A. yakutatensis required 10. 5 days to complete development at 26 °C and passed through three instars. The first instar was mandibulate, and the other two were hymenopteriform. The age of host attacked had no significant effect on the time required for development of A. yakutatensis at 26 °C, but did affect the time required for the host to reach the prepupal stage. The number of A. yakutatensis larvae per host did not affect the percentage of larvae successfully emerging from individual hosts, but there was a negative relationship between the number of larvae per host and the mean weight of adults produced by individual hosts...|$|E
