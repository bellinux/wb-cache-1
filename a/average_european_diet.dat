40|$|Two {{independent}} cross-sectional dietary surveys (the Individual and National Food Consumption Surveys, INCA), {{performed in}} 1998 – 99 (INCA 1) and in 2006 – 07 (INCA 2) on nationally representative samples of French people, {{were used to}} analyse trends in the dietary habits and nutritional intake of French adults. Food consumption was recorded through 7 -d dietary records, and nutritional intakes were assessed using the French food composition database. After exclusion of under-reporters, analyses were performed on 3267 adults, aged 18 – 79 years: 1345 from INCA 1 and 1922 from INCA 2. The trends highlighted over the 8 -year period showed a decrease in consumption of dairy products, meat, bread, potatoes, pastries/croissant-like pastries/cakes/biscuits and sugar/confectionery. In contrast, the consumption of fruits and vegetables, rice, ice cream and chocolate increased. Other food groups, like fish and snacking foods, remained stable. Food choices were mostly age specific. These age differences remained consistent {{over the years and}} underlined two opposite dietary trends: a ‘traditional’ one mainly followed by the elderly, and a ‘snacking and convenience’ one mainly adopted by young adults. The overall trends in food consumption did not influence the mean energy intake, but did slightly modify the contribution of each macronutrient to energy intake. These repeated surveys highlighted the fact that trends in French food habits have moved towards an <b>average</b> <b>European</b> <b>diet</b> at the crossroads between Mediterranean and Northern diets, and that food consumption changes impacted, to a lesser extent, nutritional intake. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper presents {{an argument that}} the current direction of research into the Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> does not accurately portray the language contact situation in Europe. The evidence for such an argument is derived from how gratitude is expressed in the different languages and regions of Europe. The patterns evident in the data indicate that there are numerous contact situations in Europe that are not recognized in the current interpretation of the Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> hypothesis. These contact situations all possess {{the same degree of}} validity as those described in the current interpretation of the Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> hypothesis. The conclusion of this research is that the field of contact linguistics would be better served by reframing the Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> hypothesis as a language union composed of numerous overlapping micro language unions rather than one macro language union with concentric “circles” of membership that decrease as distance increases.

40|$|A recent {{trend in}} the study of Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> is the {{extraterritorial}} perspective of examining the extent to which non-European languages have converged with this Sprachbund as a result of contact with one or more of its members. The present article complements this line of research in that it investigates {{the extent to which a}} European language has diverged from Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European</b> after leaving the linguistic area. The focus is on Dutch, a nuclear member of the Sprachbund, and Afrikaans, its colonial offshoot. The two languages are compared with respect to twelve of the most distinctive linguistic features of Standard <b>Average</b> <b>European.</b> Afrikaans is found to share ten of them with Dutch, including anticausative prominence and formally distinguished intensifiers and reflexives, and could therefore still be considered a core member of the Sprachbund, despite deviations in the expression of negative pronouns and the grammaticality of external possessor constructions. This relatively low degree of divergence may be attributed to the continuity from Settler Dutch to at least the variety of Afrikaans on which the standard language is based and to the important role that Dutch continued to play in the history of Afrikaans...|$|R

50|$|Many {{different}} foods can {{be prepared}} by dehydration. Meat has held an historically significant role. For centuries, much of the <b>European</b> <b>diet</b> depended on dried cod—known as salt cod, bacalhau (with salt), or stockfish (without). It formed the main protein source for the slaves on the West Indian plantations, and was a major economic force within the triangular trade. Dried shark meat, known as Hákarl, is a delicacy in Iceland, while dried reindeer meat is a traditional Sami food. Currently popular dried meats include prosciutto (a.k.a. Parma ham), bresaola, biltong and beef jerky.|$|R
