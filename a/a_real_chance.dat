New England had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> to win their first MLS championship, in MLS Cup 2006, against the Houston Dynamo. After Taylor Twellman scored in the 113th minute, the Revs allowed an equalizing header from the Dynamo's Brian Ching less than a minute later that sent the game to penalty kicks, where the Revs lost 4–3.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{was traded}} to the Kansas City Athletics with pitcher Jack McMahan for Spook Jacobs and $5,000 cash. He never played a game with the Athletics, who soon sent him to the Columbus Jets of the International League in late June 1956. Neither Jacobs nor McMahan lasted beyond the 1956 season in the Majors. After being traded to the Athletics, Pittsburgh's main black newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier, protested that Roberts never had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> in the Majors. However, Pirates general manager Joe L. Brown replied that Roberts was a [...] "fine young man, but a {{marginal}} Major Leaguer," [...] whose weak hitting was compounded by a lack of versatility: [...] "He was really a one-position player. He didn't have the arm to play shortstop." ...|$|E

His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just {{no question in my mind}} that Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E

500|$|Kurt and Blaine's duet on [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] {{received}} many more reviews {{than the other}} songs, and the greatest praise. Wieselman called it his [...] "far and away favorite" [...] song of the episode. Stack declared it the [...] "complete and total highlight of the episode {{and one of the}} best moments of the second season". He gave it an [...] "A+". Hankinson said it was the show's [...] "best musical number", and described it as [...] "well-performed, sweet and wonderfully choreographed"; he added: [...] "It was bold, without being gimmicky". The Atlantic Meghan Brown and Patrick Burns were both enthusiastic: Brown said [...] "Kurt's sweetly sexy duet with Blaine was near-perfect" [...] and [...] "the vocals and choreography gave Chris Colfer and Darren Criss <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> to shine", while Burns called it [...] "adorable". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote that it was [...] "full of sweet harmonies and has an ideal undercurrent of romantic tension", though Harper [...] "wasn't feeling any chemistry between them"; she felt the performance was [...] "a little overacted", but noted that [...] "their voices seem to like each other". Benigno was also less enthusiastic; he gave the song a [...] "B−" [...] and felt there was [...] "something missing" [...] from the rendition: [...] "these two could have sang this number in their sleep and it kind of sounds like they did".|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} first five games in charge, {{including}} a 7–0 thumping from Grimsby Town at Blundell Park, Gannon {{admitted that the}} club's finances limited his ability to change personnel. He also stated that [...] "if I didn't take the job, this club would've had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of dying... I'm not proud to be {{the manager of a}} club that loses 7–0... but this is my team now... It has always been my club, so it's my responsibility to make things better, and over time we will." [...] He released striker Antonio German, defender Chris Blackburn, and seven goal top-scorer Nick Chadwick in the January transfer window. He then signed defender Joe Connor on non-contract terms, and teenagers Aaron Cole and Danny Rowe on loan. His first win in his second spell at the club came on New Year's Day, in a 3–2 victory over Barrow at Edgeley Park. He then re-signed former players Paul Turnbull and Matty Mainwaring on loan. Worried by the situation at crisis clubs Darlington and Kettering Town, Gannon cancelled the contracts of veterans Matt Glennon, John Miles, Mark Lynch, and Ryan McCann. He brought in 23-year-old Telford defender Sean Newton and 18-year-old Sunderland keeper Lewis King on loan, whilst signing 19-year-old Lancaster City midfielder Danny Hattersley on a permanent transfer. The [...] "Hatters" [...] secured their Conference status with two games to spare, after a 1–1 home draw with Braintree Town on 14 April, having lost just twice in the league at Edgeley Park since Gannon's return. Stockport finished the campaign in 16th place, 10 points above the drop and 20 points below the play-off zone.|$|E

40|$|A common {{argument}} {{in the context of}} the Eurozone’s economic problems is that Germany should pursue a more expansive fiscal policy to help generate growth in the rest of the single currency area.

He argues that unless the country increases public investment there is <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of Germany developing into a dysfunctional economy, with the only hope for growth residing in exports and citizens struggling with both low wage growth and spiralling income inequality...|$|R

50|$|Social {{identities are}} a valued {{aspect of the}} self, and people will {{sacrifice}} their pecuniary self-interest to maintain the self-perception that they belong to a given social group.

Illingworth won an argumentative series 2–0 and regained the Ashes, but Cowdrey only made 82 runs (20.50) in the series. They carried on to New Zealand, Cowdrey missed the First Test and needed a runner to make 54 and 45 in the Second Test at Auckland, coming in at 63/4 in the second innings when New Zealand had <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of winning their first victory against England, but he added 76 with Alan Knott (96), and the danger was averted.|$|E
2500|$|Hillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi-finals in the 1980s. A crush {{occurred}} at the Leppings Lane end of the ground during the 1981 semi-final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated, resulting in 38 injuries, including broken arms, legs and ribs. Police believed there had been <b>a</b> <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> of fatalities had swift action not been taken, and recommended the club reduce its capacity. In a post-match briefing to discuss the incident, Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked: [...] "Bollocks—no one would have been killed". The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end, dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement. This 1981 change and other later changes to the stadium invalidated the stadium's safety certificate. The safety certificate was never renewed and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed. The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in 1984, and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in 1986 to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we apply}} real options theory and modern capital {{budgeting}} {{to the problem}} of valuing an Internet company. We formulate the model in continuous time, form a discrete time approximation, estimate the model parameters, solve the model by simulation, and then perform sensitivity analysis. Depending on the parameters chosen, we find that the value of an Internet stock may be rational given high enough growth rates in revenues. Even with <b>a</b> very <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> that <b>a</b> firm may go bankrupt, if the initial growth rates are sufficiently high, and if there is enough volatility in this growth rate over time, then valuations can be what would otherwise appear to be dramatically high. In addition, we find a large sensitivity of the valuation to initial conditions and exact specification of the parameters. This is also consistent with the observation that the returns of Internet stocks have been strikingly volatile. 3 RATIONAL PRICING OF INTERNET COMPANIES 1. INTRODUCTION It is diffic [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Richard Sorabji's 1980 Necessity, Cause, and Blame {{surveyed}} Aristotle's {{positions on}} causation and necessity, comparing {{them to his}} predecessors and successors, especially the Stoics and Epicurus. Sorabji argues that Aristotle was <b>an</b> indeterminist, that <b>real</b> <b>chance</b> and uncaused events exist, but never that human actions are uncaused in the extreme libertarian sense that some commentators mistakenly attribute to Epicurus.Aristotle accepted the past as fixed, {{in the sense that}} past events were irrevocable. But future events cannot be necessitated by claims about the present truth value of statements about the future. Aristotle does not deny the excluded middle (either p or not p), only that the truth value of p does not exist yet. Indeed, although the past is fixed, the truth value of past statements about the future can be changed by the outcome of future events. This is the problem of future contingents.|$|R
