40|$|Collocation {{has been}} {{considered}} a problematic area for L 2 learners. Various {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate native speakers’ (NS) and non-native speakers’ (NNS) use of different types of collocations (e. g., Durrant and Schmitt, 2009; Laufer and Waldman, 2011). These studies have indicated that, unlike NS, NNS rely on a limited set of collocations and tend to overuse them. This raises the question: if NNS tend to overuse a limited set <b>of</b> <b>collocations</b> in their <b>academic</b> writing, would their use <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> <b>collocations</b> in a specific discipline (Computer Science in this study) vary from that of NS and expert writers? This study has three main aims. First, it investigates the use <b>of</b> lexical <b>academic</b> <b>collocations</b> in NNS and NS Computer Science students’ MSc dissertations and compares their uses with those by expert writers in their writing of published research articles. Second, it explores the factors behind the over/underuse of the 24 shared lexical collocations among corpora.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the outlines of}} three empirical studies that we have carried out on actual labour {{market value of the}} various types of competencies acquired in higher education and how these competencies may be taught most effectively. The focus is on the discipline-specific competencies and academic competencies. In all three studies, use was made of the European CHEERS dataset. The main results with regard to the labour market value of the various competencies are that a high level of discipline-specific competencies provides graduates with a comparative advantage in jobs within their own professional domain, where they also earn more than outside this domain. Graduates who possess a high level <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> competencies, have a comparative advantage outside their own professional domain, where they may initially earn less than in their own domain. As they are more inclined to take part in training activities and are able to obtain the required competencies for a supervisory position more quickly, their salaries rise more quickly with time. With regard to the organization of the education process, we found that activating learning methods contribute effectively to both the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> competencies and the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> discipline-specific competencies. By combining these methods with a more prominent position for knowledge transfer by teachers, the acquired level of discipline-specific competencies can be increased without affecting the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> competencies. ...|$|R

As reading research articles in English is a substantial component of target courses syllabi in university settings in Croatia, a student assignment was designed to implement research articles in the EAP classroom. The assignment {{presented in this paper}} aimed to raise students' awareness of the rhetorical, metadiscoursal, and lexical features of a research article.

The overall results, which in most cases indicated students’ increased awareness of the aspects analyzed, suggest the effectiveness of genre-based teaching in the EAP classroom.

Some of these factors improve academic performance and the others have detrimental effects on this <b>academic</b> construction. One <b>of</b> the most recently studied factors which affect students’ academic performance is academic burnout. Traditionally, academic burnout {{is defined as a}} three dimensional syndrome which includes emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). Burnout among college students refers to tiredness result from academic demands (emotional exhaustion), having a pessimistic sense and lack <b>of</b> interest toward <b>academic</b> tasks (cynicism), and feeling of incompetency as a student (inefficacy) (Shaufeli et al. 2002 a, cited by Zhang et al. 2007).

40|$|According to the Policy on Minimum Requirements for Teacher Education Qualifications (2011), the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> literacies {{lays the}} {{foundation}} for effective learning in higher education. However, {{one of the major}} challenges for designers <b>of</b> <b>academic</b> literacies programmes is to accommodate culturally and linguistically diverse student groups. In response to this challenge the academic literacies curriculum for B.

One of the methods used to operationalise this strategy was to introduce literacy narrative pedagogy, and to gain insight into students’ <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> literacies by analysing their self-narratives. This article describes students’ construction of the identities of significant others in their narratives. New literacy studies serve as the theoretical foundation for the pedagogy, and is used in combination with Self-determination Theory as a theoretical framework for the data analysis. The analysis shows that relatedness is the most salient catalyst of motivation in the <b>acquisition</b> <b>of</b> literacies, and parents as well as other primary caregivers feature as the most important sponsors of relatedness.
