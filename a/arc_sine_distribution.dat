Here, we assessed the possibility of identifying a common diagnostic biomarker for CUP using a microarray gene expression analysis. METHODS: Tumor mRNA samples from 60 patients with CUP were analyzed using the Affymetrix U 133 A Plus 2. 0 GeneChip and were normalized by asinh (hyperbolic <b>arc</b> <b>sine)</b> transformation to construct a mean gene-expression profile specific to CUP. A gene-expression profile specific to non-CUP group was constructed using publicly available raw microarray datasets. The t-tests were performed to compare the CUP with non-CUP groups and the top 59 CUP specific genes with the highest fold change were selected (p-value< 0. 001).

A second example illustrates the application of flexible parametric density functions as conditional distributions in a GARCH formulation of the distribution of returns on the S&P 500.

The molecular differences of the five isolates were also compared using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) at Tobacco Research Boardâ€™s Molecular Biology Laboratory. In the field experiments to determine virulence, the five varieties named above were planted at each site in a Completely Randomised Block Design with four replications. Monthly infections and fortnight scoring were done from January {{to the end of}} May. Infection percentages were calculated {{at the end of the}} season. They were <b>arc</b> <b>sine</b> transformed and then subjected to analysis of variance using Gestat 3. 2. Fortnightly scores were used to calculate the area under the disease progress curves (AUDPC) using Sigma Plot 8. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) in infection percentages (<b>arc</b> <b>sine</b> transformed) were obtained at CRI, Chisumbanje and Chinhoyi but not at Rafingora and Henderson. There were no significant varietal differences for AUDPC at four sites (CRI, Chisumbanje, Rafingora and Henderson) except Chinhoyi, which had significant AUDPC differences between the varieties. From the five sites, soil samples were taken to isolate Verticillium dahliae. The isolates were tested for their virulence on five varieties used in the field. The trial was laid in a split plot design with Verticillium dahliae isolates as main plots and varieties as subplots. A single pot with one plant constituted a plot. Inoculum was prepared from the isolates and plants were stem pricked at the base at six weeks after planting. Severity scores were done a week after infection for the next four weeks. All the isolates were virulent, with isolates from CRI and Chinhoyi producing significantly higher AUDPC on all varieties than other isolates form other sites. Significant AUDPC were observed with G 501 and BC 853 having the lowest AUDPC while SZ 9314 and F 902 had the highest AUDPCs and variety 563 - 97 - 12 had intermediate AUDPC. PCR was run to compare five Verticillium dahliae isolates against the standard fungus from imported from South Africa at the Tobacco Research Board. Two primers were used (primer 19 / 22 and 42 / 70). Primer 22 / 70 managed to produce more bands (eleven bands) than primer 19 / 22 which produced five bands. Bands were scored and a cluster analysis was done to compare the differences of the banding patterns. Results show that there were differences at molecular level between the isolates. Differences were evident between the Rafingora isolate and the other isolates. Relationship between virulence and molecular differences was no established.

They are based on a <b>sine</b> <b>distribution</b> with layer refinement and a second-order expansion for the deflection.

A conforming FE approach is carried out using Lagrange and Hermite interpolations. It is important to notice that the number of unknowns is independent of the number of layers. Both mechanical and thermomechanical tests for thin and thick beams are presented in order to evaluate the capability of these new finite elements to give accurate results with respect to elasticity or finite element reference solutions.
