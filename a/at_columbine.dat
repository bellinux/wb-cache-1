5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E

25|$|Early stories {{following}} the shootings charged that school {{administrators and teachers}} <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> had long condoned a climate of bullying by the so-called jocks or athletes, allowing an atmosphere of intimidation and resentment to fester. Critics said this could have contributed to triggering the perpetrators' extreme violence. Reportedly, homophobic remarks were directed at Klebold and Harris.|$|E
25|$|At 11:10a.m., Harris and Klebold arrived {{separately}} <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> High School. Harris {{parked his}} {{vehicle in the}} junior student parking lot, by the south entrance, and Klebold parked in the adjoining senior student parking lot, by the west entrance. The school cafeteria, their primary bomb target, with its long outside window-wall and ground-level doors, was between their parking spots.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to summon}} widely {{dispersed}} personnel, then equip and brief them, {{makes for a}} long lag between the initial emergency and actual SWAT deployment on the ground.

25|$|Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981 – April 20, 1999) and Dylan Bennet Klebold (September 11, 1981 – April 20, 1999) {{were two}} American spree killers and mass murderers who killed 13 people and wounded 24 others armed with {{firearms}} and knives on April 20, 1999, <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> High School in Columbine, Colorado.

25|$|The Columbine High School {{massacre}} was {{a school}} shooting that occurred on April 20, 1999, <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> High School in Columbine, an unincorporated area of Jefferson County in the American state of Colorado. In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters, propane tanks converted to bombs placed in the cafeteria, 99 explosive devices, and car bombs. The perpetrators, senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher. They injured 21 additional people, and three more were injured while attempting to escape the school. The pair subsequently committed suicide.|$|E

25|$|A Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputy, Neil Gardner, was {{assigned}} to the high school as a full-time uniformed and armed school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 he was eating lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers' Pit in Clement Park. The security staff <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> did not observe the bombs being placed in the cafeteria, since a custodian was replacing the school security video tape as it happened. The bags holding the bombs were first visible on the fresh security tape, but they were not identified as suspicious items. No witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks already in the cafeteria.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Dave Kopel, {{attorney}} and gun rights {{advocate for the}} NRA, said: [...] "gun shows are no 'loophole' in the federal laws," [...] and that singling out gun shows was [...] "the first step toward abolishing all privacy regarding firearms and implementing universal gun registration." [...] In January 2000, Kopel said that no proposed federal law would have made any difference <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> since the adults who supplied the weapons were legal purchasers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{link between}} {{bullying}} and school violence has attracted increasing attention since the 1999 attack <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> High School. Both of the shooters {{were classified as}} gifted children who had allegedly been victims of bullying for four years.

Klebold {{is known to have}} remarked to his father of his hatred of the jock culture <b>at</b> <b>Columbine,</b> adding that Harris in particular had been victimized by this social group. In this remark, Klebold had stated, [...] "They sure give Eric hell." [...] On another occasion just weeks before the massacre, both Harris and Klebold had been confronted by a group of youths at the school—all members of the football team—who had sprayed them with ketchup and mustard while referring to the pair as [...] "faggots" [...] and [...] "queers".|$|E

40|$|Differences in transport, {{composition}} and supply of {{particulate organic matter}} (POM), as a food source for coastal consumers, were investigated between an exposed headland (Cape Columbine) and a sheltered bay (Elandsbaai) in the southern Benguela. Physical data, in agreement with previous studies, showed that Cape Columbine is situated within an upwelling center and Elandsbaai within an upwelling shadow. Three distinct oceanographic conditions, upwelling, relaxation and downwelling, were discemable from wind, current and temperature data at each site. Upwelling was most prevalent <b>at</b> Cape <b>Columbine</b> in contrast to relaxation at Elandsbaai. Significant differences (P < 0. 00001) in chlorophyll a concentration, quantities of organic carbon and % kelp-derived carbon {{were found between the}} two sites. In addition, significant differences (P < 0. 0001) in chlorophyll a concentration, quantities of organic carbon and % kelp-derived carbon were found between the different oceanographic conditions: upwelling, relaxation and downwelling. A significant interaction (P < 0. 00001) for % kelp-derived carbon was found between site and oceanographic conditions. Tests within study sites revealed significantly higher chlorophyll a concentrations in the euphotic zone, as expected. Furthermore, chlorophyll a concentrations showed a significant decrease with distance offshore at Elandsbaai. Percentage contribution of kelp-derived carbon (max = 36 %) to POM was lower than predicted and surprisingly lower than values reported in previous works (77 %). No stratification of kelp-derived matter or organic carbon was observed in the water column at both sites. It is likely that sampling stations were too shallow i. e. water column was well mixed as a results of nearshore turbulence. In terms of food supply to coastal consumers, upwelling episodes <b>at</b> Cape <b>Columbine</b> resulted in significantly high import of kelp matter into the nearshore water column. In contrast, phytoplankton, constituted the primary food source for both sites during relaxation and downwelling episodes. It is clear that different oceanographic conditions between an exposed headland and a sheltered bay have profound implications regarding the transport, {{composition and}} supply of POM, as a source of food to coastal communities...|$|R

The combined success of the Matrix trilogy, the Lord of the Rings films and the Star Wars prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that The Matrixs success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.|$|E

Violence, or the threat of violence, has a direct impact on the quality of education provided and on the way teachers and students work together in the classroom (Winett, 1998). Well-disciplined, effective schools are not a product of chance; it takes administrators, teachers, students, and parents working together to provide an environment conducive to learning (Marzano & Pickering, 2002). Developments in recent years indicate {{there is a need to}} change the way discipline is addressed. It is no longer enough to preserve the past’s narrow perception of the role of discipline. School administrators are just beginning to learn and understand that discipline includes much more than handing down punishment. This qualitative study focused on perceptions of administrators, teachers and parents in terms of effective discipline practices. Schools are discovering that the mos...|$|R
