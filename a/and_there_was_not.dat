5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room to store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> enough room to store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, {{one of which was}} used for council meetings.|$|E

5|$|In places closely {{associated}} with Titanic, the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699crew members and also home {{to many of the}} passengers. Crowds of weeping women– the wives, sisters and mothers of crew– gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built Titanic came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

He was recommended to Brentford by Martin Allen's son, having previously been on the books at Chesham United. He made his Brentford debut in October 2005 in a 1–1 against Oxford United in the Football League Trophy; playing the whole match. He made his league debut for the club two months later in a 4–1 away win over Tranmere Rovers, coming on as a 76th-minute substitute. Initially he acted as cover for regular right-back Kevin O'Connor, but was then played in a central midfield role. He was also the outfield player chosen to play as goalkeeper against Gillingham in 2006, when Clark Masters was sent-off, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a substitute goalkeeper available; the game ended 2–2 with Mousinho playing 75 minutes in goal.|$|E

25|$|As Germany and Austria {{came under}} Allied {{military}} administration, the commanders assumed {{responsibility for the}} safety and disposition of all displaced persons. The Allies provided for the DPs according to nationality, and initially did not recognize Jews as constituting a separate group. One significant consequence of this early perspective was that Jewish DPs sometimes found themselves housed in the same quarters with former Nazi collaborators. Also, the general policy of the Allied occupation forces was to repatriate DPs to {{their country of origin}} as soon as possible, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessarily sufficient consideration for exceptions; repatriation policy varied from place to place, but Jewish DPs, for whom repatriation was problematic, were apt to find themselves under pressure to return home.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of March 1917, patrols found that the Germans were beginning to retreat from the Gommecourt defences. The division followed up slowly and cautiously, but {{on the night of}} 14 March an attack on Bucquoy Graben (trench) by 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade led to heavy casualties. The rushed attack had been ordered by V Corps headquarters despite the protests of the divisional commander, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> time for the artillery adequately to cut the enemy wire. The attack went in behind an artillery barrage moving at 100 yards in four minutes but although 'the assault was gallantly pressed' (Official History) it was a complete failure. The Germans eventually retreated as far as their new Hindenburg Line defences well beyond the Somme battlefields, but 46th Division was withdrawn from the pursuit on 17 March.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{materials}} at extreme conditions, high pressure and high temperature uses {{a wide array}} of techniques to achieve these conditions and probe the behavior of material while in the extreme environment. Percy Williams Bridgman, the great pioneer of high-pressure research {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, revolutionized the field of high pressures with his development of an opposed anvil device with small flat areas that were pressed one against the other with a lever-arm. The anvils were made of tungsten carbide (WC). This device could achieve pressure of a few gigapascals, and was used in electrical resistance and compressibility measurements. The principles of the DAC are similar to the Bridgman anvils but in order to achieve the highest possible pressures without breaking the anvils, they were made of the hardest known material: a single crystal diamond. The first prototypes were limited in their pressure range <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a reliable way to calibrate the pressure.|$|E

25|$|Official Soviet figures {{reported}} {{that up to}} one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 (a decrease from estimated 80% of the country being religious in the late 1920s); altogether this made up 50% of the state's population (and even these figures may have been low estimates). However, religion had been hit very powerfully; the number of churches had been reduced from 50,000 in 1917 to {{only a few hundred}} (<b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a single church open in Belarus) or perhaps even less, out of 300 bishops in 1917 (and 163 in 1929) only 4 remained (Metropolitan Sergii (the head of the church), Metropolitan Alexii of Leningrad, Bishop Nikolai (Yarushevich), and Metropolitan Sergi (Voskresenski)), out of 45,000 priests there were only to 2,000–3,000 remaining, not a single monastery remained open {{and the only thing that}} enthusiasts of atheism could still do was to spy on individual believers and denounce them to the secret police.|$|E

500|$|The canal {{opened in}} 1805 {{and was used}} for {{passenger}} traffic as well as coal. In 1814 the Benedictine monks who came to Downside Abbey {{are said to have}} used the canal for the last stage of their journey. Another cargo carried by the canal was limestone from Combe Down. The peak level of cargo carried was in 1838 at 138,403tons resulting in over £17,000 of tolls being paid. Cargoes of over 100,000tons were common until the 1870s when the decline in output of coal from the various Somerset coalpits, along with competition from the railways, dramatically reduced the canal's profitability. [...] When the main pump at Dunkerton failed it was not replaced <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sufficient water for continual operation of the locks.

The closure caused problems across the Somerset coalfield especially to the pits along the Paulton branch, which had relied on the canal for transportation.|$|E
