Botox or Dysport injections have the advantage of ready availability (the same form is used for cosmetic surgery) and the effects are not permanent. There is a risk of temporary paralysis of the muscles being injected or the leaking of the toxin into adjacent muscle groups, causing weakness or paralysis in them. The injections have to be repeated, as the effects wear off and around 15% of recipients will develop immunity to the toxin. There is <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> B toxin approved for treatment of dystonia; often, those that develop resistance to <b>Type</b> <b>A</b> may be able to use Type B.|$|R

Now we present the "missing" data: The higher learning score can be explained just by the explicit referencing. We argue that this is an important design issue for chat applications, because it seems that explicit referencing leads to a more homogeneous discourse behavior (more homogeneous participation, more participation in parallel discussion threads) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> better grounding.
