5|$|However, {{the first}} {{conclusive}} {{evidence that the}} Balts were uniting {{is considered to be}} the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219.

That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>brother</b> Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E
