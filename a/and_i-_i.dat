30|$|Etching {{of silicon}} in iodate {{solutions}} is extremely complex {{and difficult to}} control. Surface structures including pits (circular, triangular, or rectangular), pyramids (erect or inverted), roughness, and pits within pits or pits between pyramids have been obtained. This complexity is engendered by a competition of several isotropic and anisotropic chemical and electrochemical reactions of IO 3 –, I 3 –, <b>I</b> 2, <b>and</b> <b>I–.</b> Whereas <b>I</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>I–</b> much prefer to attack defect and step sites leading to flat surfaces, I 3 – is able to attack terrace sites and exhibits a degree of crystallographic anisotropy {{as evidenced by the}} production of crystallographically defined features. We believe that the extremely high etch rates induced in IO 3 – solutions are caused by IO 3 – being able to increase the surface area and defect density of the Si substrate through the formation of porous silicon. Whereas a substantial porous layer might be formed in a non-recirculating flow through etch system, porous Si is subsequently destroyed by the actions of I 3 –, <b>I</b> 2, <b>and</b> <b>I–</b> as these reaction by-products build up in the etchant. Bromate and chlorate etching are not as complex. However, these only lead to flat surfaces at least in part due to the higher reactivity of Br 2 and Cl 2 in solution, both of which lead to step flow etching.|$|R

Nanoporous NiO films were deposited on transparent metallic fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and polarized as working electrodes in a three-electrode cell with differently concentrated I-/I 3 - electrolytes to simulate the different conditions experienced by the NiO cathodes during the lifecycle of a p-type DSC (p-DSC) at those atomic sites not passivated by the dye. Bare NiO films were tested also as photocathodes of nonsensitized p-DSCs. The ex situ XPS analysis of I 4 d ionization region of both reference and electrochemically treated NiO films showed that the presence of native and electrochemically generated Ni 3 + and Ni 4 + centers induces fast adsorption/desorption of <b>I-</b> ions <b>and</b> catalyzes their oxidation to I 3 - ions.

However, we previously discovered I- 2, but not phospho-I- 2, bound to Pin 1 as an allosteric modifier of Pin 1 substrate specificity [Li, M., et al. (2008) Biochemistry 47, 292]. Here, we use binding assays and NMR spectroscopy to map the interactions on Pin 1 <b>and</b> <b>I-</b> 2 to elucidate the organization of this complex. Despite having sequences that are ∼ 50 % identical, human, Xenopus, <b>and</b> Drosophila <b>I-</b> 2 proteins all exhibited identical, saturable binding to GST-Pin 1 with K(0. 5) values of 0. 3 μM. The (1) H-(15) N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra for both the WW domain and isomerase domain of Pin 1 showed distinctive shifts upon addition of I- 2. Conversely, as shown by NMR spectroscopy, specific regions of I- 2 were affected by addition of Pin 1. A single-residue I 68 A substitution in I- 2 weakened binding to Pin 1 by half and essentially eliminated binding to the isolated WW domain. On the other hand, truncation of I- 2 to residue 152 had a minimal effect on binding to the WW domain but eliminated binding to the isomerase domain.

30|$|Now, {{we address}} the etch {{chemistry}} of por-Si films with solutions containing <b>I–,</b> <b>I</b> 2, <b>and</b> I 3 – to which HF {{has also been}} added. HI[*]+[*]HF, I 2 [*]+[*]HF[*]+[*]ethanol, and HI[*]+[*]I 2 [*]+[*]HF solutions all remove por-Si layers accompanied by the formation of bubbles.

Interestingly, when <b>I–</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> 2 destroy por-Si, they leave behind a nearly mirror-like Si substrate. These two species, therefore, facilitate step flow etching in HF solutions. This is consistent with their lack of reactivity with the terraces of polished surfaces. I 3 –-containing solutions, on the other hand, remove por-Si to reveal a rough and pitted surface much like the one shown in Figure[*] 3. Again, {{this is consistent with the}} more aggressive and anisotropic nature of I 3 –-induced etching. All three of these species destroy nanoscale Si structures; therefore, the initiation step and etch rate of each reaction must not be constrained by quantum confinement.|$|R

40|$|Just {{a couple}} of {{transition}} metal complexes of the familiar triiodide anion are known. To investigate the bonding in these, as well as isomeric possibilities, we examined theoretically adducts of I 3 - with model organometallic fragments, [Cr(CO) 5] and [Mn(CO) 5]+. Bonding energy computations were augmented by a Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) perturbation theory analysis and Energy Decomposition Analysis (EDA). The bonding between I 3 - and the organometallic fragment is substantial, especially for the electrostatically driven anion-cation case. "End-on" coordination is favored by 5 - 13 kcal/mol over "side-on" (to the central I of I 3 -), with a ∼ 10 kcal/mol barrier for isomerization. A developing asymmetry in the I-I bonding of "end-on" coordinated I 3 - led us to consider in some detail the obvious fragmentation to a coordinated <b>I-</b> <b>and</b> free <b>I</b> 2.

Although nineteenth-century travellers were varied {{in terms of their}} habits, aspirations, wealth, type of dwelling and the like, the attempt to draw between the travellers’ cultural lines of divide based on racial determinants contains serious flaws in assumptions, methodology <b>and</b> evidence. f, <b>I-</b> <b>I</b> Moreover, although varied, the travellers were bound together by certain common features, notably by their position as a minority group in relation to settled society. Resultant upon their travelling way of life was a conflict with the 'centre', or with the institutions and structures of a sedentary-based society, in this instance organised around a capitalist political economy. The nature of this relationship with the dominant economic, social and political structures can be explained summarily by reference to the attempts to christianise, educate,, settle and sanitise the travellers, and which were carried 'out with various degrees of coercion and compulsion. Formal and informal upholders and agents of the 'new morality' worked together to bring about these desired ends. The position of travellers was also necessarily affected by general trends taking place within the economy and society as a whole. Changed perceptions about them, responses to them, and the conditions under which they lived, were a reflection of more general developments, economic trends affected their employments, and where they were carried out, which in turn altered their relations with the sedentary community they served. Similarly, racial theories concerning the 'Romany' assumed a position of pre-eminent status only with the related growth of, and deference to, scientific knowledge from the mid-century onwards...|$|R
40|$|In anesthetized piglets the {{intravenous}} injection of a lethal dose of endotoxin, 0. 5 mg/kg, {{resulted in a}} progressively evolving deterioration of the cardiovascular system (hypotension, decrease in cardiac output), {{in an increase in}} pulmonary vascular resistance and in the death of all animals within 210 min following endotoxin administration. Endotoxin induced a significant increase in immunoreactive (<b>i)</b> <b>i-</b> 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha, i-TXB 2, <b>and</b> <b>i-</b> 15 -oxo- 13, 14 -dihydro-PGF 2 alpha levels in peripheral plasma. Pretreatment with the PG-synthesis inhibitor, flurbiprofen, abolished the profound rise in PG-levels, whereas cardiovascular performance was more sustained. The results suggest the involvement of several prostanoids during the evolution of endotoxic shock in the piglet. status: publishe...|$|R

The {{use of an}} excess of diiodine up to the molar ratio 2 : 1 always gives II from 2, and 1. 2 I(2) (III) from 1. Compound I consists of polymeric chains in which each diiodine bridges between different 1 molecules, while II consists of discrete molecular units. The Raman nu(I-I) frequency and I-I bond distance in I fits well with the previously found linear correlation. This correlation suggests two different I-I bond distances for III. The comparison of the FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra for II {{is consistent with the}} three-body model for Se-I-I. The association constant between 1 <b>and</b> <b>I-</b> 2 in methylene chloride has been also studied both by UV-visible and C- 13 NMR spectroscopy, giving K values at 21 degrees C in good agreement...|$|R
