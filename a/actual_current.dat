5|$|The Corpus Juris Civilis, {{the name}} for the massive body of law promulgated by Emperor Justinian from the 530s CE and onwards, {{consists}} of two historical collections of laws and their interpretation (the Digest, opinions of the pre-eminent lawyers from the past, and the Codex Justinianus, a collection of edicts and rescripts by earlier emperors), along with Jusinian's prefatory introduction text for students of Law, Institutes, plus the Novels, Justinian's own, later edicts. That the earlier collections {{were meant to be}} sources for the <b>actual,</b> <b>current</b> practice of law, rather than just being of historical interest, can be seen, for example, from the inclusion, and modification of Modestinus' famous description of poena cullei (Digest 48.9.9), in Justinian's own law text in Institutes 4.18.6.|$|E

This fact strongly depends on the design of the fractal and how the different scales are arranged within the antenna.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of CTs used for metering purposes {{are required to}} be very accurate as they are used in tariff calculations. Decades ago, the current flowing in distribution circuits could be considered more or less to be of a purely sinusoidal form. In recent times, however, such is not the case. Many loads such as rectifiers, inverters {{and a host of}} other electronic devices draw non-sinusoidal currents. A non-sinusoidal current waveform can be considered to be composed of a pure sinusoid of the fundamental power frequency and its harmonics. Since these harmonics are injected into the system the ammeters and energy meters read the composite current, not just the fundamental component. The measurements will, therefore, reflect the <b>actual</b> <b>currents</b> only if the CTs transform the harmonics in the same proportion as the fundamental component.

25|$|The graph of Cook Strait's tides shows {{separately}} {{the high}} water and low water height and time, through November 2007; {{these are not}} measured values but instead are calculated from tidal parameters derived from years-old measurements. Cook Strait's nautical chart offers tidal current information. For instance the January 1979 edition for 41°13·9’S 174°29·6’E (north west of Cape Terawhiti) refers timings to Westport while the January 2004 issue refers to Wellington. Near Cape Terawhiti {{in the middle of}} Cook Strait the tidal height variation is almost nil while the tidal current reaches its maximum, especially near the notorious Karori Rip. Aside from weather effects, the <b>actual</b> <b>currents</b> through Cook Strait are influenced by the tidal height differences between the two ends of the strait and as can be seen, only one of the two spring tides at the north end (Nelson) has a counterpart spring tide at the south end (Wellington), so the resulting behaviour follows neither reference harbour.|$|R
