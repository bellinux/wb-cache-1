He arrived in Saigon in August 1963 and took up a posting as deputy senior advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam's IV Corps {{stationed}} in the Mekong Delta. After six months, Jukalian {{was assigned to the}} headquarters of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) to serve as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland, the MACV commander. As part of his duties, he traveled throughout South Vietnam on inspection visits to many military installations. In the transient officers quarters at Danang, he found an <b>ashtray</b> from George Mardikian's Omar Khayyam restaurant in San Francisco and kept it as a souvenir {{for the rest of his}} life. For his service in the Vietnam War, Juskalian was awarded an Air Medal and a Bronze Star.|$|E
5|$|After the album's release, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a successful world tour that was once again filled with incidents. In late summer 2002, whilst the band were on tour in the US, Noel, Bell and touring keyboardist Jay Darlington {{were involved in a}} car accident in Indianapolis. While none of the band members sustained any major injuries, some shows were cancelled as a result. In December 2002, {{the latter half of the}} German leg of the band's European tour had to be postponed after Liam Gallagher, Alan White and three other members of the band's entourage were arrested after a violent brawl at a Munich nightclub. The band had been drinking heavily and tests showed that Liam had used cocaine. Liam lost two front teeth and kicked a police officer in the ribs, while Alan suffered minor head injuries after getting hit with an <b>ashtray.</b> Two years later Liam was fined around £40,000. The band finished their tour in March 2003 after returning to those postponed dates.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was the first}} to permit smoking in rooms on the State floor. To accommodate smoking, Jacqueline Kennedy wanted portable <b>ashtrays</b> for the East Room. She initially considered modified versions of <b>ashtrays</b> seen at the home of her friend, Bunny Mellon, but rejected this idea in favor of a unique design. Maison Jansen designed stands which featured brass legs shaped like bamboo, brass handles, and Carrara glass tops. The <b>ashtrays</b> cost $280, were manufactured in Maison Jansen's New York City office, and delivered in January 1963. Finding the cost too high (and without any economy of scale cost-savings), Kennedy then designed her own portable standing <b>ashtrays.</b> Twenty were eventually manufactured out of dark wood by White House carpenters, although the gray granite tops for the Kennedy-designed <b>ashtrays</b> were made by Jansen at a cost of $310.|$|R

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, but she refused to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an <b>ashtray.</b> She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E

25|$|Placebo founders Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal {{had both}} {{attended}} the American International School of Luxembourg, without speaking to each other, {{as they were}} part of different social circles. The two met by chance in 1994, in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local gig. On the strength of Molko's performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed as <b>Ashtray</b> Heart, named after the Captain Beefheart song of the same name. Molko, however, denied in 2009 that <b>Ashtray</b> Heart was the first name of the band, dismissing this as a rumour and claiming that the band had more names initially.|$|E

25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Mexican economy in 1982 hit VAM {{along with all the}} local auto industry. In February 1983, the Mexican government sold its share of VAM to Renault. The new owner was focused more on the Jeep vehicles along with VAM's dealer network and production facilities. Renault reduced production VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. The remaining 1983 VAM cars existed mostly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories and to fulfill the previous agreements with sourcing companies. The 1983 Rally AMX is almost an exact copy of the 1982 model, specifically {{the second half of the}} model year production. The only differences between both are the presence of a rear <b>ashtray</b> design shared with the Gremlin and American (due to the loss of the console-mounted rear <b>ashtray),</b> a locally produced instrument cluster replacing the imported unit and the chromed squared door mirrors originally used on the Rally SST (minus the still optional controls). Both optional packages of 1982 were still available this year.|$|E

25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear <b>ashtray,</b> lighted vanity mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front <b>ashtray,</b> locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E

While the inclusion of a passenger compartment heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a passenger compartment heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|E

Bon Jour had 20 shapes created during 1933, with about 10 more being added in 1934.
