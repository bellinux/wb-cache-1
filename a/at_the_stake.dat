5|$|In England, burning was a legal {{punishment}} {{inflicted on}} women {{found guilty of}} high treason, petty treason and heresy.

5|$|Tannakin's {{deformity}} {{was soon}} discovered, and many locals came {{to hear her}} pig-like speech or to watch her feed from the trough.

5|$|As {{with much}} of England, Chesham {{suffered}} serious religious unrest in the 16th and 17th centuries, and in 1532 Lollard radical Thomas Harding was burnt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> in the town for heresy. From the 17th century Chesham was a focus for dissenters. The first Baptist chapel in the town opened in 1701, Quakers have met in Chesham since the late 17th century, and John Wesley preached in Chesham in the 1760s.|$|E
5|$|During the retreat, Crawford and {{an unknown}} number of his men were captured. The Indians {{executed}} many of these captives in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre that occurred earlier in the year, in which about 100 peaceful Indians were murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford's execution was particularly brutal: he was tortured for at least two hours before being burned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> His execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already-strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.|$|E
5|$|Achieving her {{objective}} was, however, not straightforward. The Pope {{was only}} {{prepared to accept}} reunion when church property disputes had been settled—which, in practice, meant letting those who had bought former church property keep it. Thus did Cardinal Pole arrive to become Archbishop of Canterbury in Cranmer's place. Mary could have had Cranmer imprisoned as he was tried and executed for treason—he had supported the claims of Lady Jane Grey—but she resolved to have him tried for heresy. His recantations of his Protestantism {{would have been a}} major coup. Unhappily for her, he unexpectedly withdrew his recantations at the last minute as he was to be burned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> thus ruining her government's propaganda victory.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of different type of ownership structure on firm performance proxied by market measure (market to book value, MTBV) based on companies listed on Bursa Malaysia in the year 2006 to 2010. Firm performance in this study is proxied by market measure (market to book value, MTBV). Results of the study indicate that director ownership and foreign ownership have non-linear relationship with MTBV using quadratic function. While family ownership and ownership by government-linked investment companies have linear relationship. Director ownership has negative relationship which indicate <b>the</b> entrenchment effect <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>stake.</b> However, director ownership has positive relationship meaning the alignment effect occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>stake.</b> However, foreign ownership has alignment effect <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>stake</b> and entrenchment effect <b>at</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>stake.</b> Government-linked investment companies has negative relationship. The findings of the study add to the ownership structure literature in the concentrated ownership market...|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September {{that the two men}} would fight to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E

Having nowhere else to go, the ship of fugitives heads for the New World. In Spain, Enrique, the Inquisitor who has killed so many witchbreed, is exposed as a witchbreed himself and sentenced to be burned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> with his young acolytes, Petros and Sister Wanda.

5|$|Henry VI of England {{was less}} than a year old but his unclesled by Henry V's brother John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedfordcontinued the war. There were more victories, {{including}} the Battle of Verneuil, but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level. Joan of Arc's involvement helped the French remove the siege of Orleans and win the Battle of Patay before Joan was captured by the Burgundians, sold to the English, tried as a witch and burned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> The Dauphin was crowned and continued the successful Fabian tactics of avoiding full frontal assault and exploiting logistical advantage.|$|E
5|$|However, the crowned Charles VII's advisors {{convince}} the King {{not to send}} the promised reinforcements to Joan at the pivotal Siege of Paris. Joan of Arc retreats to the Castle at Compiègne where the English and Burgundian troops lay siege. Trapped outside {{the safety of the}} Castle, Joan is captured by the Burgundians, trailed by the English as a heretic, and burned <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake.</b> The final campaign mission, the Battle of Castillon, has one of Joan's most trusted Lieutenant's muster a huge force of vengeful French troops, and utterly destroy the English and Burgundian forces around and in Castillon, ending the Hundred Years' War and expelling the English from France, spare Calais.|$|E
5|$|Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde {{and imprisoned}} in the castle.

At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would have to support {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake,</b> another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance {{scholars}} commonly practised astrology.

Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs, Galileo Galilei to the Medici, and Giordano Bruno who was burnt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>stake</b> for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.|$|E

Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431.
