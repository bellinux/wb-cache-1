500|$|When no stop depth or {{time limits}} are {{exceeded}} the diver must decompress more extensively than allowed {{for in the}} recommended maximum ascent rate {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. This is conventionally done as decompression stops, which are pauses in ascent at specified depths for specified times derived from the decompression algorithm and based on the dive profile history and breathing gas composition. Depth and duration of obligatory decompression stops are specified by the decompression model used. Stops are usually specified in [...] steps. The depth of the deepest (first) stop for the same profile history will depend on the algorithm, as some decompression models start decompression at lower supersaturation (lower M-values) than others. The duration of the shallower stops is generally more than the duration of deeper stops on a specific dive. Stops extend the dive profile graph <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> axis.|$|E
