50|$|Automatic Systems is a Belgian company {{founded in}} 1969 by the Belgian {{entrepreneur}} Michel Coenraets. With {{the help of}} friends and family and 1 million BEF as start-up capital, Michel Coenraets started Automatic Systems in a 15m2 garage in the suburbs of Brussels. It is in this small garage that the first vehicle barriers were developed using the crankshaft-rod principle, a reference in the barrier and gate sectors ever since. These barriers equipped the parkings of the newly inaugurated site of the Department Store Innovation in Brussels and the new off-street Parking 44 site in 1969. That year, the company also supplied a prototype of pedestrian turnstile to the Brussels metro. Within 2 years, all new Brussels metro lines were equipped by <b>Automatic</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>turnstiles.</b> At {{the end of the first}} fiscal year, the company employed 5 people and generated a revenue of 4 million BEF.|$|R
