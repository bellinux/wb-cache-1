5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful <b>active</b> <b>ingredients,</b> though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E
5|$|French chemist Pierre Joseph Pelletier and French {{pharmacist}} Joseph Bienaimé Caventou {{separated in}} 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered fever tree bark, {{allowing for the}} creation of standardized doses of the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients.</b> Prior to 1820, the bark was simply dried, ground to a fine powder and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) for drinking.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{a large number of}} medical-related {{industries}} in Columbia. The University of Missouri School of Medicine uses university-owned facilities as teaching hospitals. The University of Missouri Research Reactor Center is the largest research reactor in the United States and produces radioisotopes used in nuclear medicine. The center serves as the sole supplier of the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> in two U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved radiopharmaceuticals and produces Fluorine-18 used in PET imaging with its cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their <b>active</b> <b>ingredients,</b> morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} hypodermic syringe in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat tightness, breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients,</b> inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two <b>active</b> <b>ingredients,</b> one of which – fluticasone – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
5000|$|... {{doxylamine}} succinate was the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> in the over-the-counter sleep-aid {{marketed as}} Unisom-2 tablets (no longer available). Unisom now solely markets products containing diphenhydramine hydrochloride as the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> in a {{formulation}} {{represents a}} very {{small portion of the}} overall tablet, then the challenge is to ensure that each tablet has the same amount of <b>active</b> <b>ingredient.</b> Sometimes, blending the ingredients is not enough. The <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> may segregate from the other ingredients in the blending process. The ingredients may be incompatible because of particle size, particle density, flow characteristics, compressibility, and moisture content. These incompatibilities can cause problems such as segregation during blending or during transfer of the product to the press as well as separation of the active on the tablet press. Granulating the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> by itself and then blending it {{with the rest of the}} ingredients is one solution to the segregation problem. Otherwise, all or most of the ingredients could be granulated together. The best course of action to ensure that each tablet contains the correct amount of <b>active</b> <b>ingredient,</b> especially if the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> is only...|$|R

5|$|Piperazine-based stimulants {{began to}} appear in Europe in 2000 but {{remained}} virtually unavailable {{in the rest of the}} world until recently. In early 2006, pills containing the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> BZP and TFMPP {{began to appear}} in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where they first gained popularity with late night party-goers as a purported safer alternative to many of the illicit street drugs commonly available there. In 2007 piperazine based party-pill formulations started to become widely available nationwide which has caused concern with local authorities such as Health Canada and subsequently BZP has gained much media attention in 2008. In the United States, it is still used as an adulterant in ecstasy mimic tablets.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many {{days and the}} sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the <b>active</b> <b>ingredients</b> when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and Madagascar periwinkle.|$|E

40|$|What are {{pesticide}} formulations? A pesticide formulation is {{a mixture}} of chemicals which effectively controls • a pest. Formulating a pesticide involves processing it to improve its storage, handling, safety, application, or effectiveness. 1 See the text box on Some Formulations. What makes up a formulation? The pesticide formulation {{is a mixture}} of <b>active</b> and other <b>ingredients</b> • (previously called inert <b>ingredients).</b> An <b>active</b> <b>ingredient</b> is a substance that prevents, kills, or repels a pest or acts as a plant regulator, desiccant, defoliant, synergist, or nitrogen stabilizer. 4 Pesticides come in many different formulations due to variations in the <b>active</b> <b>ingredient’s</b> solubility, ability to control the pest, and ease of handling and transport.
