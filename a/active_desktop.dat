40|$|Searching the web {{has become}} a task in many people’s work, without which {{subsequent}} tasks {{would be hard to}} carry out or even impossible. But as people tend to have less time for querying the web or even for searching their personal computer for information they need, it becomes common to skip information gathering activities like trying to find useful resources on the web because of the “effort” it takes to query a web search engine. In this paper we propose to use software agents that collect useful web specific related information which would otherwise not be viewed at all. More specifically, we present two new algorithms to automatically search the web and recommend URLs relevant to user’s current work, defined through his or her <b>active</b> personal <b>desktop</b> documents. Our experiments show our proposed algorithms, Sentence Selection and Lexical Compounds, to yield significant improvement over simple Term Frequency based web query generation, which we used as a baseline...|$|R
2500|$|Version 4 {{released}} in September 1997, was shipped with Windows 95 OSR (OEM Service Release) 2.5, {{and the latest}} beta version of Windows 98 and was modified to integrate more closely with Microsoft Windows. It included an option to enable [...] "Active Desktop" [...] which displayed World Wide Web content on the desktop itself and was updated automatically as the content changed. The user could select other pages for use as <b>Active</b> <b>Desktops</b> as well. [...] "Active Channel" [...] technology was also introduced to automatically obtain information updates from websites. The technology {{was based on an}} XML standard known as Channel Definition Format (CDF), which predated the currently used web syndication formats like RSS. This version was designed to work on Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT, and could be downloaded from the Internet, free of charge. It supported Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Outlook Express 4.0 also came integrated into the browser and replaced the aging Microsoft Internet Mail & News product that was released with previous versions. Version 5 came out in March 1999, following Microsoft's release of Internet Explorer 5.0 Beta versions in late 1998 [...] Bi-directional text, ruby text and direct XML/XSLT support were included in this release, along with enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The actual release of Internet Explorer 5 happened in three stages. Firstly, a Developer Preview was {{released in}} June 1998 (5.0B1), and then a Public Preview was released in November 1998 (5.0B2). Then in March 1999 the final release was released (5.0). In September it was released with Windows 98. Version 5.0 was the last one to be released for Windows 3.1x or Windows NT 3.x. Internet Explorer 5.5 was later released for Windows Me in July 2000, and included many bug fixes and security patches. Version 5.5 was the last to have Compatibility Mode, which allowed Internet Explorer 4 to be run {{side by side with the}} 5.x. With IE6, there was a quirks mode that could be triggered to make it behave like IE5.5 Version 6 was released with Windows XP on August 27, 2001. It mainly focused on privacy and security features, as they had become customer priorities. Microsoft implemented tools that support P3P, a technology under development by the W3C.|$|R
50|$|It {{would take}} another 10 years for {{technology}} to mature, for the {{graphical user interface}} to make the computer approachable for non-technical users, and for the World Wide Web to provide a compelling reason for most people to want a computer in their homes. Separate 1998 studies found that 75% of Americans with Internet access accessed primarily from home and that not having Internet access at home inhibited Internet use. Predicted aspects of the revolution were left by the wayside or modified {{in the face of}} an emerging reality. The cost of electronics dropped precipitously and today many families have a computer for each family member, or a laptop for mom's <b>active</b> lifestyle, a <b>desktop</b> for dad with the kids sharing a computer. Encyclopedias, recipe catalogs and medical databases are kept online and accessed over the World Wide Web - not stored locally on floppy disks or CD-ROM. TV has yet to gain substantial interactivity; instead, the web has evolved alongside television, giving rise to the second screen concept. The HTPC and services like Netflix, Google TV or Apple TV, along with internet video sites such as YouTube and Hulu, may one day replace traditional broadcast and cable television. Our coffee may be brewed automatically every morning, but the computer is a simple one embedded in the coffee maker, not under external control. As of 2008, robots are just beginning to make an impact in the home, with Roomba and Aibo leading the charge.|$|R

40|$|Part 1 : Long and Short PapersInternational audienceMultitasking environments {{cause people}} to be {{interrupted}} constantly, often interfering with their ongoing tasks, activities and goals. This paper focuses on the disruption caused by interruptions and presents a disruption mediating approach for balancing {{the negative effects of}} interruptions with respect to the benefits of interruptions relevant to the user goals. Our work shows how Disruption Manager utilizing context and relationships to user goals and tasks can assess when and how to present interruptions in order to reduce their disruptiveness. The Disruption Management Framework was created to take into consideration motivations that influence people’s interruption decision process. The framework predicts the effects from interruptions using a three-layer software architecture: a knowledge layer including information about topics related to the ongoing activity, an intermediate layer including summarized information about the user tasks and their stages, and a low level layer including implicit low granularity information, such as mouse movement, context switching and windowing activity to support fail-safe disruption management when no other contextual information is available. The manager supports implicit monitoring of ongoing behaviors and categorizing possible disruptive outcome given the user and system state. The manager monitors actions and uses common sense reasoning in its model to compare communication stream topics with topics files that are <b>active</b> on the <b>desktop.</b> Experiments demonstrate that disruption manager significantly reduces the impact of interruptions and improve people’s performance in a multi-application desktop scenario with email and instant messaging. In a complex order taking activity, disruption manager yielded a 26 % performance increase for tasks prioritized as being important and a 32. 5 % increase for urgent tasks. The evaluation shows that the modulated interruptions did not distract or troubled users. Further, subjects using the Disruption Manager were 5 times more likely to respond effectively to instant messages...|$|R

While the Windows Desktop Update is commonly referred to (improperly) as <b>Active</b> <b>Desktop</b> itself, it is actually an entire Windows shell upgrade from v4.0 to v4.71, or v4.72, with numerous changes to the Windows interface, resulting in an appearance and functionality level nearly indistinguishable from the then yet-to-be-released Windows 98. Features include the option to allow uppercase filenames (the old v4.0 desktop would forcibly display uppercase filenames in title case), configurable one-click hot-tracking file selection, customizable per-folder HTML display settings, QuickLaunch mini-buttons on the Taskbar next to the Start button, upgraded Start Menu allowing drag and drop item reordering and allowing right-click context menus for item renaming, etc. With the update, Windows Explorer now features an Address bar in which Internet addresses can be entered and seamlessly browsed.|$|E
