5|$|Like other abelisaurs where {{material}} from the forelimbs is available, the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands</b> of Limusaurus were considerably reduced, {{even more so than}} that of Ceratosaurus. The first finger was smaller than the other fingers and lacked digits entirely. As for the other fingers, the second finger was very robust and had three digits, the third finger only had three digits as opposed to four in other early theropods, and the preserved portions of the fourth finger indicate that it was comparatively long and slender, terminating in a single digit. The claws were short, stout, and expanded at their base.|$|E
40|$|Reaching {{with the}} <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{grasping}} with the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> fingers {{is a complex}} behavior that appears in utero, is elaborated over {{the first few years}} of life, and serves useful everyday functions throughout the course of human life. Several neurological condi-tions can impair the ability to produce <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements <b>and</b> so greatly impact on the quality of life and well-being of the affected individuals. Given the fundamental role that <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements play in everyday life, deficits related to <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> function are one of the most debilitating motor conditions. Neurological conditions that can affect <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>hand</b> movements include autism spectrum disorder, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and stroke-related motor cortex damage as well as spinal cord injury at cervical levels.

5|$|During a {{visit to}} a {{division}} command post on 24 August 1944 Strachwitz was badly injured in an automobile accident. The vehicle rolled over and the other occupants were killed. He sustained a fractured skull, and broken ribs, legs, <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands,</b> and he was in critical condition. He was immediately taken to a field hospital, before being transferred to a hospital at Riga. He was then flown to Breslau in a Junkers Ju 52 for further treatment, where he was visited by his son, Harti. The doctors informed him that it would take him eight months to recover fully. Refusing to accept this, he worked out his own rehabilitation plan, and after seven days, Strachwitz signed himself out of the hospital, officially having himself transferred to the hospital at Oppeln. On the drive back he lost consciousness at almost every turn, arriving at his manor in Alt Siedel on 28 November 1944. Here he convalesced until 23 December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{it appears}} that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; {{juvenile}} I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the palms faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands.</b> The three toed pes (foot) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would {{have been used in}} a digitigrade fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; {{it would not have been}} able to gallop as a quadruped.|$|E
5|$|Several {{more recent}} studies have raised the {{possibility}} that the dinosaur was omnivorous and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine serration of the tusks are reminiscent of carnivorous animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. Muntjacs, in contrast, lack serration on their tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early {{in the development of the}} individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males if they were a tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that Heterodontosaurus could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the eyes against such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>hands,</b> which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, Heterodontosaurus would have had a significant selection advantage during the dry season when vegetation was scarce.|$|E
