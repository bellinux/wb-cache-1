5000|$|The SHS file {{extension}} is primarily associated with Shell Scrap Object Files produced by Microsoft Windows. They {{are created by}} selecting part of a document content and then dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> it outside the document program window (e.g. selecting some lines of text in a Word document, dragging <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> them on the desktop). The operating system will create an [...]shs file with the selected content, which will be useless alone, and only readable by dragging the icon <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> it in a program which supports this mechanism.|$|R

5|$|June 13, 2001– The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Allison enter {{the state as}} a subtropical depression <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> over 10inches (250mm) of rainfall in the northeastern portion of the state; the rainfall results in nine indirect deaths due to traffic accidents on slick roads.|$|E

5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E

5|$|Bomb {{engineering}} {{was carried}} out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. Jerrold R. Zacharias from Los Alamos. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to Oxnard Field, New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of Sandia Base. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> tests. By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia. As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.|$|E
5|$|In {{most places}} on Fishing Creek, {{there is not}} enough {{dissolved}} aluminum to be toxic, although East Branch Fishing Creek has aluminum concentrations of over 100μg per liter, approaching a lethal level for fish. Fishing Creek itself and all its other tributaries have concentrations of less than 70μg per liter. The concentration is seasonal: aluminum trapped in frozen ground is released into the streams when the soil thaws. As a result, aluminum levels in the creek peak in March and April <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> to almost zero in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Next was a {{match between}} Victoria and Christy Hemme. The match saw Victoria lift Hemme {{in the air}} <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> her down with force. Control of the match went back and forth, but the bout {{came to an end}} when Victoria countered Hemme's sunset flip. Victoria got the pinfall by using the ring ropes for leverage.|$|E

5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling {{to the surface of}} the sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy {{authorized}} a {{total of}} nine U-101-class submarines, six numbered sequentially from U-101 to U-106, and another three, U-118 to U-120. Upon completion of the first six U-101 boats, the Navy intended to scrap its oldest six boats, U-1 to U-6, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> the first two digits from the new boats so that, for example, U-101 would become the new U-1. In late 1917 and early 1918 the first three boats, U-101 to U-103, were laid down by Austriawerft at Trieste.|$|E
5|$|The design used a {{thin layer}} of {{aluminum}} to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E

5|$|The first bout {{was between}} Samoa Joe and Jushin Liger. It lasted 7 minutes and 27 seconds. Joe was {{accompanied}} by two Polynesian dancers during his entrance, who performed for the crowd. Liger gained a near-fall on Joe at 6 minutes. Afterwards, Joe slammed Liger in the mat back-first with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. He then followed by applying his Coquina Clutch submission hold. As the referee waited for Liger to submit, he became limp, causing the referee to lift <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> Liger's arm three times, resulting in the knock-out victory for Joe.|$|E
5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings {{be kept in}} good condition by whoever has them. Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and defend it from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, and interact with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

Together with Mighty the Armadillo, they destroy his {{machinery}} and stop the operation. They continue through the forest and find ghosts that frighten Tails. Destroying one of Eggman's robots lets Sonic see its internal architecture, including a screen that shows Eggman's plans to create an empire <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> a floating island into the sea.|$|E
5|$|When a new seal was {{unveiled}} in June 2011, it received several negative {{feedback from the}} students through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter. The changes were made after the Curia in Rome suggested for a uniformity in the titles and name of UST. The university's council of Regents decided to include UST's name in the new seal <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> the titles of Royal and Pontifical {{because they are not}} part of the official name of university. The seal was revised a month after and is currently being used today.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults {{begin to}} emerge from trees in late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed for one week on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E
