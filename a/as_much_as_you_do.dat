25|$|Our apprehensions {{are raised}} by very {{different}} objects. You seem to dread {{the prevalence of}} Paine's opinions (which in most parts I detest <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do)</b> while I am much more afraid of the total annihilation of all principles of liberty and resistance, an event which I am sure you would be as sorry to see as I. We both hate the two extremes equally, but we differ in opinions {{with respect to the}} quarter from which the danger is most pressing.|$|E

6000|$|The master-sentences of Edward's letter were these: 'You speak truly. That {{we never}} meet again is the wisest and only proper course. That I regret the past <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> yourself, {{it is hardly}} {{necessary}} for me to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{no thought}} of your leaving him," [...] Malinche said, kindly. [...] "Roger is to {{accompany}} you. He needs rest and peace almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Besides, {{he has been}} seriously wounded, though he makes light of it.|$|E

6000|$|... "They shall know <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> {{and more}} too, {{if you go}} on with that. There's a measure in all things. I won't have it done, so I tell you." [...] And the father turned his face round to the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Ruby, {{you would}} never care to live upon a miserable pittance of three hundred a year! I hate the name <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> but I think I should try to bear it {{for the sake of}} twelve hundred a year and perfect comfort." ...|$|E
