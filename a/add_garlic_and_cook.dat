40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} is to observe the antibacterial properties of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> the differences between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> My research question was : “ Is there a significant mean difference between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> depending on the antibacterial effects. ” A significant mean difference between <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic</b> is expected {{as a result of}} {{this experiment}}. According to the antibacterial characteristics, the most efficient one will be the uncooked crushed garlic. On the other hand, the cooked crushed garlic will not have a significant bactericidal characteristic. The Kirby-Bauer antibacterial testing method was prefered to conduct this experiment so as to test the hypothesis and to find the suitable answer for the research question. In laboratory conditions, incubation of Escherichia coli population was applied on Mueller-Hinton II agar plate. Filter paper disks were put onto the agar after being soaked in <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked crushed <b>garlic.</b> The growth inhibition zone diameters were measured and by these diameters data analysis was done in order to investigate the differences between antibacterial characteristics of <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> uncooked <b>garlic.</b> As a result, the filter paper disk soaked in uncooked crushed garlic had the largest diameter of the growth inhibition zone. In contrast, cooked crushed garlic had nearly no significant growth inhibition zone around the filter paper disk. Results of T-test statistics showed that uncooked crushed <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> crushed <b>garlic</b> had <b>and</b> important maen differences in terms of their antibacterial effect on the tested microorganism named Escherichia coli, which is Gram negative bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{formulations}} of dry-fermented sausages (DFS) were elaborated using different proportions of lean meat, pork backfat, oleic sunflower oil, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and flavouring. Instrumental and sensory characteristics of each formulation were evaluated through instrumental and sensory analyses. Results showed that instrumental texture and colour parameters were {{not affected by}} partial substitution of sodium chloride with potassium chloride. But, they were significantly affected by fat level, oleic sunflower oil and by flavouring. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} healthier DFS formulation with good acceptability can be manufactured by replacing 30 % of sodium chloride with potassium chloride <b>and</b> <b>adding</b> flavouring (<b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> pepper) and 3 % of sunflower oil...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} effects of {{combinations}} of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), <b>garlic</b> (Allium sativum), <b>and</b> black pepper (Piper nigrum) powder supplementation on production traits of broiler chickens. Materials and Methods: A total of 288 commercial broiler chicks were randomly assigned to 1 - 9 groups with 4 replicates each. An experiment was conducted in broilers with different feed formulations; control feed, with no <b>added</b> fenugreek, <b>garlic,</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder; and 8 treatment groups receiving feed supplemented with different combinations of fenugreek, <b>garlic,</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder. The individual broilers’ body weight and feed consumption were recorded and calculate the body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Results: Broiler’s weight gain and FCR were significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder combinations (p< 0. 01). Cumulative feed consumption was significantly higher in groups receiving feed supplemented with <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder combinations (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The combination of <b>garlic</b> <b>and</b> black pepper powder supplemented broiler feed fed groups showed higher production performance. The 5 g/kg garlic powder+ 1 g/kg black pepper powder <b>and</b> 10 g/kg <b>garlic</b> powder+ 2 g/kg black pepper powder significantly improved the weight gain and FCR...|$|R
