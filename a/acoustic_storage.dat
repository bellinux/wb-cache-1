40|$|A {{variety of}} {{experimental}} findings {{have indicated that}} a system of precategorical <b>acoustic</b> <b>storage</b> {{is responsible for the}} recency effect obtained in the immediate serial recall of sequences of digits, consonants, or syllables. This study investigated whether such findings could be generalized to the recall of sequences of words. Experiment 1 showed that phonemic similarity among a sequence of words failed to reduce the modality effect or the recency effect. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this finding was not attributable to a failure to control the phonemic properties of the stimulus material. Experiment 3 showed that the stimulus suffix effect obtained with sequences of words was not affected by the acoustic similarity between the list items and the stimulus suffix. Finally, Experiment 4 demonstrated that phonemic similarity among a sequence of words failed to reduce the stimulus suffix effect. These results were explained by extending the original model of short-term memory to incorporate a system of postcategorical lexical storage...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-two {{subjects}} had tests of serial recall of visually presented nine-digit lists which were either {{presented in a}} single block of trials (constant context) or in between lists of much longer length (variable context). Other variables were vocalization-during-presentation versus silent memorization (within subject) and order of recall (between subjects). The results showed a negative effect of variable context on the penultimate serial positions {{in the case of}} silent memorization but not in the case of vocalization. Context had no effect on the first and middle parts of the list, which confirms earlier results with auditorily presented lists (Bunt 1976), but which disagrees with the original evidence from Crowder (1969). Subjects preferred forward recall in the case of silent memorization and echobox recall in the case of vocalization during presentation, irrespective of context. The results are discussed {{within the framework of the}} notion of precategorical <b>acoustic</b> <b>storage</b> (PAS) and of positional retrieval cues. The latter theory seems to provide a better and more comprehensive accoun...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} EnviroMic, a novel distributed <b>acoustic</b> monitoring, <b>storage,</b> and trace retrieval system. Audio {{represents one of the}} least exploited modalities in sensor networks to date. The relatively high frequency and large size of audio traces motivate distributed algorithms for coordinating recording tasks, reducing redundancy of data stored by nearby sensors, filtering out silence, and balancing storage utilization in the network. Applications of acoustic monitoring with EnviroMic range from the study of mating rituals and social behavior of animals in the wild to audio surveillance of military targets. EnviroMic is designed for disconnected operation, where the luxury of having a basestation cannot be assumed. We implement the system on a TinyOS-based platform and systematically evaluate its performance through both indoor testbed experiments and a preliminary outdoor deployment. Results demonstrate up to a 4 -fold improvement in effective storage capacity of the network compared to uncoordinated recording.

40|$|Corpus based {{methods are}} {{increasingly}} used for speech technology applications {{and for the}} development of theoretical or computer models of spoken languages. These usages range from unit selection speech synthesis to statistical modeling of speech phenomena like prosody or expressivity. In all cases, these usages require a wide range of tools for corpus creation, labeling, symbolic and <b>acoustic</b> analysis, <b>storage</b> and query. However, if a variety of tools exists for each of these individual tasks, they are rarely integrated into a single platform made available to a large community of researchers. In this paper, we propose IrcamCorpusTools, an open and easily extensible platform for analysis, query and visualization of speech corpora. It is already used for unit selection speech synthesis, for prosody and expressivity studies, and to exploit various corpora of spoken French or other languages. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design of a miniature <b>acoustic</b> data <b>storage</b> tag intended for the tracking of small fish. The essential components of the system have been integrated in standard 0. 5 um CMOS technology. Geopositioning of the tag is achieved by measuring the transit time of a sonar signal emitted from a fixed source location. The received sonar signal is pre-amplified, filtered by three switched-capacitor filters, digitized, and then correlated with the expected pattern stored in internal memory. The monolithic temperature sensor is embedded in a band-gap reference circuit. The analog output of the temperature sensor is converted to digital by means of a 10 bit switched-capacitor ADC. The external memory stores all physical data such as sound arrival time, water temperature, and pressure. A power-on-reset and a battery check circuit are utilized for power management. ^ Each analog CMOS circuit block has been successfully designed, fabricated, and tested. Testing has proven that every analog unit meets the required specification. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of an <b>acoustic</b> data <b>storage</b> tag for long-range fish tracking in the ocean. The core of the tag is a custom integrated circuit fabricated in 0. 5 μm CMOS. Device geopositioning is achieved with an on-board hydrophone listening for signals from several moored acoustic sources. Environmental data in the form of temperature and pressure is periodically sampled. All acquired data is stored locally. The tag 2 ̆ 7 s sampling protocol is completely programmable via a PC interface. This interface also allows sensor calibration and retrieval of data {{at the end of the}} tag 2 ̆ 7 s mission. Sensors, batteries, nonvolatile RAM and a quartz crystal are the only components external to the custom integrated circuit, enabling a smaller and more power-efficient device. ^ The tag circuitry has been thoroughly simulated in MATLAB and HSPICE, and prototype integrated circuits have been fabricated. Tests have proven the feasibility of the employed tracking method as well as proper operation of the remainder of the tag electronics. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{invention}} {{relating to}} the use of a standing <b>acoustic</b> wave charge <b>storage</b> device as an image readout device is described. A frequency f sub 1 was applied to the storage transfer device to create a traveling electric field in the device in one direction along a straight line. A second frequency f sub 2 was applied to the charge transfer device to create a traveling electric field opposite to the first traveling electric field. A standing wave was created. When an image was focused on the charge transfer device, light was stored in the wells of the standing wave. When the frequency f sub 2 is removed from the device, the standing wave tends to break up and the charges stored move to an electrode connected to an output terminal and to a utilization device where the received charges represent the image {{on the surface of the}} charge transfer device along a projection of said straight line...|$|R
40|$|Ferroelectric single {{crystals}} with tailored domain structure are {{a promising}} {{material for the}} development of new generation of optical, <b>acoustic</b> and data <b>storage</b> devices. Therefore, approaches that lead to the control of polarization switching, and of the dynamics thereof, with nanometer spatial resolution are of immense scientific importance. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) provides wide range of tools for complex investigations of the ferroelectric domain structures and processes of polarization reversal. In this work the kinetics of SPM tip-induced polarization reversal on the surface of a LiNbO 3 single crystal has been studied. The formation of spatially inhomogeneous symmetric and asymmetric nano-sized domain structures has been revealed; it is attributed to a complex multistage process including “anomalous ” polarization reversal in the direction opposite to the applied electric field. This phenomena is expected to form the basis for a novel approach of data storage based on ferroelectric domain structures.

40|$|AbstractThe Cerro Prieto dam, a {{relatively}} small water reservoir in NE Mexico, {{is one of the}} main resources of potable water for Monterrey, a city with a population of about fourmillion inhabitants. A high resolution seismic study using non-linear parametric sub-bottom echo-sounder SES- 2000 was carried out in this water reservoir. High resolution acoustic data interpretation shows that the thickness of recent sediments due to siltation of the reservoir reaches 3. 5 - 4. 0 m. It shows a high recent sedimentation rate (1 - 2 up to 14 cm/ year). Based on the echo-sounder data, the first bathymetric map and a digital model of recent sediment thickness were designed. A significant (5 - 12 %) difference between the volume capacity value used by National Commission of Water (CNA) and acoustic survey results was revealed. Differences between the CNA and <b>acoustic</b> data indicate <b>storage</b> losses from 12 - 17 up to 30 million cubic meters. The results obtained through study such as this one, could be useful to improve a water resources management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Most of {{underground}} hydrocarbon storage {{are located in}} depleted natural gas reservoirs. Seismic survey is the most eco-nomical source of detailed subsurface information. The inversion of seismic section for obtaining pseudoacoustic impedance section gives the possibility to extract detailed subsurface information. The seismic wavelet parameters and noise briefly influence the reso-lution. Low signal parameters, especially long signal duration time {{and the presence of}} noise decrease pseudoimpedance resolution. Drawing out from measurement or modelled seismic data approximation of distribution of acoustic pseuoimpedance leads us to visualisation and images useful to stratum homogeneity identification goal. In this paper, the improvement of geologic section image resolution by use of minimum entropy deconvolution method before inversion is applied. The author proposes context and adaptive transformation of images and edge detection methods as a way to increase the effectiveness of correct interpretation of simulated im-ages. In the paper, the edge detection algorithms using Sobel, Prewitt, Robert, Canny operators as well as Laplacian of Gaussian method are emphasised.
