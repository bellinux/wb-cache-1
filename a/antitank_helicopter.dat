5000|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the SSM-A-23 [...] "Dart" [...] in 1958 the United States began evaluating the SS.11, and accepted it into service in 1961 as the AGM-22A. The missile was deployed from UH-1B Huey helicopters using either the XM11 or M22 armament subsystems. In U.S. Army service, the SS.11 was used mainly to develop tactics employing <b>antitank</b> <b>helicopters</b> and to train future helicopter crews. In September 1965, 12 U.S. Army UH-1B helicopters belonging to a special unit, fitted with the XM-58 stabilized sight arrived in Vietnam. One month later they fired AGM-22s in combat.|$|R
50|$|Due to its firepower, {{various types}} of {{ammunition}} and its Instant Ammunition Selection Device (IASD), the KBA can engage lightly armoured vehicles, infantry and <b>antitank</b> positions, <b>helicopters,</b> combat aircraft and ships.|$|R
2500|$|The first French contingents were {{deployed}} north of N'Djamena at {{points on the}} two possible routes of advance on the capital. Fighter aircraft and <b>antitank</b> <b>helicopters</b> were dispatched to Chad to discourage an attack on N'Djamena. As the buildup proceeded, forward positions were established roughly along the 15th parallel from Mao {{in the west to}} Abéché in the east (the so-called [...] "Red Line"), which the French tried to maintain as the line separating the combatants. This force eventually rose to become the largest expeditionary force ever assembled by France in Africa since the Algerian War, reaching 3,500 troops and several squadrons of Jaguar fighter-bombers.|$|R
2500|$|The SPz 12-3 {{mounted a}} small turret with a Hispano-Suiza HS.820 20mm autocannon and a 15x15 {{periscopic}} sight. [...] The {{role of the}} 20mm autocannon in German doctrine was to engage <b>helicopters,</b> <b>antitank</b> weapons, and light armored vehicles, thus freeing tanks to concentrate their fire against other tanks. Even with the turret, the SPz 12-3 was fully two feet lower in height than the M113 - no small advantage on an armored battlefield. [...] The vehicle had an on-board supply of 2,000 rounds of 20mm ammunition. [...] Frontal armor provided protection against 20mm projectiles, which was stronger than comparable vehicles of other nations. [...] The additional armor made the SPz 12-3 four tons heavier than the M113, even though the SPz could only carry half as many troops. [...] For the squad members to fire their personal weapons while mounted, roof hatches had to be opened with the soldiers sticking {{up out of the}} hatches. [...] The Germans considered this a significant disadvantage as their likely opponent, the Soviet Army, was expected to use chemical agents in any war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.|$|R
