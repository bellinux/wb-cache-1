50|$|All felids have protractible claws {{that can}} protract from a {{retracted}}, <b>at-rest</b> <b>position.</b> In a few species, {{such as the}} cheetah, the claws remain visible even when at rest (retracted). The claws are retracted when the animal is relaxed and protracted {{when they are in}} use. They are attached to the terminal bone of the toe with a tough ligament; when the animal contracts muscles in the toe to straighten it, the ligament forces the claw outwards. Cats have five toes on their forefeet and four on their hindfeet, reflecting their reliance on gripping and holding down their prey with their claws. In the Felidae, the baculum is shorter than in the Canidae.|$|E
5000|$|Automatic lockers {{lock and}} unlock {{automatically}} with no direct {{input from the}} driver. Some automatic locking differential designs ensure that engine power is always transmitted to both wheels, regardless of traction conditions, and will [...] "unlock" [...] only when one wheel is required to spin faster than the other during cornering. These would be more correctly termed [...] "automatic unlocking" [...] differentials, because their <b>at-rest</b> <b>position</b> is locked. They will never allow either wheel to spin slower than the differential carrier or axle as a whole, but will permit a wheel to be over-driven faster than the carrier speed. The most common example of this type would be the famous [...] "Detroit Locker," [...] made by Eaton Corporation, {{also known as the}} [...] "Detroit No-Spin," [...] which replaces the entire differential carrier assembly. Others, sometimes referred to as [...] "lunchbox lockers," [...] employ the stock differential carrier and replace only the internal spider gears and shafts with interlocking plates. Both types of automatic lockers will allow for a degree of differential wheel speed while turning corners in conditions of equal traction, but will otherwise lock both axle shafts together when traction conditions demand it.|$|E
50|$|The M86 antipersonnel mine is {{manually}} armed {{by removing}} the safety clip and then the arming strap assembly. A camming action breaks the shorting bar and forces the battery ball against the battery breaking the glass ampule containing an electrolyte which activates the reserve battery and provides power. The shorting bar hook, attached to the cam, shears the shorting bar (a safety device across the detonator). After a 60-second (nominal) electronic time delay, a piston actuator in the Safe and Arm mechanism is electrically fired, moving a slider to align the detonator with an explosive lead in the slider. At the same time, seven sensor triplines are released. Approximately three or four triplines will deploy up to 20 feet from the mine, depending upon the <b>at-rest</b> <b>position</b> of the mine. The remaining triplines may be hindered due to their proximity to the resting surface. After an additional 10-second electronic time delay, allowing the munition to return to equilibrium, the mine is fully armed electronically. Disturbance of a tripline, or the mine itself, now triggers a switch which completes an electronic firing circuit. The S&A electric detonator initiates the S&A firing train which initiates a detonating cord which the initiates {{a thin layer of}} liquid propellant, which by gravity rests under the kill mechanism, shattering the plastic mine body and propelling the kill mechanism upwards from 6 inches to 8 feet above the ground where it detonates. The kill mechanism is a spheroid internally embossed and loaded with 21 grams of Comp A5 and when detonated, propels fragments in a high velocity spherical pattern.|$|E
