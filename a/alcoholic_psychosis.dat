40|$|In {{previous}} {{reports of}} studies of patients with <b>alcoholic</b> Korsakoff's <b>psychosis,</b> data were presented showing significant correlations between neuropsychometric measures of amnesia and the CSF levels of the major brain metabolite of norepinephrine (NE), which was consistently reduced among {{a large group of}} experimental subjects. Dopamine (DA) metabolite concentrations in the CSF of this same patient population were also significantly lowered but to a lesser degree and less consistently than the NE metabolite. CSF levels of the DA metabolite did not correlate with any measures of amnesia but did significantly correlate with performance on the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which involves psychomotor skill learning. DSST performance did not correlate with CSF levels of the NE metabolite. These findings led to the hypothesis that the acquisition of motor learning skills is related to brain DA activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis by correlating the ability of a group of Korsakoff patients to learn two different motor tasks (rotary pursuit and mirror tracing) with the concentrations of CSF metabolites of NE, DA, and serotonin. For both tasks, improvement in performance over three daily testing sessions significantly correlated only with the DA metabolite levels. The data are consistent with the hypothesis of a specific role for DA in motor learning...|$|R
40|$|The effects upon {{regional}} {{brain function}} of infusing either saline or clonidine (1. 5 microgram/kg) has been examined in 18 patients with <b>alcoholic</b> Korsakoff's <b>psychosis</b> using 99 mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamineoxime (99 mTc-HMPAO or 99 mTc-Exametazime) and Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPET or SPECT). The hypothesis tested was that frontal lobe function would be increased by adrenoceptor stimulation. This {{was confirmed by}} an increase in the uptake of 99 mTc-Exametazime into anterior cingulate regions of the frontal lobes. Patients were scanned before and after saline or clonidine infusion during performance of a verbal fluency task. There was a significantly increased performance of verbal fluency in patients given clonidine. This effect was variable and could not be unequivocably distinguished from increases in performance in the saline treated group. Nevertheless, the increase in neuropsychological performance was also correlated with increased function in left dorsolateral frontal cortex within the clonidine treated group. An exploratory examination of other brain areas suggested that relative increases in posterior cingulate cortex and changes in the symmetry of function within the thalamus may also be produced by acute infusion of clonidine in Korsakoff patients. The findings support the idea that adrenergic mechanisms may modulate cognitive performance by actions on attentional systems within the brain. These appear to be located primarily within limbic cortex. It is, of course, notable that this can occur in patients with profound and disabling amnesia...|$|R

5000|$|Scholarly {{literature}} {{regarding the}} effect of prohibition has held that popular claim that prohibition was a failure is false. The proponents of National Prohibition believed that banning alcoholic beverages would reduce or even eliminate many social problems, particularly drunkenness, crime, mental illness, and poverty. Mark H. Moore, a professor at Harvard University Kennedy School of Government, stated, {{with respect to the}} effects of prohibition: Alcohol consumption declined dramatically during Prohibition. Cirrhosis death rates for men were 29.5 per 100,000 in 1911 and 10.7 in 1929. Admissions to state mental hospitals for <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis</b> declined from 10.1 per 100,000 in 1919 to 4.7 in 1928. Arrests for public drunkennness and disorderly conduct declined 50 percent between 1916 and 1922. For the population as a whole, the best estimates are that consumption of alcohol declined by 30 percent to 50 percent. Specifically, [...] "rates for cirrhosis of the liver fell by 50 percent early in Prohibition and recovered promptly after Repeal in 1933." [...] Professor Mark H. Moore also found that contrary to popular opinion, [...] "violent crime did not increase dramatically during Prohibition" [...] and that organized crime [...] "existed before and after" [...] Prohibition. The historian Jack S. Blocker, Jr. stated that [...] "Death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis</b> hospital admissions, and drunkenness arrests all declined steeply during the latter years of the 1910s, when both the cultural and the legal climate were increasingly inhospitable to drink, and in the early years after National Prohibition went into effect."

40|$|Background Alcohol-related {{deaths and}} {{hospital}} admissions have risen steeply in the United Kingdom and {{little is known}} about whether there are opportunities for preventive interventions or opportunities for the earlier detection of alcohol misuse. The purpose of this research was to investigate and describe patterns of healthcare utilisation in the pre-diagnosis period of alcoholic cirrhosis and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> two alcohol-related disorders which contribute significantly to alcohol related morbidity and mortality. This information is important as it could greatly facilitate a better understanding of opportunities for the earlier detection of alcohol misuse, and could also potentially encourage and assist practitioners in the timely identification of those who are at high risk of developing significant alcohol-related illnesses. Specific research objectives 1) To estimate rates of primary and secondary healthcare contacts before the diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis/psychosis and assess whether this differs from rates in the general population 2) To characterise the healthcare contacts and establish whether such consultations were for other conditions known to be related to alcohol. 3) As a secondary objective, to establish whether prior healthcare contacts led to recognition of alcohol problems and consequent interventions. Methods UK general practice and hospital admissions data were used for this research. A population of patients diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis and subsequently, a population of patients with <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis</b> were identified. For each case, 10 patients without the disease who were of similar age and from the same general practice were selected as controls. For each disease group, a case-control study design was used to compare rates of primary care contacts and hospital admissions in cases to that of the control population. Further, the reasons for primary care visits and hospital admissions were assessed to describe the frequency of other alcohol-attributable morbidities in cases and controls, and to assess whether there were any morbidities which were strongly associated with the later development of alcoholic cirrhosis and psychosis. Finally, the proportions of patients who had a record of their alcohol use status or a record of an offer of brief alcohol intervention/referral were estimated. Results Alcoholic cirrhosis 2, 479 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 24, 790 controls matched on age and GP practice were available for analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to {{describe}} and to analyse disparities {{between men and women}} for "premature" mortality rates (deaths before 65 year-old). The study is particularly focused on "avoidable" causes of death. These types of deaths are greatly related to risk behaviours such as alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse or dangerous driving. Taking account of these indicators ("premature" and "avoidable" mortality) enables to study health status discrepancies by gender and to characterize specific public health issues in France including high rates of "premature" mortality and risk behaviours. METHODS: The analysis is based on exhaustive mortality data from 1980 to 1999 supplied by the Centre for epidemiology of medical causes of death (CepiDc-INSERM). Specific causes of death closely related to risk behaviours are classified as "avoidable": lung and upper airways cancers, cirrhosis, <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis,</b> traffic accidents, aids and suicide. The contribution of these categories in the global male overmortality was assessed according to different demographic and geographic characteristics. RESULTS: Within "premature" mortality, males experience greater burden of "avoidable" mortality (sex-ratio: 4 versus 2). The gender differences are mainly due to injuries and suicides in the younger age groups and to tobacco and alcohol-related cancers (lung and upper airways) in the 45 - 64 years age group. The recent decline in "premature" mortality sex-ratio is explained by an increase of these two cancers for females. Among european countries, the French male overmortality is especially marked and mainly attributable to "avoidable" causes of death. CONCLUSION: "Avoidable" and "premature" mortality provide useful tools for the follow-up of health status in France particularly because of high risk behaviours and prevention inadequacy. Reducing gender discrepancies will depend mainly on public health policies in terms of primary prevention...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a great {{increase}} in prosperity and an improvement in living standards since Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1972. This {{has been a}} mixed blessing as far as health is concerned. With increasing purchasing power the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol has risen sharply which has resulted in a further increase in mortality and morbidity from lung cancer and chronic bronchitis and in alcohol-related problems and in admissions to our psychiatric hospitals for alcoholism and <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis.</b> The number of motor cars has more than doubled which means that we are walking and cycling much less and we are moving towards a highly urbanised society. These changes have been very pleasant for those who enjoyed a rising standard of living and prosperity has reduced emigration so that the population has increased. Nevertheless, there are still many in Ireland suffering from a considerable degree of poverty, for example the itinerants and those living in some inner areas of our cities and also some of the aged. The annual increase in prosperity is probably coming to an end and we are faced with higher prices and lower purchasing power. We will also have to pay much more for our energy sources, oil and coal. Prosperity in Ireland has brought with it other problems, for example the hazards from the mining of lead and zinc and in factories dealing with potentially highly toxic agents, such as certain chemicals and asbestos, and now, quite possibly, the mining of uranium.

40|$|Currently, average {{apparent}} {{consumption of alcohol}} for all persons older than 14 is 10 percent higher than 10 years ago, and is equivalent to about 2. 75 gallons of ethanol per person per year. Approximately 10 million adult Americans (i. e., 7 percent of those 18 or older) can be considered problem drinkers. Youthful problem drinkers, aged 14 to 17, are estimated to number more than 3 million and comprise 19 percent of this age group. In addition to the social costs, the economic costs to society {{as a result of}} alcohol misuse are substantial [...] an estimated + 49. 4 billion in 1977. Ten percent of all deaths in the United States are alcohol-related. Cirrhosis, which is largely attributable to alcohol consumption, ranks among the 10 leading causes of death. Alcohol use also is associated with cancer of the liver, pancreas, esophagus, and mouth. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated {{with a wide range of}} possible harmful effects to the fetus [...] among them decreased birth weight, spontaneous abortion, and physical and mental birth defects. Drug misuse is also an expanding problem. There are some 16 million current marijuana users. The popularity of cocaine continues to increase [...] over 10 million Americans have tried cocaine at least once and there are an estimated 1 to 2 million current users. Misuse of barbiturates remains a significant problem with at least 1 million persons believed to misuse these drugs and the 30, 000 estimated to be addicted to them. In addition, heroin addiction is still considered by many to be the most serious drug problem in the United States. Drug misuse leads to a number of social and health problems. Excessive doses of depressants can result in both physical and psychological dependence. The toll from heroin includes premature death and severe disability, family disruption, and crime committed to maintain the habit. Misuse of hallucinogens often results in emergency room visits. A special problem is the relationship of marijuana to automobile accidents, especially when used in combination with alcohol. While these events are disconcerting, progress has been made.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{reducing}} the consumption of alcohol became a topical issue among the Soviet authorities in 1982, {{but as a result}} of the following frequent substitutions in the organs of power the planned measures could not be applied. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev, being appointed secretary general, once again raised the issue, and began to carry out a considerably stricter alcohol policy. The new and unprecedentedly strict alcohol strategy was being carried out according to the guidelines sent from Moscow in all the Union Republics, including Estonia. The alcohol strategy implemented in 1985 - 1987 covered different fields and was not only about restrictions on the sale. Attention was also paid to preventive methods - propagating abstinence as well as offering new choices to spend free time. The availability of alcoholic drinks was aggravated by setting stricter limits on the sale, increasing the prices of alcoholic beverages and also by increasing the penalty for illegal sale and use of alcohol. Several changes were made to provide better availability of narcological aid. The new administration would not have withdrawn from the once started policy, but economical difficulties brought it to halt as early as in 1987. The significantly reduced production of alcohol lead to the slumping of profits from the sale and the treasury could no longer afford to continue the experiment. The purpose of this paper was to give a thorough survey of the methods of the 1985 - 87 alcohol strategy and to look into the consequences of developing a stricter official alcohol strategy in Estonia, especially the effects on consumption habits. The descriptions of the official alcohol strategy are based on the decrees of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, also the official documents issued by local authorities, legislative and executive bodies. To evaluate alcohol consumption, the author has basically relied on the statistics of the sale of alcohol. The source of the data is the departmental reports of the Central Statistical Office of the ESSR to the USSR Federal Statistical office on the sales of alcohol in Soviet Estonia. The data of the reports must be reliable as these were confidential documents intended only for official use. It may be concluded from the estimations of the amount of the alcohol sold that {{as a result of the}} new alcohol strategy, alcohol consumption in Estonia decreased considerably: from 10. 8 litres of absolute alcohol per capita in 1984 to 7. 5 litres in 1986, and 6. 4 litres in 1987. There was also a change in the different types of alcoholic drinks consumed. The consumption of strong alcohol, especially different types of wine, decreased to some extent, while the relative proportion of beer consumption increased. In addition to the decreased figures of legal alcohol sale the decrease in alcohol consumption is confirmed by the drastic fall in the rate of alcohol poisoning fatalities and cases of <b>alcoholic</b> <b>psychosis</b> in 1985 and 1986; during the period of 1985 - 1986 the rate of alcohol poisoning fatalities was reduced by half. The similarity of changes in the frequency of alcohol poisoning fatalities and tendencies in legal alcohol sales allows us to conclude that under the circumstances of restricted sale of legal alcohol the consumption of illegal alcohol and surrogates did not considerably increase. The temperance campaign and contingent fall in alcohol consumption was effective in decreasing the number of fatalities in injuries and suicides...|$|E
