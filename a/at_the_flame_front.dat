Explicit expressions have been obtained for the burning rate of the fuel droplet, for the temperature <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front,</b> and for the radius of the combustion surface. The principal assumptions on which our analysis is based are: the flame front is established at a spherical surface surrounding the drop; the rates of delivery of fuel and oxygen to this surface are in stoichiometric proportions; the rates of reaction <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> are fast compared to the rates of delivery of combustible gases. Our analysis is an extension and generalization {{of the work of}} G. A. E. Godsave.

40|$|A new kinetic {{mechanism}} {{has been}} developed {{for the formation of}} benzene and high-molecular-mass aromatic compounds in rich flames of aliphatic hydrocarbons. The kinetic scheme emphasizes both the role of resonantly stabilized radicals in the growth of aromatics and the standard acetylene addition mechanism. The model has been used to simulate premixed flames of acetylene and ethylene where the concentrations of radicals and high-molecular-mass compounds are known. The kinetic scheme accurately reproduces the concentrations and trends of radicals and stable species including benzene and total aromatic compounds. Formation of benzene is controlled by propargyl radical combination. The model reproduces well the profiles of benzene for the different hydrocarbons and in the different operating conditions. Key reactions in the formation of high-molecular-mass aromatics are the combinations of resonantly stabilized radicals, including cyclopentadienyl self-combination, propargyl addition to benzyl radicals, and the sequential addition of propargyl radicals to aromatic rings. The predicted amounts of total aromatic compounds increase <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> and remain constant in the postoxidation zone of the flames, attaining the final concentrations of soot, in slightly-sooting conditions.

Momentum {{and energy}} {{integral}} analysis of planar and axisymmetric laminar, buoyant diffusion flames is {{presented with the}} objective of describing the flame properties and ambient air entrainment. The analysis follows the traditional momentum/energy integral technique utilizing the Howarth–Dorodnitzyn transformation for variable density flows and description of the velocity profiles through the flame region in the transformed constant-density coordinate system. The assumptions utilized in the formulation include the boundary layer and thin-flame approximations, a Prandtl and Schmidt number of unity and the product of molecular diffusivity–density squared being constant throughout the field. It is shown that a similarity solution exists for a vertical planar flame formed between a semi-infinite region of fuel in contact with a semi-infinite region of oxidizer and the results are presented in non-dimensional form in this case and are compared with their asymptotic values. For the steady laminar axisymmetric buoyant diffusion flames originating from circular burners, numerical solutions are obtained for different diameter burners. It is found that ambient air entrainment is predominantly determined by the air consumption <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> and only an additional small portion of mass (about 5 % of that consumed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front)</b> is induced in the flame region. When compared with the measured air entrainment in buoyant diffusion flames, the computed entrainment rates are found to be significantly smaller than the experimental values. This points to the fact that unsteady large-scale engulfment of ambient air into fire plumes dominates over the diffusive and buoyant boundary-layer transport of air around a fire plume...|$|E

40|$|The present {{experimental}} {{study examined the}} characteristics of liquid ethanol fuel droplet combustion {{in the presence of}} high amplitude acoustic excitation, with focus on conditions where high local flame strain can result in the periodic partial extinction and reignition within <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> in time. These partial extinction phenomena were observed via phase-locked OH* chemiluminescence imaging and identified by the cycle of sudden, severe drop-off in chemiluminescent intensity near <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> stagnation region followed by reignition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stagnation <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> <b>at</b> a later portion of the acoustic cycle. For increased excitation levels, the burning rate constant values were higher than those for both baseline quiescent and moderate excitation conditions. The experimental acoustic acceleration values were also higher than those for moderate excitation levels. Furthermore, as observed in past studies, these measurements of acoustic acceleration agreed only qualitatively with predictions from the acoustic radiation force theory. The presence of periodic partial extinction did not alter these expected trends. The temporal response in flame luminosity to flow perturbations was also analyzed using the Rayleigh index to determine the degree of thermoacoustic coupling inherent in a burning droplet system for given forcing conditions. When partial extinction was absent, the integrated OH* chemiluminescent intensity oscillated nearly in phase with the pressure perturbation. This led to a positive Rayleigh index, indicating unstable combustion, as was observed in previous studies at moderate excitation. However, partial extinction phenomena altered the relationship between measured intensity and pressure perturbations: the intensity oscillated nearly out of phase with the pressure perturbation. This led to a negative Rayleigh index, indicating stable combustion despite clear evidence of thermoacoustic coupling in the combustion footage and in the combustion property trends. These results indicated that the characterization of thermoacoustic coupling is important to the description of any droplet combustion system undergoing acoustic excitation; however, they also suggested that <b>the</b> Rayleigh index, <b>at</b> least when quantified using OH* chemiluminescence, may not fully capture the nature of thermoacoustic coupling in regimes where partial extinction phenomena occur...|$|R

This is achieved by synthesising the nonlinear, first-order Michelson-Sivashinsb (MS) equation with the second order linear dispersion relation of Landau and Darrieus, which adds only one extra term to the MS equation without changing any of its stationary behaviour and without changing its dynamics in the limit of small density change when the MS equation is asymptotically valid. However, as demonstrated by spectral numerical solutions, the resulting second-order nonlinear evolution equation is found to describe the inversion of tulip flames in good qualitative agreement with classical experiments on the phenomenon. This shows that the combined influences of front curvature, geometric nonlinearity and hydrodynamic instability (including its second-order, or inertial effects, which are an essential result of vorticity production <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front)</b> are sufficient to reproduce the inversion process...|$|E
40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} stabilization of lifted turbulent jet diusion flames. Earlier {{work in this area}} was thoroughly reviewed by Pitts (1988). Recent advances in laser diagnostic methods have vastly increased the breadth of data available regarding this problem, while increased computational capacity has permitted the assessment of various models for flame stabilization. However, there remains no consensus regarding the stabilization mechanism. Proposed models dier primarily on the role of premixing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front.</b> Given a jet of undiluted fuel issuing into air, it is undisputed that some degree of fuel-air premix-ing occurs upstream of the lifted flame. The stabilization theory of Vanquickenbourne & van Tiggelen (1966) assumed full premixedness of fuel and air at the stabilization point, with stabilization occurring through a balance of the local jet axial velocity and turbu-lent flame speed. Subsequently, Peters & Williams (1983) argued that, in axisymmetric turbulent jets, insucient molecular mixing occurs upstream of the flame front to sup-port the notion of premixed flame propagation. Instead, stabilization was proposed to be governed by the quenching of thin, laminar diusion flamelets. Müller et al. (1994...|$|E

As {{part of a}} program to explain the shift in the maximum blowoff velocity from stoichiometric mixture ratio for small flame holder sizes, laminar flame stabilization studies were made using cylindrical flame holders of 0. 031 to 0. 125 inches in diameter at Reynolds numbers {{in the range of}} 10 [^ 3] to 10 [^ 4]. Chemical samples of the gases in the recirculation region behind the flame holders were taken and analyzed to determine the composition of the burning gases <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front.</b> Maximum temperature measurements were taken of this same region. It was found that at these low Reynolds numbers, the composition was different than in the unburned approach mixtures, and that this was apparently due to the difference in molecular diffusion of the fuel and air across the flame front. The variation in the composition of the burning gases appears to be a direct function of the approach fuel-air mixture ratio for each diameter and approach mixture velocity...|$|E

The flow velocity is 5 m/s and <b>the</b> turbulence intensity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> holder {{generated by a}} grid varies from 3. 5 % to 5 %. <b>The</b> <b>flames</b> are within <b>the</b> wrinkled laminar <b>flame</b> regime. A sheet of pulsed laser light (Ruby rod) of 75 × 80 mm illuminates an oil aerosol seeded in the H 2 -air flow, and <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>flame</b> structures are obtained when the oil droplets evaporate on passage through <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front.</b> <b>The</b> <b>flames</b> are imaged onto a CCD camera. The camera is interfaced with a matrix memory of 512 × 512 pixels with a dynamic range of 256 gray scales, and the tomographic records are analyzed by a digital image processing technique. The gray level corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> is determined by a filtering and thresholding operation. The first and second moments and correlations of <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> positions are deduced from the measurement of 240 instantaneous, statistically independent <b>flames.</b> <b>The</b> {{results show that the}} turbulence characteristics and equivalence ratio have an important effect on the shape and the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> In particular, <b>the</b> growth of turbulence flame brush, δT, is linear for a distance that can be correlated with the Lagrangian time scale of the turbulence. Furthermore, the slope of this evolution is proportional to <b>the</b> turbulence intensity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> holder. <b>The</b> linear growth is consistent with results observed by others for wrinkled laminar <b>flames.</b> <b>The</b> changes in <b>the</b> local <b>flame</b> surface area with downstream distance are estimated by the length of the flamelet segment within a vertical window of 10 pixels. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> area increases are found to be accompanied by increases in <b>the</b> mean <b>flame</b> angle as shown by the width of the burned zone. These results confirm that <b>the</b> wrinkled laminar <b>flame</b> model is valid for <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> studied here. <b>The</b> <b>flame</b> <b>front</b> fluctuation results are interpreted using a Lagrangian diffusion model developed by Karlovitz. From this model, the value of the rms displacement of a flame element is calculated based on the approach flow turbulence characteristics (in comparison with the propagation speed of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> <b>fronts).</b> Model predictions and experimental results are in good agreement.
