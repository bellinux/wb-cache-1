40|$|El tratamiento que ha demostrado mayor eficacia en los pacientes con síndrome de apneas-hipopneas del sueño (SAHS) es la presión positiva {{continua}} de la vía <b>aérea</b> (CPAP). <b>Los</b> mayores inconvenientes son la incomodidad y la sensación de claustrofobia, que en algunos pacientes provoca rechazo o intolerancia. Una alternativa son los dispositivos de avance mandibular (DAM), que insertados en las arcadas dentarias producen el avance de la mandíbula y de la lengua, aumentando el volumen de la vía aérea. Objetivo: Presentar nuestra experiencia en el tratamiento del SAHS mediante dispositivos de avance mandibular tipo Herbst. Metodología: Estudio de seguimiento prospectivo desde junio de 2006 hasta enero de 2009 de 7 pacientes del Área Hospitalaria Virgen Macarena con SAHS que rechazan el tratamiento con CPAP y a los que se ofrece tratamiento con DAM. Las variables analizadas son: índice de apneas-hipopneas por hora, índice de desaturaciones por hora, intensidad subjetiva del ronquido y el test de somnolencia de Epworth, antes del tratamiento y {{al menos}} 6 meses después desde el inicio de su uso. Utilizamos el test de Wilcoxon para detectar diferencias estadísticas significativas (p The most effective treatment {{in patients with}} sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure). The main drawback of CPAP is the discomfort and claustrophobic sensation that it causes, which elicits rejection or intolerance by some patients. A non-surgical alternative to CPAP is the mandibular advancement device (MAD), which consists of a plastic splint inserted between the dental arches to shift the jaw and tongue forward and thus increase airway volume. Objective: Report our experience with the treatment of SAHS using the Herbst mandibular advancement device. Material and method: A prospective follow-up study was carried out from June 2006 until January 2009 at the Virgen Macarena University Hospital with 7 patients with SAHS who refused treatment with CPAP and were treated with the mandibular advancement device. The outcome variables analyzed were: apnea-hypopnea disruptions per hour index, desaturations per hour index, subjective intensity of snoring, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Variables were evaluated pre-treatment and at least once 6 months after initiation MAD use. The Wilcoxon test for paired samples was used to detect statistically significant differences (p< 0. 05). Results: A statistically significant reduction in the hourly indices of apnea-hypopnea disruptions (p< 0. 018) and desaturations (p< 0. 018) was observed, {{as well as a}} statistically nonsignificant reduction in snoring and sleepiness. Conclusions: Use of the Herbst mandibular advancement device in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome who refuse CPAP may be helpful as it improves the clinical and functional parameters of the condition...|$|R
40|$|El estudio de la biomasa <b>aérea</b> (BA) de <b>los</b> bosques tropicales es {{fundamental}} para entender el balance del C global en el contexto del cambio climático. La BA se cuantificó en un bosque maduro de Salero (Chocó Biogeográfico), mediante ecuaciones diseñadas para bosques húmedos tropicales, a partir de datos de densidad de madera, diámetro (DAP) y altura de árboles (con DAP = 10 cm) medidos en dos sub-parcelas permanentes ("E" y "U") de 1 ha, las cuales se monitorearon en los años 1998, 2005 y 2008. La BA fue 237, 31 t·ha- 1, 259, 99 t·ha- 1 y 217, 97 t·ha- 1 respectivamente en la sub-parcela "E". Mientras que en la "U" fue de 178, 94 t·ha- 1 y 179, 17 t·ha- 1 en los años 2005 y 2008; las diferencias de BA a través del tiempo fueron no significativas. Los incrementos promedios anuales de BA de sobrevivientes fueron 4, 42 y 3, 18 t·ha- 1 año- 1 en las sub-parcelas "E" y "U" respectivamente. Además, en sub-parcela "E" en condiciones imperturbadas, se presentó una tasa de incremento neto de la BA (TINBA) de 2, 61 t·ha- 1 año- 1, en concordancia con la hipótesis del incremento en la BA en los bosques húmedos tropicales. La productividad primaria neta aérea (PPNA) en Salero de carbono fue de 5, 21 t· ha- 1 año- 1, {{por lo tanto}} los resultados no apoyaron la hipótesis de la disminución en la productividad de los bosques tropicales con el incremento en la precipitación. The {{study of}} the aboveground biomass (AB) of tropical forests is fundamental to understand {{the balance of the}} global C {{in the context of the}} climatic change. We quantified the AB in a mature forest of Salero (Chocó Biogeográfico), by means of equations designed for tropical humid forests, starting from data of wooden density, diameter (D) and height of trees (with D = 10 cm) measured in two permanent sub-parcels (E and U) of 1 hectare (ha), which were measured in the years 1998, 2005 and 2008. Inthis years the AB was of 237. 31 t·ha- 1, 259. 99 t·ha- 1 and 217. 97 t·ha- 1 respectively in the E sub-parcel. While in the U it was of 178. 94 t·ha- 1 and 179. 17 t·ha- 1 in the years 2005 and 2008; the differences of the aboveground biomass through the time were not significant. The increments annual averages in survivors' BA were of 4. 42 and 3. 18 t·ha- 1 year- 1 in the E and U sub-parcels respectively. Also, in sub-parcel E under conditions imperturbadas, the rate of net increment was presented in the AB (TINBA) of 2. 61 t·ha- 1 year- 1, in agreement with the hypothesis of the increment in the BA in the tropical humid forests. The PPNA of carbon in Salero was of 5. 21 t·ha- 1 year- 1, therefore the results didn't support the hypothesis of the decrease in the productivity of the tropical forests with the increment in the precipitation...|$|R

The group originally consisted of Pirata Morgan Jr. Barba Roja (Kaleth under a new name) and Drake Morgan (Pirata's youngest son under yet another ring name). Pirata Morgan would often team with the group and was billed as their father, even of Barbe Roja {{who was not a}} blood relative. In late 2007 Drake Morgan was repackaged as Hijo de Pirata Morgan to reveal that he was indeed the son of Pirata Morgan.

5000|$|He {{made his}} debut in 2005, {{at the age}} of only 13, working under a mask as the ring {{character}} Némesis for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). There is some confusion about the name as there was also a wrestler in AAA who used the name [...] "Némesis" [...] around the same time as well as after Hijo de Pirata Morgan began working under a different name, it is possible that he initially played the role in AAA as well, especially since his father was running the AAA wrestling school at the time. Hijo de Pirata Morgan has stated that he was at Triplemanía XIV, but it is unclear if he meant as Nemesis or if he accompanied his father for a match. As Nemesis he teamed up with Kaleth and Pirata Morgan, Jr. to form a trio called Los Jinetes de Apocalipsis ("The Horsemen of the Apocalypse"). He was one of 30 participants in the 2005 Rey del Ring tournament, but was eliminated after only being in the ring {{for a short period of}} time. On December 5, 2005 Némesis participated in IWRG's annual El Castillo del Terror ("Castle of Terror") event, a multi-man steel cage match where the last person in the cage was forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off. Némesis was one of the last two men in the ring along with Ultra Mega, with Némesis being able to escape the ring and was thus credited with unmasking Ultra Mega as per the match stipulation. In 2007 Pirata Morgan introduced a group called Los Piratas in AAA, it consisted of the former Los Jinetes de Apocalipsis as Kaleth became [...] "Barbe Roja" [...] ("Red Beard") and Nemesis became [...] "Drake Morgan", all three billed as sons of Pirata Morgan, even though Kaleth/Barbe Roja was not related.
