25|$|The {{macroeconomic}} stabilisation programme introduced in 1991, {{which focused on}} tight fiscal and monetary policies, has contributed to a controlled reduction {{in the rate of}} inflation. The <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> decreased from a high of 80.2% in 1991 to 7.9% in 1998. Inflation for FY1998/99 was 6.2% compared to 7.2% in the corresponding period in CUU1997/98. The Government of Jamaica remains committed to lowering inflation, with a long-term objective of bringing it in line with that of its major trading partners.|$|E
25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and less government intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the first}} year of President Maduro's presidency, Venezuela's economy began to {{experience}} hyperinflation according to experts. Reasons for the high inflation rate include both heavy money-printing and deficit spending. In April 2013, the month he took office, Venezuela's <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> was 29.4%, only 0.1% less than when Hugo Chávez took office in 1999 and the <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> was at 29.5%. By April 2014, Venezuela's <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> was 61.5%. In early 2014, the Central Bank of Venezuela did not release statistics {{for the first time in}} its history with Forbes reporting that it was a possible way to manipulate the image of economy. In April 2014, the International Monetary Fund stated that economic activity in Venezuela is uncertain but may continue to slow saying that [...] "loose macroeconomic policies have generated high inflation and a drain on official foreign exchange reserves". The IMF suggested that [...] "more significant policy changes are needed to stave off a disorderly adjustment". Data provided by economist Steve H. Hanke of the Cato Institute shows that Venezuela's current economy, as of March 2014, had an inflation rate hovering above 300%, an official inflation rate around 60% and a product scarcity index rising above 25% of goods. Inflation data for September and October 2014 was not reported by the Venezuelan government.|$|E

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to compare an average estimated CPI for all households of 10.5  % (see Fig.  4) resulting from a hypothetical energy subsidies reform with the actual <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> at the same time, which amounted to 12.8  % and 25.2  % in 2007 and 2008, respectively (SSCU [2009 a]). Therefore, {{it should be noted}} that immediate removal of energy subsidies and liberalization of energy prices at one step would not be tolerable to society considering already relatively high <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> observed in Ukraine. Hence, an increase of energy prices up to market levels should be implemented in steps and accompanied by social support programs targeting the most vulnerable households.|$|R

We interpret these results as a sign that price level convergence comes from goods, market and non-makret service prices. Furthermore, we find that the Phillips curve flattens with a decline in the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate,</b> that <b>inflation</b> is more persistant and that commodity prices have a stronger effect on inflation in a higher inflation environment.

The second result appears more consistent with the traditional view than with rational expectations.

In 1994, for example, the government managed to reduce monthly rates from 21% in January to 4% in August, but rates climbed once again, to 16.4% by December and 18% by January 1995. Instability in Russian monetary policy caused the variations. After tightening {{the flow of}} money early in 1994, the Government loosened its restrictions in response to demands for credits by agriculture, industries in the Far North, and some favored large enterprises. In 1995 the pattern was avoided more successfully by maintaining the tight monetary policy adopted {{early in the year}} and by passing a relatively stringent budget. Thus, the monthly <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> held virtually steady below 5% {{in the last quarter of}} the year. For the first half of 1996, the <b>inflation</b> <b>rate</b> was 16.5%.

We find a positive inflation-skewness relationship in both countries at low inflation, even though the mean <b>annual</b> <b>inflation</b> <b>rates</b> were very different: 2, 2 % for Spain and 23 % for Argentina. Therefore, the threshold of low inflation under which the menu costs model is suitable is determined endogenously, and {{it depends on the}} inflationary experience of each economy.
