25|$|Chronic, {{excessive}} vocalization {{may be due}} to improper socialization or training, stress, boredom, fear, or frustration. Up to 35% of {{dog owners}} report problems with barking, which can cause disputes and legal problems. The behavior is more common among some breeds of dog, such as the Shetland Sheepdog, which are known <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> barkers, {{due to the nature of}} the environment in which the breed was developed.|$|E
25|$|The devocalization {{procedure}} {{does not}} take away a dog's ability to bark. Dogs will normally bark {{just as much as}} before the procedure. After the procedure the sound will be softer, typically about half <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> as before, or less, and it is not as sharp or piercing. So while the procedure does not stop barking or silence the animal completely, it is effective in reducing the sound level and sharpness of the dog's bark.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} reasonably accurate {{estimate of}} the speed of sound in air was made by William Derham, and acknowledged by Isaac Newton. Derham had a telescope {{at the top of the}} tower of the Church of St Laurence in Upminster, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final {{estimate of the}} speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something <b>as</b> <b>loud</b> as a shotgun.|$|E

50|$|If air {{conduction}} is intact {{on both sides}} (therefore no CHL), the patient will report a quieter sound in the ear with the sensorineuronal hearing loss.
