25|$|Opening {{to freight}} traffic was in stages after <b>authorisation</b> <b>in</b> 1911 from Shepherdswell to Port Richborough, and from Eastry to Wingham (later renamed Wingham Colliery). The process was casual and without formality, hence exact dates {{are not easy}} to ascertain. Passenger {{services}} from Shepherdswell to Wingham started on 16 October 1916. The initial proposal was to build a line to Canterbury goods yard via Ickham, but authorisation was only granted to build the line as far as the Wingham parish boundary. (Why this terminus was chosen, near where the direct footpath between Wingham and Ickham crosses the Port Rill, is a puzzle. Perhaps another collery was hoped for.) A major stumbling block to completion was the fact that Canterbury City Council was against a level crossing over the A28 at Sturry Road. The official year of opening of the line between Eastry and Richborough Port was 1925, but this is probably incorrect (see below on Richborough Port). The company's bridge over the River Stour, and hence its traffic over it before then, was illegal, since it had built a fixed-span high-level bridge instead of the low-level swing bridge authorised.|$|E

In 1992, Pakistan became an Associate Member of Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research which was signed by his Science Adviser Munir Ahmed Khan at United Nations. As like Benazir, the ongoing nuclear weapons and the energy program remained {{one of his top}} priority. Sharif countered the international pressure, and followed the same suit as Benazir's, and refused to make compromise to halt the program despite the United States having offered a large economic aid to Pakistan. Unlike Benazir, Sharif's nuclear policy was seen less aggressive towards India and focused the atomic programme for the benefit of public usage and civil society. Unlike Benazir's nuclear policy, his set forth nuclear policy was to build civil and peaceful nuclear power, and with that vision, Sharif intensively used the integrated atomic programme for medical and economic purposes. His nuclear policy was viewed by experts as vintage Atoms for Peace program— the United States' 1950s program to use the nuclear energy for civil purposes, and to promote peaceful nuclear technology in the world as well.|$|E

2500|$|From {{the first}} days of the invasion, there had been {{incidents}} of German troops shooting Polish soldiers after they had surrendered, and killing civilians, especially Polish Jews. Some of these incidents were the work of units of the SS-VT, forerunner of the Waffen-SS, but some involved regular Army units. Rundstedt's biographer says: [...] "There is certainly no evidence that Rundstedt ever condoned, let alone encouraged, these acts." [...] Rundstedt told Reichenau that such actions did not have his <b>authorisation.</b> <b>In</b> fact, both Rundstedt and Blaskowitz complained to the Chief of Staff, General Franz Halder, about the Army Command's apparent tolerance of such incidents. Nevertheless, as commander of Army Group South, Rundstedt was legally responsible for the behaviour of his troops, and these incidents later formed part of the charges of war crimes against him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Managing {{security}} in distributed systems requires flexible and expressive authorisation models with support for conflict resolu-tion. Models {{need to be}} hierarchical but also non-monotonic supporting {{both positive and negative}} <b>authorisations.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we present an approach to resolve the authorisation conflicts that inevitably occur in such models, with administrator specified conflict resolution strategies (rules). Strategies can be global or applied to specific parts of a sys-tem and dynamically loaded for different applications. We use Courteous Logic Programs (CLP) for the specification and enforcement of strate-gies. Authorisation policies are translated into labelled rules in CLP and prioritised. The prioritisation is regulated by simple override rules spec-ified or selected by administrators. We demonstrate the capabilities of the approach by expressing the conflict resolution strategy for a moder-ately complex authorisation model that organises subjects and objects hierarchically. ...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction. That the {{requirement}} of a prior authorisation, as a precondition for the exercise of any economic activity, may restrict the freedom of establishment and the free provision of services is a truism. If an <b>authorisation</b> is required <b>in</b> the Member State where establishment is to take place or the service is to be offered (host Member State), then operators who lack such <b>authorisation</b> are <b>in</b> no right to proceed to the projected activity. Therefore, {{as soon as it}} is being accepted that the EU internal market rules are not only about discriminatory measures, but also cover mere restrictions, {{it comes as no surprise}} that national authorisation systems come to be scrutinized under the Internal Market rules...|$|R

Currently, we observe a tendency {{moving away from}} strict workflow modelling towards dynamic approaches supporting human interactions when deploying a workflow. One specific approach ensuring human-centric workflows is task delegation. Delegating a task may require an access to specific and potentially sensitive data {{that have to be}} secured and specified into <b>authorisation</b> policies. <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a modelling approach to secure delegation. In doing so, we define delegation protocols supporting specific constraints based on both workflow and access control systems. Moreover, we develop an advanced access control framework to integrate delegation constraints within existing policies. The novelty consists in the proactivity aspect of our framework to cope with dynamic delegation of authority <b>in</b> <b>authorisation</b> policies...|$|R
