5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent <b>actinide</b> elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent <b>actinide</b> with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous <b>actinide,</b> fermium. Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
5|$|Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} <b>actinide</b> metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the <b>actinide</b> curium, to the left of the <b>actinide</b> californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986°C, below that of curium (1340°C) but higher than that of californium (900°C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (2Pa).|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the <b>actinide</b> fermium, to the left of the <b>actinide</b> nobelium, and below the lanthanide thulium. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>actinides</b> will {{be mixed}} with a metal which will not form more <b>actinides,</b> for {{instance}} an alloy of <b>actinides</b> in a solid such as zirconia could be used.|$|R
5|$|Like the lanthanides, all <b>actinides</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} with halogens and chalcogens; however, the <b>actinides</b> react more easily. <b>Actinides,</b> {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most <b>actinides</b> exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other <b>actinides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Minor <b>actinides</b> - <b>Actinides</b> {{found in}} nuclear fuel, other than U and Pu: Np, Am, Cm.|$|R
5|$|There is much {{interest}} in the coordination chemistry of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the coordination chemistry of the actinides is heavily influenced by the <b>actinide</b> contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the <b>actinide</b> series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E
5|$|Development of self-glowing actinide-doped {{materials}} with durable crystalline matrices {{is a new}} area of <b>actinide</b> utilization as the addition of alpha-emitting radionuclides to some glasses and crystals may confer luminescence.|$|E

40|$|Safe {{molten salt}} {{reactors}} (MSR) can readily accommodate {{the burning of}} all fissile <b>actinides.</b> Only minor compromises associated with plutonium are required. The MSRs can dispose safely of <b>actinides</b> and long lived isotopes to result in safer and simpler waste. Disposing of <b>actinides</b> in MSRs does increase the source term of a safety optimized MSR. It is concluded that the burning and transmutation of <b>actinides</b> in MSRs {{can be done in}} a safe manner.

50|$|Some of {{the minor}} <b>actinides</b> {{have been found in}} fallout from bomb tests. See <b>Actinides</b> in the {{environment}} for details.|$|R
50|$|Because the fission {{to capture}} ratio of neutron {{cross-section}} with high energy or fast neutrons changes to favour fission {{for almost all}} of the <b>actinides,</b> including , fast reactors can use all of them for fuel. All <b>actinides,</b> including TRU or transuranium <b>actinides</b> can undergo neutron induced fission with unmoderated or fast neutrons. A fast reactor is more efficient for using plutonium and higher <b>actinides</b> as fuel. Depending on how the reactor is fueled it can either be used as a plutonium breeder or burner.|$|R
5|$|In 1945, Glenn Seaborg, an American scientist, {{made the}} {{suggestion}} that the <b>actinide</b> elements, like the lanthanides, were filling an f sub-level. Before this time the actinides were thought to be forming a fourth d-block row. Seaborg's colleagues advised him not to publish such a radical suggestion as it would most likely ruin his career. As Seaborg considered he did not then have a career to bring into disrepute, he published anyway. Seaborg's suggestion was found to be correct and he subsequently {{went on to win the}} 1951 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work in synthesizing <b>actinide</b> elements.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Glenn T. Seaborg, who {{devised the}} <b>actinide</b> concept that {{elements}} 89 to 103 formed an <b>actinide</b> series homologous to the lanthanide series from elements 57 to 71, predicted that element 103 (lawrencium) should be its final member {{and that the}} Lr3+ ion should be about as stable as Lu3+ in aqueous solution. It was not until decades later that element 103 was finally conclusively synthesized and this prediction was experimentally confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{promising}} <b>actinide</b> isotopes {{for nuclear}} power are thorium-232 and its product from the thorium fuel cycle, uranium-233.|$|E
25|$|The {{potentially}} useful components {{dealt with in}} nuclear reprocessing comprise specific <b>actinides</b> (plutonium, uranium, and some minor <b>actinides).</b> The lighter elements components include fission products, activation products, and cladding.|$|R
50|$|These fast {{reactors}} {{are better}} suited for the transmutation of other <b>actinides</b> than thermal reactors. Because thermal reactors use slow or moderated neutrons, the <b>actinides</b> that are not fissionable with thermal neutrons tend to absorb the neutrons instead of fissioning. This leads to buildup of heavier <b>actinides</b> and lowers the number of thermal neutrons available to continue the chain reaction.|$|R
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible <b>actinides</b> and are the only <b>actinides</b> that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the <b>actinides,</b> along with that of plutonium, as the self-heating and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other <b>actinides.</b> While the later <b>actinides</b> from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, as one would expect from periodic trends, the early <b>actinides</b> up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|R
5|$|The <b>actinide</b> series derives {{its name}} from the first element in the series, actinium. The {{informal}} chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of <b>actinide</b> chemistry to refer to any <b>actinide.</b> All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f electron shell, although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
5|$|The two layout forms {{originate}} from two graphic forms of {{presentation of the}} same periodic table. Historically, when the f-block was identified it was drawn below the existing table, with markings for its in-table location (this page uses dots or asterisks). Also, a common presentation is to put all 15 lanthanide and <b>actinide</b> columns below, while the f-block only has 14 columns. The fifteenth (rightmost) lanthanide and <b>actinide</b> are d-block elements, belonging to group 3, with scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, <b>actinide</b> chlorides, bromides, and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. <b>Actinide</b> hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|Like the lanthanides, the <b>actinides</b> form {{a family}} of {{elements}} with similar properties. Within the <b>actinides,</b> there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and transplutonium elements, which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most <b>actinides</b> are rare. The majority {{of them do not}} even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized <b>actinides</b> are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{fast reactor}} {{transmutation}} studies generally disregarded higher mass minor <b>actinides</b> beyond Cm- 246 due to various considerations including deficiencies in nuclear cross-section data. Although omission of these higher mass <b>actinides</b> does not significantly impact the neutronic calculations and fuel cycle performance parameters follow-on neutron dose calculations related to fuel recycling, transportation and handling are significantly impacted. This report shows that including the minor <b>actinides</b> in the equilibrium fast reactor calculations {{will increase the}} predicted neutron emission by about 30 %.

5|$|Americium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Am and atomic number 95. It is a transuranic {{member of the}} <b>actinide</b> series, in the periodic table located under the lanthanide element europium, and thus by analogy was named after the Americas.|$|E

Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium is a {{synthetic}} element with chemical symbol Md (formerly Mv) and atomic number 101. A metallic radioactive transuranic {{element in the}} <b>actinide</b> series, {{it is the first}} element that currently cannot be produced in macroscopic quantities through neutron bombardment of lighter elements. It is the third-to-last <b>actinide</b> and the ninth transuranic element. It can only be produced in particle accelerators by bombarding lighter elements with charged particles. A total of sixteen mendelevium isotopes are known, the most stable being 258Md with a half-life of 51days; nevertheless, the shorter-lived 256Md (half-life 1.17hours) is most commonly used in chemistry because it can be produced on a larger scale.|$|E
40|$|Investigation of {{behavior}} of <b>actinides</b> in alkaline media containing AL(III) showed that no aluminate complexes of <b>actinides</b> in oxidation states (IIII-VIII) were formed in alkaline solutions.

However, in precipitates contained <b>actinides</b> (IIV) <(VI), {{and to a}} lesser degree <b>actinides</b> (III), some interference of components takes place that is reflected in change of solid phase properties in comparison with pure components or their mechanical mixture. The interference decreases with rise of precipitation PH and at PH 14 is exhibited very feebly. In the case of NP(VII) the individual compound with AL(III) is obtained, however it is not aluminate of neptunium(VII), but neptunate of aluminium(III) similar to neptunates of other metals obtained earlier...|$|R

5000|$|This {{behavior}} of pure fission products with <b>actinides</b> removed, {{contrasts with the}} decay of fuel that still contains <b>actinides.</b> This fuel is produced in the so-called [...] "open" [...] (i.e., no nuclear reprocessing) nuclear fuel cycle. A number of these <b>actinides</b> have half lives in the missing range of about 100 to 200,000 years, causing some difficulty with storage plans in this time-range for open cycle non-reprocessed fuels.|$|R
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} <b>actinide</b> metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the <b>actinide</b> uranium, to the left of the <b>actinide</b> plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has been determined to melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the <b>actinide</b> concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the <b>actinide</b> series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided {{a good source of}} royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists in a written statement known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E
