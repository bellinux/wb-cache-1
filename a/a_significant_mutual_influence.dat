40|$|The dermal {{penetration}} of compounds {{may be influenced}} by other compounds when mixtures are presented to the skin. Plant extracts, often used in cosmeceuticals, are complex mixtures of wanted bio-actives as well as undesirable impurities like nanoparticles and mycotoxines. A major question is if plant bio-actives (like spilanthol) can significantly alter the {{dermal penetration}} of other compounds which can be actives (like testosterone) or impurities (like mycotoxins). If so, the qualification assessment of the product quality needs to include this influence within the Quality-by-Design strategy. Therefore, the concentration-dependent penetration promoting effect of spilanthol was investigated on the three CART transdermal model compounds i. e. caffeine, ibuprofen and testosterone [1]. It was shown that spilanthol has a compound and concentration dependent penetration enhancing effect. No significant penetration enhancing effect for ibuprofen has been observed. However, with increasing spilanthol concentration (from 0 up to 1 %, m/V), the permeability of caffeine increases, resulting in an enhancing ratio (ER) of 4. 60 ± 0. 49 (mean ± SEM, n= 4). For testosterone, a maximal penetration enhancing concentration of 0. 5 % spilanthol was found (ER = 4. 13 ± 0. 44 (mean ± SEM, n= 3)). Our findings with these model compounds are also confirmed with mycotoxins [2]. In conclusion, the existence of <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>influence</b> of compounds towards skin penetration should always be considered as part of the functional quality evaluation or in topical product development.

Its point of departure is the <b>significant</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>influence</b> of the Western worldview and sciences. It shows how the intertwined construction of science and worldview has modelled our conceptual selfunderstanding, our being and our acting. The issue is considered from a philosophical-anthropological stance, with due attention being given to past delineations and future alternatives. It is argued that, {{within the framework of}} the Western worldview, self-realisation is considered essential for being a human self. There is a tacit, yet conscious, agreement that the way to attain self-realisation is through the gradual development of two potentials: the rational potential and the potential for self-expression. The authors recognise that both are indispensable in forming the human self, but point out that the nature of the development of these potentials can conceptually be misinterpreted, causing 1 problems on the individual, societal and ecological levels. In order to prevent the development of the rational potential and the potential for self-expression from receiving undue emphasis, two more potentials are introduced on the conceptual level, to wit the ethical potential and the potential to be situated in and oriented towards a larger and meaningful whole. The assumption is that bringing these to the fore will also affect the very definition of self-realisation...|$|R

We find that these drug-carrier interactions {{do not conform to}} the traditional picture of long-time retention of the drug within a hydrophobic core of the dendrimer carrier. Rather, 5 FU, which is moderately soluble in its own right, experiences weak, transient chattering interactions all over the dendrimer, mediated through multiple short-lived hydrogen bonding and close contact events. We find that charge {{on the periphery of the}} dendrimer actually has a negative effect on the frequency of drug-carrier interactions due to a counterion screening effect that has not previously been observed. However, charge is nevertheless an important feature since neutral dendrimers are shown to have <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>mutual</b> attraction that can lead to clustering or agglomeration.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the main factors that have contributed to the decline in aggregate energy intensity of the Tunisian economy, during the period 1980 – 2007. Using the Logarithmic Mean Division Index (LMDI) decomposition method, we decompose the total changes in energy intensity into inter-fuel substitution effects, technological effects, and structural effects. The decomposition analysis is carried out at two levels of sectoral disaggregation (3 sectors and 13 sub-sectors) and uses three energy sources: petroleum, natural gas, and electricity. Our results show that the main contributor to the decline in energy intensity of the Tunisian economy throughout the period studied is the technological effect. This result was confirmed when we decomposed the energy intensity changes in the industrial and service sectors. On the other hand, the inter-fuel substitution effect contributed to increasing energy intensity, but without affecting its general downward trend.

The aim of this work is a comparison of two alternative approaches of risk measurement. Twenty years long time series of 30 stocks' returns from 1991 to 2010 are first used to analyze a relationship between average realized returns {{and standard deviations of}} the returns.

Development of various performance benchmarks has allowed investors to quantitatively assess various portfolio alternatives and has established that diversification can reduce systematic risk.

The results of the synchronous expression of TGF-a and EGFR suggest that parathyroid adenomas may regulate their growth by an autocrine mechanism. Presence of apoptic cells and immunoreactivity to Ki- 67, bcl- 2 and p 23 were studied in the same cases of parathyroid adenomas. All of the adnomas contained Ki- 67 immunoreactive cells.

The stellar chaotic phase preceding the instability of the triple system and the wide oscillations in eccentricity and inclination of the companion star due to the high mutual inclination between the companion and the singleton would quickly eject planets orbiting the binary in S-type orbits. Methods: We perform numerical simulations of the dynamical evolution of hierarchical triple star systems with planets hosted around the primary star of the inner binary. Different values of mutual inclination, binary separation and singleton initial semimajor axis are explored in a statistical way. Results: We find that <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>mutual</b> inclination im between the singleton and the binary is a key factor for instability of the planetary system. When im is larger than ~ 40 ° the {{fraction of}} planets in the binary surviving the chaotic phase of the triple declines dramatically. The combination of eccentricity and inclination oscillations of the binary companion induced by the secular perturbations of the singleton and the sequence of close encounters preceding the ejection of one star fully destabilize a planetary system extending beyond 1 AU from the star. For im around 90 ° the percentage of surviving planets is lower than 20 % for all binaries with a semimajor axis smaller than 200 AU.

We {{explore the}} {{dynamical}} {{evolution of a}} planet that is embedded in a circumstellar disk, {{as part of a}} binary system where the orbital plane of the companion star is significantly tilted with respect to the initial disk plane. Aims: Our aim is to test whether the planet remains within the disk and continues to migrate towards the star in a Type I/II mode, in spite of the secular perturbations of the companion star. Our findings, could explain why observed exoplanets have significant inclination in relation to the equatorial plane of their host star. Methods: We used two different smoothed particle hydrodynamic codes, VINE and PHANTOM, to model the evolution of a star+disk+planet system with a companion star over time. Results: After an initial coupled evolution, the inclinations of the disk and the planet begin to differ significantly. The period of oscillation of the disk inclination, in relation to the initial plane, becomes shorter for the planet, which evolves independently after about 104 yr, following a perturbed N-body behaviour. However, the planet continues to migrate towards the star because, during its orbital motion, it crosses the disk plane, and friction with the gas causes angular momentum loss. Conclusions: In a significantly inclined binary system, disks and planets are not dynamically coupled for small binary separations but evolve almost independently. The planet abandons the disk, and because of the onset of <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>mutual</b> inclination, it interacts with the gas only when its orbit intersects the disk plane.

The case showing a rise in the icteric index is extremely rare, and {{there is not a single}} case that presented icteric sign as the result of the estimation of total bilirubin, cholesterol, and alkaliphosphatase. 4. Looking over the entire cases, the disturbances in the liver function have been recognized in 23. 8 per cent; namely, 12. 7 per cent in the minimal cases; 29. 2 per cent in the moderately advanced cases; and 45. 5 per cent in the far advanced cases. Although there is a mutual relationship between symptoms and the liver disturbance, there can be found not one case showing a critical disturbance. 5. From these results it is believed that the functional disturbance of the liver in lung tuberculosis is a mild symptom consisted mainly of the disturbance in the protein metabolism, caused by the chronic infection. 6. As for the routine work in the examination of the liver function in lung tuberculosis it is justifiable to conduct examinations of the serum protein picture, especially the picture of albumin and A/G, Gros' reaction, Takata' reaction, CCF, and Ch-E or TTT tests, and BSP test if necessary.
