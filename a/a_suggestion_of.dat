5|$|Yeats is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} twentieth century key English language poets. He was a Symbolist poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols is usually something physical that is both itself and <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.|$|E

Sarah Jane declines a second chance of travelling in the TARDIS, having finally decided {{to move on with}} her life and stop waiting for the Doctor. Mickey says he would like to join the TARDIS crew, <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> which Sarah Jane approves. She then asks Rose to stay with the Doctor, and to find her one day if she needs to. Sarah Jane then gets a chance to part properly with the Doctor, who leaves her with a brand new K9 as a parting gift.|$|E
5|$|Corona Australis' {{location}} {{near the}} Milky Way means that galaxies are uncommonly seen. NGC 6768 is a magnitude 11.2 object 35′ south of IC 1297. It {{is made up}} of two galaxies merging, one of which is an elongated elliptical galaxy of classification E4 and the other a lenticular galaxy of classification S0. IC 4808 is a galaxy of apparent magnitude 12.9 located on the border of Corona Australis with the neighbouring constellation of Telescopium and 3.9 degrees west-southwest of Beta Sagittarii. However, amateur telescopes will only show <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> its spiral structure. It is 1.9 arcminutes by 0.8 arcminutes. The central area of the galaxy does appear brighter in an amateur instrument, which shows it to be tilted northeast-southwest.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> , the {{antennae}} of the Submillimeter Array, a radio-wave astronomical observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, {{are arranged}} on four nested Reuleaux triangles. Placing the antennae on a curve of constant width causes the observatory {{to have the}} same spatial resolution in all directions, and provides a circular observation beam. As the most asymmetric curve of constant width, the Reuleaux triangle leads to the most uniform coverage of the plane for the Fourier transform of the signal from the array. The antennae may be moved from one Reuleaux triangle to another for different observations, according to the desired angular resolution of each observation. The precise placement of the antennae on these Reuleaux triangles was optimized using a neural network. In some places the constructed observatory departs from the preferred Reuleaux triangle shape because that shape was not possible within the given site.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{factorization}} of Euclidean domains {{is useful}} in many applications. For example, the unique factorization of the Gaussian integers is convenient in deriving formulae for all Pythagorean triples and in proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. Unique factorization was also {{a key element in}} an attempted proof of Fermat's Last Theorem published in 1847 by Gabriel Lamé, the same mathematician who analyzed the efficiency of Euclid's algorithm, based on <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> Joseph Liouville. + Bn + Cn = 0 | journal = J. Math. Pures Appl. | volume = 12 | pages = 172–184}} Lamé's approach required the unique factorization of numbers of the form x + ωy, where x and y are integers, and ω = e2iπ/n is an nth root of 1, that is, ωn = 1. Although this approach succeeds for some values of n (such as n=3, the Eisenstein integers), in general such numbers do not factor uniquely. This failure of unique factorization in some cyclotomic fields led Ernst Kummer to the concept of ideal numbers and, later, Richard Dedekind to ideals.|$|E

Tenniel apparently drew the Hatter to resemble Carter, on <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> Carroll's. However, {{it is unlikely that}} Carter was the model for The Hatter, and {{there is no evidence that}} Carroll ever invited Tenniel to Oxford for any purpose.|$|E
25|$|The {{ground was}} built in 1876 as a race course. There was no {{permanent}} pavilion until 1892, when a ‘grand stand’ was built according to <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> Mr. P A Templer, the then Secretary of the Galle Municipal Council. Eventually the racing ceased and the ground was used for cricket matches more than races. In 1927, the ground was officially declared as a cricket stadium.|$|E
25|$|The first {{congregation}} (on {{the morning}} of 4 March) focused on introductory matters, picking three assistants to the Camerlengo, the recent Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization, and <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> a message of appreciation to Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, with 13 cardinals giving speeches (simply in the order they had requested to speak). The second congregation (the evening of 4 March) featured the preaching {{of the first of}} two required meditations by Father Raniero Cantalamessa and nine more addresses.|$|E

He also makes peace with Galactus by rescuing current herald Nova (Frankie Raye) from the Skrulls. Galactus declares the Surfer's exile ended.

25|$|However, {{there is}} another {{explanation}} {{for the creation of}} the depression. The Padma has been changing its course over the centuries. In Ven den Brouck's map of Bengal, prepared in 1660, the main channel of the Padma is shown as flowing through Faridpur-Bakharganj, but there also is <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> another, possibly earlier channel. This channel runs through Rampur Boalia in Rajshahi, Chalan Beel, Dhaleswari and Buriganga before meeting the Meghna. At that time the Jamuna was virtually non-existent and the Brahmaputra used to flow through its old channel.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} voice shifts between Munira {{and the other}} characters describing the events of their lives, and an omniscient narrator. There is also <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> a communal {{narrative voice}}, as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial. This communal voice is at work through the various Gikuyu songs with which Ngugi intersperses the novel; {{there is a great}} reliance placed on such songs, which help tell, through the oral tradition of linking of proverbs and fables, the history of Ilmorog and Kenya before colonial intervention.|$|E

Under the new process, Jupiter V continued as Amalthea, Jupiter XIII was named Leda in accordance with <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> Kowal's, and all previous proposals for the seven satellites VI-XII were abandoned in favor of new names, in accordance with a scheme suggested by the German philologist Jürgen Blunck where prograde moons received names ending in 'a' and retrograde moons received names ending in 'e'.|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} from the service, Lord Haig devoted {{the rest of his}} life to the welfare of ex-servicemen, making many speeches (which did not come easily to him) and answering all letters in his own hand. Haig pushed for the amalgamation of organisations, quashing <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> a separate organisation for officers, into The British Legion which was founded in June 1921. He visited South Africa in 1921, Newfoundland in 1924, and Canada in 1925 (visits to Australia and New Zealand were being planned when he died) to promote ex-servicemen's interests. He was instrumental in setting up the Haig Fund for the financial assistance of ex-servicemen and the Haig Homes charity to ensure they were properly housed; both continue to provide help many years after they were created.|$|E
25|$|There are no updated {{and precise}} figures for labor productivity, {{measured}} in employees per 1,000 connections. However, the Ministry of Water and Power indicated a {{poor performance in}} the country's major cities. The ADB found an average of 5.6 employees per 1,000 connections in Karachi. In Lahore and Rawalpindi, labor productivity is indicated lower at 9.5 and 12.7 employees per 1,000 connections, respectively. At the 2005 workshop, between 6 and 27 employees per 1,000 connections in major cities were reported (see table 3). Tynan and Kingdom propose a best practice target of 5 employees per 1,000 connections in developing countries. However it should be mentioned that equally to NRW, this target is <b>a</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>of</b> the authors, which is not established as official best practice target among professionals.|$|E
