40|$|Preface Dear Friends of the Laboratories, From {{the very}} start {{we can tell you}} that 2004 has been a good year. Three of our PhD {{students}} have completed their theses and taken over attractive jobs in the Swiss industry. An equivalent number of young researchers <b>also</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> last year for PhD studies, so the size of our research staff, {{as well as that of}} the permanent staff, has remained more or less unchanged on a comparably high level. Numerous projects are being carried out by these approximately 30 researchers, as a rule in close cooperation with Swiss institutions such as the Bundesamt für Energie (BfE), and with Swiss and foreign industry and utilities. Many of these projects are strongly application related. For example, a new KTI project has been installed by the Power Systems Laboratory together with the spin-off company Plexim, dealing with algorithms for real-time simulation. However, we are proud to say that we also managed to find financing partners for visionary projects with a long-term perspective of more than the usual three o...|$|R

40|$|A {{ground-based}} {{remote sensing}} system - SMART (Surface Measurements for Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) - was deployed during both the SAFARI- 2000 and the ARREX- 1999 dry season campaigns. The measurement site is the Skukuza airport. The operation period for 1999 is from August 16 to September 10. The main instruments include shortwave (approximately 0. 28 - 2. 8 micrometers) and longwave (approximately 4 - 50 micrometers) broadband radiometers, a shadow-band radiometer, a micro-pulse lidar, and a microwave radiometer. We also did some measurements of solar spectral flux by using an ASD spectrometer. The operation period for 2000 is from August 15 to September 22. This time we added a few new features to the SMART system: a solar tracker for direct and diffuse components of solar fluxes; the scanning capability to the microwave radiometer; a whole sky camera for documenting the sky conditions every minute; and a mini-weather station for atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction. A surface SSFR (Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer) from NASA Ames <b>also</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> for the measurements. This is a unique data set with reasonably long observational period and high accuracy. The data show good correlation with the local weather patterns. We also see diurnal change and some special events, such as fierce fires nearby. To quantify the surface radiative forcing of biomass burning aerosols, many pyranometers, pyrgeometers, and pyrheliometers measure the global, direct, and diffuse irradiance at the surface. These fluxes combining with the collocated optical thickness retrievals from sun photometer (or shadow-band radiometer), the solar radiative forcing, proportional to delta F/delta tau, can be investigated. Integrated with measurements of other instruments at the site, these data sets will serve as "ground truth" for the satellite measurements and modeling...|$|R

The road divides momentarily {{at the intersection of}} State Road 30, which has controlled turn lanes in the divider, but then turns back into an undivided two lane road as it curves northwest. At Buckeye Nursery Road, US 27 gets the name East Hampton Springs Avenue. East Hampton Springs curves from northwest to southwest once again, and the straight west at Washington Street. The street name changes from East Hampton Springs Avenue to West Hampton Springs Avenue at US 221(hidden SR 55) but <b>also</b> <b>joins</b> <b>U.S.</b> Truck Route 221.

US 19-27 also {{continues to}} carry US Truck 221 until it reaches County Road 359A (Wright Road), but also continues to take SR 20 with it heading straight northwest through the rest of Taylor County, and then Madison County, where it intersects County Road 150. US 19 breaks away in Capps onto State Road 57 on its way through Monticello, but not before resuming a westward direction at the Madison-Jefferson County Line. In Tallahassee, the road becomes the 1957-built Apalachee Parkway, a major east-west thoroughfare.

60|$|My {{elder brother}} {{occasionally}} accompanied {{us on our}} egg-hunting visits to the lagoons, and he <b>also</b> <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> in our rides to {{the two or three}} streams where we used to go to bathe and fish; but he took no part in our games and pastimes with the gaucho boys: they were beneath him. We ran races on our ponies, and when there were race-meetings in our neighbourhood my father would give us a little money to go and enter our ponies in a boys' race. We rarely won when there were any stakes, as the native boys were too clever on horseback for us, and had all sorts of tricks to prevent us from winning, even when our ponies were better than theirs. We also went tinamou, or partridge, catching, and sometimes we had sham fights with lances, or long canes with which we supplied the others. These games were very rough, and one day when we were armed, not with canes but long straight pliant green poplar boughs we had cut for the purpose, we were having a running fight, when one of the boys got in a rage with me for some reason and, dropping behind, then coming quietly up, gave me a blow on the face and head with his stick which sent me flying off my pony. They all dashed on, leaving me there to pick myself up, and mounting my pony I went home crying with pain and rage. The blow had fallen on my head, but the pliant stick had come down over my face from the forehead to the chin, taking the skin off. On my way back I met our shepherd and told him my story, and said I would go to the boy's parents to tell them. He advised me not to do so; he said I must learn to take my own part, and if any one injured me and I wanted him punished I must do the punishing myself. If I made any fuss and complaint about it I should only get laughed at, and he would go scot free. What, then, was I to do? I asked, seeing that he was older and stronger than myself, and had his heavy whip and knife to defend himself against attack.|$|R
