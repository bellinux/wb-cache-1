As a consequence, the velocity of the soliton begins {{to depend on the}} amplitude and frequency of the injected radiation. It has been found that if the frequency of the external signal coincides with the frequency of the dispersive waves emitted by solitons in a laser cavity with lumped intracavity elements, a mechanism for controlling long-range soliton interaction occurs. This mechanism is related to the interference between the injected wave and the dispersive waves involved in the strong long-range interaction between solitons.

30|$|Variable {{selection}} {{is the process}} of selecting an optimum subset of input variables from the set of potentially useful variables which may be available in a given problem. Different researchers have applied variety of feature selection methods, such as genetic algorithm (El Alami 2009), principal component analysis (Zhang and Zhang 2002) and stepwise regression analysis (SRA) to select the key factors in their forecasting systems. Among them, in recent years some researcher have used SRA for input variable selection in the field of stock market forecasting and they have obtained very promising results (Chang and Liu 2008). So, in this paper we adopt stepwise regression to analyze and select the variables <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence,</b> to improve the forecasting accuracy of the system. Stepwise regression method determines the set of factors that most closely determine the dependent variable. This task is carried out by means of the repetition of a variable selection.|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} stage, we use SRA to {{eliminate}} low impact factors and choose {{the most influential}} ones. The statistical software SPSS was used for applying stepwise regression analysis in this research. After the elimination process, two factors of: open and close price were selected. The selected variables will be inputted into intelligent models. In third stage, SGF is applied on collected data to make our raw data clean and smooth. It {{is obvious that the}} noisy data and outliers will cause a bad training process <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence,</b> it will decrease the forecasting performance. By applying SGF smoothing filter, not only we do not eliminate the outliers but also we change them into suitable and useful data. We use trail-and-error process for determining the size of number of clusters, after examination of different number of clusters such as 2, 3 and 4 we obtained that in our cases the suitable number of clusters (k) that provides minimum MAPE values for test data of IBM.|$|E

Assumptions about the possibility of the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; 5. The representations of marginalized groups.

In order to present a comprehensive exploration, the thesis deals with both Danto's philosophy of art and philosophy {{of the history of}} art. Within this discourse it aspires to evaluate Danto's end of art thesis and its appropriateness. In the first part, Danto's idea of the artworld, that is his contextual and historical theory of art, is examined. This includes the exploration of historical circumstances within which his art definition was developed, the notion of his essentialist and historic approach, and main features of his well-known technique of comparing indiscernible counterparts. The second part is devoted to Danto's philosophy of the history of art, especially to his Hegelian turn and what of such shift further stems. The third part explores the end of art thesis itself <b>and,</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequence,</b> the posthistorical condition of art. The final part consists of two sections that attemp to critically evaluate both Danto's art definition and his end of art thesis.

This study examines Block encryption algorithm such as: Blowfish algorithm and Cellular Automata. Blowfish encryption algorithm is one of the fastest Block symmetrical key encryption algorithms. In this study it is tried to increase the speed of algorithm using Cellular Automata instead of F function of Blowfish encryption algorithm, decreasing F function calculations <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> <b>consequences</b> decreasing the delay of F function of algorithm. Cellular Automata is used because of its ability to produce random numbers. It should be mentioned that is this study in order to increase the security, several rules are added to Cellular Automata.

The improved algorithm has been compared to block encryption algorithms AES, DES and Blowfish, regarding speed. This algorithm was implemented by MATLAB software and Active HDL software then santeze time and used memory are measuring by ISE 13. 2 software.
