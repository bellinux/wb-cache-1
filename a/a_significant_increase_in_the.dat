40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} blocking the angiotensin II AT- 1 receptor by the systemic administration of candesartan on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 in the sclera and choroid of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. METHODS: New Zealand rabbits were divided into 3 groups, as follows: GI, which was fed a rabbit standard diet; GII, which was fed a hypercholesterolemic diet; and GIII, which received hypercholesterolemic diet plus candesartan. Samples of the rabbits' sclera and choroid were then studied by hematoxylin-eosin staining and histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression. RESULTS: Histological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sclera and choroid revealed that macrophages were rarely present in GI, and GII had significantly increased macrophage numbers compared to GIII. Moreover, in GII, the sclera and choroid morphometry showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> thickness in comparison to GI and GIII. GIII presented <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> thickness in relation to GI. Sclera and choroid immunohistochemical analysis for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression revealed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> immunoreactivity in GII in relation to GI and GIII. GIII showed <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> immunoreactivity in relation to GI. CONCLUSION: Candesartan reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and consequently macrophage accumulation in the sclera and choroid of hypercholesterolemic rabbits...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{diseases}} predominantly afflict women, {{suggesting a}} role for female hormones in the disease process. However, {{little is known about}} the role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in regulating mandibular condylar cartilage growth. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of altered estrogen levels on the mandibular condylar cartilage in wild type (WT) and ER beta Knockout (KO) mice. Materials and methods 21 -day-old female WT (n =  37) and ER beta KO mice (n =  36) were either sham operated or ovariectomized, and treated with either placebo or estradiol. The mandibular condylar cartilage was evaluated by histomorphometry, proliferation was analyzed by double ethynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine/bromodeoxyuridine (EdU/BrdU) labeling, and assays on gene and protein expression of chondrocyte maturation markers were performed. ResultsIn WT mice, ovariectomy caused <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> mandibular condylar cartilage cell numbers, <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sox 9 expression and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> proliferation compared with sham operated WT mice. In contrast, ovariectomy did not cause any of these effects in the ER beta KO mice. Estrogen replacement treatment in ovariectomized WT mice caused <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> decrease in ER alpha expression and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sost expression compared with ovariectomized mice treated with placebo. Estrogen replacement treatment in ovariectomized ER beta KO mice caused <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Col 2 expression, no change in ER alpha expression, and <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sost expression.

During the 12th century, the Byzantines provided their model of early humanism as a renaissance of interest in classical authors. In Eustathius of Thessalonica, Byzantine humanism found its most characteristic expression. In philosophy, there was resurgence of classical learning not seen since the 7th century, characterised by <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publication of commentaries on classical works.

5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate, which probably resulted in <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of plebeian senators.|$|E

The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E
