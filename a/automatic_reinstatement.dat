40|$|Canada Pension Plan Disability {{provides}} {{benefits to}} individuals who meet the contributory and medical eligibility criteria. Although few beneficiaries are expected to leave the benefit and return to work, some do recover from their disabilities and regain {{the ability to work}} beyond the level the program deems capable of no longer being eligible for benefits. This study analyzes Statistics Canada data and draws on interviews with disability agencies and academics to inform our understanding of institutional disincentives to work. The issues raised through the interview and data analysis lead to the formulation of policy options, which are assessed against a set of criteria. The recommendations include revamping current communications and reforming the <b>Automatic</b> <b>Reinstatement</b> policy as short-term options. Exploring a revised earnings exemption scheme is proposed for the longer term...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, Canada {{offers a}} unique {{opportunity}} to study the effects of vocational rehabilitation on exit rates from the disability rolls as well as subsequent employment. Canada’s disability insurance program, the Canada Pension Plan Disability (CPPD) program, did not introduce its vocational rehabilitation program, the CPPD-VR program, until the mid- 1990 s. Moreover, when it did introduce this program it did not have any other incentives (e.g., allowable earnings, trial work periods, or <b>automatic</b> <b>reinstatement</b> options for disability beneficiaries who left the disability rolls) available to disability beneficiaries that might increase their employment. However, the CPPD program began to change its strategy and approach for facilitating the attachment of its beneficiaries to the labor market by beginning to introduce these incentives in 2001 (Campolieti and Riddell 2012). Consequently, there is a short window available in the Canadian data where only vocational rehabilitation services were available to disability beneficiaries.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, {{keyless entry}} systems are widely adopted for vehicle {{immobilizer}} systems due to both advantages {{of security and}} convenience. Keyless entry systems could overcome brute-force key guessing attack, statistics attack and masquerade attack, however, they can't prevent from thieves stealing behavior. In this paper, we proposed a new architecture try to improve the existent flaws. The integration of the keyless entry system and the fingerprint identification technology is more suitable to implement on the portable transponder to achieve higher security needs. We also adopt and modify AES security protocol for life expectancy and security of the portable transponder. In addition, the identification of a driver's fingerprint makes the service of <b>automatic</b> <b>reinstatement</b> of a driver's preferences become possible. Our design can satisfy not only the three kinds of previous illegal attacks, but also the stealing situation. Furthermore, many practical factors, such as costs, life expectancy and performance, have been well considered {{in the design of}} portable transponder. Keywords—Keyless entry-system, fingerprint identification, AES security protocol, vehicle immobilizer system. C I...|$|E
30|$|A few policy {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to increase the attachment of disability beneficiaries to the labor market. On the one hand, disability insurance programs can allow disability beneficiaries to engage in work activities and not terminate their benefits {{as long as they do}} not cross an earnings threshold. This sort of policy (referred to as benefit offset in the U.S. and an earnings disregard in Canada) can allow disability beneficiaries to earn some labor market income as well as test the waters to determine whether they can work in a sustained fashion. These sorts of initiatives are often bundled with trial work periods and <b>automatic</b> <b>reinstatement</b> options, where if an individual leaves the disability rolls but then determines they are unable to maintain their employment because of their disability they can resume receiving a disability pension. There is some evidence that such incentives can increase the employment of disability beneficiaries (Campolieti and Riddell 2012; Kostøl and Mogstad 2013) as well as their exit rates from the disability rolls (Kostøl and Mogstad 2013).|$|E
30|$|Our {{estimates}} {{of the effect of}} VR are also quite interesting in comparison to estimates from studies looking at financial and non-financial incentives to increase the attachment of disability beneficiaries to the labor market. Campolieti and Riddell (2012) found that the introduction of the CPPD earnings disregard (similar to the benefit offset in the SSDI program in the U.S.) increased the employment of disability beneficiaries. Campolieti and Riddell’s preferred difference-in-difference estimates show that the introduction of the earnings disregard and <b>automatic</b> <b>reinstatement</b> option increase the employment of men by 5.1 percentage points and women by 9.5 percentage points, relative to the Quebec Pension Plan Disability program. One concern about the introduction of such incentives is the increased uptake of benefits, which is also referred to as the induced entry effect (e.g. Hoynes and Moffitt 1999). However, Campolieti and Riddell (2012) did not find any evidence of the increased receipt of disability benefits in their analysis of flows onto the disability rolls. Kostøl and Mogstad (2013) looked at the introduction of a benefit offset in Norway, which is very similar to the benefit offset used in the SSDI program, exploiting a discontinuity created by the eligibility rules for these new incentives, and found that there was a five to six percentage point increase in employment after the introduction of the benefit offset. They also found that the benefit offset could generate program savings of about 3.5 to 5.0 percent of costs of SSDI benefits.|$|E
