5|$|Increases in {{the number}} of CAT operations, and {{in the number}} of {{airports}} they operate from, has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class <b>A</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace. Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and Wales, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class <b>A</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class <b>A</b> <b>controlled</b> airspace there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.|$|E

It may include greenhouses, test grounds, an herbarium, an arboretum, and other departments. It maintains a scientific as well as a plant-growing staff, and publication is one of its major modes of expression.|$|E

It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
