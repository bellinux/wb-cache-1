40|$|AbstractTolerance greatly {{influences}} the quality, process planning, measurement, cost, and assembly of products. How {{to use an}} effective method to interpret tolerance semantics {{is becoming more and}} more important. Traditional directed graph theory cannot interpret the assembly relationship clearly. This paper presents an <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> modeling method based on generalized directed graph. The construction process of tolerance model, reference frame and key features related to geometric shape and dimension were defined. Then <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> relationship between key features by generalized directed graph was described and a unit vector was used to represent <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> model. The elements of the vectors denote the assembly relationship between function vertexes. Therefore, generalized chain and generalized adjacent matrix were defined, all of which formed the concept of generalized directed graph. The <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> model structure was formalized by generalized adjacent matrix. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested using an example. The result indicates that the method is a reasonable way to interpret the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> semantics and the proposed method has very important applications for assembly plan...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMachine {{tool spindle}} {{is among the}} most precise {{components}} which require both high accuracy and high repeatability. It has been an issue how to distribute components’ tolerances in order to reduce production cost while keep the tolerance target under control. This paper investigates the method for tolerance re-distribution of a spindle in order to keep its high <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The dimensional chain of the spindle is first constructed to analyze the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance.</b> While the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> is out of the target, the reverse process that re-distributes the target tolerance to each component is investigated such that the target can be satisfied and controlled. Tightening tolerances of spindle parts is the most straightforward approach to reduce the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> that, however, increases manufacturing cost. An approach to re-distribute the components’ tolerance based on the IT precision grade is then assigned and analyzed. This approach, however, still fails to achieve the required tolerance target. The “negative tolerancing” approach is then employed. The retaining ring of the spindle severs as the adjusting component which carries “negative tolerance” to compensate the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The result shows that the tolerance target can be achieved using this approach without paying high manufacturing cost...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Tolerance {{analysis}} {{is a major}} link between design and manufacturing. An assembly or a part should be designed based on its functions, manufacturing processes, desired product quality, and manufacturing cost. <b>Assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis performed {{at the design stage}} can reduce potential manufacturing and assembly problems. Several commonly used <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis models and their limitations are reviewed in this research. Also, a new <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis model is developed to improve the limitations of the existing <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis models. The new model elucidates the impact of the flatness symbol (one of the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) specification symbols) and reduces design variables into simple mathematical equations. The new model is based on beta distribution of part dimensions. In addition, a group of manufacturing variables, including quality factor, process tolerance, and mean shift, is integrated in the new <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis model. A computer integrated system has been developed to handle four support systems for the performance of tolerance analysis in a single computer application. These support systems are: 1) the CAD drawing system, 2) the Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) specification system, 3) the <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis model, and 4) the tolerance database operating under the Windows environment. Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) is applied to exchange the data between two different window applications, resulting in improvement of information transfer between the support systems. In this way, the user is able to use this integrated system to select a GD&T specification, determine a critical assembly dimension and tolerance, and access the tolerance database during the design stage simultaneously. Examples are presented to illustrate the application of the integrated tolerance analysis system...|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} mechanical assemblies, <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> {{design is}} an important issue which must be seriously considered by designers. Assembly tolerances reflect functional requirements of assembling, which can be used to control assembling qualities and production costs. This paper proposes a new method for designing <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> networks of mechanical assemblies. The method establishes the assembly structure tree model of an assembly based on its product structure tree model. On this basis, assembly information model and assembly relation model are set up based on polychromatic sets (PS) theory. According to the two models, the systems of location relation equations and interference relation equations are established. Then, using methods of topologically related surfaces (TTRS) theory and variational geometric constraints (VGC) theory, three VGC reasoning matrices are constructed. According to corresponding relations between VGCs and <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> types, the reasoning matrices of tolerance types are also established by using contour matrices of PS. Finally, an exemplary product is used to construct its <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> networks and meanwhile to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

One {{way to reduce the}} assembled variation is to tighten tolerance specifications of each component that, however, increases product cost. This paper investigates the effect of grouping for components with uniform and normal distributions by the developed “grouped random assembly” method. It is a method that first sorts and divides components into several groups and then assemble each group with corresponding group in order to reducing <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Distribution of resultant dimension based on the “grouped random assembly” approach is then analyzed. The results showed that, without changing components’ tolerance specifications, <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> depends on the number of grouping. Tolerance stack-up can be dramatically reduced with a suitable grouping strategy. The merit of this research is to develop a theoretical foundation for the grouped random assembly method. The results lead to a design for assembly strategy that <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> can be effectively reduced without tightening components’ tolerances...|$|E

This research provides a review of several commonly used <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis models and evaluation of their limitations.

40|$|The nozzle-to-case joint on the Shuttle SRM (as {{redesigned}} {{after the}} Challenger accident) features an adhesive sealant filling and bonding the joint, with a wiper O-ring {{to prevent the}} adhesive from reaching and disabling the closure O-ring. Flawless implementation of that joint design would ensure that hot, corrosive propellant combustion gases never reach the closure O-ring. However, understanding the flow field related to bonding defects is prudent. A comprehensive test program was conducted to quantify such flow fields and associated heating environments. A two-dimensional, full-scale model represented 65 inches of the nozzle joint, using unheated air as the test medium, in a blowdown mode. Geometry variations modeled RSRM <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerances,</b> and two types of bonding defects: pullaways and blowholes. A range {{of the magnitude of}} each type defect was tested. Also a range of operational parameters was tested, representative of the RSRM flow environment, including duplication of RSRM Mach and Reynolds numbers. Extensive instrumentation was provided to quantify pressures, heat rates, and velocities. The resulting data established that larger geometric defects cause larger pressure and larger heating, at the closure O-ring region. Velocity trends were not so straight-forward. Variations in <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerances</b> did not generally affect flow fields or heating. Operational parameters affected flow fields and heating as might be expected, increasing density or velocity increased heating. Complete details of this test effort are presented...|$|R

40|$|Geometric feature {{variations}} are {{the result}} of variations in the shape, orientation or location of part features as defined in ANSI Y 14. 5 M- 1982 tolerance standard [ANSI 1982]. When such feature variations occur on the mating surfaces between components of an assembly, they affect the variation of the completed assembly. The geometric feature variations accumulate statistically and propagate kinematically in a similar manner to the dimensional variations of the components in the assembly. The Direct Linearization Method (DLM) for <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis provides a method for estimating variations and assembly rejects, caused by the dimensional variations of the components in an assembly. So far, no generalized approach has been developed to include all geometric feature variations in a computer-aided tolerance analysis system.

40|$|Task {{characteristics}} such as visual and manual demands influence the postures employed and the muscular load during task execution. According to ergonomic experts at a car assembly plant, these demands are difficult to predict during product and process development and can easily be underestimated. One such task with combined visual and manual demands is the application of deco-tape to the door frame of cars. This precision task requires the exact manual positioning of the tape and a careful visual control in order to continuously adjust alignment and to check for any air bubbles fastened under the tape. This task has {{to be carried out}} within limited time determined by the pace of the assembly line, thus requiring both high precision and a certain speed. The present study aimed at the question: How do different degrees of <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> affect the execution of a precision assembly task? Deco-tape fixation was transformed into an experimental task in order to study the effect of different degrees of precision demands. Ten subjects without previous assembly experience completed 60 experimental trials each. In each trial a tape was affixed in an area indicated on a frame. Thirty trials required high precision with minimal <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> - that is the tape was affixed in an area that had the same widh as the tape. The remaining 30 trials were carried out with lower precision demands. - the indicated area provided an <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 3 mm at a tape width of 19 mm. Task completion time, the movement path of the right hand and head, and the occurrence of quality defiences were registered. The study showed strong effects of the change in <b>assembly</b> <b>tolerance</b> on the speed, postural behaviour and movementpaths during the task execution: Tasks with high precision demands required significantly longer completion times. Higher precision demands lead to a working posture with less variation in the distance between the right hand and the head. During tasks with high precision, the movement path of the right hand was less economic - with smaller movement cycles of shorter duration - allowing for a more frequent control of results. It was concluded that precision demands play an important role for the speed, working posture and movement path during an assembly task. Considering these effects and their potential implication for the muscular load during task execution, it seems important to consider task {{characteristics such}} as precision demands in detail when designing products for assembly. A careful consideration of these task characteristics is essential when using simulation tools such as mannequins in extended phases of future product development process. Relevance to industry Current ergonomic guidelines often focus on the physical layout of a work place, while task {{characteristics such as}} visual and manual demands are considered to a lesser extent. However, these task characteristics may play an important role for assembly workers postural behaviour and the muscular load during work. Increasing use of simulation tools instead of physical prototypes in the product and production development process makes it even more difficult to evaluate task characteristics such as precision demands. On this background, more knowledge about the effect of task characteristics such as precision demands is needed. The present pilot study provides a detailed analysis of the effect of different precision demands on the work posture and execution of an assembly task - deco-tape fixation...|$|E
