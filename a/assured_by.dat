5|$|In August 1844, in {{the midst}} of the campaign, Tyler withdrew from the race. The Democratic Party was by then {{unequivocally}} committed to Texas annexation, and Tyler, <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> Polk's envoys that as President he would effect Texas annexation, urged his supporters to vote Democratic. Polk narrowly defeated Whig Henry Clay in the November election. The victorious Democrats were poised to acquire Texas under President-elect Polk's doctrine of Manifest Destiny, rather than on the pro-slavery agenda of Tyler and Calhoun.|$|E
5|$|Still {{eligible}} for junior, Brulé made the Blue Jackets' roster for the 2006–07 season. A month into the campaign, he was <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> General Manager Doug MacLean {{that he would}} not be returned to the Giants as he had been the previous season. He was scratched several times under head coach Gerard Gallant, but after Gallant was replaced by Ken Hitchcock in late-November, he began receiving more playing time. Playing mostly on the fourth line in his rookie season, he averaged 10minutes of ice time per game. He went on to tally 19points (9goals and 10assists) over 78games in his first full NHL season.|$|E

5|$|The Franciscan friar Jacobo de Testera {{arrived in}} Champoton in 1535 to attempt the {{peaceful}} incorporation of Yucatán into the Spanish Empire. Testera had been <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> the Spanish authorities that no military activity would be undertaken in Yucatán, {{while he was}} attempting its conversion to the Roman Catholic faith, and that no soldiers would be permitted to enter the peninsula. His initial efforts were proving successful when Captain Lorenzo de Godoy arrived in Champoton at the command of soldiers despatched there by Montejo the Younger. Godoy and Testera were soon in conflict and the friar was forced to abandon Champoton and return to central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny him the {{opportunity}} to regain the fullback position for Australia in the Centenary Test against New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 State of Origin series was <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> Queensland coach Mal Meninga but there was speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would make way for the Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the position for Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E
5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E

After destroying the car, the family returns to the dealer to receive the gift, which Homer forgets to open until he is in bed with Marge. His gift turns out to be free tickets to a preview screening of the new Mel Gibson film, a remake of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. The audience members are given comment cards to fill. The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> federal amendments and legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he had {{changed his mind and}} supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{had voted}} {{to move the}} seat of {{government}} permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that Queen Victoria decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. Macdonald privately asked the Colonial Office {{to ensure that the}} Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election. In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of Ottawa.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he had interviewed Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|The story {{concerns}} the British secret agent James Bond, gambling at the casino in Royale-les-Eaux to bankrupt Le Chiffre, the treasurer of a French union {{and a member}} of the Russian secret service. Bond is supported in his endeavours by Vesper Lynd, a member of his own service, as well as Felix Leiter of the CIA and René Mathis of the French Deuxième Bureau. Fleming used his wartime experiences as a member of the Naval Intelligence Division, and the people he met during his work, to provide plot elements; the character of Bond also reflected many of Fleming's personal tastes. Fleming wrote the draft in early 1952 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica while awaiting his marriage. He was initially unsure whether the work was suitable for publication, but was <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> his friend, the novelist William Plomer, that the novel had promise.|$|E

5|$|When {{a chance}} arose {{for him to}} escape to a safe country, Edwin chose to remain at Rædwald's court. He was then visited by a {{stranger}} who was aware of Rædwald's deliberations. The source for this story, written at Whitby, stated that the stranger was Paulinus of York, {{a member of the}} Canterbury mission, who offered Edwin the hope of Rædwald's support and held out the prospect that Edwin might someday attain greater royal power than any previous English king. Paulinus was <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> Edwin that he would accept his religious teaching. His vision of Paulinus was afterwards made the means of his decision to embrace Christianity, on the condition that he survived and achieved power. If, as is supposed by some, Paulinus appeared to him in the flesh, the bishop's presence at Rædwald's court would throw some light on the king's position regarding religion.|$|E
5|$|Before he died, Bolesław III Wrymouth {{divided the}} country, {{in a limited}} sense, among four of his sons. He made complex {{arrangements}} intended to prevent fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Bolesław's death, {{the implementation of the}} plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Kraków. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Kraków, was {{to be added to the}} senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Kraków, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when Władysław II the Exile, Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II the Just fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is <b>assured</b> <b>by</b> maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E
