5|$|On 6 November 1981, Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had {{established}} the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Council, {{a forum for}} meetings between the two governments. On 15 November 1985, Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which {{marked the first time}} a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland. In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.|$|E
25|$|In November 1985 the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{was signed}} between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The {{agreement}} gave the Republic of Ireland a formal say in Northern Ireland and its affairs. As {{was the case}} with the New Ireland Forum Report, the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected.|$|E
25|$|Note: The {{by-election}} {{was caused}} by the decision of all Unionist MPs to resign their seats and seek re-election on a platform of opposition to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E
500|$|There were {{a series}} of {{agreements}} from the [...] "cattle-coal pact" [...] of 1935 to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> of 1938 which ended the dispute, on terms favourable to Ireland.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> {{was signed}} on 25 April 1938 by Ireland and the United Kingdom. It aimed {{to resolve the}} Anglo-Irish Trade War which had been {{on-going}} from 1933.|$|R

25|$|In 1985, the Irish {{government}} {{was part of}} the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement,</b> in which the British government recognised that the Irish government had a role to play in a future peace settlement in the North. In 1994, the Irish {{government was}} heavily involved in negotiations which brought about an IRA ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, a new <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>agreement</b> gave Aer Lingus {{exclusive}} UK {{traffic rights}} from Ireland {{in exchange for}} a 40% holding by British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA). Because of Aer Lingus' growth the airline bought seven new Vickers Viking aircraft in 1947, however, these proved to be uneconomical and were soon sold.|$|E
25|$|Under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Ireland was partitioned, {{creating}} Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Under {{the terms}} of the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>agreement</b> of 6 December 1921, which ended the war (1919–21), Northern Ireland was given the option of withdrawing from the new state, the Irish Free State, and remaining part of the United Kingdom. The Northern Ireland parliament chose to do that. An Irish Boundary Commission was then set up to review the border.|$|E
5000|$|The Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 [...] was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{passed on}} 17 May 1938. It was the British {{implementing}} measure for the 1938 <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreements</b> which were signed at London on 25 April 1938 by the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. There were three agreements in total: one to rescind Articles 6 and 7 of the Anglo-Irish Treaty and {{the transfer of}} British Admiralty property to Ireland; a second for the settlement of outstanding financial claims against the Irish Government; and the third, an important trade agreement {{putting an end to}} an [...] "economic war" [...] between the two countries.|$|R
50|$|The IRA's {{campaign}} on the mainland was ongoing, with the bombing of Chelsea Barracks in October 1981, the Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings in July 1982 and the Harrods bombings in December 1983. Thatcher herself was the target in the Brighton hotel bombing of October 1984. British military intelligence informed Thatcher {{that she could not}} take the IRA head on and the likelihood of never ending violence persuaded her to seek a political solution to the Troubles. The <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement's</b> origins lay in the behind-the-scenes negotiations between the British and Irish foreign offices, co-ordinated by the Cabinet Secretary, Robert Armstrong, and the secretary to the Irish government, Dermot Nally.|$|R
50|$|The partial {{liberalisation}} of the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> bilateral <b>agreement</b> {{during the}} early 1980s enabled Dan-Air to commence scheduled operations on Gatwick-Dublin in 1982. As the recession began to bite and passengers for Link City dwindled, the company contracted them to regional airlines operating smaller aircraft. Nineteen eighty-two saw Metropolitan Airways, a subsidiary of Alderney Air Ferries (Holdings), take over Dan-Air's Bournemouth-Cardiff/Birmingham-Manchester-Newcastle schedule.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, after a five-year {{absence from the}} organisation, Wright resumed his UVF activities. This was in {{consequence}} of the November 1985 <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> which angered unionists because it gave the Irish Government an advisory role in Northern Ireland's government. There were constant raids by the RUC and British Army on his home in Portadown's Corcrain estate. Although he was arrested repeatedly on suspicion of murder and conspiracy, he never faced any charges.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{was signed}} by the British and Irish governments on 15 November 1985, {{following}} months of talks between the two governments. The Agreement confirmed {{that there would be}} no change in the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its citizens, and set out conditions for the creation of a power-sharing government for Northern Ireland. It also gave the Irish government an advisory role on political, legal and security matters in Northern Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The horrified {{reaction}} of the Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald to this speech and the electoral success of Sinn Féin following the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike shocked the Thatcher Government and they were receptive to FitzGerald's lobbying {{on behalf of the}} SDLP which eventually led in 1985 to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which was opposed by both unionists and republicans. Republicans were concerned that the agreement did not go far enough. Unionists staged a demonstration of some 200,000 people in Belfast city centre.|$|E
50|$|Accordingly, {{even after}} the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at Spike Island. Spike Island remained under British sovereignty until 11 July 1938 when, pursuant to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> of 25 April 1938, the territory was ceded to Ireland. The hand-over ceremonies were attended by senior military and political figures, including Éamon de Valera and Frank Aiken.|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, {{even after}} the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at Fort Dunree. Fort Dunree remained under British sovereignty until 3 October 1938 when, pursuant to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> of 25 April 1938, the territory was seceded to Ireland. On 4 October 1938, The Times reported on the handover of Lough Swilly at Fort Dunree on 3 October 1938 as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, {{even after}} the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State, the Royal Navy continued to maintain its presence at the forts and batteries around Castletownbere and on Bere Island (together known as Berehaven). Berehaven remained under British sovereignty until 29 September 1938 when, pursuant to the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> of 25 April 1938, the territory was seceded to Ireland. The Times reported the handover of port as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Alliance {{was seriously}} {{damaged by the}} 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which deeply polarised Northern Ireland politics, {{and led to the}} {{emergence}} of Sinn Féin as a serious political force. The party supported the 1985 <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement,</b> and despite claims that this would fatally damage its soft unionist support, Alliance rebounded to pick up 10.0% of the vote in the 1987 United Kingdom general election, with some voters rejecting the tacit mainstream unionist support for violence {{in the aftermath of the}} Agreement.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Troubles, Paisley {{was seen}} as a {{firebrand}} and the face of hardline unionism. He opposed all attempts to resolve the conflict through power-sharing between unionists and Irish nationalists/republicans, and all attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern affairs. His efforts helped bring down the Sunningdale Agreement of 1974. He also opposed the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1985, with less success. His attempts to create a paramilitary movement culminated in Ulster Resistance. Paisley and his party also opposed the Northern Ireland peace process and Good Friday Agreement of 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Harney had {{her first}} electoral success when she was elected to Dublin County Council. Two years later she {{was elected to the}} Dáil at the 1981 general {{election}} for Dublin South-West. She retained her seat at every election until her retirement in 2011, moving to the new Dublin Mid-West constituency at the 2002 general election when it was created from part of Dublin South-West. As a member of the so-called Gang of 22, she was expelled from the party after voting in favour of the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> in 1985.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom was {{recovering}} from the Second World War and Ireland remained economically dependent on the latter, which represented nearly 75% of its exports and this was codified in the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Free trade <b>agreement</b> of 1966.|$|R
50|$|The {{resolution}} of the crisis came {{after a series of}} talks in London between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and de Valera, who was accompanied by Lemass and James Ryan. An agreement to reach an acceptable settlement was drawn up in 1938, enacted in Britain as the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act. Under the terms of the three-year <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> all duties imposed during the previous five years were lifted.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> of 25 April 1938 was {{motivated}} {{in part by}} a desire by both countries to remove the distractions of the Anglo-Irish Trade War to preparations for an expected European war. After the agreement the British government shared details of the emergency laws it was preparing. The Sudetenland crisis prompted the adapting of the British [...] "war book" [...] for Ireland's purposes; draft legislation was already finished by 18 September 1938.|$|R
25|$|Up until 1972 the UUP {{sat with}} the Conservative Party at Westminster, {{traditionally}} taking the Conservative parliamentary whip_(politics). To {{all intents and purposes}} the party functioned as the Northern Ireland branch of the Conservative Party. In 1972, in protest over the prorogation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland, the Westminster Ulster Unionist MPs withdrew from the alliance. The party remained affiliated to the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, but in 1985, withdrew from it as well, in protest over the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement.</b> Subsequently, the Conservative Party has organised separately in Northern Ireland, with little electoral success.|$|E
25|$|The DUP {{evolved from}} the Protestant Unionist Party and has {{historically}} strong links to the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the church Paisley founded. During the Troubles, the DUP opposed attempts to resolve the conflict that would involve sharing power with Irish nationalists or republicans, and rejected attempts to involve the Republic of Ireland in Northern Irish affairs. It campaigned against the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973, the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1985, and the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. In the 1980s, the party was involved in setting up the paramilitary movements Third Force and Ulster Resistance.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the Labour Party {{entered into}} a {{coalition}} government with Fine Gael. When Peter Sutherland was appointed Ireland's European Commissioner, Labour demanded {{the choice of the}} next Attorney General. Many expected Robinson to be the choice, but the party leader instead picked an unknown, new senior counsel called John Rogers. Shortly afterwards, Robinson resigned from the party in protest at the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> that the coalition under Garret FitzGerald had signed with the British Government of Margaret Thatcher. Robinson argued that unionist politicians in Northern Ireland should have been consulted as part of the deal, despite their reluctance to share power.|$|E
50|$|This first Emergency {{ended in}} 1938 with the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Free Trade <b>Agreement,</b> when Neville Chamberlain's {{appeasement}} policy allowed a climb down. The UK would end economic sanctions {{and return the}} treaty ports {{in exchange for a}} once-off payment of £10m.|$|R
50|$|Dicey was a Liberal Unionist and a {{vigorous}} opponent of Home Rule for Ireland and published and spoke against it extensively from 1886 until {{shortly before his}} death, advocating that no concessions be made to Irish nationalism {{in relation to the}} government of any part of Ireland {{as an integral part of}} the United Kingdom. He was thus bitterly disillusioned by the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Treaty <b>agreement</b> in 1921 that Southern Ireland should become a self-governing dominion (the Irish Free State), separate from the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The {{programme}} {{paved the}} way for free trade. In 1960 Ireland signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a worldwide agreement to reduce tariffs. In 1961 Ireland applied unsuccessfully for membership of the European Economic Community. Ireland's failure to join was said to be Lemass's biggest regret and disappointment as Taoiseach. Ireland eventually joined in 1973, two years after Lemass's death. The 1965 Merger Treaties {{paved the way}} for the signing of the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement</b> between Lemass's government and Harold Wilson's Labour government.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the signing}} of the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> in 1985, unionist {{politicians}} Christopher and Michael McGimpsey brought a suit against the Irish government in the High Court arguing that the Agreement was unconstitutional under Articles 2 and 3, because it recognised that Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. This argument was unusual coming from unionists because of the traditional unionist opposition to these two articles, but was undertaken to undermine an agreement they opposed, albeit not for the reasons they opposed it. Their case failed in the High Court, and again on appeal to the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|An {{attempt by}} the two governments to resolve the {{conflict}} in Northern Ireland politically in 1972 through the Sunningdale Agreement failed due to opposition by hard-line factions in Northern Ireland. With no resolution to the conflict in sight, the Irish government established the New Ireland Forum in 1984 to look into solutions. While the British UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected the forum's proposals, it informed the British government's opinion and {{it is said to}} have given the Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald a mandate during the negotiation of the 1985 <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which was directed at resolving the conflict. The 1992 Downing Street Declaration further consolidated the views of the two Governments and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement eventually formed the basis for peace in the province.|$|E
25|$|In May 1984 the New-Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was {{involved}} in the drafting of this {{at the time he was}} in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna Fáil TD. Ironically when Haughey returned to power he embraced the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> <b>Agreement</b> that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.|$|E
50|$|Some former RIC men {{joined the}} Garda Síochána. These {{included}} {{men who had}} earlier assisted IRA operations in various ways. Some retired and the Irish Free State paid their pensions as provided for {{in the terms of}} the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Treaty <b>agreement.</b> Others, still faced with threats of violent reprisals, emigrated with their families to Great Britain or other parts of the Empire, most often to police forces in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. A number of these men joined the Palestine Gendarmerie, which was recruiting in the UK at this time.|$|R
25|$|With the new {{constitution}} in place, de Valera determined that the changed circumstances made swift resolution to Ireland's ongoing trade war with the UK more desirable for both sides—as did the growing probability of the outbreak of war across Europe. In April 1938, de Valera and British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain signed the <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement,</b> lifting all duties imposed during {{the previous five years}} and ending British use of the Treaty Ports it had retained in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The return of the ports was of particular significance, since it ensured Irish neutrality during the coming Second World War.|$|R
25|$|He was {{instrumental}} in having para-military forces (Black and Tans and Auxiliaries) intervene in the Irish War of Independence. He became Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1921 and was a signatory of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, which established the Irish Free State. Churchill {{was involved in the}} lengthy negotiations of the treaty and, to protect British maritime interests, he engineered part of the Irish Free State agreement to include three Treaty Ports—Queenstown (Cobh), Berehaven and Lough Swilly—which could be used as Atlantic bases by the Royal Navy. In 1938, however, {{under the terms of the}} <b>Anglo-Irish</b> Trade <b>Agreement,</b> the bases were returned to Ireland.|$|R
