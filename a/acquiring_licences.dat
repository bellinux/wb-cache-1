30|$|Software as a Service – SaaS: {{refers to}} {{applications}} delivered {{as a service}} to consumers through the Internet/Intranet (Armbrust et al. 2009; Mell and Grance 2010). The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a Web browser (e.g., Web-based email).

40|$|I've grouped {{the most}} {{important}} Italian initiatives in three categories: SBN net, territorial library systems and cooperation by sector. Recently - {{with the development of}} electronic publishing - academic libraries are again interested in cooperation activities (especially about <b>acquiring</b> <b>licences</b> and sharing electronic resources). These are the trends of the firts ongoing initiatives by Italian libraries: a) development of digital collections, b) electronic resources cataloguing, c) managing electronic resources and negotiating licences. Conclusions: the initiatives in the field of digital cooperation especially originate from academic libraries and research institutes world; these projects seldom reach an enough dimension so that scale economies are accomplished; ongoing projects don't prefigure the forming of real consortia; librarians prefer decentralized forms of cooperation; almost always the initiatives aren't stimulated by funds and ad hoc State programs; a big part of cooperation projects is about the sharing of CD-ROM databases; some ongoing initiatives derive more from vendors than from librarians; some projects are lead by academic consortia that begun to be interested in the library field; a certain attention is emerging about academic electronic publishing; finally, library initiatives in the content development and in the archiving of collections is still lacking. This analysis is the base of an initiative which is inspiring the debate about digital cooperation in Italy in these months: INFER, Italian National Forum on Electronic Information Resources...|$|E
