5|$|The humorous 2007 {{animated}} film Bee Movie used Jerry Seinfeld's first script and {{was his first}} work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside Renée Zellweger. Critics found its premise <b>awkward</b> and its delivery tame.|$|E
5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales were good during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who felt it was <b>awkward</b> and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, the {{employees}} confront Michael to hear about the surprise, but Michael's <b>awkward</b> stalling tactics cause them to finally realize there is no surprise, and they leave. With only him and Dwight left in the office, Dwight casually mentions to Michael what Jan said to him.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, {{a lonely}} Michael strikes up a {{pleasant}} {{conversation with a}} woman while giving blood, but passes out before he can learn her name.

5|$|Max tracks Donna down at {{the bookstore}} where she works {{and they have the}} first of several <b>awkward</b> conversations. Donna then runs into Max when he stops by her mother's {{apartment}} to return a book to her mother, Nancy (Polly Draper), who is a former professor of his. They have lunch together where Donna is prepared to tell Max about her pregnancy and impending abortion until he makes a comment about how {{he wants to be a}} grandfather someday.

5|$|Michael (Tony Gardner) {{owns and}} runs the café that Rick and Marty {{frequently}} visit {{to escape the}} chaos of Rick's home.

His father turns out to be gay in later series, to which Michael reacts negatively.|$|E
5|$|Sol quickly {{falls for}} Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and <b>awkward</b> as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was <b>awkward</b> anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, <b>awkward,</b> and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. As many of his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} was {{that both the}} Glasgow and Ayr {{stations}} were <b>awkward.</b> The Glasgow station, at Bridge Street, was on {{the south of the}} Clyde (and Glasgow Bridge carried a toll at the time). The Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and although not inconvenient for passenger access to the town, the location prevented southward railway extension.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton and Stamford branches of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the two branches are merged. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) have an <b>awkward</b> reunion, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to make his new employees feel welcome, and a rivalry begins between Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms).|$|E

5|$|This sparrow is <b>awkward</b> {{in flight}} and {{primarily}} uses running and hopping to move. The rufous-crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season, and in family-sized flocks {{in late summer}} and early autumn. During the winter they can occasionally be found in loose mixed-species foraging flocks.|$|E
5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and <b>awkward</b> when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due {{to the presence of}} large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.|$|E
5|$|We {{are also}} {{introduced}} to {{a few of the}} other workers in the office, such as Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), a socially <b>awkward</b> salesman and part-time, volunteer sheriff’s deputy; Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), another salesman who enjoys playing pranks on Dwight; Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), the receptionist on whom Jim harbors an obvious crush; and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), a temporary worker.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt Cenac had {{a tumultuous}} tenure on the show, {{revealing}} in a July 2015 interview on WTF with Marc Maron, that his departure stemmed {{in part from}} a heated argument he had with Jon Stewart in June 2011 over a bit about Republican Presidential candidate Herman Cain. However, Cenac did return for Stewart's final episode to bid him farewell and the two exchanged an intentionally <b>awkward</b> conversation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} from earlier games in the franchise - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in Saints Row IV, many of whom take up the protagonist's Presidential administration. Kinzie Kensington, the socially <b>awkward</b> FBI hacker from Saints Row: The Third becomes the White House's press secretary, often tasked with clearing up the mess {{left behind by the}} President's verbal missteps. Benjamin King, former leader of the Vice Kings gang from the original Saints Row, becomes the President's Chief of Staff, while Pierce Washington has been appointed the Communications Director and Shaundi as the Director of the Secret Service.|$|E
5|$|After {{doing some}} more searching, Veronica discovers {{that one of}} the lab members {{actually}} stole the monkey after developing a special bond with it. The lab member knew he could blame it on PHAT. Veronica decides to tell the other lab members that she was unable to find the monkey, although she is surprised to learn that they will quickly get another monkey. Veronica has a heartfelt conversation with Piz, although soon afterward, she goes back to Logan. Keith decides to take the case of Dean O’Dell’s death. The next morning, Piz walks up to Veronica excitedly, but Logan appears, making things <b>awkward</b> and causing Piz to leave sadly.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles was so afraid of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the <b>awkward</b> position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{frequently}} teases Kenny {{for being}} poor, and derides Kenny's family {{for being on}} welfare. He will also use an <b>awkward</b> pause during a conversation {{as an opportunity to}} casually remind Kenny that he hates him. Cartman's mischievous treatment of Butters Stotch, and the relationship the duo shares has received significant focus in the more recent seasons of the series. This reflects Parker's interest; the scenes between the two are the ones he most enjoys writing.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{characters}} {{feature in}} the Walt Disney animated movies Pinocchio (1940), where Jiminy Cricket becomes the title character's conscience, and in Mulan (1998), where Cri-kee is carried in a cage {{as a symbol of}} luck, in the Asian manner. The Crickets was the name of Buddy Holly's rock and roll band; Holly's home town baseball team in the 1990s was called the Lubbock Crickets. Cricket is the name of a US children's literary magazine founded in 1973; it uses a cast of insect characters. The sound of crickets is often used in media to emphasize silence, often for comic effect after an <b>awkward</b> joke, in a similar manner to tumbleweed.|$|E
5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as by the age of fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically <b>awkward,</b> and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
5|$|For the game's halftime show, the Orange Bowl hosted American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} Goo Goo Dolls. Reviews criticized the performance for <b>awkward</b> staging and brevity, {{as the group}} performed only two songs. Middle {{school and high school}} dance squads also participated in the halftime show, performaing on the field while the Goo Goo Dolls played. Pregame media coverage erroneously reported that Stanford's marching band, which had been scheduled to perform, was banned from the field. The band had never been scheduled to perform at halftime; each team's marching band was allotted a six-minute pregame performance.|$|E
5|$|Himmler's first name, Heinrich, {{was that}} of his godfather, Prince Heinrich of Bavaria, {{a member of the}} royal family of Bavaria, who had been tutored by Gebhard Himmler. He {{attended}} a grammar school in Landshut, where his father was deputy principal. While he did well in his schoolwork, he struggled in athletics. He had poor health, suffering from lifelong stomach complaints and other ailments. In his youth he trained daily with weights and exercised to become stronger. Other boys at the school later remembered him as studious and <b>awkward</b> in social situations.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{was also}} transported by {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. Ice was not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally <b>awkward</b> to transport. By the 1880s ice was being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there <b>awkward</b> at best.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Ann (Rashida Jones) {{goes to a}} singles mixer {{where she}} is {{extremely}} uncomfortable. She runs into Donna (Retta), who at first views Ann as competition, but then offers her advice after witnessing Ann's <b>awkward</b> flirting. When Ann hears about Andy getting married from Leslie, she considers going home, as she and Andy dated for several years. Donna tells Ann to forget her past and enjoy herself in the present. Ann ends up {{having a good time}} at the mixer and gets several phone numbers.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) {{goes on a}} {{date with}} a young, twenty-year-old coffee {{delivery}} man named Jamie (Val Emmich).

Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) gets a younger boyfriend of her own. Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) develops a crush on Jamie. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) helps Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to coach a Little League Baseball team.|$|E
5|$|Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) berates Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{when she}} discovers that {{he calls the}} entire office into the conference room every Monday to watch a movie. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) prods Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to ask Jan to give him Michael's job. After her <b>awkward</b> meeting with Dwight, where he {{declares}} {{he can be a}} better boss than Michael, Jan calls Michael and demands he get his branch under control.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam {{does the same}} with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim {{that it is not}} fair to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and <b>awkward</b> together.|$|E
5|$|Little Sammy Sneeze was a {{comic strip}} by American {{cartoonist}} Winsor McCay. In each episode the titular Sammy sneezed himself into an <b>awkward</b> or disastrous predicament. The strip ran from July 24, 1904, until December 9, 1906, in the New York Herald, where McCay {{was on the}} staff. It was McCay's first successful comic strip; he followed it with Dream of the Rarebit Fiend later in 1904, and his best-known strip Little Nemo in Slumberland in 1905.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially <b>awkward</b> and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E
