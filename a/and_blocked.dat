5|$|A double-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles are fairly common in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E
5|$|A quintuple-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in all five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> shots—-in a single game. There are only two known quintuple-doubles, both only done at the high-school level. The first was recorded by Tamika Catchings of Duncanville High School (Duncanville, Texas) with 25points, 18rebounds, 11assists, 10steals and 10blocks in 1997. The second was by Aimee Oertner of Northern Lehigh High School (Slatington, Pennsylvania), who had 26 points, 20 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 11 blocks on January 7, 2012.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of the Campaign, it is {{revealed}} that Tychus was only released from his prison by Arcturus Mengsk, under the conditions that he had to assassinate Sarah Kerrigan, who had just been de-infested by the Xel'naga artifact's energy pulse. According to him, if she was killed, he would go free. Raynor made the decision right there <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> a shot from Tychus, intended for Kerrigan, and he shot his friend dead.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{supported}} U.S. neutrality in World War I and endorsed Wilson's plan {{to purchase}} merchant ships for the U.S. {{instead of paying}} foreign carriers to travel waters containing German U-boats. His position was popular in his district, as 80% of the dark tobacco grown in western Kentucky was sold overseas, and higher shipping costs adversely affected profits. The House authorized the purchase, but Republicans and conservative Democrats in the Senate regarded the idea as socialistic <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> its passage with a filibuster.|$|E

Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

5|$|Gough Whitlam's Labor {{government}} {{was elected in}} 1972 after 23 years of rule by a coalition formed by the Liberal and Country parties.

5|$|In Mananjary {{where the}} cyclone moved ashore, Alibera {{produced}} gusts of 250km/h (150mph).

The cyclone {{shut down the}} city's water system, disrupted access to the ocean, cut communications, <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> or damaged most roads. There were 15deaths in Mananjary alone.

5|$|Most 50-point triple-doubles in {{a single}} season: Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) {{recorded}} three 50-point triple-doubles in the 2016–17 season. James Harden is the other player to record more than one 50-point triple double with two in the same season. It is more than likely that Wilt Chamberlain recorded many 50-point triple-doubles during his historic 1961-62 NBA season, but they remain unofficial, as steals <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> shots were not yet recorded as official statistics.|$|E

5|$|On January 4, 2016, Turner {{started in}} place of an injured Avery Bradley and posted a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double against the Brooklyn Nets.

On February 16, at halftime of the Ohio StateMichigan game at Value City Arena, Turner's collegiate number, 21, was retired by Ohio State. On March 26, Turner posted a 17-point, 11-rebound double-double <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> Devin Booker's {{potential}} game-tying shot with 3.9 seconds left against the Phoenix Suns.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} possession, Boston College needed only seven plays and just under {{three minutes to}} travel 74yards. The drive culminated in a 14-yard quarterback {{scramble}} for a touchdown. Duane Brown, who had blocked the first Boston College field goal attempt, again charged through the Boston College offensive line <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> the extra point attempt. This time, the ball bounced {{into the hands of}} Virginia Tech's Brandon Flowers, who returned it 75yards for a defensive two-point conversion. The play kept Boston College's lead within a single touchdown and extra point. With 5:27 remaining in the half, the score was now 169 in favor of Boston College.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of January 30, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, a shot rang out, and Goebel fell wounded. He {{was taken to a}} nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds. Soldiers filled the streets <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> {{entrance}} to the capitol. Defiantly, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall. By a strictly party-line vote, they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices.|$|E
5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|Students {{across the}} nation protested the Vietnam War, {{including}} at similar {{institutions such as the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students picketed <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> access to the Draper Laboratory that was producing guidance systems for the Poseidon missile. While The Technique did publish editorials against the United States' involvement, the Student Council easily defeated a bill endorsing the Vietnam Moratorium in the fall of 1969. There were significant protests at other institutions that conducted military research, but there were no protests against the military electronics research at the Georgia Tech Research Institute.|$|E

50|$|The most simple form of {{this play}} has the strong side {{offensive}} lineman step towards the ball <b>and</b> <b>block</b> any defender inside of him. The fullback will kick out the end man to create the running lane for the ball carrier. The Maryland I used the 2nd back to lead through the hole <b>and</b> <b>block</b> the linebacker. More complicated versions of the play have pulling guards block the linebacker or combination blocks by a tight-end and tackle to create the hole <b>and</b> <b>block</b> the linebacker.|$|R
5|$|Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} a one-yard run later, Tech prepared to punt the ball away.

The ball rolled inside the one-yard line, where Florida State's offense took over. On the first play after the block, Rix leaped across the goal line for the game's first touchdown. The extra point attempt was a success, and with 6:32 remaining in the first half, Florida State took a 73 lead.|$|E

The Tiger emerged from cover onto Route Nationale 175 and knocked out a Cromwell, the rearmost tank at Point 213. A Sherman Firefly was then knocked out, caught fire <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> the road. The British at Point 213 were then engaged {{by the rest of}} the 2nd Company and lost three more tanks.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} to Colt's success was {{vigorous}} protection of his patent rights. Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver, scores of imitators copied {{his work and}} Colt found himself constantly in litigation. In {{each one of these}} cases, Colt's lawyer, Edward N. Dickerson, deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt's competitors. However, Colt's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States. His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company's transition to the cartridge system <b>and</b> <b>blocked</b> other firms from pursuing revolver designs. At the same time, Colt's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism; as a result they created their own.|$|E
