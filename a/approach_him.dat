5|$|Cunard Line, already {{familiar}} with Smallpeice {{as a result}} of the BOAC-Cunard venture, were quick to <b>approach</b> <b>him.</b> Sir John Brocklebank offered Smallpeice a board position with the shipping line in December 1963, during Smallpeice's last meeting as a BOAC representative on the BOAC-Cunard board.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} of Bob & Rose, Davies was approached by Abbott to write for his new BBC show Linda Green. He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by Liza Tarbuck) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> with additional concepts for period dramas, which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive Doctor Who, which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.|$|E

Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police <b>approach</b> <b>him.</b> After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|With {{the help}} of some miners, John and Kanyenke bring down large rock bridges to stop the Russians' large cannons from getting through. John then sends Kanyenke and the {{remainder}} of his mercenaries back east as he plants explosives to cause an avalanche and bury the Russians in the mountains. In the end, as John is setting up the dynamite, Warwick and several Boneguard <b>approach</b> <b>him.</b> Warwick attempts to kill John but John uses a barrel of gunpowder as a shield (knowing that Warwick won't risk detonating it by shooting at him), jumps to the trigger, and pushes it, detonating the mountainside; killing himself, the soldiers, and Warwick; and causing an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians and sets the Circle of Ossus back so far that they cause no problems for many years.|$|E

25|$|As per his destiny, the {{messengers}} of Yama came to {{take away}} Markandeya's soul, but failed to <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> as he ceaselessly repeated Shiva's name. Yama came himself to take Markandeya's soul and told Markandeya to stop his worship and come with him as per his fate. Markandeya refused, warning Yama that he was committing an offence against Shiva. Yama, however, proclaimed that not even Shiva could stop him. The wrathful Yama assumed a fearsome form and threw his noose to capture Markandeya, who hugged the linga tightly. When the noose touched the linga, Shiva emerged from it and struck Yama with his Trishula and kicked his chest, killing the lord of death.|$|E
25|$|Bau led one of 3 {{competing}} Traditionalist Tarragona factions, {{namely the}} one opposing Carloctavistas and javieristas and promoting rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, Don Juan. The Tortosa javierista Carlists distributed leaflets presenting him as Francoist traitor who ignored {{the lot of}} requetés detained by the Francoist administration. He apparently acknowledged that a future kingdom must encompass Francoist structures. His private papers from mid-1950s suggest that Bau, though with hesitation, tended to support what seemed a long-distance Franco’s plan for crowning prince Juan Carlos. However, when in 1957 he joined the Carlists who abandoned the regent-claimant Don Javier, Bau declared Juan Carlos’ father, Don Juan, the legitimate heir and continued to <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> as a king.|$|E
25|$|He first {{submitted}} the piece {{to appear at}} the Cubist Salon des Indépendants, but Albert Gleizes (according to Duchamp {{in an interview with}} Pierre Cabanne, p.31) asked Duchamp's brothers to have him voluntarily withdraw the painting, or to paint over the title that he had painted on the work and rename it something else. Duchamp's brothers did <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> with Gleizes' request, but Duchamp quietly refused. However, there was no jury at the Salon des Indépendants and Gleizes was in no position to reject the painting. The controversy, according to art historian Peter Brooke, was not whether the work should be hung or not, but whether or not it should be hung with the Cubist group.|$|E

25|$|On 17 August 1962, a teenaged East German, Peter Fechter, {{was shot}} in the pelvis by East German guards while trying to escape from East Berlin. His body lay tangled in a barbed wire fence, and he bled to death, {{in full view of the}} world's media. American {{soldiers}} could not rescue him because he was a few metres inside the Soviet sector. East German border guards were reluctant to <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> for fear of provoking Western soldiers, one of whom had shot an East German border guard just days earlier. More than an hour later, Fechter's body was removed by the East German guards. A spontaneous demonstration formed on the American side of the checkpoint, protesting the action of the East and the inaction of the West.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{he acted}} in five films, the first being Janakan, a crime thriller {{in which he}} co-starred with Suresh Gopi, written by S. N Swamy. In the film, he played Adv. Surya Narayanan who {{encounters}} some runaway suspects as they <b>approach</b> <b>him</b> for justice. Alexander the Great directed by Murali Nagavally was a comical racy entertainer released in May. Oru Naal Varum directed by T. K Rajeev Kumar, scripted by Sreenivasan and produced by Maniyanpilla Raju, was a social satire about the corruption in India. It reunited the much-adored classic combo of Mohanlal-Sreenivasan onscreen. His next film was Shikkar, a dark revenge thriller directed by M. Padmakumar, in which he played a lorry driver who is haunted by his past. The film topped at the Ramzan box-office. It was followed by Kandahar, a war film directed by Major Ravi, based on the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999. Mohanlal reprised the role of Major Mahadevan in the film. It was the third installment in the Major Mahadevan film series, and the debut Malayalam film of Amitabh Bachan.|$|E

John tries to <b>approach</b> <b>him,</b> but slips and {{falls into the}} sea. He is saved from drowning by the sole survivor of the wreck, a Spaniard Alonzo Monçada. Alonzo Monçada tells his story, in which his family confines him to a monastery. He is mistreated by the monks, and his brother Juan arranges for him to escape {{with the help of}} a fellow monk, a parricide. The escape plan is a trap and Juan is killed. Monçada is taken to the prison of the Inquisition. There he is visited in his cell by Melmoth, who says he will help him escape. A fire breaks out, and in the confusion Monçada escapes. He meets a venerable Jewish scholar, Adonijah, who lives in a secret chamber decorated with the skeletons of his own family.

25|$|Cao Cao {{had stayed}} in Wan for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu {{suddenly}} rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao's camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen. Dian Wei stood guard {{at the entrance to}} the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu's soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao's camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu's forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long ji, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei's men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to <b>approach</b> <b>him.</b> Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, he was still glaring and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei's head was passed around for Zhang Xiu's men to see. They also came to look at his headless body.|$|E
