50|$|Living in {{the village}} {{originally}} were {{the descendants of the}} Frankish settlers, who had taken over the land in the Early Middle Ages. Before the Thirty Years' War, some 50 people lived {{in the village}}. After that war, newcomers settled here, some with family names that are still found in Gries to this day. After the Second World War, a great many ethnic Germans from Romania settled in the village, and more recently there have been other ethnic Germans from Kazakhstan. Until the 19th century, almost everybody living in the village earned his livelihood at agriculture, whereas today, Gries has only one full-time agricultural operation. Roughly one hundred years <b>ago,</b> <b>working</b> men began seeking work outside the village, mainly in the Saarland’s mines and ironworks. Today’s villagers represent the most varied of occupations, and most must commute to jobs elsewhere. Gries’s attractive location and cultural life have made it a sought-after residential community, leading to a rise in population, especially as houses were being built in the extensive new building zones. While the village had a mere 400 or so inhabitants in the early 19th century, it was even then already one of the biggest villages in the area by population. Each century thereafter, the population has roughly doubled. Stagnant growth seems to have set in recently, however, at a level of about 1,150. Two hundred years ago, two thirds of the villagers were Protestant and one third Catholic. Since then, the Catholics’ share of the population has shrunk to about one fourth.|$|E

40|$|Firms {{in modern}} western world are often said to {{encourage}} people to prioritize work over family life. This imbalance, some personnel psychologist claim, causes tension and unhappiness. The story, however, is not new. Something very similar happened during the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture, some 10, 000 years <b>ago.</b> <b>Working</b> time increased alongside population. Meanwhile, consumption remained at the subsistence level. I show, using a neoclassical economic, that the technological improvements associated to agriculturization induce free, rational and self-interested hunter-gatherers to adopt agriculture. As a result, working time increases while consumption remains at the subsistence level, and population begins to grow until diminishing returns to labor bring it to a halt. Welfare, which depends on consumption, leisure, and fertility, rises at first; but after a few generations it falls below its initial level. Still, the adoption of agriculture is irreversible. The latter generations choose to remain farmers because, at their current levels of population, reverting to hunting and gathering would reduce their welfare.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the actual {{gathering}} and use of wild edible plants in the 18 th and 19 th centuries, with a brief concluding discussion on the present day use of wild plants as food within Sweden. The peasants and the nomads in pre-industrial Sweden utilised very few wild plant taxa as food. Many even despised the wild fruits and green plants. Some plants and fruits were earlier mostly eaten fresh on the spot, or gathered for consumption in bread, gruel or soup. Other fruits were dried or preserved in other ways. In times of food shortages the amount of wild plants increased in the diet, but still the peasantry and nomads were often able to use fish and game to provide enough nutrients. 			 			With access to cheap sugar in the early 20 th century wild fruits (Vaccinium myrtillus L., V. vitis-idaea L., and Rubus chamaemorus L.) increased in importance, especially among urban-dwellers and within food industry. In the last few decades fungi have also become part of the urban diet. Fifty years <b>ago</b> <b>working</b> class people gathered only Cantharellus cibarius (Fr.) and occasionally Boletus edulis Bull. Nowadays more taxa are utilised within the Swedish households, and especially the easy to pick Cantharellus tubaeformis (Pers.) has become very popular recently.

40|$|This {{document}} {{is also available}} electronically at: [URL] and the follow-up report {{is available on the}} repository at: [URL] AIMS: For over a decade, work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) have remained {{the most common cause of}} work-related ill health in Great Britain, and despite an initial decline in prevalence rates, figures appear to have reached a plateau in recent years. The failure for prevalence rates to diminish further in 2001 / 02 and 2003 / 04 may be an indication that further health and safety interventions are failing to have any additional notable effect. Behaviour is a crucial factor in the reduction of many of today’s most widespread diseases and health problems, including MSDs. As with the effective reduction of any health or safety risk, not only do managers first need to take action to implement risk-reducing measures, but employees then need to change their routine ways of working to incorporate new methods, equipment, or working practices. Despite this, evidence suggests that ergonomics consultants focus largely on the physical aspects of the work, tending to overlook the more ‘psychological’ factors such as risk perception or management commitment (Whysall et al., 2004). Such an approach also overlooks psychosocial factors, which have been found to be associated with MSDs. This research attempted to improve the efficacy of interventions by applying the stage of change approach (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1982) to the workplace. The stage of change model acknowledges the importance of addressing attitudes in order to achieve behaviour change, and assumes that any behaviour change involves movement through distinct stages: i) precontemplation (resistance to recognising or modifying problem behaviour) ii) contemplation (recognition of the problem, thinking about changing, but not ready to act) iii) preparation (intending to change in the next 30 days, and/or having made specific plans to do so) iv) action (having engaged in behaviour change, no longer than 6 months ago) v) maintenance (initiated changes over 6 months <b>ago,</b> <b>working</b> to consolidate gains made and avoid relapse) An individual’s stage determines their receptiveness to, and the likely efficacy of, particular methods of education...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies suggest}} that {{denitrification}} in riparian zones removes nitrogen from groundwater as it moves from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. However, removal rates vary widely among sites complicating the incorporation of riparian zones into models of nitrogen movement across landscapes. Because denitrification in the riparian subsurface is often limited by the supply of microbially-available carbon, explaining how and why carbon supply varies among riparian zones using mappable landscape attributes holds practical and theoretical appeal. First principles suggest three carbon sources for subsurface microbes: (1) dissolved organic carbon leached from surface soils; (2) deep plant roots; and (3) buried, carbon-rich soil horizons deposited long <b>ago.</b> <b>Working</b> in Rhode Island USA at riparian zones mapped as outwash and alluvium, I investigated {{the relative importance of}} different carbon sources to 3 meters depth. Field and laboratory experiments showed that both roots and buried horizons can supply carbon in the shallow subsurface (40 - 75 cm), but that buried horizons dominate below 75 cm. Radiocarbon dates and results from ingrowth cores showed that roots 40 - 75 centimeters deep grow and decompose on decadal time scales and form patches of organic matter that may influence nitrogen removal from groundwater. However, in both alluvial and outwash profiles, most roots below 80 cm are relics (usually > 140 years old) and therefore do not act as direct carbon conduits between the surface and deep subsurface. Laboratory incubations of buried soils from many sites demonstrated that high rates of carbon mineralization associated with these soils are common. In-situ groundwater incubations and 14 C dating demonstrated that metabolism of ancient carbon constitutes at least 31 % of total carbon mineralization > 2 meters below the surface at some sites. My results suggest that: (1) the depth of the biologically active zone extends as deep as buried horizons; (2) on outwash and alluvium the riparian surface and subsurface are largely decoupled on time scales of months to years; (3) functional classifications of riparian zones intended to support management need to include buried horizons and recognize the limited influence of surface vegetation on subsurface biogeochemistry over short time frames...|$|E

In the next issue of human stem cells were considered successful until finally in 1998 the first report was published in the proliferation and differentiation of human {{embryonic stem cells}}. However, due to the occurrence of some restrictions on the production and use of embryonic stem cells (which are continuing to try to fix them) in the last few years, a new wave of research on adult stem cells began and continue. Adult stem cells in many organs and tissues of the body have been separated, {{but the important thing is}} that there are very few of these cells in each tissue in a specific area such as living tissue for years, until the advent of activated textural injury and illness. Adult stem cells found in tissues that are: Bone marrow, peripheral blood, brain, blood vessels, dental pulp, skeletal muscle, skin, liver, pancreas, cornea, retina, gastrointestinal system. Scientists in many laboratories are trying to ensure that adult stem cells into specific cell types in cell culture so that they can use for the treatment of diseases tissue damage. Stem cells can be used to reconstruct the cells or tissues that have been damaged by disease or injury. This type of treatment is known as cellular therapy. The use of cell therapy in multiple areas of vascular surgery is: 1 - Chronic limb ischemia. Beginning in 2002, the first report of successful treatment with stem cells in chronic ischemia was reported from Japan. This area rapidly expanded to other countries, and currently has more than fifty percent limb ischemia cell therapy centers in America. In our country, a study was started in 1386 and still continues. Initial reports in the journal of cytotherapy of America were published in 2010. In this study, 15 patients with chronic lower limb ischemia treated with bone marrow stem cells were extracted from the improvement in 80 % of patients. 2 - Diabetes and chronic foot ulcers. Studies in this area are very extensive in the world. Iran also has a very extensive study started. Result of the first study in this area was published in the journal of cytotherapy 2011.
