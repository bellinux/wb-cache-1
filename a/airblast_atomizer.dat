40|$|The driving {{mechanism}} of pulsations in gas turbine combustors {{depends on a}} complex interaction between flow field, chemistry, heat release and acoustics. In aeroengines with airblast nozzles, {{the response of the}} fuel, in terms of liquid fuel flux, atomization and evaporation to a fluctuating aerodynamical and thermochemical environment needs to be considered as well. The objective of this work was to investigate the response of the heat release and the liquid fuel distribution to forced periodic modulations of the primary air flow through a diffusion type burner using <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizers.</b> A second focus was on the investigation of the pressure effect and the influence of the nozzle exit geometry on fuel placement and its interaction with the heat release region. The spatial distribution of spray density and heat release at three different modulation frequencies was studied using simultaneous phase-resolved OH chemiluminescence for heat release visualization, and planar Mie scattering of kerosene in two airblast nozzles with different exit geometries. Experiments were performed for a variety of pressures, preheat temperatures, AFR values and modulation frequencies. The purpose of these experiments was to study the potential effect of the prefilmer on the impedance of the system, and its dependence on operating parameters. For one set of operating conditions, the dependence of the phase shift between plenum and combustor pressures on modulation frequency was studied as well. It was observed that the exit geometry of the nozzle has a considerable effect on the flame shape and fuel distribution, but also on the modulation depth of the response to forcing of the air flow. Superposition of fuel and heat release distributions shows that the expanding and contracting fuel spray cone during a period of the air flow modulation drives the region of the heat release, by establishing favourable flammability conditions at varying locations during the oscillation. Instantaneous and phase-averaged images of spray and heat release distribution were recorded at eight phase angles with 45 ° separation, to cover a full period of the oscillation. Within this phase resolution, no phase shift between spatially integrated fuel flux and heat release could be observed. If there is a changing impedance of the fuel flow caused by a potential storage effect on the prefilmer, it is too small to cause a phase shift variation with forcing frequency within the phase resolution of this experiment. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that the fuel-air mixing process is {{a critical factor in}} improving combustion efficiency and in minimizing pollutants such as NOx. Enhancement of fuel-air mixing can lead to lower pollutant emissions and greater efficiency. However, swirl-ing flows in lean combustors play the role of fuel-air mixing and flame stability. The complex fluid dynamic phenomena encountered in swirling two-phase flow contribute to the difficulty in complete understanding of the different processes occurring in combus-tors. Fortunately, optical and laser-based visualization techniques available in our lab are important nonintrusive tools for visualizing flow process, especially for fuel injection and fuel-air mixing. To provide for a better understanding of effects of counter-rotating flow on droplets in atomization process, this study is a detailed characterization of the spray generated by an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> by planar laser sheet imaging method.

Both fuel sprays were generated from an <b>airblast</b> type <b>atomizer</b> and compared {{under the same}} atomizing air-to-liquid mass ratio (ALR). Under non-reacting spray condition, droplet velocity profiles for both sprays peak at the centerline due to high atomizing air momentum, while the droplet size is smallest at the spray core. Palm biodiesel generated slightly larger droplet size compared to Jet-A 1 due {{to the effect of}} higher viscosity and lower volatility. Utilising an airblast atomizer-based swirl burner, spray flames of Jet-A 1 and palm biodiesel were established and compared under continuous, steady swirl conditions. The droplet velocity and diameter distributions within the reacting spray flames were significantly different compared to non-reacting spray due to interaction with swirl air flow and flame within the combustor. Spray flame reaction zones obtained via OH* chemiluminescence imaging showed that fuel droplets evaporated rapidly within 20 mm from the burner outlet.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{understanding of}} the breakup processes of two-phase flows is essential to effectively control the fuel atomization for future aircraft engines. A detailed insight into the phenomena of primary breakup is a major limitation in gaining this knowledge. Aircraft engines use airblast atomizers to provide the fuel atomization. The geometries of airblast atomizers are complex, the operating conditions are characterized by high Reynolds- and Weber numbers. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of liquid breakup under realistic conditions and geometries are hardly possible. The embedded DNS (eDNS) concept aims to fill this gap. The concept consists of three steps: a geometry simplification, the generation of realistic boundary conditions for the DNS and the DNS of the breakup region. The realistic annular <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> geometry is simplified to a planar geometry. Inside this domain the eDNS is located. The eDNS domain requires the generation of boundary conditions. A zonal Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the turbulent channel flow is performed prior to the DNS. The parameters are stored transiently on the “virtual” DNS inlet planes. These variables are then mapped to the DNS. The Volume of fluid (VOF) method is used to solve for the two-phase flow. DNS are performed for a shear-driven liquid wall film and for a generic planar prefilming <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer.</b> As the Reynolds and Weber number for the first operating point (OP) are low (Reair = 5, 333 /Wefilm = 1. 9), the liquid wall film {{as well as the}} liquid sheet show no surface waves. For the second case with Reair = 13, 333 and We film = 11. 9, the surface appears more wrinkled and streamwise waves are transported along the wall for the shear-driven wall film. Instantaneous snapshots in 2 –D and 3 –D illustrate the qualitative behavior of the liquid sheet in time. Leaving the prefilmer trailing edge, the liquid sheet starts to oscillate in a sinusoidal fashion. This oscillation appears crucial for the onset of primary breakup. The qualitative characterization of the breakup for OP 1 and OP 2, yield to the distinction of the stretched ligament breakup for the former, and the torn-sheet breakup for the latter O P. The breakup time for OP 1 is longer than for OP 2. This study proves the applicability of the eDNS concept for investigating breakup processes as the transient nature of the phase interface behavior can be captured. The approach offers the potential of simulating realistic annular highly-swirled <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> geometries under realistic conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a {{detailed}} programme of research on airblast atomization carried out using a specially designed atomizer in which the liquid is first spread into a thin sheet and then exposed on both sides to high velocity air. The primary aim of the investigation was to examine the influence of air and liquid properties on atomization quality. The work was divided into four main phases:- (1) The first phase was confined to the effects of liquid properties, namely viscosity, surface tension and density on mean drop size. Special liquids were produced to study the separate effect of each property on atomization quality. They presented a range of values of viscosity from 1. 0 to 124 centipoise, while surface tension and density were varied between 26 and 73. 5 dynes/cm and 0. 8 and 1. 8 gm/cm 3 respectively. Atomizing air velocities covered the range of practical interest to the designers of continuous combustion systems and varied between 60 and 125 m/sec. (2) To obtain experimental data on the influence of air properties, notably air density, on mean drop size, the air temperature was varied between 23 and 151 °C at atmospheric pressure in one series of experiments, while a separate study on the effect of air pressure on atomization quality was undertaken, where tests were conducted at constant levels of air velocity and temperature, using a range of liquid flows from 5 to 30 gm/sec, at various levels of air pressure between 1 and 8. 5 atm. (3) In order to provide a comprehensive picture of airb 1 ast atomizer performance over a wide range of conditions the separate effects of varying air velocity, liquid flow rate, and hence atomizing air/liquid mass ratio on SMD were examined. This study enabled {{a better understanding of the}} effects of changes in operation on the atomizer's performance. (4) In all three phases above, velotities of both inner and outer atomizing air streams were kept equal. This last phase was aimed at studying the effect of varying the velocity between the inner and outer air streams. Best atomization quality was achieved when 65 % of the total atomizing air was flowing through the outer stream. A detailed description of the light-scattering technique for drop size measurement is included.

40|$|Self-excited {{periodic}} instabilities in a staged {{lean burn}} injector {{could be forced}} by operating the combustor at off-design conditions. These pressure oscillations were studied in a high pressure single sector combustor with optical access. Two damper configurations were installed and tested {{with respect to their}} damping efficiency in relation to the configuration without dampers. For a variety of test conditions, derived from a part load case, time traces of pressure in the combustor were measured, and amplitudes were derived from their Fourier transformation. These measurements were performed for several combinations of the operating parameters, i. e., injector pressure drop, air/fuel ratio (AFR), pilot/main fuel split, and preheat temperature. These tests “ranked” the respective damper configurations and their individual efficiency with respect to the configuration without dampers. Although a general trend could be observed, the ranking was not strictly consistent for all operating conditions. For several test cases, preferably with pronounced self-excited pressure oscillations, phase-resolved planar optical measurement techniques were applied to investigate the change of spatial structures of fuel, reaction zones, and temperature distributions over a period of an oscillation. A pulsating motion was detected for both pilot and main flame, driven by a pulsating transport of the liquid fuel. This pulsation, in turn, is caused by a fluctuating air velocity, in connection with a prefilming <b>airblast</b> type <b>atomizer.</b> A phase shift between pilot and main injector heat release was observed, corresponding to a shift of fuel penetration. Local Rayleigh indices were calculated qualitatively, based on phase-resolved OH chemiluminescence used as marker for heat release, and corresponding pressure values.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study that}} has been performed to investigate different phenomena exhibited by a spray generated by an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer.</b> Three main subjects are addressed: • Characterization of the spray generated by an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> at various operating conditions, including ambient pressure, airflow rate and liquid flow rate. • Investigation of instationary phenomena in spray, its natural and forced oscillations • Modelling of spray atomization inside the nozzle Characterization of both liquid and gas phases of the two-phase flow of an airblast spray is performed using high-speed video imaging, Particle Image Velocimetry and the phase Doppler technique. Three velocity components profiles and size distribution of the droplets in the spray are obtained. The effect of three parameters on the velocity profile and the size distribution, namely; chamber pressure, liquid flow rate and airflow rate has been thoroughly investigated. The collected data {{can be used for}} the validation of the numerical Euler-Lagrange code developed for simulation of spray propagation. Next, spray fluctuations at various chamber pressures are characterized using two techniques, namely; Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of time-resolved images and spectral analysis of laser Doppler velocity data. The airblast spray frequency exhibited a strong dependency on the chamber pressure and the gas-phase flow rate and is totally independent of the liquid phase flow rate. The obtained frequencies from both techniques match each other closely. Scaling analysis of the spray frequency demonstrates that it depends only on the average air velocity at the nozzle outlet and on the atomizer geometry. A specific Strouhal number is proposed which {{could be used as a}} predictive tool for the determination of spray frequencies at various operational conditions. The value of the Strouhal number depends only on the geometry and type of the atomizer. For the atomizer used in this study the empirical value of the Strouhal number is determined as. The effect of oscillating downstream pressure conditions on the airblast spray is qualitatively investigated. It is found that small pressure oscillating magnitudes has a noticeable effect on the spray behavior. Furthermore, the penetration velocity of the spray under the oscillating pressure conditions is estimated by analyzing the high-speed video images. It is found that the penetration velocity and the oscillation frequency increase when increasing the chamber pressure. Then, in order to better understand the mechanism of film formation in an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> with pre-filmer, an auxiliary series of spray impact experiments onto inclined targets experiments are performed the outcome of the impingement process is investigated. The film thickness of the residual liquid on the target is estimated by processing high-speed video images whereas the ejected droplets are characterized using the phase Doppler technique. The experimental data is used to express the film thickness as function of the primary spray parameters. Finally, a novel scaling analysis for the droplet size in the airblast spray is proposed based on the energy balance principle in the framework of the chaotic disintegration theory. The model is validated by the comparison with the experimental data from this and other studies...|$|E

The aerosol-to-aerosol transmission efficiency for the AAC configuration was found to be approximately 50 % for 1 ?m diameter particles as compared with 70 ? 100 % for the White-type cyclone. A time response test was performed in which the White-type (ca. 2003) cyclone had an initial response of 3 minutes for a condition where there was no liquid carryover through the cyclone outlet and 8 minutes on average with hydrosol carryover. The decay response of the White-type cyclone was 1. 25 minutes for non-liquid carryover conditions. The AAC had an initial response of 2. 75 minutes and a decay response of 2. 5 minutes. The shortened version of the AAC had an initial response of 1. 5 minutes and a decay response of 1. 25 minutes. There was no liquid carryover observed for any tests of this cyclone configuration. Power consumption tests were performed comparing pressure drops across different variations of White-type cyclones (circa 2003 and 1999) including a variation with an electrical discharge machined (EDM) inlet profile, that reduces the pressure drop at a nominal air flowrate of 780 L/min from 18 inH 2 O for the basic White-type cyclone (ca. 2003) to 16 inH 2 O with use of the EDM inlet. Two different variations of White-type cyclones were found to have pressure drops of 25 inH 2 O and 18 inH 2 O at an air flowrate of 780 L/min...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaporation}} {{and mixing}} of kerosine {{emerging from a}} flat prefilming <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> was studied experimentally and numerically in an optical accessible, straight rectangular duct at conditions relevant for lean premixed and prevaporized combustion. Liquid phase properties were measured by Phase-Doppler anemometry and fuel vapour concentrations were determined by an infrared light extinction technique. Computations {{were based on the}} Lagrangian particle tracking technique, and captured the spray features sufficiently well with and without taking into account the spray feddback on the gas field. A degree of evaporation of 95 % was measured after 100 mm for 9 bar air pressure, 750 K air temperature and 120 m/s for air velocity. No autoignition of the fuel occurred. Parametric variations of pressure, temperature and velocity of the air flow, {{as well as of the}} initial temperature of the spray and of fuel loading were conducted. A strong influence of the initial fuel temperature of the spray and of fuel loading were conducted. A strong influence of the initial fuel temperature on evaporation was found. The air pressure had mainly an indirect but strong effect through atomization quality...|$|E
40|$|Liquid sheet {{breakup of}} a prefilming and nonprefilming <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> is {{investigated}} experimentally at ambient temperatures and elevated pressures of air. The breakup is studied by High-Speed flow visualization. The visualizations show {{the differences between}} both types of atomizers [...] For lower liquid loadings the atomizer edge is always wetted in the prefilming case whereas dry zones are observed for the nonprefilming injector. Different atomization regimes are observed for rising Weber numbers on the prefilmer: Wavy sheet breakup below We = 100, surface stripping above 380 and a transition zone in between. The nonprefilming case always exhibits wavy sheet breakup, provided there is a sheet at the outlet, with the breakup length reducing to 0, 5 mm above We 100. Liquid sheet thickness is characterized with side view images. Films which are thin compared to the edge thickness and are not composed of ligaments at the edge wrap around the edge and therefore exhibit a storage mechanism. In the far field dropsizes are characterized with a global SMD measured by PDA. The measured dropsizes, influencd by primary and secondary atomization show only small {{differences between the two}} types of atomizers. Correlations for the final drop size are obtained for both atomizers types for the conditions investigated...|$|E
40|$|Envisaged {{application}} of biodiesel in gas turbine engines or furnaces requires extensive {{tests on the}} deflagration properties of biodiesel. The laminar flame speeds of Palm Methyl Esters (PME) and blends of PME with conventional fuels are determined using the jet-wall stagnation flame configuration. The same technique {{is also used to}} measure the laminar flame speed of diesel, Jet-A 1, n-heptane, acetone, methane and methane/acetone. The spray atomization characteristics of a plain-jet <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> are investigated using a phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) under non-reacting conditions. The droplet size and velocity distribution of biodiesels are compared to conventional fuels. For spray combustion investigations, a generic gas turbine-type combustor is developed to compare the spray flame established from PME, rapeseed methyl esters (RME), diesel, Jet-A 1 and biodiesel blends. The spray droplet characteristics in the flame and the flow field in the combustor are investigated. Chemiluminescence imaging of OH* and CH* are applied to capture the global flame structure and heat release region. Flame spectroscopy and long bandpass filtered imaging at > 550 nm are performed to evaluate the tendency of soot formation. In general, biodiesels exhibit flame shapes and spray droplet characteristics that are comparable to conventional fuels. In spite of the higher fuel specific consumption, the emission of NOx is found to be lower for biodiesels compared to conventional fuels. The results show that biodiesels can potentially be used as alternative fuels for gas turbine operation...|$|E
40|$|Experimental data on {{evaporation}} of {{droplets of}} decane, Jet-A 1, and Jet-A 1 surrogate are generated using a spray in crossflow configuration. The {{advantage of a}} crossflow configuration is that it enables us to study droplet evaporation under forced convective conditions involving droplet diameters of size relevant in practical combustors. Specifically, spray from an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> is injected into a preheated crossflow of air and the resulting spray is characterized in terms of spray structure along with droplet size and velocity. An existing correlation for the spray trajectory is modified to incorporate the effect of elevated temperature, and {{is found to be}} in good agreement with the experimental data. Droplet sizes and velocities are measured at different locations along the crossflow direction to assess droplet evaporation. Specifically, droplets having size less than 25 -mu m are selected for further analysis since these droplets are observed to exhibit velocities which are aligned with the crossflow. By comparing the droplet diameter profiles at upstream and downstream locations, the evaporation constant k for the d(2) -law is obtained iteratively. To assess the efficacy of the values of k obtained, the calculated droplet size distribution using the proposed k values at the downstream location is compared with the measured droplet size distribution at that location. A reasonably good match is found for all the three liquids confirming the validity of the analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|For the {{investigation}} of periodic unsteady phenomena in gas turbine combustors, an off-line phase-sorting method was developed and applied to retrieve phase-resolved data from randomly sampled single pulse images. Simultaneously recorded real-time traces of reference data (e. g. pressure or spatially integrated chemiluminescence) {{were used to determine}} the local amplitude, phase and frequency of the combustion oscillation combining mode decomposition and the Hilbert transformation. This method was used to investigate self excited combustion oscillations in a gas turbine model combustor with <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> at realistic operating conditions at elevated pressures up to 12 bar. Phase resolved images of the fuel distribution (planar Mie scattering, kerosene PLIF), reaction zone (OH chemiluminescence using Abel inversion) and the temperature field (simultaneous absorption and PLIF measurement of OH) are presented. In technical combustion systems OH PLIF measurements lead generally to the problems of laser absorption and of the interference of OH and kerosene LIF. The simultaneous detection of the PLIF signal by two cameras using different spectral filters reduces the interference substantially. A simultaneous measurement of laser absorption and OH LIF allows a laser absorption correction and an absolute calibration of the OH PLIF image in terms of local number densities. The temperature can be deduced assuming OH equilibrium concentration in lean flames (phi< 0. 9), where [OH] is nearly independent of phi and a function of temperature only. The high temperature sensitivity of this method, which is about 8 times higher than the sensitivity of the frequently used OH 2 -line thermometry, enables a reliable evaluation of single-pulse temperature images...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{numerical}} simulations with combustion {{for predicting}} the flow field in a gas turbine combustor or afterburner {{may reduce the}} required time in the development process. To investigate the performance of numerical simulation codes some different combustor geometries was studied. By combining water tunnel tests, engine rig data and numerical simulations, conclusions were made regarding the cause for pressure oscillations in a studied afterburner. The numerical predicted flow field characteristics was verified by water tunnel testing and the measured thrust effective efficiency characteristics versus afterburn equivalence ratio was qualitatively predicted in the numerical simulations. To get a detailed evaluation of computer codes with combustion a specially designed test rig was built at Volvo Flygmotor AB. In this rig different types of bluff body flameholders were tested and several non-intrusive, as well as conventional measurement techniques, were applied on the premixed system. Two different numerical methods, a standard stationary flow solver with a k-. epsilon. model, and an inhouse developed large eddy simulation (LES) technique were applied. The calculation results were compared with gas analysis, LDA-data and for the LES also with temperature pdf's. The simulations with the k-. epsilon. model showed an underprediction of the generated turbulent kinetic energy behind the flameholder leading to an underprediction of the mixing process. Corresponding results using the LES code improved the results and demonstrated that the large eddy simulation technique captured most of the significant features of the studied turbulent premixed flame. A vaporisation liquid droplet model has also been implemented into the LES code and applied on an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer.</b> Parcels representing varying number of physical droplets of specified initial sizes are injected and followed in time while exchanging momentum, energy and mass with the surrounding gas...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure atomized burners include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer</b> which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A burner head has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and combustion head the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a solenoid pump and flow metering orifice. At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and metering orifice to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this task is the characterization of the temporal and spatial fuel placement in a two-phase flow downstream of a fuel-air nozzle at elevated pressure. The activity pursues a two-fold goal: One focus area is the detection and analysis of temporal fluctuations in the 2 -phase flow. Specifically, {{the response of the}} liquid fuel placement to a periodic modulation of the primary air flow is investigated. These fluctuations may be a contributing factor to combustion instabilities, which represent a major problem for the operation of lean premixed combustion systems. The second focus area is the investigation of the pressure effect on fuel placement. This activity can be considered as a continuation and extension of work performed within the ACIACOC project. The {{objective of}} that project was to investigate the response of the heat release to forced modulations of the air flow through a diffusion type burner using an <b>airblast</b> <b>atomizer.</b> In this task, the same configurations and operating parameters studied within ACIACOC have been investigated again, but this time with additional emphasis on the response of fuel placement and its interaction with heat release following forced modulation of the burner air flow. The test program of this task was conducted in three stages. The first two stages consisted of isothermal tests at elevated pressure up to 20 bar, as well as tests with preheated air without combustion. These test aimed at characterization of fluctuations in the liquid fuel flux and in droplet sizes. Also, time-resolved measurements of fluctuations in the fuel vapour concentration by applying the Fast Fourier Transformation to IR/vis light extinction data were performed. The 2 -phase flow in a chemically reacting environment was the subject of the third stage of the activity. In this case, there exists the potential for amplification of fuel flux fluctuations by non-steady heat release in the reaction zone or by preferential combustion in zones characterized by relatively small droplet sizes. It was the goal of the tests of the third stage to relate the non-steady 2 -phase flow with non-steady heat release in the reaction zone. At one fixed value of swirl intensity, phase-resolved spatial fuel placement was measured by planar Mie scattering using a pulsed laser light sheet technique. Simultaneously, heat release was visualized by chemiluminescence of the OH radical. Both quantities were recorded over a period of a forced air flow modulation. ...|$|E
