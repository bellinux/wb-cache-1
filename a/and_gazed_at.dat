500|$|On {{hearing of}} the Dutch show of force, {{aboriginal}} tribes from further afield decided to submit to Dutch rule, either through fear of Dutch military might or hope that such an alliance would prove beneficial to the tribe. Representatives came from Pangsoia (Pangsoya; modern-day Linbian, Pingtung), 100km to the south, to ally themselves with the VOC. The Dutch decided to hold a landdag (a grand convention) to welcome all the villages into the fold and impress them with Dutch largesse and power. This duly took place on 22 February 1636, with 28 villages represented from southern and central Formosa. The governor presented the attendees with robes and staffs of state to symbolise their position, and Robert Junius wrote that [...] "it was delightful to see the friendliness of these people when they {{met for the first}} time, to notice how they kissed each other <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> one another. Such a thing had never before been witnessed in this country, as one tribe was nearly always waging war against another." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Time Ships, Stephen Baxter's {{sequel to}} The Time Machine, the Time Traveller {{encounters}} his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self's {{knowledge of his}} real names: [...] "I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. [...] "No. I will use—if you will permit—Moses." [...] He took a deep pull on his brandy, <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> me with genuine anger in his grey eyes. [...] "How {{do you know about}} that?" [...] Moses—my hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school—and which I had kept a secret since leaving home!" [...] This is a reference to H.G. Wells's story [...] "The Chronic Argonauts", the story which grew into The Time Machine, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells's first inventor graces another character in Baxter's book (see above).|$|E
2500|$|On May 19, 1936, Abe went {{shopping}} {{and saw a}} movie. Under a pseudonym, she stayed in an inn in Shinagawa on May 20, where she had a massage and drank three bottles of beer. She spent the day writing farewell letters to Omiya, a friend, and Ishida. She planned to commit suicide {{one week after the}} murder, and practiced necrophilia. [...] "I felt attached to Ishida's penis and thought that only after taking leave from it quietly could I then die. I unwrapped the paper holding them <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> his penis and scrotum. I put his penis in my mouth and even tried to insert it inside me... It didn't work however though I kept trying and trying. Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to legend {{it was so}} {{magnificent}} and impressive, Napoleon {{who stood}} {{on the threshold of}} this synagogue in 1812 <b>and</b> <b>gazed</b> <b>at</b> the interior was speechless with admiration. The synagogue had a number of entrances. One, at street level, consisted of a pair of iron gates that had been donated by a tailors' society in 1640. The other entrance on the western side, added in 1800, was a bit more imposing: it had an elevated two-tiered wooden gable with a portal and wrought iron posts. There was a heavy iron door with an original Hebrew inscription indicating it was a gift of a [...] "society of Psalm reciters" [...] in 1642. At the time of its building, ecclesiastical regulations all through Europe specified that a synagogue could not be built higher than a church. To obey the law, and yet create the necessary interior height, it was customary to dig a foundation deep enough for the synagogue’s floor level to be well below that of the street. Outside, the synagogue looked to be about three stories tall, but inside it soared to over five stories. Another entrance with a vestibule and the [...] "pillory" [...] was located on the northern side of the building.|$|E
