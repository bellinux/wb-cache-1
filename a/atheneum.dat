5000|$|Once {{the public}} library {{proposal}} was suggested by Mayor Smyth, the <b>Atheneum's</b> collection was officially transferred to the city's possession on September 6, 1854, and was housed at 6 Patten Block off Elm Street, next to City Hall. It officially {{opened to the public}} November 8, 1854, with Francis B. Eaton as Head Librarian. His salary was $315.50 per year. [...] The collection started with fewer than 200 volumes.|$|R
50|$|The Conservatory was {{an active}} part of the musical life of Hartford, {{and the home of}} {{orchestra}} and vocal groups that formed {{a major part of the}} arts scene especially in the first half of the twentieth century. Not only sacred and secular classical music performances, but city premieres of avant-garde works were presented under Conservatory sponsorship in collaboration with the Wadsworth <b>Atheneum’s</b> Chick Austin and other Hartford notables.|$|R
5|$|Péladan {{agreed to}} lecture {{in front of}} Societatea Ileana at the <b>Atheneum,</b> and his subject of choice was The Genius of the Latin Race. His mystical {{doctrine}} was received with much skepticism and amusement by the Romanian literary chroniclers. The visit then turned to scandal: Péladan issued a call for all Romanians to embrace Catholicism, and left the country on pain of being deported.|$|E
5|$|The Tombs of Atuan is {{a fantasy}} novel by the American author Ursula K.

5|$|Although Stoenescu was {{a disciple}} of his, Macedonski favored Caion in this dispute, and {{employed}} {{him to write}} more denunciations of Caragiale in the magazine Forța Morală. Forța Morală expanded on the initial accusations, claiming to have discovered an entire history of plagiarism in Caragiale's writings (from Victorien Sardou to Alfred Duru). Following Macedonski's intercession, Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu, who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian <b>Atheneum</b> conference (January 24, 1902).|$|E
5000|$|The Wadsworth, {{as it is}} most {{commonly}} known, was constructed {{on the site of}} the family home of Daniel Wadsworth in the heart of downtown Hartford. Its architects were Alexander Jackson Davis and Ithiel Town, who designed the [...] "castle" [...] that is the <b>Atheneum's</b> oldest building. Construction began in 1842 after the museum was incorporated on June 1 of that year. The museum opened on July 31, 1844 and has operated continuously since then.|$|R
5000|$|As a {{prominent}} member of Boston’s society, Parker found himself inevitably {{immersed in the}} city’s cultural organizations. In 1815 Parker was listed as a Trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, in 1826 was noted to have contributed $100, and in the years ranging 1821, 1844, and 1850 was noted as a subscriber and proprietor. [...] Parker {{was also one of}} a number of patrons and trustees that contributed to the commission of the first painting to join the <b>Atheneum’s</b> collection; a portrait of the organizations benefactor James Perkins by Gilbert Stuart.|$|R
50|$|In 1928 Austin founded The Friends and Enemies of Modern Music, {{a society}} that {{sponsored}} premieres or early performances of works by composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Charles Ives, Erik Satie, and Virgil Thomson, as well as Vivaldi, Scarlatti, and Couperin (played on period instruments). The 1936 American premiere of Satie's symphonic drama Socrate, for example, featured one of Alexander Calder's early mobiles. An innovation begun in 1929 was the showing of motion pictures (foreign, experimental, and Hollywood) seven years before films were shown at the Museum of Modern Art. The most far-reaching of Austin's theatrical ventures was the Wadsworth <b>Atheneum's</b> sponsorship, at Lincoln Kirstein's request, of choreographer George Balanchine's immigration to the United States in 1933, originally to found the School of American Ballet in Hartford.|$|R
5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by <b>Atheneum,</b> which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help the homeowners reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E

2500|$|Having severed {{ties with}} The Russian Messenger, Leskov {{found himself in}} serious {{financial}} trouble. This was relieved to an extent by his invitation in January 1874 to join the Scholarly Committee of the Ministry of Education (for this he owed much to the Empress consort Maria Alexandrovna who was known to have read The Cathedral Clergy and spoke warmly to it), where his duty was to choose literature for Russian libraries and <b>atheneums</b> for a meager wage of one thousand rubles per year. In 1874 Leskov began writing Wandering Lights: A Biography of Praotsev which was soon halted and later printed as Early Years: From Merkula Praotsev’s Memoirs. It was during the publication of this work that the author made a comment which was later seen as his artistic manifesto: [...] "Things pass by us and I'm not going to diminish or boost their respective significance; I won't be forced into doing so by the unnatural, man-made format of the novel which demands the rounding up of fabulas and the drawing together of plotlines to one central course. That's not how life is. Human life runs on {{in its own way}} and that's how I'm going to treat the roll of events in my works." ...|$|R

[...] Also in 1986, Winters' Playroom {{was held at the}} Institute for Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts. The exhibition was part of Think Tank, a retrospective of Winters' work which traveled to the Stedeliljk Museum in the Netherlands, the Centre Regional d’Art Contemporain in France, and the Contemporary Arts Center in Ohio. [...] In the Playroom, walls were covered with paper and cardboard boxes were placed in the room, all with the purpose of the audience being able to create their own art. Both children and adults were encouraged to participate.Winters spent a month in 1989 working with students at the San Francisco Art Institute. Never having worked with ceramics, he spent the month making numerous ceramic pieces, which were then shown in the aptly named One Month in San Francisco. Other components of the piece included Winters’ childhood bottle collection and a video showing each piece in the show filmed briefly next to a ruler. [...] Also that year, Robin served as a visiting artist at the Pilchuck Glass School. Winters again explored the accessibility of art, as he did in Playroom, with his exhibition Train of Thought/Objects of Influence, held in 1989 at both the Wadsworth <b>Atheneum's</b> Lion and Matrix galleries in Hartford, Connecticut. The use of such devices as audiotapes, Braille-like mono-types, low display furniture, wide aisles and ramps, and walls with colors and scents to make sure that his target audience of the visually and auditory impaired were included. Winters also made a number of objects available to the audience so that they could handle them, adding another sensory element to the show. [...] The artist has been quoted as saying, [...] "My work is about the interplay between the artist and viewer." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy has shown {{its ability to}} determine the 3 D (dimensional) structure of gaseous ions. Using this technique, the structures of small biologically relevant ions such as amino acids and nucleic acid bases bound with a proton or metal cations in the gas-phase were determined. The necessity of employing computational methods to analyze and interpret the experimental data has been demonstrated. However, the computational results must be analyzed with extreme caution to prevent any incorrect conclusions. Among the parameters one has to consider when dealing with the computational results is the experimental method used to obtain the data. For example, the simulated IR spectra for {{only two of the}} four lowest-energy protonated adenine dimer isomers were similar to the experimental IRMPD while, based on gas-phase calculations, the four lowest-energy structures were almost isoenergetic. Since the ions were produced by electrospray ionization (ESI) from the solution phase, the effect of water as a solvent was considered by applying two independent computational approaches to take solvation effects into account. Polarizable continuum model (PCM) calculations as well as microsolvation with five explicit water molecules calculations showed that water only preferentially stabilizes these two observed isomers, consistent with the interpretation of the IRMPD spectra. The results suggest great caution is required when using gas-phase calculations to predict the structures of gaseous ions borne in solution by ESI. [...] To investigate the influence of solvent on the structure of ions, an experimental method was developed to produce solvated ions in the gas-phase. These solvated ions then were investigated by IRMPD spectroscopy and blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD) to obtain kinetic and thermodynamic data. The solvation of electrosprayed ions occurs in the accumulation/collision hexapole of a hybrid quadrupole-Fourier transform mass spectrometer (Q-FTMS) by introducing the solvent into the collision cell. The most sensitive parameters based on our experience were the collision energy in the hexapole, the pressure of both collision gas and solvent in the hexapole, ion accumulation time, and the chemical nature of the species. This method was successfully applied to adenine and thymine cluster ions to produce multiply hydrated ions. The structures of singly hydrated ions were determined by IRMPD spectroscopy. [...] Due to the importance of m-DNA (metalated-DNA), an attempt to investigate the structure of singly hydrated thymine zinc ion-bound dimer was initiated. It was found that thymine loses one proton in the presence of zinc. Therefore, the [(Thy₂-H) -Zn-(H₂O) ]+ cluster was singly charged. Solely comparing the IRMPD spectrum in the 3100 - 3850 cm⁻¹ and simulated IR spectra was not sufficient to assign only one structure to the observed spectrum. Based on thermodynamical values, the two lowest energy structures were assigned as possible structures under the experimental conditions. In the most stable structure, the water is directly attached to the zinc in the zinc ion-bound dimer in which the Zn²⁺ is shared between the two <b>atheneums</b> at N 3 O 4 sites. Furthermore, computational data suggested that recording an IRMPD spectrum in the 1800 - 2800 cm⁻¹ region might be useful to distinguish between the two lowest energy structures. Therefore, recording the spectrum for the [(Thy₂-H) -Zn-(H₂O) ]+ cluster in this lower energy region is part of the future work...|$|R
