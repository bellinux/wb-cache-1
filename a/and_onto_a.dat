5|$|In 1975, NC98 was rerouted in Durham: {{replacing}} the old alignment to US15 Bus./US501 Bus. via Miami Boulevard and Geer Street, to Holloway Street (westbound)/Chapel Hill Street-Liberty Street (eastbound) and its current western terminus. In 1978, NC98 replaced part of US64's routing {{to its current}} eastern terminus. In 1981, part of NC98 was abandoned and placed on new construction {{as a result of}} the creation of Falls Lake; remnants of the old alignment that were not submerged became secondary roads. In 2006, NC98 was rerouted south along US1 <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> new four-lane bypass south of Wake Forest to Jones Dairy Road; its old alignment becoming NC98 Business. In 2011, NC98 was removed from US1 and placed onto new construction east of Falls of Neuse Road; NC98 Business was also realigned, starting further east along a new alignment of Durham Road.|$|E
5|$|NY414 {{has been}} {{truncated}} twice over the years. The {{first of these}} occurred on January1, 1949, when it was cut back on its southern end to Corning. NY414 was truncated to its current northern terminus in the mid-1960s following {{the construction of the}} super two highway for US104 between Sodus and NY414. US104 continued to use the former alignment of NY414 along Lake Bluff Road to connect to Ridge Road until the remainder of the super two east to Red Creek was completed in the early 1970s. This portion of Lake Bluff Road is now maintained by Wayne County as CR254. In Seneca County, NY414 was realigned slightly in the early 1950s to bypass the hamlet of Romulus to the east, moving it off CR148 and NY96 <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> new road leading directly to Ovid.|$|E
5|$|The Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Rail Road had {{originally}} {{been part of a}} loop that traveled along the existing route. The line diverges from the present-day Atlantic and Long Beach Branches east of Valley Stream station in Valley Stream, New York. Eastbound trains continued south then southwest, through Five Towns and the Rockaway Peninsula, <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> trestle across Jamaica Bay through Queens where it reconnected with the Rockaway Beach Branch; westbound trains did the reverse, using the Rockaway Beach Branch to cross the trestle, go through the Rockaways and Five Towns, and continue northeast then north to join the westbound Atlantic Branch.|$|E

5|$|With the Mujahideen's help, Bond {{plants a}} bomb aboard the cargo plane {{carrying}} the opium, but is spotted {{and has no}} choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep into the back of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men gain an important victory over the Soviets. Bond returns to Tangier to kill Whitaker, infiltrating his estate with the help of his ally Felix Leiter, as Pushkin arrests Koskov, sending him back to Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, NY151 was rerouted off High Street <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> new roadway, Barracks Road, in the {{vicinity}} of Rensselaer. As a result, the roadway no longer entered the Rensselaer city limits. It was re-extended into the city by way of Third Avenue in the late 1990s when NY43 was rerouted to meet I-90 at the new exit8 west of Defreestville. Like NY43 before it, NY151 terminated at an interchange linking Third Avenue to US9 and US20.|$|E

25|$|Extremely durable {{high-grade}} {{concrete and}} reinforcing steel were used throughout {{construction of the}} pre-cast components, with the estimated lifespan of the bridge being in excess of 100 years.

500|$|US77 {{has never}} been a long route in Iowa. [...] It was {{extended}} into Iowa in 1929, overlapping US20 across the Combination Bridge and onto Perry Street.

500|$|The song's lyrics, which discuss escapism, are {{constructed}} {{in a way}} resemblant of nursery rhymes. During the chorus, Ellis-Bextor sings [...] "It's just my imagination / Running away / Girl's gotta have a little daydream / It's a secret escape / It's just my imagination / Running away / Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay". Considine highlighted [...] "I could tie up the bed sheets and slide down the house / Be gone before the morning comes" [...] as lyrics exemplificative of Ellis-Bextor's [...] "artistic freedom" [...] in Wanderlust. Reviewing the song for Loud and Quiet, Stuart Stubbs wrote that it [...] "sees our protagonist pull herself out of squalor <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> road of self discovery." [...] The song concludes with a short outro where Ellis-Bextor repeats the line [...] "Don't worry baby, I'm here to stay" [...] twice.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Stephan Lynn, {{head of the}} Emergency Department, who {{had been}} called in again after having just {{returned}} home after a 13-hour-long work shift, received Lennon {{in the emergency room}} at Roosevelt Hospital a few minutes before 11:00 pm, when Officers Frauenberger and Moran arrived, with Moran carrying Lennon on his back from their squad car <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> gurney, into the emergency room demanding a doctor for a multiple gunshot wound victim. When Lennon arrived, he had no pulse and was not breathing. Dr. Lynn, two other doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for 10 to 15 minutes {{in a desperate attempt to}} resuscitate him. As a last resort, Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation, but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great.|$|E
500|$|Frank Capra's The Bitter Tea of General Yen was {{not quite}} the same type of film: Stanwyck plays a missionary who goes to civil-war-torn China and meets the titular general (played by Nils Asther) after his car kills the driver of her rickshaw. When she is knocked {{unconscious}} in a riot, he takes her out of the rabble <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> train car. She has lurid, horror-themed, symbolic dreams about the General, in which she is both titillated and repulsed by him. The film breaks precedent by developing into an interracial love story, but his army ends in ruins. Yen kills himself at the film's conclusion—by drinking poisoned tea—rather than be captured and killed. Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation. Cinematographer Joseph Walker tested a new technique he created, which he dubbed [...] "Variable Diffusion", in filming the picture. This rendered the entire picture in very soft focus.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to stop {{the success of the}} former company salesman, Ellwood and Washburn-Moen filed for an {{injunction}} to stop the business of Southern Wire Company. The suit, filed in U. S. District Court, claimed the machines Gates and Clifford used in the production of their product were a direct copy of those used by Washburn-Moen. [...] The suit also called for Gates and Clifford to pay US$100,000 in damages to the company. As they avoided process servers, Gates and Clifford made a plan to save their company. [...] They were able to rent a building in East St. Louis, Illinois and moved their equipment out of the factory <b>and</b> <b>onto</b> <b>a</b> ferryboat after dark. [...] After they crossed the Mississippi River, the machines were out of the jurisdiction of the St. Louis U. S. District Court and were back in business the next day.
