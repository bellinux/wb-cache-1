By eating some of these toxic plants, the caterpillars sequester <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> which renders both the caterpillars and the butterflies of some of these as toxic, thus protecting them from predators.

2500|$|The {{caterpillars}} are voracious eaters but {{move very}} little; {{a small group}} will defoliate an entire vine. If starved due to overcrowding, the caterpillars may resort to cannibalism. Fleshy spine-like tubercles line the caterpillars' backs, and their bodies are dark red to brown and velvety black. Some species have tubercles of contrasting colours, often red, or pale [...] "saddle" [...] markings. Like other members of their family, birdwing caterpillars possess a retractable organ behind their heads called an osmeterium. Shaped like the forked tongue of a snake, the osmeterium excretes a fetid terpene-based compound and is deployed when the caterpillar is provoked. The caterpillars are also unappealing to most predators due to their toxicity: the vines which the caterpillars feed upon contain <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid,</b> a poisonous compound known to be carcinogenic in rats. The feeding caterpillars incorporate and concentrate the <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> into their tissues, where the poison will persist through metamorphosis and into adulthood.|$|E

50|$|Aristolochia macrophylla {{contains}} the natural substance <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid.</b> Aristoclochic acid {{is found in}} all plants of the Aristolochiaceae family. <b>Aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is a very dangerous}} compound in that this acid is a potent mutagen and carcinogen that can cause urological cancers as well as permanent kidney failure. Consumption of <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> can also induce uterine bleeding.

5000|$|The aristolochic acids {{are among}} a group of {{substituted}} 10-nitro-1-phenantropic acids, biogenetically derived from benzylisoquinoline precursors, which in turn originate from tyrosine. The biosynthesis of <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid,</b> therefore, begins at tyrosine (2), which is converted to L-DOPA (3). DOPA is subsequently converted into dopamine (4) and further converstion of dopamine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (5) (or 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde to yield reticuline), results in the formation of norlaudanosoline (6) via a spontaneous Pictet-Spengler condensation of the two molecules. [...] Evidence of these precursors was confirmed by 14C experiments where labeled compounds were administered to Aristolochia sipho and <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> was successfully extracted. Modification of norlaudanosoline is continued with a methylation of two alcohol groups to give orientaline (7). Orientaline undergoes a cyclization event to give the addition of the 5-membered ring into orientalinol (8), subsequently undergoing a methyl shift and aromatization event (9) to yield prestephanine (10). The final steps are the formation of stephanine (11) and the addition of a carboxylate to yield <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> (12). Comer et al. originally proposed a postulated pathway from norlaudanosoline to <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> in 1968 very similar to the described pathway, but Sharma et al. confirmed the presence of the intermediate compounds via DL-3-14C tyrosine trapping experiments in Aristolochia bracteata in 1982. After the general backbone of <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> is synthesized, postsynthetic modifications are performed; for example, aromatization of one of the rings yields <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acid</b> I.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAristolochia (馬兜鈴 mădōu ling) is an {{important}} genus widely cultivated and had long been known for their extensive use in traditional Chinese medicine.

40|$|Introduction: Endemic (Balkan) Nephropathy is {{a chronic}} renal disease mainly {{affecting}} rural {{populations in the}} valleys of the Danube. In the absence of renal replacement therapy, it leads to fatal kidney failure and is significantly associated with upper urothelial carcinoma. Bread poisoning with <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids</b> is now widely accepted. The source of this toxic substance {{is considered to be}} Aristolochia clematitis, a perennial plant that invades farming fields. The poisoning with <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids</b> was suggested when clinical and histopathological changes similar to those observed in the Balkan patients were reported in several cases of nephropathy in Belgian patients unintentionally exposed to <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids</b> during a Chinese herbs diet. Those clinical and histopathological features were then reproduced in laboratory experimental models. Methods: Using metabonomics, an emerging dynamic technique that allows an effective mapping of alterations in endogenous metabolites levels in biofluids and tissues, we evaluated early signs of renal toxicity from extra urine samples collected in a rat model of intoxication with <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids.</b> Results: Changes in urine composition were consistent with a proximal tubular damage, most likely initiated by a mitochondrial default and an inappropriate response to oxidative stress. The same metabonomic approach was applied to surplus of urine samples collected from Belgian and Croatian patients in clinical and epidemiological studies, respectively. It allowed a clear discrimination of the Belgian patients from a database of healthy volunteers. On the other hand, a trend to discrimination was noticed when comparing urine samples collected from individuals living in Croatian endemic regions as compared to Croatian non endemic villages. Finally, when included in the same analysis, both Belgian and Croatian patients displayed similar urine metabolic signatures, suggesting a common etiology of both diseases. © 2012 Duquesne M, et al.

40|$|A novel {{method has}} been {{developed}} for the purification of <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids</b> and aristololactams compounds from Aristolochia plants, a kind of typically toxic traditional Chinese medicine. In this method, Oligo (ethylene glycol) separation column which has "clustering function" for compounds in TCMs was used to produce the fractions containing the compounds with similar structures. A four-channel parallel preparative HPLC with C 18 separation column was employed to purify the target compounds. The extraction sample of the blending of Radix Aristolochiae, Fructus Aristolochiae and Caulis Aristolochiae Manshuriensis was used to develop the method. Then, four <b>aristolochic</b> <b>acids</b> and three aristololactams were obtained using this method and the chemical identification was confirmed by Q-TOF-MS, (1) H NMR and (13) C NMR. Thus, this method can deal {{with more than one}} traditional Chinese medicine simultaneously.

We describe here NMR structural studies of an undecameric duplex damaged at its center by the presence of an ALII-dA adduct. Our data establish a locally perturbed double helical structure that accommodates the bulky adduct by displacing the counter residue into the major groove and stacking the ALII moiety between flanking bases. The presence of the ALII-dA perturbs the conformation of the 5 ′-side flanking base pair, but all other pairs of the duplex adopt standard conformations. Thermodynamic studies reveal that the lesion slightly decreases the energy of duplex formation in a sequence-dependent manner.
