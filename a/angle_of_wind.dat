40|$|In {{previous}} studies, a twin-deck configuration with a centre gap {{has been}} proven {{to be an effective}} means of improving the flutter responses by altering the surface pressure distribution around the bridge deck. Hence, twin-deck or even multi-deck configurations have a great potential to be widely employed in future super long-span bridges. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of gap-width and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> incidence on the Stonecutters Bridge which features a twin-deck design. A 1 : 80 geometry scale static sectional model was fabricated to allow for simultaneous pressure measurements at 448 locations to calculate the time history of aerodynamic forces and pitching moment by spatial integration of the surface pressures. Five gap-widths corresponding to 0 m, 1 m, 7. 5 m, 14. 3 m and 21. 1 m at prototype scale were used to provide gap-width to total deck width ratios of 0 %, 2. 5 %, 16. 1 %, 26. 8 % and 35. 1 %. The flow excitation mechanisms were found to change with the gap-width and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> incidence as illustrated by the stream-wise mean and fluctuating pressure distributions around the test configurations. As the gap-width is increased, mean positive pressures were recorded at the upstream windward surface of the downstream deck which results in significant increase of drag force. The magnitude of the lift and pitching moment coefficients was found to increase with the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> incidence and there is no obvious trend with respect to the length of the gap-width. In addition, the aerodynamic admittance functions for each of the tested configurations were also identified to quantify the effectiveness of the velocity fluctuations at generating aerodynamic force on a bridge deck. The pitching moment admittances were shown to increase gradually with increasing gap-width over the whole range of reduced frequency considered. Further research can include various bridge deck shapes which have the potential to be used for future super long-span designs. Larger ranges of turbulence intensities and length scales should be tested systematically to obtain a clearer picture of the corresponding wind effects on the bridge decks...|$|E

This article presents a basic mathematical model {{with the aim}} of evaluating radial pressure and transversal stress on bobbins at different angles of winding, different yarn tensions and yarn cross-section areas. Considering the additional complexities of the real problem, an experimental comparison of bobbin alterations under different conditions was carried out with the realisation of two experimental sets.

The critical speed for both kinds of soil is within the range of 7 - 8 m center dot s(- 1). For a constant wind speed, the rate of soil wind erosion changes from increasing to falling at a critical soil slope. The critical slope of loam soil and sandy loam soil is 20 A degrees and 10 A degrees, respectively. Soil moisture content has a significant effect on wind erosion. Soil wind erosion of both soils decreases with an increase of the soil water content in two treatments, however, for treatment two, the increasing trends of wind erosion for two soils with the falling of soil water content are no significant, especially for the loam soil, and in the same soil water content, the wind erosion of two soils in treatment one is significantly higher than treatment two, this indicates reducing the disturbance of soil surface can evidently control the soil wind erosion...|$|E

Measurements of across and along vibration have been made on scale model of Panipat power station chimney, India. The aeroelastic model of the chimney has been tested in a simulated atmospheric boundary layer of height 1. 0 m in the Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at IIT Roorkee, India. The chimney model has been fabricated with FRP (fiber-reinforced plastic) at a geometric scale of 1 : 150 representing a chimney with height of 100 m in prototype. The wind tunnel tests for the present study have been carried out with the objective of obtaining the maximum along-wind and across-wind response of the chimney and this has been expressed in terms of bending moments. In particular, the interference effect between other nearby structures of the TPS has been investigated. Based on dimensional analysis measured values of chimney model have been converted into prototype values. In the present study, particular attention has been given to bending moment due to across-wind vibration, because it has been found that across-wind vibration is more predominant for the case of interference at a 45 o <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> incidence. Bending moment due to across-wind vibration for interference is found to be approximately double compared to that of stand-alone condition.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Coastal foredunes are natural aeolian bedforms located landward of the backshore and which interact continuously with the beach. Traditionally, coastal dunes {{have been associated with}} onshore winds, however they can be found under more complex wind regimes where offshore winds are common such as the UK East coast, Northern Ireland and New Zealand. This research investigates the ways in which foredune-beach interactions occur under a complex wind regime at a range of overlapping temporal and spatial scales and is innovative in that it explicitly links small-scale processes and morphodynamic behaviour to large scale and long-term dynamics. The study area is the north Lincolnshire coast, East England. Detailed observations of airflow at three locations under varying wind regimes revealed considerable spatial variations in wind velocity and direction, however it was possible to determine a general model of how foredune topography deflected and modified airflow and the resultant geomorphological implications (i. e. erosion and deposition). During direct offshore and onshore winds, airflow remained attached and undeflected; and distinct zones of flow deceleration and acceleration could be identified. During oblique winds airflow was deflected to become more parallel to the dune crest. The field sites used are characterized by a seasonal erosion/accretion cycle and a series of increasingly complex models was developed and tested to determine whether it was possible to predict sand volume changes in the foredune-beach system based on a limited number of variables. The model predictions were tested against detailed digital terrain models at a seasonal timescale. The model prediction that best matched the observed (surveyed) sand volume changes included wind speed, direction, grain size, fetch effect controlled by beach inundation and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> approach was accurate to within ± 10...|$|E

The positioning of the wind towers was varied in six different cases, two different arrangements with three different spacing lengths between wind towers. All analysis was compared against the benchmark (isolated) wind tower. The ability of the wind towers, particularly the leeward wind tower, to ventilate the space below was determined for a set occupancy against current guidelines for air supply rates. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} spacing and arrangement on CO 2 concentration within rooms ventilated by the leeward wind tower was investigated (re-entry of exhaust air pollutants into fresh supply). It was found that a parallel arrangement of wind towers was not effective for ventilating an occupied volume, regardless of the spacing between the two wind towers when incident wind direction was parallel to the arrangement. The maximum supply rate for the leeward wind tower in parallel arrangement at a spacing of 5 m was just over 50 % of the regulation rate (10 L/s/occupant) and 40 % of the supply rate of an isolated wind tower. Decreasing the spacing between the parallel wind towers to 3 m further reduces the supply rate to 2. 4 L/s/occupant and the device was observed to be operating in reverse (airflow entering from leeward opening). As the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wind</b> increased, an improvement of air supply rates was seen. For a staggered arrangement of wind towers, the leeward wind tower was capable of supplying the recommended ventilation rates at all tested spacing lengths.
