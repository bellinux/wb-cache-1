500|$|Despite his success, Homer {{notices that}} his team members <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> overworked. He decides that the {{solution}} is to get them hammocks and visits Scorpio to ask where he can purchase some. Scorpio begins to tell Homer of [...] "the Hammock district", but he is interrupted by some urgent business. It turns out that Scorpio is a criminal mastermind formulating a plot to take over the East Coast of the United States with a doomsday device, as he turns to a screen and threatens the United Nations Security Council by declaring that he has got hold of the doomsday device and that they have 72 hours to meet his demand of gold. To prove his intent, he blows up the 59th Street Bridge. Despite being in the same room, Homer appears oblivious to Scorpio's nefarious plan as he was looking outside the window.|$|E
500|$|Maxie Zeus of Toon Zone {{cited the}} episode {{as an example}} of the series' decline. Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices wrote [...] "I have to look at this special like the 'Friend or Foe?' special. While 'WhoBob WhatPants?' works well as a regular story for SpongeBob SquarePants, I'm not entirely {{convinced}} that it deserved to be hyped up as a special. While this story had the potential to be 'special material,' it just didn't materialize in the final produced product." [...] Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict said, [...] "It makes me sad to think about how something so pleasurable has declined into something so tedious." [...] Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "With a laugh-skimpy script, 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' may be confirming a trend I noticed back with the last original SpongeBob toon to get its own disc release, Pest of the West: SpongeBob shorts <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tired. And 'What Ever Happened to SpongeBob?' is even less funny than 'Pest of the West'," [...] adding the episode was [...] "Not a good sign." ...|$|E

The album was released in April 2009, also made available through an iTunes Pass, where the buyer received individual tracks in {{the weeks leading up}} to official release date. Andy Fletcher says the idea for their iTunes Pass was a combination of the band's and iTunes': [...] "I think the digital and record companies <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their act together. They were very lazy in the first 10 years when downloads came in. Now they're collaborating more and coming up with interesting ideas for fans to buy products." [...] The album went to number one in 21 countries. Critical response was generally positive and it was nominated for a Grammy in the [...] "Best Alternative Album" [...] category. [...] "Wrong" [...] was the first single from the album, released digitally in February 2009. Subsequent singles were [...] "Peace" [...] and the double A-side [...] "Fragile Tension / Hole to Feed". In addition, [...] "Perfect" [...] was released as a promotional-only (non-commercial) single in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|All's {{previous}} albums {{had been}} released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little hipper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the critics' final {{scores were}} {{affected}} by the cliffhanger, which most found unsatisfactory, while others left the game unrated until the second episode. Davison wrote that the game is a [...] "fine return to form for the series" [...] that [...] "very much feels {{like one of the}} first two Broken Sword games," [...] but [...] "frustratingly" [...] "ends with a cliffhanger just as things <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> really interesting in this regard." [...] Although finding it a [...] "natural break" [...] and saying that [...] "What's here is very good indeed and absolutely well worth your time," [...] he noted that buying the separate episode before the full release depends on [...] "your own tolerance to cliffhangers." [...] Thew was upset with how the game ends with an [...] "egregious cliffhanger" [...] without a [...] "sense of resolution". He still said that [...] "Even if it hasn’t been entirely satisfying," [...] it is a [...] "thoroughly enjoy" [...] game that [...] "has been a lot of fun so far." [...] He closed stating that people unfimiliar with the game being wary because of it being [...] "half-finished", he wouldn't hesitate to recommend the game to fans and hoped and believed that Revolution would deliver a [...] "fulfilling conclusion" [...] and [...] "great finale". Edge wrote that the game [...] "offers much of the same charismatic virtual tourism and intrigue that has held the brand in such high regard for so long" [...] and [...] "certainly take and recreate some of the best elements of their previous adventures," [...] but feared that it did not offer enough innovation to [...] "drag players away from" [...] newer point-and-click offerings and hoped that the second episode would [...] "offer a narrative curveball to shock the series into a new era rather than simply riffing on its past." [...] McDonald felt like the game was [...] "one big title that's been chopped in half" [...] which closes just as [...] "the big mystery is really only beginning to kick off" [...] and doesn't feel [...] "normally self-contained," [...] making it difficult to score the game, as the quality of it [...] "hinges so badly {{on the quality of the}} second episode;" [...] this made him wary of recommending it [...] "too highly" [...] to someone who is not familiar with the series until the second episode's release and finished off writing: [...] "I hope that, when episode two launches, I'll be bemoaning my own idiocy and falling over myself to award the complete game a much higher score [...]" [...] Osborn deemed the first episode of The Serpent's Curse [...] "immensely entertaining so far" [...] and [...] "one of 2013's unexpected pleasures." ...|$|E
