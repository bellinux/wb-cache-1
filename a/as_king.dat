5|$|After Alfred's {{death in}} 899, Æthelwold disputed the throne with Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. As senior ætheling (prince {{of the royal}} dynasty {{eligible}} for kingship), Æthelwold had a strong claim to the throne. He attempted to raise an army to support his claim, {{but was unable to}} get sufficient support to meet Edward in battle and fled to Viking-controlled Northumbria, where he was accepted <b>as</b> <b>king.</b> In 901 or 902 he sailed with a fleet to Essex, where he was also accepted <b>as</b> <b>king.</b>|$|E

5|$|Edward died at Farndon in {{northern}} Mercia on 17 July 924, {{and the ensuing}} events are unclear. Ælfweard, Edward's eldest son by Ælfflæd, had ranked above Æthelstan in attesting a charter in 901, and Edward may have intended Ælfweard to be his successor <b>as</b> <b>king,</b> either of Wessex only or of the whole kingdom. If Edward had intended his realms to be divided after his death, his deposition of Ælfwynn in Mercia in 918 may have been intended to prepare the way for Æthelstan's succession <b>as</b> <b>king</b> of Mercia. When Edward died, Æthelstan was apparently with him in Mercia, while Ælfweard was in Wessex. Mercia acknowledged Æthelstan <b>as</b> <b>king,</b> and Wessex may have chosen Ælfweard. However, Ælfweard outlived his father by only sixteen days, disrupting any succession plan.|$|E

5|$|In 920 Sitric left Dublin for Northumbria, {{with his}} kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair {{succeeding}} him <b>as</b> <b>king.</b> That same year {{he led a}} raid on Davenport, Cheshire, perhaps {{as an act of}} defiance against Edward the Elder, King of the Anglo-Saxons. In 921 Ragnall ua Ímair died, with Sitric succeeding him <b>as</b> <b>King</b> of Northumbria. Though there are no written accounts of conflict, numismatic evidence suggests there was a Viking reconquest of a large part of Mercia in the following few years. An agreement of some sort between the Vikings of Northumbria and the Anglo-Saxons was achieved in 926 when Sitric married a sister of Æthelstan, perhaps Edith of Polesworth. Sitric also converted to Christianity, though this did not last long and he soon reverted to paganism. He died in 927 and was succeeded by his kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair. Sitric's son Gofraid later reigned <b>as</b> <b>King</b> of Dublin, his son Aralt <b>as</b> <b>King</b> of Limerick, and his son Amlaíb Cuarán <b>as</b> <b>king</b> of both Dublin and Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|A three-year {{civil war}} {{followed}} his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers {{was created for}} Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) <b>as</b> <b>king.</b> In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, {{with the death of}} Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r. 911–918) <b>as</b> <b>king.</b>|$|E
