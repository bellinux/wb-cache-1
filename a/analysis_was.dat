5|$|Probably {{his most}} notable {{contribution}} to functional <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> the 1927 {{proof of the}} Banach–Steinhaus theorem, given along with Stefan Banach, which {{is now one of}} the fundamental tools in this branch of mathematics.|$|E
5|$|The BTO <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> able to {{determine}} {{the distance between the}} satellite and aircraft with a relatively high degree of accuracy, while the BFO <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> able to estimate the heading and speed of the aircraft, but is sensitive to small changes in input data. To determine the final location of Flight 370, the BTO and BFO analyses were considered in combination with aircraft performance limitations, such as altitude, airspeed, and wind. The BFO <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> able to isolate the Doppler shift between the aircraft and determine the relative motion of the aircraft to the satellite, which is reduced by the limited range of speeds at which the aircraft can fly and thus a limited set of speed/direction combinations exist that correlate with the calculated Doppler shifts.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} {{training}} also received attention. Commercial companies (often forensic software developers) began to offer certification programs and digital forensic <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> {{included as a}} topic at the UK specialist investigator training facility, Centrex.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or spontaneous abortion.

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent was outside the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
40|$|Uncertainties are {{inherent}} in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These uncertainties need to be systematically addressed and managed.

5|$|As {{the month}} {{came to a}} close, serious {{concerns}} were being raised by some observers regarding Enron's possible manipulation of accepted accounting rules; however, <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> claimed to be impossible based on the incomplete information provided by Enron. Industry analysts feared that Enron was the new Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund whose bankruptcy in 1998 threatened systemic failure of the international financial markets. Enron's tremendous presence worried some {{about the consequences of}} the company's possible bankruptcy. Enron executives accepted questions in written form only.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> beset with difficulties—the dimensions depended on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems. This anomaly was resolved in 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi published a paper in which he advocated using a fourth base unit alongside the existing three base units. The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, {{was trying to find}} a way to get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> that Donkey Kongs storyline was based on that of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Prosaurolophus was {{studied with}} other hadrosaurids by Wagner. The genus, along with Corythosaurus and Maiasaura, were {{considered}} by Wagner to be synonymous with Saurolophus, Hypacrosaurus and Brachylophosaurus respectively. Prosaurolophus maximus was reassigned to Saurolophus as S. maximus. The same year however, Prosaurolophus {{was found to}} be distinct from Saurolophus, in an analysis of Hu et al.. Their <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> unique from any of the time, and they recovered Prosaurolophus in Saurolophinae, with Saurolophus, Lophorhothon, Tsintaosaurus, Jaxartosaurus, and Kritosaurus. No other analysis has recovered this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the implication of this new <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

5|$|Samples of {{wood from}} the {{shipwreck}} were sent for analysis at the Forest and Forest Products {{division of the}} Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia. The <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> conducted by Jugo Ilic of CSIRO, a wood identification specialist. Many of the samples were too badly deteriorated to be positively identified, as the lack of cellulose remaining in the wood cells prevented successful analysis.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and progress was further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E
5|$|Statistical <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> {{applied to}} {{discover}} more specific drivers of peace. Specifically, {{the research team}} looked for indicators that were included and excluded from the index that had high levels of correlation with the overall score and rank of countries. Among the statistically significant indicators that were not used in the analysis were the functionality of a country's government, regional integration, hostility to foreigners, importance of religion in national life, corruption, {{freedom of the media}} and GDP per capita.|$|E
50|$|The {{unrestricted}} race model {{states that}} <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> affected {{prior to the}} introduction of ambiguity and affects which meaning is adopted (based on probability) before multiple analyses are able to be introduced. Van Gompel and Pickering refer to the unrestricted race model explicitly as a two-stage reanalysis model. In contrast to constraint-based theories, only one <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> constructed at a time. Because only a single <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> available at any time, reanalysis may sometimes be necessary if information following the initial <b>analysis</b> <b>is</b> inconsistent with it.|$|R

5|$|The first {{published}} reports of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns—and also B-DNA—used analyses based on Patterson transforms that provided {{only a limited}} amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA. An alternative <b>analysis</b> <b>was</b> then proposed by Wilkins et al., in 1953, for the in vivo B-DNA X-ray diffraction-scattering patterns of highly hydrated DNA fibers in terms of squares of Bessel functions. In the same journal, James Watson and Francis Crick presented their molecular modeling analysis of the DNA X-ray diffraction patterns to suggest that the structure was a double-helix.|$|E

The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
