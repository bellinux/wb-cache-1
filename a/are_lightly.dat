5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. She lays four or five bright glossy blue eggs which <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|Japanese cuisine {{offers a}} vast array of {{regional}} specialties known as kyōdo-ryōri (郷土料理), many of them originating from dishes prepared using traditional recipes with local ingredients. Foods from the Kanto region taste very strong. For example, the dashi-based broth for serving udon noodles is heavy on dark soy sauce, similar to soba broth. On the other hand, Kansai region foods <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> seasoned, with clear udon noodles. made with light soy sauce.|$|E
25|$|Water-cured type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives, {{these are}} soaked in water or weak brine and this {{solution}} is changed {{on a daily}} basis for 10–14 days. The oleuropein is naturally dissolved and leached into the water and removed during a continual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> cracked with a hammer or a stone to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations of 8–12% NaCl and acid corrected, and are then ready to eat.|$|E

25|$|A girl {{or woman}} goes {{early in the}} morning to a {{resource}} of water, as a well, spring, or stream. After she puts by the water an ear of maize and a bunch of basil which she has brought from home, she collects water with a bucket, and takes it home to her family. This water collected on early Christmas morning is called the strong water, and is believed to possess a special beneficial power. Each member of the family washes the face with it, and drinks it before breakfast; infants are bathed in it. On her way back home, the girl who carries the strong water picks several cornel or willow twigs, with which children <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> struck that morning. This is intended to strengthen their health.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{machines}} printing {{from two}} to sixteen colours are precisely similar in principle to the above, but differ somewhat in detail and are naturally more complex and difficult to operate. In a twelve-colour machine, for example, twelve copper rollers, each carrying one portion of the design, are arranged round a central pressure cylinder, or bowl, common to all, and each roller is driven by a common driving wheel, called the crown wheel, actuated, in most cases, by its own steam-engine or motor. Another {{difference is that the}} adjustment of pressure is transferred from the cylinder to the rollers which works in specially constructed bearings capable of the following movements: (1) Of being screwed up bodily until the rollers <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> pressed against the central bowl; (2) of being moved to and fro sideways so that the rollers may he laterally adjusted; and (3) of being moved up or down for the purpose of adjusting the rollers in vertical direction. Notwithstanding the great latitude of movement thus provided each roller is furnished with a box-wheel, which serves the double purpose of connecting or gearing it to the driving wheel, and of affording a fine adjustment. Each roller is further furnished with its own colour-box and doctors.|$|E
25|$|In Borealis Planitia, however, most of {{the ridges}} are of {{external}} origin. They appear either to outline the rim crests of subjacent ghost craters that <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> mantled by smooth plains material or to be lava flow fronts. The map shows the rim crests of 20 ghost craters, ranging in diameter from 40 to 160 km, that are buried under the smooth plains material of Borealis Planitia, which material is coextensive with the fill covering {{the floor of the}} Goethe Basin. In addition, ejecta from the crater Depréz extend more than 40 km eastward beyond a circular scarp that may represent the rim crest of a buried crater 170 km in diameter (FDS 156, 160) or, more likely, the front of lava flows. The size and density of these ghost craters suggest that, prior to emplacement of smooth plains material, the original heavily cratered surface of Borealis Planitia—which may have been the cratered floor of a very large multiring impact basin—and the cratered floor of the Goethe Basin were similar in composition and age to the intercrater plains material of the highlands to the west. Many scarps in Borealis Planitia are subconcentric to the rim of the Goethe Basin and have steeper slopes that face away from it, suggesting that they represent the fronts of lava flows that resurfaced extensive areas of heavily cratered terrain (intercrater or older plains material).|$|E

500|$|In the game's fourth mission, [...] "No Russian", {{the player}} {{controls}} an undercover CIA operative, Joseph Allen, who participates {{in a mass}} shooting at a Moscow airport to gain the trust of a Russian terrorist group. It begins with the player exiting from an elevator with four other gunmen, who proceed to open fire on {{a large group of}} civilians at a security checkpoint. The player then accompanies the gunmen as they assault the airport, killing any civilians. The level is very graphic, as screams can be heard throughout, and the injured crawl away leaving blood trails. However, the player is never forced to partake in the massacre, and may instead let their comrades kill the civilians. The only legitimate targets <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> armed security personnel within the airport terminal, and a group of more heavily armed FSB members who are deployed on the tarmac. If the player does not feel comfortable during the level, they are allowed to skip to the next level with no penalties. A warning before the campaign also notifies players that there is disturbing material, at which point they can either elect {{to go ahead with the}} mission anyway or skip it.|$|E

500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

Marine {{protected}} areas: Many intertidal areas <b>are</b> <b>lightly</b> to heavily {{exploited by}} humans for food gathering (e.g. clam digging in soft-sediment habitats and snail, mussel, and algal collecting in rocky intertidal habitats). In some locations, marine protected {{areas have been}} established where no collecting is permitted. The benefits of protected areas may spill over to positively impact adjacent unprotected areas. For example, {{a greater number of}} larger egg capsules of the edible snail Concholepus in protected vs. non-protected areas in Chile indicates that these protected areas may help replenish snail stocks in areas open to harvesting. The degree to which collecting is regulated by law differs with the species and habitat.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{it is not}} {{rare for}} cippi to have dedications, [...] the Cippi of Melqart have an unusual construction, as they have two parts.

[...] The bases support pillars which are interpreted as candelabra. The lower parts of the candelabra are decorated with a shallow relief of acanthus leaves. Calligraphic differences in the incised text, varying positioning of the words and differences in the depth of the relief and the mouldings, imply that the two cippi are separate offerings, carrying the same inscription because the patrons were brothers.|$|E
