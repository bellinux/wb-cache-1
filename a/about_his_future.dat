5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future</b> employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 1542, {{the thirty}} year old {{must have been}} feeling {{confident}} <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future</b> prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. Ironically it was this same Duke to whom Mercator would turn ten years hence. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were great. The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.|$|E

Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future,</b> alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.|$|E

Several days before shooting, Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His arrest prompted speculation <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future</b> on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. With the revelation of Sun as one of the Oceanic Six, all six members have been revealed. Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E

5|$|The Peach Bowl was {{the final}} game as head coach of Virginia Tech for Bill Dooley, who had {{accumulated}} a record of 62381 for the Hokies since assuming the head coaching job in 1978. Tech president William Lavery had long disagreed with Dooley {{about the role of}} football at Virginia Tech, and prior {{to the beginning of the}} season, Lavery told Dooley that his tenure as coach would end on January 1, 1987. This fact was revealed to the football team and the general public after Tech's third game of the season. At the time, Dooley was the winningest head coach in Virginia Tech history, but was under investigation for recruiting violations and had settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the university for $3.5 million. As part of the out-of-court settlement, Dooley was required to quit his position following the Peach Bowl. In the weeks leading up to the game, Dooley dodged questions <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future.</b> On December 23, it was announced that Murray State head coach Frank Beamer would replace Dooley after the Peach Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Wright, {{whose father}} was head {{biochemist}} at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School. He taught himself to play guitar, trumpet and piano at age 12 after he was recuperating from breaking a leg. His mother helped and encouraged him to play the piano. He took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music and became influenced by the trad jazz revival, learning the trombone and saxophone {{as well as the}} piano. Uncertain <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future,</b> he enrolled in 1962 at the Regent Street Polytechnic which was later incorporated into the University of Westminster. There he met fellow musicians Roger Waters and Nick Mason, and all three joined a band formed by classmate Clive Metcalf called Sigma 6.|$|E
5|$|He {{gained a}} Second Class {{in the first}} History Tripos in 1909, and won the English Essay Prize with an essay on {{political}} satire in English poetry. He won the same prize again in 1910, and that year gained first-class honours in his Theological Special Examination. By this point, he was having doubts <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future</b> as a minister and consulted with the university Law Reader as {{to the possibility of}} a career as a barrister. On the Reader's advice, Birkett took the second Law Tripos in 1911, passing with second-class honours. Birkett interviewed with the editors of The Guardian and The Observer in his search for a job to sustain him while he took the bar exam. He took a job as personal secretary to George Cadbury Junior, with a wage of £200 a year, which he planned to hold until he qualified as a barrister. After only a month of working for Cadbury, his salary was raised to £500, and he was offered a permanent position. While there, he continued his political work and spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, cementing his reputation as an effective speaker by, on one occasion, holding the attention of more than a thousand people for an hour. He took {{the first part of the}} Bar Examination in 1912, but failed the paper on real property; he passed it on his second attempt, and was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 4 June 1913.|$|E

5|$|Liddell {{entered the}} youth team on {{his arrival in}} 1938. Before he {{established}} himself in the side, Liddell had been frustrated at the frequent rotation of players until trainer Albert Shelley advised him to be patient. An injury incurred against Blackburn Rovers threatened to end his career prematurely. He had struck his knee against concrete near the corner flag after being challenged while running with the ball. Doctors informed him {{of the extent of}} tissue damage, causing Liddell anxiety <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>future.</b> He remained in Blackburn for two weeks, living in the family home of a colleague, before returning to Liverpool to continue his recovery. The Second World War precluded an official debut for Liddell, as the Football Association suspended competitive football from the abandoned 1939–1940 season and instituted a regional system in its place. Until the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Liddell guested for various domestic sides when unavailable for Liverpool and represented select teams, including a Football Association XI and Scottish Services XI. Liddell was capped eight times for Scotland during the war, scoring on his debut in a 5–4 win over England in 1942.|$|E
