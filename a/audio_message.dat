25|$|On 7 March 2015, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau pledged {{allegiance}} to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant via an <b>audio</b> <b>message</b> posted on the organisation's Twitter account. On 12 March 2015, ISIL's spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani released an audio tape in which he welcomed the pledge of allegiance, and described it as {{an expansion of the}} group's caliphate into West Africa. ISIL publications from late March 2015 began referring to members of Boko Haram as part of Wilayat Gharb Afriqiya (West Africa Province). The group suffered a split in 2016, with ISIL appointing 'Abu Musab al-Barnawi' as the group's new leader, due to disagreements with Abubakar Shekau's leadership. This was rejected by Shekau and his supporters, who continued to operate independently.|$|E
25|$|On 8 April 2013, al-Baghdadi {{released}} an audio statement {{in which he}} announced that the al-Nusra Front had been established, financed, and supported by ISI, and that {{the two groups were}} merging under the name Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIL, Al-Sham also translates as the Levant). However, Abu Mohammad al-Julani and Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leaders of al-Nusra and al-Qaeda respectively, rejected the merger. Al-Julani issued a statement denying the merger, and complaining that neither he nor anyone else in al-Nusra's leadership had been consulted about it. In June 2013, Al Jazeera reported that it had obtained a letter written by al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, addressed to both leaders, in which he ruled against the merger, and appointed an emissary to oversee relations between them {{to put an end to}} tensions. That same month, al-Baghdadi {{released an}} <b>audio</b> <b>message</b> rejecting al-Zawahiri's ruling and declaring that the merger was going ahead.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} accompanied by eight different remixes by DJ Junior Vasquez, who re-used Madonna's vocals, but changed {{the composition of}} the track completely. Unusual for a singer in the mid-1990s, Madonna talked about the new single on the Internet, leaving an <b>audio</b> <b>message</b> for her fans as well as a snippet of the song. [...] "Secret" [...] received favorable reviews from music critics, who praised Madonna's vocal delivery and its mid-tempo R groove, deeming it seductive and soulful. The song was also a commercial success. In the United States, it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In the United Kingdom, it reached a peak of number five, becoming her record-breaking 35th consecutive top-ten single on the UK Singles Chart. Elsewhere, it reached number one in Canada, Finland and Switzerland, and the top five in Australia, Denmark, France, Italy, New Zealand and Spain.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album's release, Madonna {{talked about the}} album in an <b>audio</b> <b>message</b> {{available}} exclusively online prior to its release. There were promotional advertisements aired on television channels proclaiming {{that there will be}} [...] "no sexual references on the album" [...] and Madonna adding that [...] "it's a whole new me! I'm {{going to be a good}} girl, I swear." [...] One of the first promotional appearances the singer did was in Paris, where she was interviewed by Ruby Wax and talked about the album. According to Wax, she was quite intimidated by Madonna and her entourage and, in her own words, [...] " [...] nerves got the best of me". On February 18, 1995, Madonna arrived in Europe to promote Bedtime Stories. During the same day, she performed [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] on German TV show Wetten, dass..?, while she was also interviewed on the program.|$|E
500|$|After searching, Madonna {{chose to}} work with Babyface, whose {{previous}} collaborations with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. Through him, she met with then upcoming young producer from Atlanta called Dallas Austin, who had become famous {{for his work on}} girl group TLC's debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992). Together they composed two songs for the album, [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary". The former was originally produced in its demo form by Pettibone, under the name [...] "Something's Coming Over Me", however Austin reworked the demo and made it a different song musically. On September 27, 1994, the song was released as the lead single from Bedtime Stories. The cover art of the single showed a new look for Madonna, with blonde hair and style compared to the look of 1930s American actress, Jean Harlow. Shot by photographer Patrick Demarchelier in black-and-white, the image showed the singer slouched on a sofa with her dress down and revealing her translucent brassiere.
