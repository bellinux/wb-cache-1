5|$|According to the medievalist Katharine Keats-Rohan, Gervase {{was the son}} of Roger, who was {{the nephew}} of Hubert the queen's chamberlain. Other {{scholars}} are less sure that Gervase was Roger's son, and argue that Gervase was Hubert's nephew. Gervase was likely born around 1110. He married Agnes, the daughter of Edward of Cornhill. After his marriage, he became known <b>as</b> <b>de</b> Cornhill because of his wife's property.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam's {{unexpected}} death {{created a}} power vacuum in Baghdad, with disagreements between Daylamite and Turkish forces prompting the former {{to join the}} defeated al-Baridi. With their assistance, he marched on Wasit and Baghdad, capturing them, but was soon forced to flee due to the disorder that followed his usurpation of power. A Daylamite chief named Kurankij replaced him <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto ruler of Baghdad, but he imposed tyrannical rule, and al-Muttaqi appealed to the former amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq for assistance.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1914, when Jolin and his friends from the Matisse Academy {{returned}} to Stockholm, the group became known <b>as</b> <b>De</b> Unga (The Young Ones).

5|$|Its {{position}} was formed through constitutional convention, making its status <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto capital {{a part of}} the UK's unwritten constitution. The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the 12th and 13th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court, and thus the political capital of the nation. More recently, Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London.|$|E

5|$|Several modern {{commentators}} regard Staunton <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto World Champion {{after his}} match victory over Saint-Amant, although that title {{did not yet}} formally exist. After Saint-Amant's defeat, no other Frenchmen arose to continue the French supremacy in chess established by Philidor, Deschapelles, La Bourdonnais and Saint-Amant. Some contemporary English commentators, mainly in Staunton's Chess Player's Chronicle, and some later writers hailed Staunton as the world champion.All presented at From Chess Player's Chronicle vol. 5 p. 92 and p. 128.|$|E

5|$|Alfa Ba, Karamoko Alfa's father, {{formed a}} {{coalition}} of Muslim Fulbe and called for the jihad in 1725, but died before the struggle began. The jihad was launched around 1726-1727. After a crucial, concluding victory at Talansan, the state was established {{at a meeting of}} nine Fulbe ulama who each represented one of the Futa Jallon provinces. Ibrahima Sambeghu, who became known as Karamokho Alfa, was the hereditary ruler of Timbo and one of the nine ulama. He was elected leader of the jihad. Under his leadership, Futa Jallon became the first Muslim state to be founded by the Fulbe. Despite this, Karamokho Alfa was constrained by the other eight ulama. Some of the other Ulama had more secular power than Karamokho Alfa, who directly ruled only the diwal of Timbo; for this reason the new state was always a tenuous confederation. Karamoko Alfa ruled the theocratic state until 1748, when his excessive devotions caused him to become mentally unstable and Sori was selected <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto leader. Karamokho Alfa died around 1751 and was formally succeeded by Ibrahim Sori, his cousin.|$|E
5|$|As Soviet forces {{continued}} to {{fight their way}} into the centre of Berlin, Hitler and Braun committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April. Braun took cyanide and Hitler shot himself.

In accordance with Hitler's last wishes, Bormann was named as Party Minister, thus officially confirming his position <b>as</b> <b>de</b> facto General Secretary of the Party. Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz was appointed as the new Reichspräsident (president of Germany) and Goebbels became head of government and Chancellor of Germany. Goebbels and his wife Magda committed suicide later that day.|$|E
