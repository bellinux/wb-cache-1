5|$|In a {{departure}} {{from one of the}} F-16's original raison d'etre recent costs for both new and refurbished aircraft have risen significantly from its 1998 fly-away cost of $18.8 million. In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that buying a new F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} cost {{on the performance of}} small and medium sized manufacturing firms. Two distinct types of firms were examined: those with lower than <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> for their market, and firms with above <b>average</b> <b>costs.</b> The overall drivers in both sets of firms are examined along with the resultant performance. The study sampled cost structures in SMEs in the engineering and electronics industries. The findings show differences in both sets of firms. Firms with lower than <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> have reduced their employee levels over the past three years, which is reflected in their reduced direct labour costs, arguably as a result of increased contracting out of activities. The lower than <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> translate into the ability to offer competitive pricing and increased market share. On the other hand, firms with above <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> in their market have experienced an increase in costs (other than direct and indirect labour) reduced turnover, have more management levels and tend to focus on specific markets...|$|R

5|$|Stanier, the {{designer}} of the locomotives, felt that the added weight and difficulty in maintenance due to the streamlining was too high {{a price to pay}} for the actual benefits gained at high speed. Therefore, in 1938 a third batch of five locomotives (again named after Duchesses) was built, Nos. 6230–6234, without streamlining at an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of £10,659 each.|$|E

5|$|The fifth batch, again {{named after}} cities, {{comprised}} four locomotives, Nos. 6245–6248. These engines were built during 1943 and the <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> {{was held to}} £10,908 due to the incorporation of recycled boilers. During the Second World War, the Materials Committee of the government tried to balance the needs for steel between civilian departments and the War Department when allocating those resources. Despite these constraints, the entire batch was still outshopped in streamlined form.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} cities {{continued}} into 1944 when another batch of four, Nos. 6249–6252, was built without streamlining. The cost of these locomotives averaged £11,664 each. A follow-up batch of three locomotives (Nos. 6253–6255) {{was built in}} 1946 and this batch attracted an inflationary <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of £15,460 each.

5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
40|$|This {{explains}} {{the connection between}} the Short Run <b>Average</b> Total <b>Cost</b> Curves and the Long Run <b>Average</b> Total <b>Cost</b> Curve. The distinction between operating and planning decisions is established, as is the fact that every Short Run <b>Average</b> Total <b>Cost</b> Curve is based on some given level of fixed inputs. The Long Run <b>Average</b> Total <b>Cost</b> Curve is shown to be a collection of the 2 ̆ 2 better spots 2 ̆ 2 on a collection of Short Run <b>Average</b> Total <b>Cost</b> Curves, one for each level of assumed fixed inputs...|$|R
50|$|An {{implicit}} {{assumption of}} the above rules is that all fixed costs are sunk costs. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total fixed costs (TFC) equal sunk fixed costs (SFC) plus non-sunk fixed costs (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some fixed costs are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. As Besanko notes, to illustrate the new rule {{it is necessary to}} define a new <b>cost</b> curve, the <b>average</b> non-sunk <b>cost</b> curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the <b>average</b> variable <b>costs</b> plus the <b>average</b> non-sunk fixed <b>cost</b> or ANSC = AVC + ANFC. The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum <b>average</b> <b>costs,</b> produce; if the price is between minimum <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> and minimum ANSC produce, and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down. If all fixed costs are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below <b>average</b> total <b>costs.</b>|$|R

Of the 458 total planned, 360 are for the U.S. Marine Corps, 50 for the Air Force, and 48 for the Navy at an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of $110 million per aircraft, including development costs. The V-22 had an incremental flyaway cost of $67 million per aircraft in 2008, The U.S. Navy had hoped to shave about $10 million off that cost after a five-year production contract in 2013. The cost for each CV-22 was $73 million in the FY 2014 budget.|$|E
5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of £11,641 each. They were all {{intended}} to haul the Coronation Scot, so the locomotives and the special trainsets bore a common livery.

The special trainsets that they hauled were painted the same shade of blue and the silver lining was repeated along each side of the coaches.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
30|$|As the firms’ {{expected}} {{marginal costs}} of variability {{are difficult to}} estimate, we think that a more promising approach is to estimate the marginal cost of precautionary measures for a given variability in the transport system. The marginal cost of precautionary measures might be computed from a theoretical model for buffer stocks or buffer time with appropriately estimated parameter values; here, however, we take {{as a proxy for}} marginal <b>costs</b> the <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> for precautionary measures and relate the <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> to different measures of variability. Assuming that <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> can approximate marginal costs, the marginal cost for precautionary measures is observable given appropriate company data, since firms are investing in their logistic systems to handle the variability in transportation times they are facing.|$|R

5|$|Bergstein then shopped {{the script}} around to other studios but was {{repeatedly}} rejected, until she {{brought it to}} Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio division of Stamford, Connecticut, based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video distribution company. While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose Emile Ardolino as the film's director, who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary, He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin'. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message {{from where he was}} sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5million, {{at a time when the}} <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> for a film was $12million.|$|E
5|$|In 1938 {{the second}} five {{locomotives}} of the class, Nos. 6225–6229 (named after Duchesses) were also built in streamlined form at an <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> of £11,323 each. They were {{painted in the}} same shade of crimson lake which had already been applied to the Princess Royal class; the same style of horizontal lining {{that had been a}} feature of the first five locomotives was continued, but in gilt. Although the crimson lake matched the standard LMS rolling stock, there was no attempt to apply the gilt lining along the sides of these coaches. A prototype trainset was built with such lining for exhibition in America, but it was never put into service due to the outbreak of the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft.
