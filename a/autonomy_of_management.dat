40|$|This paper reviews recent {{developments}} in the <b>management</b> <b>of</b> government debt in the euro area, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. It focuses on key aspects of debt management; the objectives <b>of</b> debt <b>management,</b> its organisation, the maturity of debt, inflation-indexation, currency-denomination, the ownership of debt, and debt issuing and trading practices. Main adjustments include an increase in <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> debt <b>management</b> agencies, and a convergence in debt maturities and in debt issuing strategies. Issuance of inflation-indexed bonds {{and the use of}} interest rate swaps have increased strongly. While the share of government debt denominated in non-domestic currencies is falling, foreign ownership of euro area government debt is increasing markedly. The observed changes in recent years in part reflect the introduction of the euro and the related integration of European capital markets. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of multidatabase systems and {{heterogeneous}} distributed database systems, {{it has been observed}} that <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the component databases has to be violated in order to maintain traditional database and transaction properties.

Hence, this paper is aimed at characterizing the different types <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> by focusing on transaction management and showing the relationships between autonomy requirements and database protocols. As a case-study, we investigate the <b>autonomy</b> implications <b>of</b> the two-phase commit protocol and its multidatabase variants.

40|$|This paper empirically {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between competition design and productive efficiency in the railway industry. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to construct efficiency scores, and explain these scores, using variables reflecting institutional factors and competition design. Our results suggest that competitive tendering improves productive efficiency, which {{is in line with}} economic intuition as well as with expectations on the design of competition. We also find that free entry lowers productive efficiency. A possible explanation for this result is that free entry may disable railway operators to reap economies of density. Our final result is that more <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> lowers productive efficiency. Most of the incumbent railway companies are state owned and do not face any competitive pressure. As a consequence, increased independence without sufficient competition and adequate regulation may deteriorate incentives for productive efficiency. ...|$|E
40|$|A central {{feature of}} financialization is the {{argument}} that the relative <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> has been realigned with the interests of shareholders and their demand for higher returns on capital employed (ROCE). This paper reveals that average ROCE in the S&P 500 has not been transformed in the 1990 s, relative to an earlier period, even after extensive corporate restructuring. Deconstructing S&P 500 ROCE reveals how additional cash and profit generated out of income are offset by inflated balance sheet capitalization putting a brake on the ROCE. In the US business combinations are now accounted for at their market value and this, we argue, is forcing a financialized ratchet because management will need to step-up cost reduction to finance balance sheet restructuring. Corporate cash is being used to finance share buy-backs which: facilitate balance sheet restructuring, improve reported ROCE and provide a pool of treasury stock {{that can be used to}} reward managers who deliver shareholder value. This paper concludes that the nature and relative scale of these financial transactions can be employed to construct financialized account...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor decades, managers' {{powers and}} their freedom to make {{strategic}} decisions were {{taken for granted}} {{in the field of}} corporate governance. The present crisis has revealed that their managerial latitude is in reality much weaker than thought. The growing influence of shareholders has undermined the historical and professional legitimacy of managers, who are now viewed as 'agents' controlled by 'principals'. This paper makes two contributions. First, we hold that the crisis is not a purely economic or financial crisis but a fundamental crisis of management, with its function of regulating the relationship between the firm and society. Second, we show that this crisis is rooted in law, since corporate law does not actually protect the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>management.</b> Until now, management theory has underestimated the role of law in the evolutions of corporate governance; we argue that management research needs to open its boundaries and specifically to re-examine corporate law. We suggest new governance rules to ensure managers have the latitude to organize collective creation processes {{in a way that is}} both efficient and legitimate. And we discuss some avenues for reflecting on a postcrisis business law...|$|E

From a general perspective it can be understood that there is a gradation in the already stated intervention of administration and inspection, ranging from their wider or more extensive ability in public schools to the minimum intervention in private establishments, passing through an intermediate situation in the case of maintained centers subsidised with public funds that offer formal education...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{of the public sector}} affects us all. There are at least three reasons why we should be interested in how well it functions: it is big; its outputs are special; and it is getting bigger. With all these, in Romania, the performance within the public sector represents a concept not so analyzed and rarely applied in practice. There is not the same situation in countries with a high developed economy, which represent an interest for us, along with the European integration. Internationally, since the 1970 s processes of modernization and reorganization of public institution have been initiated in diverse countries in the world. The society has demanded greater efficiency in rendering of services, a better application of public resources and also questioned the effective bureaucratic model. In this context, the model of managing government institutions gains force, consistence and become more credible. Flexibility, decentralization, creativity, <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>management,</b> and a management contract used as quantification instrument are basic characteristics of the management reforms that focus on results. Results determination within the public sector and the implementation of a system meant to measure the financing and non-financing performances need an exact definition of the objectives and purposes of each organization and constituent institution. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been said that the Japanese {{corporate}} governance does not pay sufficient attention to shareholders as {{the owners of the}} corporation. An yet, despite this seeming lack of shareholder ownership, Japanese firms have performed quite well until recently. This paper seeks to solve this conundrum by developing the "Company Community" concept as a positive model of the Japanese corporate governance. This model is used to illustrate how the Japanese system of corporate governance solves the hidden problems of the corporate law. These hidden problems of corporate law are common to all developed economies and consist of the dual problems of balancing between monitoring and <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> and balancing between money capital and human capital. The company community concept solves these problems through an intricate system of monitoring consisting of three levels. The first level is the in-house monitoring by core employees who are quasi-residual claimants and monitor management as a participant in the Community. The second level is the monitoring by cross-shareholders in the firm, the main bank in particular. Cross-shareholding also has the effect of stabilizing the management position against outside control. The third level is the monitoring by exit of the outside shareholders. These multiple levels of monitoring have the effect of stabilizing management yet upholding shareholder ownership as the end game norm...|$|E

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of the inter-sectoral Framework Agreement on Telework is a significant innovation in European policy-making reflecting a shift towards greater <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> organised <b>management</b> and labour; both sides of industry are invited to proactively engage in the implementation as well as follow-up of European framework agreements {{at different levels of}} bargaining. Building on workplace level telework arrangements, the paper discusses the role of trade unions in implementing the Telework Agreement in Spain and the UK and provides a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of its autonomous character. Analysis is structured around two sets of factors; institutional (impact of industrial relations traditions) and societal influences (how the topic of the European agreement is situated within different societal contexts). It is argued that differences in the significance attributed to teleworking have shaped unions' perceptions and policies on both the form of implementation and practical application at lower levels, while the impact of institutions seems to be greater on substantive issues. Overall, despite their soft character, autonomous agreements represent agreements with potential. Although not enforceable in court, they can operate as good practice guides while their European origin may act as an informal element of legality when they reach a Tribunal. However, without active local union involvement the protections they offer can be largely symbolic...|$|R
40|$|Concurrency control {{schemes for}} {{ensuring}} global serializability in a multidatabase system (MDBS) environment are complicated {{due to the}} <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> local database <b>management</b> systems (DBMSs).

In a trivial MDBS, the global transaction manager (GTM) does not delay any operations and simply submits them to the local DBMSs in the order in which they arrive. In a semi-trivial MDBS, the GTM may delay the submission of commit operations belonging to global transactions, while all other operations are submitted for execution with no delay. We identify restrictions on the local DBMSs that ensure that global serializability is maintained in trivial and semi-trivial MDBSs. These restrictions are both necessary and sufficient to guarantee serializability. We also develop concurrency [...] ...|$|R
