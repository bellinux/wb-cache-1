40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} usable engineering design approach to the fatigue analysis of threaded connections. Although primarily concerned with the fatigue-fracture mechanics behaviour of screw <b>threads,</b> <b>a</b> broad review of stress analysis investigations in such connections is reported. Connection types, their functions and standardisation authorities are presented {{with the purpose of}} familiarising the reader with the subject and the options available to the design of threaded fasteners. Fatigue crack initiation is discussed with reference to the specific setting of <b>a</b> critical <b>thread</b> <b>root.</b> <b>A</b> crack initiation model is adapted for employment in <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> design. <b>A</b> novel weight function approach is developed for use in the determination of stress intensity factors for <b>threaded</b> connections. <b>A</b> generic solution is proposed valid for the fatigue crack growth from any <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> under any symmetrical stress system. Its development and discussion is examined in detail, remaining close to its proposed application. Two engineering situations where the chief structural components are comprised of threaded members are taken as case studies. The background to each situation is elaborated in detail and full-scale fatigue tests were conducted on the critical components. In all, fourteen full-scale tests under constant and variable amplitude loading are reported. The results of these are analysed and used to validate the fatigue crack initiation and propagation models. Useful observations which are helpful to understanding the fracture mechanisms operating during the fatigue of threaded connections are reported. Material and environmental considerations are examined and a survey of relevant materials and their behaviour in environments associated with threaded fasteners is presented. The merits or otherwise of some common engineering practices are discussed with regard to fatigue. A method has been developed for predicting fatigue life in large threaded connections under random loading. Experimental results have been gathered on two types of components used on certain oil rigs, tether joints and drill strings. The agreement found between prediction and experiment is appreciably better than by previous methods of analysis and also points to aspects open to further improvement...|$|R

40|$|Nondimensional stress {{intensity}} factor (K) solutions for continuous circumferential cracks in threaded fasteners were calculated using finite element methods that determined the energy release rate during virtual crack extension. Assumed loading conditions included both remote tension and nut loading, whereby the effects of applying the load to the thread flank were considered. In addition, K solutions were developed for axisymmetric surface cracks in notched and smooth round bars. Results showed that the stress concentration of <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> causes <b>a</b> considerable increase in K for shallow cracks, but has much less effect for longer cracks. In the latter case, values of K can be accurately estimated from K solutions for axisymmetric cracks in smooth round bars. Nut loading increased K by about 50 % for shallow cracks, but this effect became negligible at crack depth-to-minor diameter ratios (a/d) greater than 0. 2. An evaluation of <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> acuity effects showed that root radius {{has no effect on}} K when the crack depth exceeds 2 % of the minor diameter. Closed-form K solutions were developed for both remote-loading and nut-loading conditions and {{for a wide range of}} <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> radii. The K solutions obtained in this study were compared with available literature solutions for threaded fasteners as well as notched and smooth round bars...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{modulated}} {{tool path}} (MTP) chip breaking {{process has been}} modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining <b>a</b> <b>thread</b> with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips...|$|R

Warshaw and Miller met in 1992 when they bonded over a passion for country music and began to {{regularly}} deejay on Wednesday country nights at a Chicago bar called Crash Palace, now called Delilah's. Both Warshaw and Miller had played in bands, had deejayed at their local college radio stations, and had worked in {{different areas of the}} music business. Warshaw had booked tours for bands she was friends with and had worked as a publicist for the band KillBilly who released a record on Flying Fish Records, where co-founder Babcock worked.

25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such <b>a</b> <b>thread.</b> The single-point cutting tools or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult.

Also, {{there is no way}} to compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R
40|$|Fine {{screw threads}} {{are widely used}} for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> is higher than coarse screw threads and the fatigue strength of <b>threaded</b> fasteners shows <b>a</b> minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at <b>thread</b> <b>root</b> of fine screw threads is higher than that of coarse screw threads, and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine screw threads are smaller comparing to those of coarse screw threads when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening screw threads is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} {{garbage collector}} has to fulfill two basic properties: ensure that programs with bounded allocation rates do not {{run out of}} memory and provide short blocking times. Even for incremental garbage collectors, two major sources of blocking exist, namely root scanning and heap compaction. Finding root nodes of an object graph {{is an integral part}} of tracing garbage collectors and cannot be circumvented. Heap compaction is necessary to avoid probably unbounded heap fragmentation, which in turn would lead to unacceptably high memory consumption. In this paper, we propose solutions to both issues. Thread stacks are local to <b>a</b> <b>thread,</b> and <b>root</b> scanning therefore only needs to be atomic with respect to the thread whose stack is scanned. This fact can be utilized by either blocking only the thread whose stack is scanned, or by delegating the responsibility for root scanning to the application threads. The latter solution eliminates blocking due to root scanning completely. The impact of this solution on the execution time of a garbage collector is shown for two different variants of such a root scanning algorithm. During heap compaction, objects are copied. Copying is usually performed atomically to avoid interference with application threads, which could render the state of an object inconsistent. Copying of large objects and especially large arrays introduces long blocking times that are unacceptable for real-time systems. In this paper an interruptible copy unit is presented that implements non-blocking object copy. The unit can be interrupted after a single word move. We evaluate a real-time garbage collector that uses the proposed techniques on a Java processor. With this garbage collector, it is possible to run high priority hard real-time tasks at 10 kHz parallel to the garbage collection task on a 100 MHz system.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} recovering from failures of distributable threads with assured timeliness. When a node hosting a portion of <b>a</b> distributable <b>thread</b> fails, it causes orphans — i. e., segments of distributable threads that are disconnected from the <b>thread’s</b> <b>root.</b> We consider <b>a</b> termination model for recovering from such failures, where the orphans must be detected and aborted, resources held by them must be released and rolled back to safe states, and exceptions must be delivered to farthest, contiguous surviving thread segment from where execution can be resumed. Since distributable threads are subject to time constraints in real-time distributed systems, such recovery must be conducted with assured timeliness. Toward this, we present 1) a real-time scheduling algorithm called AUA, and 2) <b>a</b> distributable <b>thread</b> integrity protocol called TP-TR. We show that AUA and TP-TR bound the orphan cleanup and recovery time (thereby bounding thread starvation durations), maximize total thread accrued timeliness utility, and satisfy thread mutual exclusion constraints. We implement AUA and TP-TR in a real-time middleware that supports distributable threads. Our experimental studies with the implementation validate the algorithm/protocol’s time-bounded recovery property and confirm their effectiveness. in...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Evaluation of {{semi-circular}} {{surface crack}} influence on threaded connection fatigue behavior, made of 42 CrMo 4 heat treatable steel, was carried out. Crack diameters {{were defined as}} 0. 02, 0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 15 mm. Influence of semi-circular surface cracks was investigated by means of Kitagawa–Takahashi diagram and El Haddad equation.

40|$|Presently, {{the rotary}} wing-head and hub {{subassemblies}} of the Army’s Black Hawk helicopter require almost complete disassembly to inspect failure critical threads {{of the main}} spindle. Even with {{direct access to the}} threads, detection of fatigue cracks in the <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> is very difficult using visual and penetrant methods. Therefore, the purpose of this project was twofold: (1) to demonstrate an improved nondestructive inspection method for the spindle threads applicable to routine teardown maintenance, and (2) to determine the feasibility of performing safety-of-flight inspections on the spindle with only minimal disassembly. Recent projects funded by the Air Force have shown that the electric current perturbation (ECP) method is capable of detecting very small surface fatigue cracks in gas turbine engine disks 1 and second layer defects in relatively thick structural wing sections. 2 Based on these results, the ECP method was evaluated for its capability to inspect the spindle <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> not only by scanning the outside diameter (crest of the threads), but also by scanning the hollow spindle bore under the threads and inspecting through the wall thickness for flight-critical cracks. With an ECP probe located on the crest of the threads, high sensitivity to very small defects in the <b>thread</b> <b>roots</b> was achieved and thumbnail shaped EDM slots as small as 0. 53 mm long by 0. 23 mm deep by 0. 064 mm wide were detected. Inspection from the bore requires only that the rotary wing be removed so that a probe can be inserted into the spindle bore. Since this inspection is performed through the spindle wall, sensitivity is reduced and only larger defects are detectable. From the bore, detection of a thumbnail shaped EDM slot measuring 7. 75 mm long by 2. 21 mm deep by 0. 102 mm wide was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
