In 2005, a stabbing occurred at the stop, and in 2007 a rider forced off the MAX by TriMet then attempted to assault someone at the neighboring apartment complex.|$|E
5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed his left ear with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E
5|$|Chłapowski advised Plater {{to stand}} down and return home. She {{allegedly}} replied {{that she had}} no intention of taking off her uniform until her fatherland was fully liberated. Her decision was accepted and she was made a commanding officer of the 1st company of the Polish–Lithuanian 25th Infantry Regiment. She was promoted to the rank of captain, the highest rank awarded to <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> that time. She spent some time in Kaunas, before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 Harold Knight died at Colwall; {{the couple}} had been married fifty-eight years. Knight's second autobiography, The Magic of a Line was {{published}} in 1965, to coincide with a major retrospective of her work at the Royal Academy. The exhibition, the first such for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the Academy, contained over 250 works, and was followed in 1968 and 1969 by further retrospective exhibitions at the Upper Grosvenor Galleries.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person he thought was a female was not <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> all.|$|E
5|$|Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is {{awakened by}} a nightmare, and is comforted by her father Frank Black (Lance Henriksen). However, Black is soon called to {{investigate}} the body of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> a dog pound in Portland, Oregon. Black works for the Millennium Group, an organisation which offers private investigation services and consults with law enforcement on certain types of cases. He is asked by Group member Jim Penseyres (Chris Ellis) to help a local detective on the murder case, as he is being considered as prospective member of the Millennium Group. Black believes the murder to {{be the work of}} a serial killer, and is convinced there will be a message from him on the bodies.|$|E

5|$|Sayers {{was educated}} {{at home and}} then at the University of Oxford. This was unusual for <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the time, as they were not {{admitted}} as full members of the university until 1920 – five years after Sayers had completed her first class degree in medieval French. In 1916, a year after her graduation, Sayer published her first book, a collection of poems entitled Op. I, which she followed two years later with a second, a slim volume titled Catholic Tales and Christian Songs. The same year she was invited to edit and contribute to the annual editions of Oxford Poetry, which she did for the next three years. In 1923 she published Whose Body?, a murder mystery novel featuring the fictional Lord Peter Wimsey, and went on to write eleven novels and five collections of short stories about the character. The Wimsey stories were popular, and successful enough for Sayers to leave the advertising agency where she was working.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{elements}} of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously {{referred to as a}} film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and William Faulkner, of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, Barton Fink continues to be positively received, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman among its admirers.|$|E

25|$|Furundžija was a {{commander}} of the Jokers- {{a unit of the}} Bosnian Croatian Militia, which allegedly attacked villages of Bosnian Muslims through imprisonment, murder, sexual abuse, and other forms of violence- he was accused of participating in the torture involving forced sexual intercourse of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> the Jokers' headquarters. The prosecution depended on the testimony of the woman, and this drew debate over the credibility of the victim's memory.

She continued writing until the 1970s. She would not get back into the publishing business again but ran a small printing business in the 1950s.|$|E

Edwards stated that it was not in response to Johnson's legal troubles, but instead of insubordination.|$|E
