5|$|On 4 June 1952, Evita {{rode with}} Juan Perón in a parade through Buenos Aires {{in celebration of}} his {{re-election}} as President of Argentina. Evita was by this point so ill that {{she was unable to}} stand without support. Underneath her oversized fur coat was a frame made of plaster and wire that allowed her to stand. She took a triple dose of pain medication before the parade, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> two doses when she returned home.|$|E
5|$|The Lakers won 60 {{games in}} the 1972–73 NBA season, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> Pacific Division title. Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again {{led the league in}} {{rebounding}} and set the still standing NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7%. The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven {{games in the}} conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals. They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Ricciardo was {{the first}} driver to pit {{for a second time}} on lap 30. At the same time, a {{three-way}} fight had emerged for ninth place, with Pérez in front of Grosjean and Verstappen. On lap 32, Verstappen moved ahead of Grosjean <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> position from Pérez, who in turn lost another place to Grosjean in the same manoeuvre. Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 33, prompting Rosberg to follow suit one lap later. Hamilton briefly held the lead, but made a pit stop as well soon after, emerging to set a new fastest lap of the race albeit emerging behind both Ferrari cars. Lap 36 saw a collision between Pastor Maldonado and Marcus Ericsson, but both drivers were able to continue the race. Two laps later, Maldonado was in another fight for position with the other Sauber of Felipe Nasr, moving ahead. He ultimately received a five-second penalty for his part in the incident with Ericsson.|$|E

5|$|Early in the advance, Maxwell's company {{commander}} was severely wounded, resulting in Maxwell assuming control. Reaching the German barbwire defences under intense machine-gun fire, the company suffered heavy casualties, including {{all of the}} officers except Maxwell. Pushing forward alone through a narrow passageway in the wire, Maxwell captured the most dangerous machine gun, killed three Germans <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> four as prisoners; thereby enabling the company {{to move through the}} wire and reach their objective. Shortly afterwards, it was noticed that the company on their left flank was held up and failing to advance. Gathering a party of men, Maxwell led the group in an attempt to attack the German force from the rear. They soon came under heavy machine gun fire, and, single-handedly, Maxwell dashed forward and attacked the foremost gun. Firing his revolver, he managed to shoot five of the crew and silence the gun.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} only one match against England at Lord's, where he got out after scoring one run. Despite {{dropping}} England captain Michael Vaughan from the bowling of Anil Kumble, he eventually stumped Vaughan down the legside <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> catch. He played another match in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against Kenya, taking three catches as India persisted with Dravid's wicket-keeping {{for the majority of}} the English tour. Karthik was not required to bat as India only lost four wickets in their innings. He was subsequently replaced in the ODI team by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took over the gloves from Dravid on a full-time basis; Karthik did not play another ODI until April 2006.|$|E

25|$|Roberts {{supposedly}} {{used one}} of Echos boats, and 13 men armed only with side and small arms, to capture five vessels carrying 250 soldiers. Then one day Echo inadvertently left him behind when she sailed from Jamaica. While he was on shore he observed a French privateer capture the West Indiaman Dorothy Foster. Roberts gathered some volunteer sailors <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> merchant vessel in pursuit, recapturing Dorothy Foster. For this feat Boger informally made Roberts an acting lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate on March 2, 1903, and served the {{remaining}} two years of the term with the Republican majority in the 58th Congress. In 1905, when Ball's term ended, the General Assembly again deadlocked <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> two years to fill the seat. The repeated inability of the Delaware General Assembly to fulfill this constitutional duty contributed strong evidence throughout the nation of the need for the Seventeenth Amendment providing for the popular election of U.S. Senators.|$|E
25|$|In the {{election}} of October, Pogor did not rally with the Conservative–Junimist caucus, and joined the dissident Liberals of Dimitrie Brătianu, winning at ballotage for Iași County, Second College. He also continued to be listed as a Junimist, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> seat {{in the race for}} the First College. Rosetti's cabinet was by then supported by the Conservatives, but fell when a Conservative deputy, Nicolae Moret Blaremberg, stirred political conflicts by proposing to indict the PNL's former governing team—such a project was regarded by Rosetti and the Junimists as entirely demagogic. Both Pogor and Maiorescu were also partly responsible for the PNL's return to power: they abstained form voting against the motion of no confidence which toppled Rosetti.|$|E

25|$|It {{was in a}} club {{match that}} he {{caught the eye of}} former Indian Test batsman Gundappa Viswanath, then a {{selector}} for the state team. In 1989/90, Srinath made his first-class debut for Karnataka against Hyderabad, taking a hat trick in the first innings. He followed this with wickets off successive balls in the second innings. Srinath finished the season with 25 wickets from six matches, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> 20 the following season. The second season involved a display of reverse swing against Maharashtra at the Nehru Stadium in Pune, taking 7/93 to dismiss the home team for 311 in response to a Karnataka total of 638 on a good batting track.|$|E
25|$|Broad {{enjoyed a}} hugely {{successful}} ODI series in Sri Lanka in October 2007, taking eleven wickets {{in the series}} {{at an average of}} 19.27. He took figures of 2–54 in the first match and followed this up with 2–42 in the second match. In the third match of the series Broad made an unbeaten 20 with the bat <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> two wickets. In the final match of the series he took 3–36 and although England lost the match by over 100 runs, they won the series three-two to record its first ever ODI series win in Sri Lanka. This resulted Broad a test debut against Sri Lanka. In a high scoring game, Broad could only manage to take 1 wicket, conceding 95 runs in the process as the match ended in a draw.|$|E

25|$|Australia toured Pakistan {{at the end}} of 1959 for a three Test series {{which they}} won 2–0, Pakistan's first series defeat at home. In the first Test at Dacca the {{tourists}} won by eight wickets, Fazal claimed six wickets including a first innings five-for, 5/71. He missed the second Test at his home city of Lahore, wicket-keeper Imtiaz Ahmed taking over captaincy duties in a match Australia won by seven wickets. Fazal returned for the third Test in Karachi <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> five wicket haul with 5/74 in Australia's first innings. Pakistan gained a lead on first innings but after three early wickets their second innings slowed and the match petered out to a draw. Despite missing a match Fazal was Pakistan's leading wicket-taker for the series, taking 11 at 19.36. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowlers ranking for 1959.|$|E

500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it [...] "difficult" [...] to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of [...] "I Don't Need Anyone". She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided to do this with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together.

He commanded Isis in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and in the Baltic Sea, {{as well as with}} the Channel Fleet. Isis was assigned to the Baltic expedition under Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, and joined Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron for the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The plan of attack had to be improvised at the last minute, after several ships ran aground while trying to enter the harbour, including Nelson's flagship, [...] Walker took Isis in to engage both his own target as well as Elephants, and ended up fighting two Danish blockships and a 14-gun battery. When eventually Nelson was able to work his way down the line he left Walker at his task <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> position. As he passed, Nelson took off his hat, waved it, and cried, 'Well done, brave Walker! Go on as you have begun; nothing can be better'. After four and a half hours of intense fighting Isis silenced her opponents, at the heavy cost of nine officers and 103 men killed or wounded. Nelson came aboard Isis the following morning and thanked Walker and his men for their brave efforts.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Law & Order: Criminal Intent premiered during the 2001–2002 {{television}} {{season on the}} American terrestrial television network NBC. The pilot episode, titled [...] "", aired on Sunday September 30, 2001 at 9:00p.m. EST. Episodes aired weekly until December, when the show took a brief hiatus until January, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>another</b> hiatus during February. The final episode of the season aired at 9:00p.m. on Friday May 10, 2002. Under a $100,000-per-episode shared or second window syndication agreement that cable channel USA Network made with NBC, USA Network was allowed to broadcast episodes out of primetime a week after their premiere on NBC. The season is also under a regular off-network syndication deal at USA Networks and Bravo. The two channels teamed up late 2004 to pay $2 million per episode for the syndication rights to the series, allowing USA Network to air episodes during the week, and Bravo to air episodes at the weekend. In 2007, Fox Television Stations, a group of Fox Broadcasting Company owned-and-operated stations, entered a syndication deal to broadcast episodes {{as part of its}} daytime schedule. From late 2009, MyNetworkTV will broadcast Law & Order: Criminal Intent, including episodes from season one, having changed their business model from a network broadcaster to a syndication programming service. The series has also been distributed to international broadcasters. It aired in Canada on CTV, in France on TF1, in the United Kingdom on Hallmark Channel and Five, in Australia on Network Ten, and in New Zealand on TV3.|$|E
