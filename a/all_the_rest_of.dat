5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, {{along with}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} {{south of the}} now defunct Ozone Park station, {{was taken out of}} service for eight months for restructuring and upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station {{along with the rest of}} the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|Edwards's {{stint as}} the Lions coach was unsuccessful. He guided {{the team to}} a 4–6–1 record in 1941, and Mandel fired him after three {{straight}} losses to begin the 1942 season as the team's roster was depleted by players' service in World War II. Detroit went on to lose <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> its games after John Karcis was named his replacement.|$|E

25|$|The mine owners retaliated with a lockout of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Leadville mines, {{so that by}} 22 June, {{the entire}} mining {{district}} was idled, {{with a total of}} about 2,250 mine workers out of work. The mine owners turned off the dewatering pumps and allowed the mines to start to fill with water, showing that they were prepared for a long strike.|$|E

25|$|Just before daybreak at {{the depth}} of the dark and rain, the waiting women and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the wakefull town heard the great crash as the booms burst, and the cry of the whistle {{signaled}} the men's defeat. Logs from thousands of trees boiled over the broken dams, smashed together in a grinding roar and surged on down the current like giant toothpicks tossed by some elemental energy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} and fall of 2016, Connecticut {{experienced}} a drought {{in many parts of the}} state, causing some water-use bans. As of , 45% of the state was listed at Severe Drought by the US Drought Monitor, including almost all of Hartford and Litchfield counties. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the state was in Moderate Drought or Severe Drought, including Middlesex, Fairfield, New London, New Haven, Windham, and Tolland counties. This affected the agricultural economy in the state.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} culture in Anatolia were Stone Age artifacts. The remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples provide us with many examples of {{the daily lives of}} its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. They, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire.|$|E

25|$|In Aleppo, Syria this custom {{seems to}} go back about 500 years. Most of the {{community}} would arise at 3:00AM to sing Baqashot and {{to listen to the}} voices of the Hazanim, Paytanim, and Meshorerim. When they arrived at Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat they would break to listen to a sermon by one of the Rabbis who discussed the Parashah of the week. When he concluded they would begin Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat and sing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Baqashot.|$|E
25|$|In 1858 Spencer {{produced}} {{an outline of}} what was to become the System of Synthetic Philosophy. This immense undertaking, which has few parallels in the English language, aimed to demonstrate that the principle of evolution applied in biology, psychology, sociology (Spencer appropriated Comte's term for the new discipline) and morality. Spencer envisaged that this work of ten volumes would take twenty years to complete; in the end it took him twice as long and consumed almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> his long life.|$|E

25|$|The congregations also {{competed with}} each other, each one {{desiring}} to bury him {{in its own}} cemetery. Congregation Adath Israel on Elridge Street promised to give his widow $1,000 on the spot and $10 a week <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her life. Congregation Beis HaMidrash HaGadol was permitted to bury him in their plot at the Union Field Cemetery in Ridgewood, Queens. This became a good business venture, for the plots near the grave of the chief rabbi became extremely valuable. The widow received the amount promised for several years, and then they stopped sending her the money.|$|E
25|$|Populated {{places in}} Ukraine are {{split into two}} categories: urban and rural. Urban {{populated}} places are split further into cities and urban-type settlements (a Soviet administrative invention), while rural populated places consist of villages and settlements (a generally used term). All cities have certain degree of self-rule depending on their significance such as national significance (as {{in the case of}} Kiev and Sevastopol), regional significance (within each oblast or autonomous republic) or district significance (<b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> cities). City's significance depends on several factors such as its population, socio-economic and historical importance, infrastructure and others.|$|E
25|$|Chad died on 2 March 672, and {{was buried}} at the Church of Saint Mary which later {{became part of}} the cathedral at Lichfield. Bede relates the death story as that {{of a man who was}} already {{regarded}} as a saint. In fact, Bede has stressed throughout his narrative that Chad's holiness communicated across boundaries of culture and politics, to Theodore, for example, in his own lifetime. The death story is clearly of supreme importance to Bede, confirming Chad's holiness and vindicating his life. The account occupies considerably more space in Bede's account than <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Chad's ministry in Northumbria and Mercia together.|$|E

25|$|The Federal Reserve allowed {{some large}} public bank {{failures}} – particularly {{that of the}} New York Bank of United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed.

25|$|The {{reason for}} the lack on news was that on 22 July the weather was foggy and Blenden Hall had drifted on to the rocks at Inaccessible Island. Two seamen drowned trying to swim to shore. However <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the crew and {{passengers}} on Blenden Hall made it to shore safely. Once there, they were marooned for four months. They subsisted on birds, birds' eggs, and seal meat. On 19 October six men sailed for Tristan da Cunha on a boat or raft that the survivors had constructed; this party was never heard from again. The survivors constructed a second boat that with three men aboard reached Tristan da Cunha on 8 November. Two boats set out from the island and rescued {{the remainder of the}} survivors.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch {{army was}} divided into four groups. The first group, the vanguard, led by Commisaris Jan Thysen, was to attack the bastion of Conception. The center, {{commanded}} by Minne Williemsz Caertekoe, was to attack the Bastion of Santiago and the curtain between Conception and Santiago. The rearguard, commanded by Opperkoopmen Simon de Wit, was to follow up the storming once a breach had been made. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the troops, carpenters, support troops and two Kandyan units, which had arrived, formed the reserve force and occupied the high ground where the battery was mounted. They were commanded by Fiscal Gerard Herbers, the former Dutch commander of the fort at Trincomalee.
