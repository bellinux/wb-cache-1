5|$|Despite their {{relatively}} smaller brains {{compared to}} other primates, lemurs have demonstrated levels of technical intelligence in problem solving that are comparable to those seen in simians. However, their social intelligence differs, often emphasizing within-group competition over cooperation, which {{may be due to}} adaptations for their unpredictable environment. Although lemurs have not been observed using objects <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> in the wild, they can be trained to use objects <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> in captivity and demonstrate a basic understanding about the functional properties of the objects they are using.|$|E

5|$|All {{elephants}} {{have several}} distinctive features, {{the most notable}} {{of which is a}} long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.|$|E
5|$|Falafel {{plays an}} iconic role in Israeli cuisine and is widely {{considered}} to be the national dish of the country. While falafel is not a specifically Jewish dish, it was eaten by Mizrahi Jews in their countries of origin. Later, it was adopted by early Jewish immigrants to Palestine. Due to its being entirely plant based, it is considered pareve under Jewish dietary laws and gained acceptance with Jews because it could be eaten with meat or dairy meals. According to Jonathan Kis-Lev, falafel and hummus are often used as symbols for peace, as well <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> for bridging Israelis and Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|The few {{species of}} demosponge that have entirely soft fibrous skeletons with no hard {{elements}} {{have been used}} by humans over thousands of years for several purposes, including as padding and as cleaning tools. By the 1950s, though, these had been overfished so heavily that the industry almost collapsed, and most sponge-like materials are now synthetic. Sponges and their microscopic endosymbionts are now being researched as possible sources of medicines for treating a wide range of diseases. Dolphins have been observed using sponges <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> while foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such <b>as</b> <b>tools,</b> machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, nickel, cadmium, or lead.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used <b>as</b> <b>tools,</b> suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this paper is}} to derive a set of generalizations that might {{characterize}} children <b>as</b> <b>tool</b> makers/users in the earliest human societies. These generalizations will be sought from the collective wisdom of four distinct bodies of scholarship: lithic archaeology; juvenile chimps <b>as</b> novice <b>tool</b> users; recent laboratory work in human infant and child cognition, focused on objects becoming tools and; the ethnographic study of children learning their community’s tool-kit. The presumption is that this collective wisdom will yield greater insight into children’s development <b>as</b> <b>tool</b> producers and users than has been available to scholars operating within narrower disciplinary limits...|$|R

5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} intimidation was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|Amulets and idols {{fashioned}} from assorted natural materials have occupied an important place among many ethnic groups of Madagascar for centuries. Ody, personal amulets believed to protect or allocate powers to the wearer, were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. The name sampy {{was given to}} those amulets that, while physically indistinguishable from ody, were distinct in that their powers extended over an entire community. The sampy were often personifiedcomplete with a distinct personalityand offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo amassed twelve of the most reputed and powerful sampy from neighboring communities. He furthermore transformed {{the nature of the}} relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen <b>as</b> <b>tools</b> at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the leader's sovereignty and the integrity of the state which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampytwelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmologyand transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones <b>as</b> <b>tools.</b> When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that both ecological and cultural factors predict which dolphins use sponges <b>as</b> <b>tools.</b> Sponging occurs more frequently in areas with higher distribution of sponges, which tends to occur in deeper water channels. Sponging is heavily sex-biased to females. Genetic analyses suggest that all spongers are descendants of a single matriline, suggesting cultural transmission {{of the use of}} sponges <b>as</b> <b>tools.</b> Sponging may be socially learned from mother to offspring. Social grouping behavior suggests homophily (the tendency to associate with similar others) among dolphins that share socially learned skills such as sponge tool use. Sponging has only been observed in Shark Bay.|$|E
