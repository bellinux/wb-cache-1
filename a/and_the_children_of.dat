5|$|Mieza {{was like}} a {{boarding}} school for Alexander <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed {{a passion for the}} works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> Constantine I. Traumatized {{by the events of}} the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which her family had been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the {{minimum spanning tree}} allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The root of the Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum spanning tree edge, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum spanning tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals {{the weight of the}} Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum spanning tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E

5|$|In Mexico on 20August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch {{national}} {{he had met}} {{three years}} earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 {{when they decided to}} camp well away from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Lord Granville died {{in early}} 1846, having never {{recovered}} from a stroke he suffered five years previously. He was buried at Stone, Staffordshire. His death desolated his wife.

Her contacts {{in the outside world}} were chiefly her children and step-children, her brother William, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> her sister Georgiana. She survived her husband by fifteen years, dying on 25 November 1862 of a stroke at her London home at 13 Hereford Street.|$|E
5|$|Mary's {{request to}} be buried in France was refused by Elizabeth. Her body was embalmed and left unburied in a secure lead coffin until her burial, in a Protestant service, at Peterborough Cathedral in late July 1587. Her entrails, removed as part of the {{embalming}} process, were buried secretly within Fotheringhay Castle. Her body was exhumed in 1612 when her son, King James VI and I, ordered that she be reinterred in Westminster Abbey, in a chapel opposite the tomb of Elizabeth I. In 1867, her tomb was opened in an attempt to ascertain the resting place of James I; he was ultimately found with Henry VII, but many of her other descendants, including Elizabeth of Bohemia, Prince Rupert of the Rhine <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> Anne, Queen of Great Britain, were interred in her vault.|$|E
