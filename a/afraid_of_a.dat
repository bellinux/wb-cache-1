5|$|Árbenz was {{initially}} confident that his army would quickly dispatch the rebel force. The victory {{of a small}} garrison of 30 soldiers over the 180 strong rebel force outside Zacapa strengthened his belief. By 21 June, Guatemalan soldiers had gathered at Zacapa {{under the command of}} Colonel Víctor M. León, who was believed to be loyal to Árbenz. León told Árbenz that the counter-attack would be delayed for logistical reasons, but assured him not to worry, as Castillo Armas would be defeated very soon. Other members of the government were not so certain. Army Chief of Staff Parinello inspected the troops at Zacapa on 23 June, and returned to the capital believing that the army would not fight. <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> U.S. intervention in Castillo Armas' favor, he did not tell Árbenz of his suspicions. PGT leaders also began to have their suspicions; acting secretary general Alvarado Monzón sent a member of the central committee to Zacapa to investigate. He returned on 25 June, reporting that the army was highly demoralized, and would not fight. Monzón reported this to Árbenz, who quickly sent another investigator. He too returned the same report, carrying an additional message for Árbenz from the officers at Zacapa—asking the President to resign. The officers believed that given U.S. support for the rebels, defeat was inevitable, and Árbenz was to blame for it. He stated that if Árbenz did not resign, the army was likely to strike a deal with Castillo Armas, and march on the capital with him.|$|E

25|$|On 8 March 2000, 19-year-old {{secondary}} school student Ebrima Barry {{was murdered by}} firefighters in Brikama, West Coast Division. Barry's teacher, a Mr Paul, had called firefighters to the school after Barry had insulted him, in order to remove Barry from the classroom, as he was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical altercation. However, the firefighters not only removed him from the school but took him to their station where they shaved his head, beat him, forced him to carry heavy bags of cement, stripped him naked, poured cement on him and finally put cement {{in his mouth and}} forced him to swallow it. He was able to get home that night but died the next day from his injuries.

25|$|In {{the night}} between 27 and 28 October 1922, about 30,000 Fascist blackshirts {{gathered}} in Rome {{to demand the}} resignation of liberal Prime Minister Luigi Facta and {{the appointment of a}} new Fascist government. On the morning of 28 October, King Victor Emmanuel III, who according to the Albertine Statute held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare martial law, which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed a wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.|$|E
25|$|In March 1921, {{the plans}} for a {{plebiscite}} were abandoned. Neither Lithuania, which was <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> negative result, nor Poland, which {{saw no reason to}} change status quo, wanted the plebiscite. The parties could not agree in which territory to carry out the vote and how Żeligowski's forces should be replaced by League's forces. The League of Nations then moved on from trying to solve the narrow territorial dispute in the Vilnius Region to shaping the fundamental relationship between Poland and Lithuania. During 1921, Belgian Paul Hymans suggested several Polish–Lithuanian federation models, all rejected by both sides. In January 1922, parliamentary election to the Wilno Diet (Sejm wileński) resulted in a landslide Polish victory. In its first session on February 20, 1922, the Diet voted for incorporation into Poland as the Wilno Voivodeship. Polish Sejm accepted the resolution of the Diet. The League of Nations ended its efforts to mediate the dispute. After Lithuanians seized the Klaipėda Region in January 1923, the League saw recognition of Lithuanian interest in Klaipėda as adequate compensation for the loss of Vilnius. The League accepted the status quo in February 1923 by dividing the neutral zone and setting a demarcation line, which was recognized in March 1923 as the official Polish–Lithuanian border. Lithuania did not recognize this border.|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} the CD book voice actors, {{especially}} Tomokazu Seki and Megumi Ogata, who portrayed Sanosuke and Kenshin in the CD books, respectively, did not get their corresponding roles in the anime disappointed Watsuki. Ueda, Sanosuke's voice actor in the Japanese anime, commented that voicing Sanosuke in the original video animations was very complicated because his character was notably older {{and he has not}} acted in the role for a long period. He also said that {{he would have liked to}} see more fights involving Sanosuke in the original video animations, but was happy to see that Sanosuke had matured as a character. Lex Lang, the voice actor of Sanosuke in the English adaptation of the anime, commented that his first impression of Sanosuke was as a fight-driven character motivated by anger, but as the story continued Sanosuke became friendly and more likable. Because his voice is noticeably different from Ueda's, Lang tries to create his own interpretation of Sanosuke's character. Lang has noted that the scene of the episode 22 of the anime, in which Sanosuke is <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train because he believes it is a demon, was the most enjoyable scene for him to record; he added [...] "I recently saw it and had some big laughs." ...|$|E
500|$|The Rescue is {{the first}} story under Dennis Spooner as script editor, though he is not listed in the credits because he {{had little to do}} since much of the job was given to his {{predecessor}} David Whitaker and thus he is not credited. The story was commissioned on 1 November 1964, the day after his contract with the BBC for his position as script editor had expired. The scripts were due on 10 November. In Whitaker's original draft, entitled Doctor Who and Tanni after one of Vicki's original names, there are a few differences from the broadcast version. Bennett was more unkind to Vicki. Notably, Koquillion had a [...] "torch" [...] device, which he used to paralyse Ian upon meeting and interrogating him and Barbara in the first episode.
