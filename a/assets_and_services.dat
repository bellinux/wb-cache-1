[...] For example, the construction industry, which focuses on the delivery of things like buildings, roads, and bridges, has developed its own specialized form of project management that it refers to as construction project management and in which project managers can become trained and certified. [...] The information technology industry has also evolved to develop its own form of project management that {{is referred to as}} IT project management and which specializes in the delivery of technical <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> <b>services</b> that are required to pass through various lifecycle phases such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. Biotechnology project management focuses on the intricacies of biotechnology research and development. Localization project management includes many standard project management practices even though many consider this type of management to be a very different discipline. It focuses on three important goals: time, quality and budget. Successful projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and according to previously agreed quality standards.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{propose that}} {{designing}} a manufacturer’s equipment-based service value proposition in outcome-based contracts is {{the design of}} a new business model capable of managing threats to the firm’s viability that can arise from the contextual variety of use that customers may subject the firm’s value propositions. Furthermore, manufacturers need to understand these emerging business models as the capability of managing both <b>asset</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> provision to achieve use outcomes with customers, including emotional outcomes such as customer experience. Service-Dominant logic proposes that all “goods are a distribution mechanism for service provision,” upon which they propose a value-centric approach to understanding the interactions between the <b>asset</b> <b>and</b> <b>service</b> provision, <b>and</b> suggest a viable systems approach towards reorganising the firm to achieve such a business model. Three case studies of B 2 B equipment-based service systems were analysed to understand customers’ co-creation activities in achieving outcomes, in which the authors found that the co-creation of complex multi-dimensional value could be delivered through the different value propositions of the firm catering to different aspects (dimensions) of the value to be co-created. The study provides a way for managers to understand the effectiveness (rather than efficiency) of firms in adopting emerging business models that design for value co-creation in what are ultimately complex socio-technical systems...|$|R
