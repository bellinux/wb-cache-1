50|$|Deconstructive {{metamorphosis}} {{begins as}} the snow makes {{its way to the}} ground often melting, refreezing, and settling. Water molecules become reordered causing the snowflakes to become more spherical in appearance. These melting snowflakes fuse with others around them becoming larger until all are uniform in size. While the snow is on the ground the melting and joining of snow flakes reduces the height of snowpack by shrinking air spaces and causing the density and mechanical strength of the snowpack to increase. Freshly fallen snow with a density of 0.1 g/cm3 has very good insulating properties; however as time goes on, due to destructive metamorphism the insulating property of the snowpack decreases because the air spaces between snowflakes disappear. Snow that has been residing on the ground {{for a long period of}} time has an average density of 0.40 g/cm3 and conducts heat well; however, once a base of 50 cm of snow with a density around 0.3 g/cm3 has <b>accumulated,</b> <b>temperatures</b> under the snow remain relatively constant because the greater depth of snow compensates for its density. Destructive metamorphosis is a function of time, location, and weather. It occurs at a faster rate with higher temperatures, in the presence of water, under larger temperature gradients (e.g., warm days followed by cold nights), at lower elevations and on slopes that receive large amounts of solar radiation. As time goes on snow settles compacting air spaces, a process expedited by the packing force of the wind.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{circulation}} patterns on extreme thermal resources during the growing season in Poland. Thermal resources were specified using the sums of surpluses of mean daily air temperature values above the thresholds of 5. 0 °C (growing season) and 10. 0 °C (the period of active plant growth) ? the so called effective <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The main aim here is to define the structure of circulation patterns over Poland during the years of extreme thermal resources during the growing season and the period of active plant growth.

40|$|Aim Temperature is an {{important}} environmental factor influencing seed germination. Our objective was to research the seed germination response of 12 Compositae species from the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China to different <b>temperatures</b> using the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> model. Methods All 12 species belong to four genera of Compositae. Seeds of each species were germinated at five constant temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 °C), and germination was recorded once per day. We combined the logistic function and the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> equation and used non-linear regression to estimate the base <b>temperature</b> and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> for seed germination of each species. Important findings The average base <b>temperature</b> and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> of the 12 species were 0 °C and 94. 5 °C·d, respectively. The base temperature was lower and the <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> was higher than reported by previous researchers. These {{are the result of}} long-term adaptation to the temperature environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. There was a significant negative correlation between base <b>temperature</b> and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> (p = 0. 04). Therefore, species with lower base temperature would avoid the risk of seeds germinating earlier in an environment with changeable temperature. A significant positive correlation existed between seedmass and <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> (p = 0. 01). Under relatively constant base temperature, small-seeded species germinated faster than large-seeded ones, giving them priority of germination in early succession...|$|R

30|$|With the {{improvement}} of the meteorological recording method, in 1735, Dullir first discovered that plants completed their life cycle requiring a certain <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature,</b> that is, plants from sowing to maturity required a certain amount of daily average temperature accumulation. It can be said that solar terms, <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperature,</b> and phenology are the summary and reflection of the farmers’ production experience, and they play a guiding role in agricultural production. However, this agricultural proverb has a long history and is highly targeted in its geographical scope. <b>Accumulated</b> <b>temperature</b> is one of the important indicators for judging the agricultural season, which lays the foundation for the automatic identification of farming season, but the cumulative temperature {{is only one of the}} many meteorological factors, and more factors need to be considered. Phenology is more reliable, but it is more dependent on human experience judgments; there are many limitations to achieve automatic identification. Overall, these three methods reveal a strong correlation between the crop growth cycle and agro-climatic resources and require the use of association rule algorithms for mining.|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} {{life-cycle}} events crucially influences fitness, particularly in migratory birds, which visit chains of sites with varying seasonality.

Our results not only identified day length, local accumulated temperature, and their interaction as likely candidates, but also (more importantly) showed {{for the first time}} that their relevance changes en route. The results suggest that the birds switch on a “migratory program” in their wintering grounds, with day length providing general information on time of the year and integrated temperatures providing information on larger scale climate trends.

40|$|Abiotic and biotic {{factors have}} the {{potential}} to alter herb communities, however, few studies consider feedback between them. This study explores how variation of species interaction and climatic conditions associated with changes in altitude affect herb community composition. We sampled <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures</b> of growth duration (June-November) (ATGD), maximum summer temperatures (MST) and herb community composition (herb height, abundance, richness) on non-gaps and forest-gaps site across an elevational gradient. A significant negative relationship was detected between MST and herb richness. The temperature of non-gaps was cooler than that of forest gaps, and overstory cover positively correlated with herb abundance. However, the ATGD exhibited a negative relationship with overstory cover, in that overstory cover decreased with ATGD. We suggested that temperature has a profound effect on height and richness of herb communities, while the overstory cover is moderating the effect of temperature on herb community structure and influence the abundance of herb community. Conversely, decreases in ATGD weakened the relative importance of overstory cover. We concluded that the interaction of temperature and overstory cover shapes the morphology, abundance and richness of herb communities...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis of}} this paper is that impacts from climatic change can be {{evaluated}} effectively as changes in the frequency of short-term, anomalous climatic events. These can then be expressed as changes in the level of risk of impact from climatic extremes. To evaluate this approach, the risk of crop failure resulting from low levels of accumulated temperature is assessed for oats farming in southern Scotland. Annual <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures</b> are calculated for the 323 -year long temperature record compiled by Manley for Central England. These are bridged across to southern Scotland and, by calculating mean levels of risk for different elevations, an average "risk surface" is constructed. 1 -in- 10 and 1 -in- 50 frequencies of crop failure are assumed to delineate a high-risk zone, which is mapped for the 323 -year period by constructing isopleths of these risk levels. By re-drawing the risk isopleths for warm and cool 50 -year periods, the geographical shift of the high-risk zone is delineated. The conclusion is that relatively recent and apparently minor climatic variations in the United Kingdom have in fact induced substantial spatial changes in levels of agricultural risk. An advantage of expressing climatic change as a change in agricultural risk, is that support programs for agriculture can be re-tuned to accommodate acceptable frequencies of impact by adjusting support levels to match new risk levels...|$|E
40|$|Miscanthus sacchariflorus is {{a fast-growing}} C 4 {{perennial}} grass that can naturally hybridize with M. sinensis to produce interspecific hybrids, {{such as the}} sterile triploid M. ? giganteus. The creation of such hybrids {{is essential for the}} rapid domestication of this novel bioenergy crop. However, progress has been hindered by poor understanding of the environmental cues promoting floral transition in M. sacchariflorus, which flowers less readily than M. sinensis. The purpose of this work was to identify the flowering requirements of M. sacchariflorus genotypes in order to expedite the introduction of new germplasm optimized to different environments. Six M. sacchariflorus accessions collected from a range of latitudes were grown under controlled photoperiod and temperature conditions, and flowering, biomass, and morphological phenotypic data were captured. Results indicated that M. sacchariflorus, irrespective of origin, is a quantitative short-day plant. Flowering under static long days (15. 3 h daylength), compared with shorter photoperiods, was delayed by an average 61 d, with an average associated increase of 52 % of above-ground biomass (DM plant? 1).

40|$|In {{temperate}} zones, {{the seasonal}} cycling of perennials comprises two main steps: a growing period when environmental conditions are favourable and a non-growing period in winter. Winter dormancy {{consists of two}} phases: endodormancy and ecodormancy [1]. The former is the deepest state of the dormancy controlled by the meristem itself, while the latter is controlled by environmental factors, such as <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This phenological cycle {{has been shown to}} be strongly affected by climatic change: higher temperature having a positive effect on ecodormancy phase by accelerating meristem cell growth and early bud break is particularly crucial to consider not only in respect to increasing length of the growing season, but also regarding the risk of frost damage. For these reasons, understanding the molecular mechanism controlling the shift from endo- to ecodormancy is of main importance to optimize the management of forest tree plantations to their most likely environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to characterize the transcriptome of endo- and eco-dormant sessile oaks (a major broadleaf species in Europe) by RNA-seq and to identify differentially expressed genes between these two dormancy stages.

A com-mon view among the scientific community and public health officers is that heavy rainfalls have a flushing effect on breeding sites, which negatively affects vector populations, thereby diminishing disease transmission. During 2014 in Montpellier, France, there were at least 11 autochthonous cases of chikungunya caused by the invasive tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus in the vicinity of an imported case. We show that an extreme rainfall event increased and extended the abundance of the disease vector Ae. albopictus, hence the period of autochthonous transmission of chikungunya. Methodology/Principal Findings We report results from close monitoring of the adult and egg population of the chikungunya vector Ae. albopictus through weekly sampling over the entire mosquito breeding season, which revealed an unexpected pattern. Statistical analysis of the seasonal dynamics of female abundance in relation to climatic factors showed that these relationships changed after the heavy rainfall event. Before the inundations, <b>accumulated</b> <b>temperatures</b> are the most important variable predicting Ae. albopictus seasonal dynamics.
