40|$|This paper {{uses the}} non-competitive I-O {{model and the}} Tapio {{decoupling}} model to comprehensively analyze the decoupling relationship between {{the output of the}} <b>product</b> <b>sector</b> in China and its embodied carbon emissions under trade openness. For this purpose, the Chinese input and output data in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2012 are used. This approach is beneficial to identify the direct mechanism for the increased carbon emission in China from a micro perspective and provides a new perspective for the subsequent study about low-carbon economy. The obtained empirical results are as follows: (1) From overall perspective, the decoupling elasticity between the output of the <b>product</b> <b>sector</b> and its embodied carbon emissions decreased. Output and embodied carbon emissions showed a growth link from 2002 to 2005 and a weak decoupling relationship {{for the rest of the}} study period. (2) Among the 28 industries in the <b>product</b> <b>sector,</b> the increased growth rate of output in more and more <b>product</b> <b>sectors</b> was no longer accompanied by large CO 2 emissions. The number of industries with strong decoupling relationships between output and embodied carbon emissions increased. (3) From the perspective of three industries, the output and embodied carbon emissions in the second and third industries exhibited a growth link only from 2002 to 2005; the three industries presented weak or strong decoupling for the rest of the study period. Through empirical analysis, this paper mainly through the construction of ecological and environmental protection of low carbon agriculture, low carbon cycle industrial system, as well as intensive and efficient service industry to reduce the carbon emissions of China’s <b>product</b> <b>sector...</b>|$|R
