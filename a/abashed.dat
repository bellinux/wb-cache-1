25|$|To {{obtain the}} monkeys {{used in the}} climactic sequence, Herzog paid several locals to trap 400 monkeys; he paid them half in advance and was to pay the other half upon receipt. The trappers sold the monkeys to someone in Los Angeles or Miami, and Herzog came to the airport just as the monkeys were being loaded to be shipped out of the country. He pretended to be a {{veterinarian}} and claimed that the monkeys needed vaccinations before leaving the country. <b>Abashed,</b> the handlers unloaded the monkeys, and Herzog loaded them into his jeep and drove away, used them in the shot they were required for, and released them afterwards into the jungle.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} scene the two girls are {{returning}} from school, Agnes accompanied by her punning attribute, a lamb with a cruciform halo, and carrying a martyr's palm. They are accosted by Procopius, the young son of the Prefect of Rome, who has {{fallen in love with}} Agnes and shows her an open casket of jewels to persuade her to marry him. The inside of the casket is white, the only colour of opaque enamel in the original work, used only for a few highlights like the tiny area of the host held by Christ {{on the inside of the}} cover. Agnes [...] rejects him, with the words Illi sum desponsata cui angeli serviunt ("I am betrothed to him who the angels serve") in a banderole above. In the Caxton her rejection is unequivocal and not polite, and she points out that her heavenly fiancé has promised her much better jewels. [...] The Prefect stands behind his son, and in the next scene has sentenced her to serve in a brothel for being a Christian who refuses to sacrifice to the goddess Vesta. Caxton's Legend fills in the intervening action: Then made she of the bordel her oratory, ... All they that entered made honour and reverence to the great clearness that they saw about St. Agnes, and came out more devout and more clean than they entered. At last came the son of the provost with a great company for to accomplish his foul desires and lusts. And when he saw his fellows come out and issue all <b>abashed,</b> he mocked them and called them cowards. And then he, all araged, entered for to accomplish his evil will. And when he came to the clearness, he advanced him for to take the virgin, and anon the devil took him by the throat and strangled him that he fell down dead. In the next scene on the cup, Agnes stands outside the sentry box-like brothel, looking down at the Prefect's son who has been strangled to death by the devil crouched over him; a banderole reads Quo modo cecidisti qui mane oriebaris ("How has thou fallen that risest in the morning", [...] ), and the Prefect looks on sadly.|$|E

2500|$|... 'The Deemster' {{will live}} in the {{literature}} of the English nation, their own descendants <b>abashed</b> and wondering, and asking what their fathers meant by an indifference so stupid and so unaccountable. Of course I can see that the year 1887 must always be an epoch in Manx history, the year 'The Deemster’ was published.|$|E
2500|$|Dover {{wrote that}} he understands what Scruton meant by {{describing}} his Greek Homosexuality as [...] "trivialising", but adds that, [...] "I am not <b>abashed,</b> because despite profound agreement with part of his analysis of sexual emotion, I attach importance to some phenomena which he ignores." [...] The philosopher Christopher Janaway, writing in The Oxford Companion to Philosophy (1995), identified Sexual Desire as one of several works in which Scruton challenges the conventional boundaries of analytic philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|The Gryllus {{dialogue}} {{was taken}} up by another Italian writer, Giovan Battista Gelli, in his La Circe (1549). This {{is a series of}} ten philosophical and moral dialogues between Ulysses and the humans transformed into various animals, ranging from an oyster to an elephant, in which Circe sometimes joins. Most argue against changing back; only the last animal, a philosopher in its former existence, wants to. The English poet Edmund Spenser also makes reference to Plutarch's dialogue in the section of his Faerie Queene (1590) based on the Circe episode which appears at the end of Book II. Sir Guyon changes back the victims of Acrasia's erotic frenzy in the Bower of Bliss, most of whom are <b>abashed</b> at their fall from chivalric grace, ...|$|E
2500|$|Trinity's mascot, the bantam, was {{conceived}} by Joseph Buffington, Class of 1875, {{who was a}} federal judge and trustee of the College. He was a noted speaker, and gave an address during an 1899 dinner with alumni of other prestigious colleges. Giving his view on what a Trinity student is, and supporting his view that Trinity students {{are different from the}} [...] "collegiate barnyard" [...] consisting of Harvard and Yale (amongst others such as Amherst), Buffington said: [...] "But I tell you, my fellow chanticleers, that the Trinity bantam has been brought up in the Trinity barnyard on different principles, and the most marked outcome of his collegiate training is the fostering of a habit which leads him to size things from his own standpoint, and not have somebody else size them for him." [...] He continued, saying: [...] "You will therefore understand, gentlemen, the spirit in which the Trinity bantam, game from comb to spur, crows at your door, hops in, shakes his tail feathers, and with a sociable nod to the venerable John, and a good natured [...] "How d'ydo" [...] to the ponderous old Elihu steps into the collegiate cock pit, makes his best bow to the tiger, says he is glad to be here, is not a whit <b>abashed</b> at your hugeness, [...] is satisfied with himself and his own particular coop." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too <b>abashed</b> to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E
