The ideal electromagnetic actuator will have capabilities of producing large deflection and high tuneable frequency. These two characteristics make the actuator very attractive for the present application. Much effort has been put into the development of the proposed <b>diaphragm</b> <b>air</b> <b>pump</b> because it is easily integrated into the complex system. The characteristics of the magnetic field of the electromagnetic coils are thoroughly investigated in order to complete the design optimization for the proposed electromagnetic actuator. As the base of the design optimization for the proposed planar and cylindrical coils, the proposed model of magnetic field distribution for a circular current loop is developed. The design optimization for various parameters of planar coils was thoroughly investigated. Approximate approaches to determine the electromagnetic forces are discussed. Models for diaphragm deflection were determined. The fluid model for evaluation of flow rate form the output of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> was developed. The {{feasibility of}} using nozzle/diffuser elements as components of air pumps is investigated. The geometry of nozzle/diffuser elements was designed and the chamber configuration for the proposed electromagnetic air pump was determined. The proposed air pumps, including the electromagnetic actuator, PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) diaphragm, and chamber and nozzle/diffuser elements were built. Several experiments were conducted to investigate the performances of the proposed electromagnetic actuator including the deflection of diaphragm and frequency characteristics. The flow rate of the proposed air pump was measured. In conclusion this study supplies solid evidence of achievements using electromagnetic actuators in air pumps...|$|R

Limitation of excessive deformation of the diaphragm {{is of utmost}} importance for eliminating fatigue failures of the diaphragm and thereby obtaining a high reliability of the piston <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump.</b> The deformation shape of the diaphragm {{is the result of}} a complex 2 -way Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) mechanism within the pump chamber between the propelling fluid, the <b>diaphragm</b> and the <b>pumped</b> slurry.

We tested on the prototype under the driving voltage of 260 Vpp. The results show that the diaphragm system reaches resonance under the driving frequency of 265 Hz, which is very close to the fundamental frequency of check valve. Compared with the rectangular piezoelectric vibrator’s amplitude, the diaphragm’s amplitude is double amplified.

40|$|Exhaust after {{treatment}} technology {{based on a}} reductant (urea) injection into the silencer, {{has been set up}} to be a very efficient tool to reduce the emission of the Engines especially NOx. The reductant is stored in a tank positioned on the truck chassis. The reductant tank volume of today is required to be increased to meet the requirements of the market and that is motivated by Euro VI regulations which aim to a higher reduction of the emission of the NOx of the trucks. In this thesis the installation of dual reductant (Adblue) tanks on the truck chassis has been successfully setup. A proper method to transfer reductant from secondary to primary tank including a method to monitor the volume levels inside both tanks has been developed. Moreover, the installation of dual tanks deals with a liquid with a corrosive nature together with a truck that works in both cold and hot conditions, therefore there is a big challenge {{to come up with a}} concept robust enough. Also previous work in this area has been investigated to avoid the weaknesses for a developed solution. An <b>air</b> operated double <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> has been selected to transfer the reductant and an electromagnetic level sensor CAN-based type to monitor the reductant inside the tanks.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. In this paper, we take two important steps to analyse hydropneumatic systems and their components. In this regard, we first extend a new all-speed approach to solve the full onedimensional Navier-Stokes equations. The extended approach can be equally used to simulate both gas and liquid flows, considering an equivalent gas constant for the latter case. We further apply the extended approach to analyse both liquid water and air flows through two separate hydro-pneumatic circuits. To verify the accuracy of our solution, we compare our solutions with those of Lax-Wendroff method. The comparison shows that the current proposed all-speed algorithm provides solutions with excellent accuracy. One important advantage of this new extended algorithm is in treating the two-phase fluid flow problems, where there are mixed liquid water and vapour behaviours, e. g., <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps.</b> Therefore, as a second contribution, we simulate a multi-component <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump,</b> whose parts consist of check valves, signal subsystems, conveys, and air distribution system.

40|$|Commercial pumps {{tested at}} MIT's Jensen lab for {{applications}} pumping highly corrosive materials at medium pressure (100 - 300 psi) {{and a low}} flow rate (less than 50 mL/min) have proven unreliable. The most common failures observed have been check valve failure and insufficient chemical compatibility. Some of these pumps use dual reciprocating pistons to drive the fluid, requiring the use of four check valves. This lowers {{the reliability of the}} pump as a whole to an undesirable level. A novel pump system design could operate without the need for any check valves. Operating three <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pumps</b> in series creates a pseudo-peristaltic pump, but requires check valves on both sides of each <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump.</b> Instead, a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pump</b> was designed such that the diaphragm can completely seal at the apex of each stroke, eliminating the need for check valves between the pumps. Proper timing of the draw and pump phases of the cycle of each pump eliminates the need for check valves at the ends of the series as well. Thus, each stroke of the pump is able to drive fluid forward and seal to allow adjacent pumps to draw effectively and prevent them from creating backflow. Additionally, current pumps have problems with chemical compatibility due to poor material selection. Thus, this new pump could be made to be more reliable and more robust against corrosion by choosing materials with high chemical compatibility.
