25|$|One Christmas was so {{much like}} another, in those years, around the sea-town corner now, and out of all sound except the distant {{speaking}} of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep, that I can never remember whether it snowed for six days and six nights when I was twelve or whether it snowed for twelve days and twelve nights when I was six; or whether the ice broke and the skating grocer vanished like a snowman through a white trap-door on that same Christmas Day that the mince-pies finished Uncle Arnold and we tobogganed down the seaward hill, all the afternoon, on the best tea-tray, and Mrs. Griffiths complained, and we threw a snowball at her niece, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> burned so, with {{the heat and the}} cold, when I held them in front of the fire, that I cried for twenty minutes and then had some jelly.|$|E
500|$|Although Verlaine {{was against}} drug use after Television formed, {{he once had}} a {{short-lived}} phase using psychedelic drugs, to which he makes reference in similes on songs such as [...] "Venus". The vignette-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: [...] "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> are like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." [...] According to Waterman, although psychedelic trips informed the experiences of many artists in lower Manhattan at the time, [...] "Venus" [...] contributed to the impression of Marquee Moon as a transcendental work in the vein of 19th-century Romanticism: [...] "Verlaine is into perception, and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance." [...] Christgau said the lyric about Broadway lent the album its association among critics to the East Village, as it [...] "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands,</b> and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|And yet she is {{also shown}} as having real power in the play. When {{threatened}} to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: [...] "She {{is not to be}} silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: 'My resolution <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> I'll trust/ None about Caesar' (IV. 15.51–52)". From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.|$|E
2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she {{received}} her answer {{in the form of a}} heavenly vision. As she described it:The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, [...] "GO TO KIOWA," [...] <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> were lifted and thrown down and the words, [...] "I'LL STAND BY YOU." [...] The words, [...] "Go to Kiowa," [...] were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but [...] "I'll stand by you," [...] was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: [...] "Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Above all, Debussy was {{inspired}} by nature and the impression it made on the mind, making a pantheistic profession of faith when he called [...] "mysterious Nature" [...] his religion. 'I do not practice religion {{in accordance with the}} sacred rites. I have made mysterious Nature my religion. I do not believe that a man is any nearer to God for being clad in priestly garments, nor that one place in a town is better adapted to meditation than another. When I gaze at a sunset sky and spend hours contemplating its marvellous ever-changing beauty, an extraordinary emotion overwhelms me. Nature in all its vastness is truthfully reflected in my sincere though feeble soul. Around me are the trees stretching up their branches to the skies, the perfumed flowers gladdening the meadow, the gentle grass-carpeted earth, ... <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> unconsciously assume an attitude of adoration. ... To feel the supreme and moving beauty of the spectacle to which Nature invites her ephemeral guests! ... that is what I call prayer.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E
