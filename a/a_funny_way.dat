This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find {{a different sort of}} gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, but that was enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

Benn's contact with leading politicians of the day, {{dates back to}} his earliest years. He met Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald when he was five years old, whom he described as: [...] "A kindly old gentleman [...] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit.

[...] Benn also met former Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George when he was twelve, and later recalled that, while still a boy, he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi; in 1931, while his father was Secretary of State for India.|$|E
500|$|The idea of Ann {{making out}} with Chris Traeger {{was not part}} of the {{original}} screenplay, but was added after the first cast read-through of the script. The writing staff felt that while Ben was immediately connected to Leslie and the other characters through his role in eliminating wasteful spending at Pawnee, Chris still needed something to more strongly connect to the cast, and the subplot with Ann was determined to be <b>a</b> <b>funny</b> <b>way</b> to do it. In one scene, after Ben explains the need for severe budget cuts at Pawnee, Ron asks Leslie, [...] "What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?" [...] That line was not in the first draft of the script, but was added during filming as a possible alternative line for the editors to choose from later. The staff found it so funny, however, that they chose to use it and the original line was never filmed.|$|E

Stevens donated an undisclosed amount of money to the campaign, and also starred in television and magazine advertisements supporting the cause.
