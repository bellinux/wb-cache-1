The ancient lineages appear most in Asia but least in Europe because the Victorian era development of modern dog breeds used little of the ancient lineages. All dog populations (breed, village, and feral) show some evidence of genetic admixture between modern and ancient dogs. Some ancient dog populations that once occupied Europe and the New World no longer exist. This implies that some ancient dog populations were entirely replaced and others <b>admixed</b> {{over a long period}} of time.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{studies of}} Parsis of Pakistan show sharp {{contrast}} between genetic {{data obtained from}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA), different from most populations. Historical records suggests that they had moved from Iran to Gujarat, India and then to Mumbai and Karachi, Pakistan. According to Y-DNA, they resemble Iranian population which supports historical records. When mtDNA pool is compared to Iranians and Gujaratis (their putative parental populations), it contrasted Y-DNA data. About 60% of their maternal gene pool originates from South Asian haplogroups, which is just 7% in Iranians. Parsis has high frequency of haplogroup M (55%), similar to Indians, which is just 1.7% in combined Iranian sample. The studies suggest sharp contrast between the maternal and paternal component of Parsis. Due to high diversity in Y-DNA and mtDNA lineages, the strong drift effect is unlikely {{even though they had}} small population. The studies suggest a male-mediated migration of Parsi ancestors from Iran to Gujarat where they <b>admixed</b> with local female population during initial settlements which ultimately resulting in loss of Iranian mtDNA.|$|E

25|$|East Asia: In 2002, a {{study of}} {{maternal}} mDNA indicated that the dog diverged from its ancestor in East Asia because there were more dog mDNA haplotypes found there than {{in other parts of}} the world, but this was rebutted because village dogs in Africa also show a similar haplotype diversity. In 2015, a whole genome analysis of modern dog and wolf sequences concluded that based on the genetic diversity of today's East Asian dogs, the dog had originated in southern East Asia, followed by a migration of a subset of ancestral dogs 15,000 YBP towards the Middle East, Africa and Europe and reaching Europe 10,000 YBP. Then, one of these lineages migrated back to northern China and <b>admixed</b> with endemic Asian lineages before migrating to the Americas. A criticism of this proposal is that no dog remains date beyond 12,000 YBP in this region but date to 14,000 YBP in western Europe, however it is accepted that archaeological studies in the Far East are generally lagging behind those in Europe.|$|E

The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and Great Lakes region wolf are highly <b>admixed</b> with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf–coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000-117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present.

25|$|In 2015, {{during an}} attempt to {{understand}} the genetic identity of the rapidly expanding jackal populations in Europe, an international team of researchers examined 15 microsatellite markers and a 406 base-pair fragment of the mtDNA control region from the tissue samples of 97 specimens throughout Europe and Asia Minor. The results showed that European jackals have much lower haplotype diversity than those in Israel (where they have <b>admixed</b> with dogs, grey wolves and African wolves), and that they mostly descend from populations originating from the Caucasus. The highest level of haplotype diversity was found in Peloponnesian jackals, which may represent a relict population of Europe's original golden jackals prior to their extirpation elsewhere. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the genetics of Baltic jackals, as all Baltic states class the animal as an artificially introduced invasive species subject to extermination. It was found that jackals in Estonia originate from the south-eastern European population, whereas those in Lithuania are of Caucasian origin; this was concluded to render the hypothesis of an artificial introduction unlikely, and that their presence in both states was consistent with the natural northward expansion of both southeastern and eastern European populations.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, a study {{proposed}} that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from [...] Eurasia. In 2010, a {{study found that the}} coyote was a basal member of the clade that included the Tibetan wolf, the Dog, the Mongolian wolf and the Eurasian wolf, with the Tibetan wolf diverging early from wolves and domestic dogs. In 2016, a whole-genome DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000–117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly <b>admixed</b> with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time.

Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present. The study found that coyote ancestry was highest in red wolves from the southeastern United States and lowest among the Great Lakes region wolves. The theory proposed was that this pattern matched the south to north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization and its resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the southeast, and as the wolf population declined, wolf-coyote admixture increased. Later, this process occurred in the Great Lakes region with the influx of coyotes replacing wolves, followed by the expansion of coyotes and their hybrids across the wider region. The proposed timing of the wolf/coyote divergence conflicts with the finding of a coyote-like specimen in strata dated to 1 Mya.|$|E

In this study, paired pure Pinus massoniana plantations, Cinnamomum camphora plantations and mixed Pinus massoniana – Cinnamomum camphora plantations at ages of 10, 24 and 45  years were selected to test whether the mixed plantations sequestrate more organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) in soils and whether this <b>admixing</b> effect becomes more pronounced with stand ages. The results showed that tree species identification, composition and stand age significantly affected soil OC and N stocks.

40|$|Complex doping schemes in RE$_ 3 $Al$_ 5 $O$_{ 12 }$ (RE=rare earth element) garnet {{compounds}} {{have recently}} led to pronounced improvements in scintillator performance. Specifically, by <b>admixing</b> lutetium and yttrium aluminate garnets with gallium and gadolinium, the band-gap was altered {{in a manner}} that facilitated the removal of deleterious electron trapping associated with cation antisite defects. Here, we expand upon this initial work to systematically investigate the effect of substitutional <b>admixing</b> on the energy levels of band edges. Density functional theory was used to survey potential <b>admixing</b> candidates that modify either the conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band maximum (VBM). We considered two sets of compositions based on Lu$_ 3 $B$_ 5 $O$_{ 12 }$ where B = Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb; and RE$_ 3 $Al$_ 5 $O$_{ 12 }$, where RE = Lu, Gd, Dy, and Er. We found that <b>admixing</b> with various RE cations does not appreciably effect the band gap or band edges. In contrast, substituting Al with cations of dissimilar ionic radii has a profound impact on the band structure. We further show that certain dopants can be used to selectively modify only the CBM or the VBM. Specifically, Ga and In decrease the band gap by lowering the CBM, while As and Sb decrease the band gap by raising the VBM. These results demonstrate a powerful approach to quickly screen the impact of dopants on the electronic structure of scintillator compounds, identifying those dopants which alter the band edges in very specific ways to eliminate both electron and hole traps responsible for performance limitations.
