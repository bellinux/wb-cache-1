5|$|Like her {{predecessor}} Rudd, Gillard {{had said}} that health is <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> in her agenda. She announced during the 2010 election, {{that there would be}} an increase of 270 placements for emergency doctors and nurses and 3,000 extra nursing scholarships over the following 10 years. She also said mental health would be <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> in her second term, with a $277million suicide-prevention package which would target high-risk groups. As the election delivered a hung parliament, a $1.8billion package was given to rural hospitals, which was agreed to by the independents to support her re-election.|$|E
5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%.

However, with its double chimney and {{subsequent}} fitting {{of a double}} Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E
5|$|Ten of GO's train {{stations}} are shared with Via Rail. GO also connects with fifteen other municipal transit providers, {{such as the}} TTC.

Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was <b>a</b> <b>priority,</b> combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce. The Cabinet received criticism for holding to hard in the public finances, with limited investments, and the support of Reinfeldt's policies dropped to one of the lowest ever seen for an incumbent Government.|$|E

30|$|There {{are several}} {{works in the}} {{literature}} that have adopted <b>a</b> dynamic <b>priority</b> assignment to deal with (m,k)-firm scheduling approaches[18, 19, 23, 24]. Nevertheless, it often occurs that <b>a</b> fixed <b>priority</b> scheduling can be more attractive than <b>a</b> dynamic <b>priority</b> one, due to its implementation simplicity and lower overhead. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} wireless sensor networks due to the inherent limitations in processing power and energy consumption that must be dealt with when implementing applications upon sensor nodes. Therefore, in this work, we adopted <b>a</b> fixed <b>priority</b> scheduling algorithm for the (m,k)-firm task model.|$|R

The first prime minister made it <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water toilets, providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its limited}} release, English-language copies of Panzer Dragoon Saga are rare and sell for high prices. It {{has not been}} re-released. In 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for the game-downloading service GameTap stated that GameTap had non-exclusive rights to distribute the game, but as Saturn emulation is difficult, there was not enough demand to make it <b>a</b> <b>priority.</b> In the same year, Futatsugi stated that Sega had lost the game's source code, which would make porting the game difficult.|$|E
5|$|Betances also {{promoted}} {{direct intervention}} of Puerto Ricans in the Cuban independence struggle, which eventually {{happened in the}} Cuban War of Independence (1895–98). Spain had promoted political reform in Puerto Rico, and the local political climate was not conducive to a second revolution at the time. Therefore, Betances and the Puerto Rican revolutionaries ceded their caches of firearms hidden in Saint Thomas, Curaçao and Haiti to the Cuban rebels in October 1871, since their struggle was deemed as <b>a</b> <b>priority.</b>|$|E

50|$|Priority {{inversion}} {{can also}} reduce the perceived performance of the system. Low priority tasks usually have <b>a</b> low <b>priority</b> {{because it is not}} important for them to finish promptly (for example, they might be a batch job or another non-interactive activity). Similarly, <b>a</b> high <b>priority</b> task has <b>a</b> high <b>priority</b> because it {{is more likely to be}} subject to strict time constraints—it may be providing data to an interactive user, or acting subject to realtime response guarantees. Because priority inversion results in the execution of <b>a</b> lower <b>priority</b> task blocking the high priority task, it can lead to reduced system responsiveness, or even the violation of response time guarantees.|$|R
5|$|Cullacabardee {{is located}} over an {{unconfined}} aquifer {{known as the}} Gnangara Mound, a major supplier of scheme groundwater to the Perth Metropolitan Area. The area is classified as an underground Water Pollution Control Area under the Water Authority Act 1984 and <b>a</b> <b>Priority</b> 1 drinking water source by the Department of Water. A survey of soils {{in the area in}} April 1999 indicated that Cullacabardee's soil is located in the Bassendean Sand soil association, and is a leached white siliceous sand of mineral quartz, with negligible phosphorus retention capability. Vegetation is mainly low woodland forests of sheoak and banksia, with scattered jarrah.|$|E

In addition, he sought younger actors to play the assassins, in {{particular}} Sousuke Takaoka and Takayuki Yamada, with whom Miike had worked in his two films, Crows Zero (2007) and its sequel Crows Zero 2 (2009). The film's screenplay was written by Daisuke Tengan, who had also written the screenplay for Miike's film Audition (1999).|$|E
5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was <b>a</b> <b>priority</b> for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
