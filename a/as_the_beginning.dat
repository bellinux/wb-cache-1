5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without resolution, and notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E

5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the village center, NY31 and NY370 split, with NY31 {{retaining}} the Genesee Street name and heading northeast towards Oneida Lake. NY370, meanwhile, travels southeast on Salina Street, loosely paralleling the Erie Canal as it heads toward Syracuse. The route intersects NY631 before leaving Baldwinsville and heading into another rural section of Lysander. This open stretch ends at the canalside hamlet of Cold Springs, which serves <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of the Syracuse suburbs. After passing through the community, NY370 crosses over the conjoined Erie Canal and Seneca River and enters the town of Salina. Not far from the canal is a junction with John Glenn Boulevard, a four-lane arterial connecting NY370 to Interstate690 (I-690).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1980 the {{eligibility}} year for nominations {{was set to}} the calendar year, rather than December–November as initially conceived, and the SFWA organizing panel was allowed to add an additional work. Authors were also allowed to use the mass-market paperback publication of their books <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> of their nomination period, rather than the initial hardback publication. As {{a consequence of the}} combination of this rule and the rolling eligibility, the 2007 awards, despite nominally being for works published in 2006, instead were all given to works initially published in 2005. Beginning with the 2010 awards, the rolling eligibility system and paperback publication exemption were replaced with the current rules.|$|E
