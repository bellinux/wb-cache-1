5|$|Many weekend visitors—particularly from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia—prefer Belgrade nightlife to that {{of their}} own capitals, due to a {{perceived}} friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, the lack of language difficulties, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> restrictive night life regulation.|$|E

5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> documentation to prove it.

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|Agaricus bitorquis, also edible, has {{a similar}} appearance, but can be {{distinguished}} by its double ring, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a fishy or briny odor. Additionally, A.bitorquis does not stain reddish when cut, and usually {{does not have a}} scaly or warty cap. The Hungarian species A.bernardiiformis, named for its similarity to A.bernardii, is distinguished from the latter by its smaller spores (6.2–8.2 by 5.4–6.2μm) and its club-shaped cheilocystidia that measure 17–35 by 7–9.5μm. MycoBank, however, considers the two species to be conspecific.|$|E
5|$|Although {{rubidium}} is {{more abundant}} in Earth's crust than caesium, the limited applications <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> a mineral rich in rubidium limits {{the production of}} rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year. Several methods are available for separating potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O yields after 30 subsequent steps pure rubidium alum. Two other methods are reported, the chlorostannate process and the ferrocyanide process.|$|E

5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995. American cited {{the aftermath of}} the early 1990s recession <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> local passengers as reasons for the closure. As American scaled down its operations, it subleased its gates to other carriers, largely in order to cover the debt used to construct the hub facilities, which American had guaranteed. Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
5|$|Author Timothy White {{has called}} Paramount's efforts to launch its own {{television}} service, which directly competed with the DuMont Television Network, an unwise decision – Paramount in effect was competing with itself. The resulting ill feelings between Paramount's and DuMont's executives continued to escalate throughout the early 1950s, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> cooperation hindered both entities' network plans. According to White, by 1953, even the public pretense {{of cooperation between}} Paramount and DuMont was gone.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the contradictions}} within Ramesside king lists <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> contemporary, festive inscriptions, the exact chronological {{position}} of Khaba remains disputed. Egyptologist Nabil Swelim believes that Khaba {{could have been}} the direct successor to King Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. He bases his assumptions on similarities between the two's names: both begin with the syllable kha. As a comparison, he points to the names Netjerikhet (Djoser) and Sekhemkhet (Djoserteti), which also display such similarity and are widely assumed to have ruled back-to-back.|$|E
