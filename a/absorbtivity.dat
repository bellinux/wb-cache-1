40|$|One {{of the key}} {{predictions}} of the nonlocal photopolymerization driven diffusion (NPDD) model is that {{a reduction in the}} extent of the nonlocal effects within a material will improve the high spatial frequency response.

The spatial frequency response of an acrylamide/polyvinylalcohol-based photopolymer is then improved through the addition of a chain transfer agent (CTA), sodium formate. Using the NPDD model demonstrates that the CTA has the effect of decreasing the average length of the polyacrylamide (PA) chains formed, thus reducing the nonlocal response parameter, σ.

We assessed DOM concentration and absorbance in 15 streams with upstream lakes and 17 streams without upstream lakes located in the same geographic region in May and August 2003. In addition, we estimated watershed land cover and morphology to assess the possibility that other landscape variables could account for DOM differences between the two stream types. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon, its UVB absorbance, and its molar <b>absorbtivity</b> (absorbance per unit carbon) were all significantly lower in streams with upstream lakes than in streams with no lakes. Strong predictive relationships existed between upstream watershed metrics and stream DOM properties, but varied by season and the presence of upstream lakes.

40|$|A {{simple and}} highly {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric method for {{the determination of}} ascorbic acid is described. The developed method {{is based on a}} redox reaction in that Mn(III) generated electrolytically is taken in excess, which is oxidizing a known but a less quantity of vitamin C and the unreacted oxidant will oxidize further o-tolidine to produce a orange yellow quinonedi imine absorbing cation (max. 455 nm). Therefore, in principle, the decrease in colour intensity of the absorbing system is proportional to the concentration of vitamin C. The stoichiometry between Mn(III) and o-tolidine and stability of the complex were determined by Job’s method, the corresponding values obtained were 2 : 1 and 1. 58  105 lmol- 1. The system was found to be obeying Lambert-Beer’s law in the range, 0. 08 - 0. 8 mg l- 1 of ascorbic acid.

The reliability of the new method was tested by parallel determination of ascorbic acid in standard, pharmaceutical and fruit samples using a standard method. The results of vitamin C obtained from both the methods were comparable with one another and the reliability and reproducibility of the new method were concluded by F and t test values.

40|$|During the {{development}} of technics {{for the study of}} phosphorus metabolism in butter yellow carcinogenesis in the rat, it was of interest to discover whether {{it might be possible to}} measure alkaline and acid phosphatase activities in tissue sections of the size in which amounts of pentose and desoxypentose nucleic acids could be measured (16). The methods of Seligman et al. (14, 17) seemed to offer an excellent source of extractable reaction product of high absorbancy which might be suitable for spectrophotometric measurement. This possibility was investigated extensively, but no method was found by which a reproducible amount of reaction product could be extracted from the tissue sections. The method of Gomori for the localization of alkaline phos-phatase activity (5) as modified for quantitative measurement by Doyle (2) was also studied. ’ Doyle’s technic was satisfactory, though time consuming, and subject to all the objections raised against the Gomori technic. This method was also tried with the Gomori technic for the localization of acid phosphatase activity (4). Although visually there appeared to be some difference in the amounts of lead suffide present in the sections, no significant difference could be detected between control and reacted sections by Doyle’s method which converts the suffide into methylene blue.

The optical spectrum showed loss of <b>absorbtivity</b> and a shift to longer wavelength as the hydrogen peroxide modification ratio was increased. SDS-PAGE showed that the products were not homogenous. Amino acid analysis indicated the loss of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. Concentration-dependent studies of the decay showed that there was a change in the activity of the decay products as the concentration of the enzyme was increased. Gel filtration studies at different enzyme concentrations showed changes in the distribution of products. These observations indicate the presence of bimolecular interactions during the decay process. Separation and characterization of the decay products produced at low concentration revealed two major monomeric components along with dimer and trimer species. All of the species showed reduced activity towards ferrocyanide and the loss of the hydrogen peroxide titer. The optical spectrum of the products showed perturbations in the heme environment. Amino acid analysis showed loss of tryptophan and tyrosine residues. The peptide map of the separated products showed modification of peptides which surround the methionine cluster at positions 230 and 231. These peptides include T 25, which contains tryptophan 223, T 26, which contains tyrosines 229 and 236, and T 23, which contains tryptophan 191.

40|$|Seasonal {{snow storage}} for cooling {{applications}} {{is an ancient}} technique now being revived {{in different parts of}} the world. From June 2000 the first Swedish large-scale snow cooling plant provides for comfort cooling at the hospital in Sundsvall. The snow is thermally insulated by a 0. 2 m layer of wood chips and stored in a shallow pit (140 ´ 60 m) of watertight asphalt, with a capacity for 60, 000 m 3 (40, 000 tons) of snow. Meltwater from the snow storage is cleaned and pumped to the hospital, and after cooling the heated meltwater is re-circulated to the snow storage. During the first summer the hospital required 655 MWh of cooling with a maximum cooling power of 1, 366 kW. Approximately 93 % of the cooling demand was attained by 19, 000 m 3 of snow, the rest by a cooling machine. The main part (75 %) of the snow was natural while the rest was produced with snowguns. The running COP of the snow cooling system was 10. 5 while the corresponding value of the chiller was 2. 2. When material depreciation was included, based on lifetimes and energy input, the total COP became 8. 6 for the snow cooling system and 2. 2 for the chiller. The operation of the plant experienced only minor problems. Urban snow is polluted and the meltwater quality in the snow cooling plant was such that further treatment had to be considered, in particular concerning non-biodegradable compounds, phosphorus, and lead. The snow storage technique enables analysis and treatment of the meltwater. Without thermal insulation and cold extraction a 30, 000 m 3 snow pile in Sundsvall would be gone by mid-June. With 0. 2 m of wood chips covering the snow the melting is reduced considerably. In this case 75 % of the snow remains and can be utilised for cooling. In a laboratory experiment it was found that with a 0. 08 m layer of wood chips the natural melt rate was reduced by approximately 85 %. The thermal insulation qualities of wood chips on snow and ice depend on both evaporative cooling and heat resistance of the wood chips. Approximately 3 % of the melt water was evaporated, which corresponds to 20 % of the total heat transfer. The <b>absorbtivity</b> of light, which was 0. 5 - 0. 6 in fresh wood chips, is important for the thermal insulation qualities. Since the <b>absorbtivity</b> increases and water transport functions of wood chips might deteriorate by time it is of interest to study the impact of ageing. As water freezes in an open system, some water is evaporated. This mass loss is typically 2. 5 - 3 % of the mass of ice and accumulates to large quantities with repeated freezing and thawing. It should therefore be included in snow storage modelling since the snow is stored during a period when repeated melting and re-freezing occur. The total construction cost of the Sundsvall plant was about 1. 3 MEUR with a running cost of 15. 3 EUR MWh- 1 (total 0. 01 MEUR) during the first year of operation. In a more recent study it was concluded that the construction cost could be considerably reduced. Estimated pay back time is about three years for a new project with the same conditions as the Sundsvall Hospital system, decreasing with increased cooling power and size. The expected lifetime of a snow storage plant is about 40 years. The snow/ice cooling plant has a great technical potential in industrial, agricultural, and comfort cooling applications in large parts of the world. By replacing cooling machines the use of cooling media is reduced. These are often flammable, poisonous and/or environmental hazardous. A snow cooling plant means not only saving of money and energy but also environmental benefits. Godkänd; 2001; 20070313 (ysko...|$|E
