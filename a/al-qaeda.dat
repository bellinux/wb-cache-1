In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team's surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, <b>al-Qaeda</b> prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated <b>al-Qaeda</b> activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{official}} had {{stated that}} by 2002, interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an <b>al-Qaeda</b> courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti (sometimes {{referred to as}} Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait). One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani, a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003. At some point during this period, al-Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{who was part of}} the inner circle of <b>al-Qaeda.</b> Later in 2003, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged operational chief of <b>al-Qaeda,</b> stated that he was acquainted with al-Kuwaiti, but that the man was not active in <b>al-Qaeda,</b> according to a U.S. official.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the earlier}} {{official}} version of his identification from a U.S. official, identification of <b>al-Qaeda</b> couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from <b>al-Qaeda</b> foot soldiers and top commanders. Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998, when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate's satellite phone.|$|E

In 2006, Saleh was presented with evidence that bin Laden was living in a major settled area of Pakistan just 20 miles from the town of Abbottabad, Pakistan.

5|$|Suspicion quickly fell on <b>al-Qaeda.</b> The United States {{responded by}} {{launching}} the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had harbored <b>al-Qaeda.</b> Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded {{the powers of}} law enforcement and intelligence agencies to prevent terrorist attacks. Although al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he {{claimed responsibility for the}} attacks. <b>Al-Qaeda</b> and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq as motives.
