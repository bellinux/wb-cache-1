5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|As Link and his clones {{wander the}} overworld of Hyrule Field on {{their quest to}} restore peace to Hyrule, they learn that the {{creation}} of Link's evil counterpart and the release of Vaati is only a small part in an insidious plot to take control of Hyrule. Things complicate as the dimension of the Dark World appears and people are being abducted throughout Hyrule. The four Links learn that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc. Hyrule castle has been taken over and monsters are appearing everywhere. The four Links <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will defeat Vaati, and then rescue Zelda to restore peace to Hyrule.|$|E

5|$|The agents {{interview}} Tony Fiore, the ex-partner of Morris, who attributes Morris' {{death to}} a triad gang {{they had been}} investigating together. Later that day, Fiore meets with a Leon Felder, and the two discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box, but <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> haven't waited the ten years they had intended to, ominously discussing {{that they are the}} last two claimants left. That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, as the bus drives off. The driver tries to brake, but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate, strangling Felder as Michelle watches from inside the bus.|$|E
5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says {{there will be no}} more attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should not follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{suddenly}} {{wakes up}} to find himself in the machine in 2011, only one minute since he entered it, and Olivia waiting by his side; concurrently, in the parallel universe, Walternate attempts to convince Fauxlivia to help stop the machine. Peter recalls the memories from the future, and uses the machine to merge the machine rooms from both universes into one thus creating a bridge. While Olivia and Walter and their doppelgangers stare each other down, Peter convinces the two sides {{to work together to}} try to repair the damage to save both universes, then suddenly disappears. The Olivias and Walters cautiously <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> need to put aside their differences to save both worlds, apparently unaware of Peter's disappearance. Outside on Liberty Island in the prime universe, the Observers watch as September (Michael Cerveris) notes to December (Eugene Lipinski) that Peter has already been forgotten by his friends, his purpose having been served, and explains that Peter now never existed.|$|E
5000|$|In 2008 Tyndale {{received}} the top {{score in the}} Canadian University Survey Consortium survey of students who agreed or strongly <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are satisfied {{with the quality of}} teaching they have received; the results were subsequently published in the Maclean's 2009 University issue. Tyndale also ranked first overall in {{the number of students who}} strongly <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are satisfied with their [...] "decision to attend this university".|$|R

5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour and texture of the red fabrics.|$|E

Also, <b>they</b> unanimously disagreed <b>that</b> interacting with haptic devices or interpreting force feedback required a lot of mental effort.|$|R

25|$|While Georgian experts {{disagree}} {{over the}} details of their interpretations of these accounts, they generally <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> reflect a decline of the Mushki state and rise of Persian influence before the arrival of Alexander, who, perhaps more as a side-effect than by any effort on his part, ushered in a new era of unity in much of the Mushki state's former territories under a new dynasty, who preferred the name Kartli over Mushki. Mtskheta remained the capital of the Kartli state, which became known in most languages as Iberia, until the 5th century AD.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{he notes}} that Ran and Rivash were the source of Rema’s claim that women could not be called up to read all the {{portions}} of the Torah. Ran’s comment is ambiguous (so that he might <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could take any three aliyyot), but Rivash assumes that Ran agreed with him that women could only take the seventh or, perhaps, the reading added on for the maftir. Further, when Hagahot Maimoniyot limits slaves to the seventh portion, the comment closes by citing his teacher, the more famous R. Meir of Rothenburg.|$|E

25|$|Although the Dutch {{casualty}} {{figures are}} in dispute, both Portuguese and Dutch sources <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> suffered heavy casualties. Dutch writer Phillipus Baldaeus {{stated that the}} fighting “caused us no small loss in killed and wounded” and Portuguese writer Fernão de Queiroz gives a figure of 900 killed and a proportionate number of wounded. Captain Ribeiro, who served in Sri Lanka from 1640 to 1658 and personally met the battle participants, stated that Dutch lost “more than four hundred men”. Official Dutch records give an indirect figure; “the arrival of 350 men two days later {{was regarded as a}} welcome reinforcement to bring the army up to its original strength”.|$|E
25|$|The Slavs, of Indo-European origin, {{were first}} {{mentioned}} in written sources to inhabit the territories {{to the north}} of the Danube in the 5th century AD but most historians <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had arrived earlier. The group of Slavs that came to be known as the South Slavs was divided into Antes and Sclaveni who spoke the same language. The Slavic incursions in the Balkans increased during the second half of Justinian I's reign and while these were initially pillaging raids, large-scale settlement began in the 570s and 580s. This migration is associated with the arrival of the Avars who settled in the plains of Pannonia between the rivers Danube and Tisza in the 560s subjugating various Bulgar and Slavic tribes in the process.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{who loved}} {{lingering}} in her bath spent unusually much time there on 28 April. Being hungry, Conrad {{decided to have}} a dinner with Philip of Dreux, {{but by the time he}} arrived at Philip's house, the bishop had already finished his meal. Conrad wanted to return home, but two men ambushed and stabbed him in a narrow street. Most sources <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were sent by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins. While dying, Conrad ordered Isabella not to give Tyre to anyone but Richard of England or to the new king of Jerusalem. When Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, who was Philip of France's lieutenant in the Holy Land, urged Isabella to deliver Tyre to him, she shut herself up in the fortress and refused to open its gates.|$|E
30|$|The {{teachers}} surveyed largely <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> felt pressured, by head teachers, parents, {{and particularly}} students, {{to teach in}} ways that would achieve good marks in the examination. <b>They</b> largely <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> actively prepared students for the examination, not only arranging mock class tests but also teaching answers to expected questions, and interestingly a majority acknowledged that their teaching style would have been different if there was no examination. Nearly 90 % of the teachers <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> reading and listening tests needed {{to be included in the}} national examination process.|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} factor was women’s desire to maintain social networks. About 84 % {{of the respondents}} either strongly <b>agreed</b> or <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> started business for networking. Social groups at the market place provide a platform for them to share their family experiences and learn from others. About 50 % of the respondents either strongly <b>agreed</b> or <b>agreed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> engaged in entrepreneurship to earn respect in society. They also earned respect and trust from their husbands when they supported their husbands financially.|$|R
25|$|The Tour de Nesle scandal {{led to the}} {{imprisonment}} of Blanche and Margaret, and {{the execution}} of their lovers. Having been tortured, the guilty knights Gautier and Philippe were then killed; most histories <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were first castrated and then either drawn and quartered or flayed alive, broken on a wheel and then hanged. The episode came as a severe shock to Philip IV and some suggest {{that it may have}} contributed to his death later that same year. Isabella was criticized by some in France for failing to stand by her sisters-in-law, although this passed with time; Isabella's own marriage failed catastrophically in due course, with many historians believing that she was responsible for the murder of her husband Edward in 1327 after Isabella's seizure of power in England with her lover Roger de Mortimer in 1326.|$|E
25|$|The {{relations}} between the Bulgars and the local Slavs {{is a matter of}} debate depending on the interpretation of the Byzantine sources. Vasil Zlatarski asserts that they concluded a treaty but most historians <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were subjugated. The Bulgars were superior organisationally and militarily and came to dominate politically the new state but there was cooperation between them and the Slavs {{for the protection of the}} country. The Slavs were allowed to retain their chiefs, to abide to their customs and in return they were to pay tribute in kind and to provide foot soldiers for the army. The Seven Slavic tribes were relocated to the west to protect the frontier with the Avar Khaganate, while the Severi were resettled in the eastern Balkan Mountains to guard the mountain passes to the Byzantine Empire. The number of Asparukh's Bulgars is difficult to estimate. Vasil Zlatarski and John Van Antwerp Fine Jr. suggest that they were not particularly numerous, numbering some 10,000, while Steven Runciman considers that the tribe must had been of considerable dimensions. The Bulgars settled mainly in the north-east, establishing the capital at Pliska, which was initially a colossal encampment of 23km2 protected with earthen ramparts.|$|E
500|$|Cricket has {{for many}} years debated whether batsmen should [...] "walk", that is to <b>agree</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been {{dismissed}} and leave the field of play without waiting for (or contrary to) an umpire's decision. Gilchrist reignited this debate by walking during a high-profile match, the 2003 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, after the umpire ruled him to be not out. He has since proclaimed himself to be [...] "a walker", or a batsman who will consistently walk, and has done so on numerous occasions. On one occasion against Bangladesh, Gilchrist walked but TV replays failed to suggest any contact between his bat and the ball. Without such contact, {{he could not have}} been caught out.|$|E
