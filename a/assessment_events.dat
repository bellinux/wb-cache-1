40|$|The {{purpose of}} this case study was to {{describe}} a variety of classroom <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> in high school social studies classes. This study included data from 12 classroom <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> in the classes of a teacher–researcher in an urban high school. Four assessments in each course of the teacher-researcher’s entire teaching load were studied. The courses were world cultures, honors U. S. history, and philosophy. The total number of students was 96; sample sizes for individual assessment analyses ranged from 11 to 39. Results supported the conclusion that even within the same classroom assessment environment, student perceptions of the assigned task and self-efficacy for the task, reported mental effort invested, goal orientations, and learning strategy use differed by assessment. The mean level of these variables differed by type of student. Observed correlations among these variables differed between paper-and-pencil tests and performance assess-ments. Potential implications for classroom assessment practices are discussed. When researchers want to understand what students know, classroom assessment is not the tip {{but the bulk of}} the iceberg. Large-scale assessment is more carefully studied, better funded, and higher profile than is classroom assessment—but the lion’s share of assessment that students experience is classroom assessment.

By designing OBX around the logical structure of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), we have found that a relatively simple conceptual model can represent the relatively complex domain of clinical research. In addition, the common framework provided by BFO makes it straightforward to develop data dictionaries based on reference and application ontologies from the OBO Foundry...|$|E

40|$|Education {{researchers}} and classroom teachers {{have argued that}} the constant pressure to measure and rank students makes it difficult to shape assessment as an episode of learning. Yet we know little about how learning moves in and through assessment of any kind. Building on two national multisited studies, the research reported here uses ethnographic techniques to examine learning within critique. Critique is a form of assessment through which young people jointly judge their own work and that of their peers. The article focuses on episodes of critique within two nonschool sites for col-laborative production involving ethnically and economically diverse groups of youth—a community-based video project and an organization in which young people create radio stories for local and national broadcast. Learning environments such as these draw voluntary youth participation and are organized around sustained projects released to outside audiences. Findings indicate that critique manifests itself as an episode of learning by engaging young people in joint <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> that are improvisational, reciprocal, and oriented toward the future of the work under review. Intra- and cross-site comparisons suggest that critique is likely to arise within specifi...|$|E
40|$|Simulation or {{scenario}} {{learning is}} an integral part of student paramedic development and, despite the increasing amount of paramedic research, very little is known about how students and tutors experience it. Current literature regards simulation as invaluable without exploring why this may be the case and this study aims to address this. This is a compressed time mode ethnographic approach study that incorporates data from student paramedics during and immediately after simulation learning events and tutor views of facilitating the simulation experience. This, along with a comprehensive literature review, provides an overview of simulation in the student paramedic development pathway. This thesis exposes how student paramedics find the simulation process anxiety provoking and explores the many reasons for this. The performance aspect of scenarios is echoed in the dramaturgical language used when talking about simulation learning events and the similarities between simulation learning events and simulation <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> merely adds to this stress. Using the lens of critical pedagogy, issues of power (control and hierarchy) within the educational and organisational structures are examined and offered as another possible explanation for the high levels of anxiety in simulation learning.

An analysis of the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity's (MCTSSA's) C 4 SoS assessment approach provides a means for defining a MAGTF C 4 SoS and for illustrating how that SoS is represented in the assessment environment. This provides the framework and context for follow-on examination of SoS performance metrics. The challenges with defining specific performance metrics and examination of past <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> using those metrics {{provide the basis for}} discussion of alternative approaches and application of assessment tools specifically tailored for SoS assessment efforts. Three specific tools, i-Score, Interoperability Quotient (IQ), and Dynamic Software Architecture Visualization and Evaluation (DynSAVE), are examined. The results indicate i-Score and DynSAVE offer the greatest potential applicability to the MAGTF SoS assessment effort. In a culminating discussion, applying a multicriteria identification process to obtain a mathematical model that correlates an interoperability measure with measurable SoS performance criteria is proposed as a means of extending the i-Score model for greater applicability to SoS assessment and performance improvement efforts.

An electronic assignment sub system assists course advisers in the management of marking and ensures prompt, secure assignment submission and return. A newsgroup sub system allows students to participate in the dialogue of a "virtual classroom " and receive prompt feedback to queries. 1. Distance Education Systems Distance education (DE) operates within an administrative framework. Rumble [2] proposed a systems model consisting of a materials subsystem and a student subsystem. This model, which is neither a curriculum nor a program development model, can be further simplified [1]. The events involved in the production and distribution of materials, and the processes in student support services are shown in Figure 1. This paper will concentrate on academic and social support of the learner and <b>assessment</b> <b>events.</b> However, the other events and processes will have some bearing on the discussion because all components of the system are related. Particular reference will be made to the DE process in computing subjects. 2.

40|$|Cheating in British {{secondary}} schools {{has not been}} previously researched. The aim of this thesis was to ascertain what factors affect cheating in secondary school and why? Initially, four questions were posed: "what is cheating?', "when is it wrong to cheat?', 'what role do parents play' and 'what are teacher perceptions of cheating {{compared with those of}} students?'. These questions were addressed by studying the perspectives of students, parents and teachers using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, involving nearly 1000 respondents in six studies. Two models were developed. The first, a four dimensional model, explained what students thought cheating was. Cheating was perceived to be comprised of the following interrelated dimensions: non-academic and academic behaviours, a temporal component, <b>assessment</b> <b>events</b> and degrees of severity. The second, a decision model, indicated under what circumstances cheating might be right or wrong. Cheating was wrong for respondents who perceived only negative academic associations, whilst It could be right for others, when motives for cheating were perceived to be honourable. Respondents reported {{the extent to which they}} were like students in scenarios who were portrayed to have cheated in a variety of ways. Data from parents and teachers were used to test and amplify these models. Students and teachers held similar perceptions regarding cheating frequency, but not severity. Parents held perceptions of cheating that were more extreme than those of students and teachers. The findings of these studies have major implications for those involved in the wider educational environments of the home, school and society. Recommendations are made regarding cun-ent educational testing policies, the promotion of leaming and the reduction of cheating...|$|E
