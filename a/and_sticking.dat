5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba's disciples and devotees {{claim that}} he {{performed}} many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) {{to people in the}} form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.|$|E

5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty {{and the reason}} he framed Krusty was because he spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags. He vows revenge on Bart, setting up a regular plotline in future episodes. The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community. Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> to his convictions, and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also {{frequently}} leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, such as when he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|Three {{music videos}} were shot for the single; one by Yusuke Azumaya, the second being a lyric video, {{and the third}} {{directed}} and animated by Riff Studios. Azumaya's version opens with a large-figured woman cutting images of herself <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> them on portraits of a blonde male. As she sticks it on her wall, she begins a quest to lose weight for {{the man in the}} photo, and starts running and exercising in Los Angeles, California. Throughout the entire video, it has the woman running to different locations and trying different workouts with the public, whilst small animations of her exercising are added into small parts. Near the end of the video, the girl decides to get a makeover, whilst a stylist dresses her in a pink dress. She runs towards the man in a park, though he is disinterested and walks away. A man holding a balloon bumps into the woman, and as the camera pans away to the balloons floating towards the sky, the woman turns into Hamasaki. The man who walked away from the woman then see's Hamasaki, walks to her, and both hug each other.|$|E

25|$|The reactor {{emergency}} {{protection system}} (EPS) {{was designed to}} shut down the reactor when its operational parameters are exceeded. The design accounted for steam collapse in the core when the fuel element temperature falls below 265°C, coolant vaporization in fuel channels in cold reactor state, <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> of some emergency protection rods. However, the slow insertion speed of the control rods, together with their design causing localized positive reactivity as the displacer moves through {{the lower part of the}} core, created a number of possible situations where initiation of the EPS could itself cause or aggravate a reactor runaway.|$|E

The war Azog started climaxed in the Battle of Azanulbizar, where he killed Náin, but while fleeing back to the gates of Moria he was caught and beheaded by Náin's son Dáin. After killing Thrór, Azog had given a small pouch of money to Thrór's companion, as payment for him to tell the other Dwarves of the murder. The Dwarves returned the insult by setting Azog's severed head on a stake <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> the money pouch in his mouth.|$|E
25|$|Dessalines and Pétion {{remained}} {{allied with}} France until they switched sides again, in October 1802, and {{fought against the}} French. As Leclerc laid dying of yellow fever and heard that Christophe and Dessalines had joined the rebels, he reacted by ordering all of the blacks living in Le Cap be killed by drowning them in the harbour. In November, Leclerc died of yellow fever, like much of his army. His successor, the Vicomte de Rochambeau, fought an even more brutal campaign. Rochambeau waged a near-genocidal campaign against the Haitians, simply killing everybody who was black. Rochambeau imported about 15, 000 attack dogs from Jamaica, who had trained to savage blacks and mulattoes. At the Bay of Le Cap, Rochambeau had blacks drowned so that no-one would eat fish from the bay for months afterward as no one wished to eat the fish that had eaten human flesh. Bonaparte, hearing {{that most of his}} army in St. Domingue had died of yellow fever and the French only held Port-au-Prince, Le Cap and Les Cayes sent about 20, 000 reinforcements to Rochambeau. Dessalines matched Rochambeau in his vicious cruelty. At Le Cap, when Rochambeau hanged 500 blacks, Dessalines replied by killing 500 whites <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> their heads on spikes all around Le Cap, so that the French could see what he was planning on doing to them. Rochambeau's atrocities helped rally many former French loyalists to the rebel cause. Many on both sides had come to see the war as a race war where no mercy was to be given, and the Haitians were just as brutal as the French, as they burned French prisoners alive, cut them up with axes, or tied to a board and sawed them into two. Having sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States in April 1803, Napoleon began to lose interest in his failing ventures in the Western Hemisphere. He was more concerned about France's European enemies such as Great Britain and Prussia. With that, he withdrew a majority of the French forces in Haiti to counter the possibility of an invasion from Prussia, Britain, and Spain on a weakened France.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu {{gave the}} game a strong review, with one {{reviewer}} calling it [...] " [...] {{of the most}} outstanding games in the series", giving it a Platinum award and giving it the highest score out of the games reviewed in that edition of the magazine. Eurogamer's Simon Parkin said that, while lacking the big-budget look of other JRPG series <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> {{to many of the}} genre's conventions, [...] "Namco is to be applauded for updating the series with no small amount of consideration and flair, an effort that has resulted in the strongest entry to the aging series yet". Edge praised the cast's strength and the battle system, saying that the development team's focus in other areas was what made the game enjoyable and easy to play. Andrew Fitch, writing for 1UP.com, greatly enjoyed the technical improvement over Abyss and enjoyed the battle system and other elements including some mature plot elements, but noted translation issues in the English script and a lack of end-game content. As part of his review, he called it [...] "perhaps the finest franchise entry to date". Matt Miller of Game Informer was less positive than most other reviewers, finding the story and gameplay lacking while appreciating the graphical polish.|$|E

Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks. The heroin addictions had taken their toll on the band members; Gregg Allman later said, [...] "We were taking vitamins, we had doctors coming over <b>and</b> <b>sticking</b> us in the ass with B12 shots every day.

However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies with {{a smile on her face}} just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.|$|E
