Concepts from genetic engineering are producing results which indicate that there are useful alternate design processes to those modeled on human design processes. Computer-based <b>design</b> <b>aids</b> have assumed that designing occurs independently of the context in which it occurs. Research into “situated ” learning is showing {{that it is possible to}} develop <b>design</b> <b>aids</b> that learn. The consequence of this is that the tools become more useful over time.

40|$|On-farm manure storage pits contain both toxic and asphyxiating gases such as {{hydrogen}} sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia. Farmers {{and service}} personnel occasionally need to enter these pits to conduct repair and maintenance tasks. One intervention {{to reduce the}} toxic and asphyxiating gas exposure risk to farm workers when entering manure pits is manure pit ventilation. This article describes an online computational fluid dynamics based <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> for evaluating the effectiveness of manure pit ventilation systems to reduce the concentrations of toxic and asphyxiating gases in the manure pits. This <b>design</b> <b>aid,</b> developed {{by a team of}} agricultural engineering and agricultural safety specialists at Pennsylvania State University, represents the culmination of {{more than a decade of}} research and technology development effort. The article includes a summary of the research efforts leading to the online <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> development and describes protocols for using the online <b>design</b> <b>aid,</b> including procedures for data input and for accessing <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> results. <b>Design</b> <b>aid</b> results include gas concentration decay and oxygen replenishment curves inside the manure pit and inside the barns above the manure pits, as well as animated motion pictures of individual gas concentration decay and oxygen replenishment in selected horizontal and vertical cut plots in the manure pits and barns. These results allow the user to assess: (1) how long one needs to ventilate the pits to remove toxic and asphyxiating gases from the pit and barn, (2) from which portions of the barn and pit these gases are most and least readily evacuated, and (3) whether or not animals and personnel need to be removed from portions of the barn above the manure pit being ventilated...|$|R

Eisenhauer Abstract: Watershed planners need a tool {{for determining}} width of filter strips that is accurate enough for developing cost-effective site designs and easy enough to use for making quick determinations on a large number and variety of sites. This study employed the process-based Vegetative Filter Strip Model to evaluate the relationship between filter strip width and trap-ping efficiency for sediment and water and to produce a <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> for use where specific water quality targets must be met. Model simulations illustrate that relatively narrow filter strips can have high impact in some situations, while in others even a modest impact cannot be achieved at any practical width. A graphical <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> was developed for estimating the width needed to achieve target trapping efficiencies for different pollutants under {{a broad range of}} agricultural site conditions. Using the model simulations for sediment and water, a graph was produced containing a family of seven lines that divide the full range of possible relationships between width and trapping efficiency into fairly even increments.

Using the model simulations for sediment and water, a graph was produced containing a family of seven lines that divide the full range of possible relationships between width and trapping efficiency into fairly even increments. Simple rules guide the selection of one line that best describes a given field situation by considering field length and cover management, slope, and soil texture. Relationships for sediment-bound and dissolved pollutants are interpreted from the modeled relationships for sediment and water. Interpolation between lines can refine the results and account for additional variables, if needed. The <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> is easy to use, accounts for several major variables that determine filter strip performance, and is based on a validated, process-based, mathematical model. This <b>design</b> <b>aid</b> strikes a balance between accuracy and utility that fills a wide gap between existing design guides and mathematical models...|$|R
