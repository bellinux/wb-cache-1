5|$|In the Amazon basin, when caimans became scarce as {{a result}} of {{overhunting}} in the mid-20th century, the number of local fish, such as the important <b>arapaima</b> (<b>Arapaima</b> gigas), also decreased. These are nutrient-poor waters, and the urine and faeces of the caimans may have increased primary production by contributing plant nutrients. Thus the presence of the reptiles could have benefited the fish stock; the number of crocodilians in a stretch of water appears to be correlated with the fish population.|$|E

25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and eyelash viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, <b>arapaima,</b> piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata.

5000|$|The African arowana, Heterotis niloticus, is {{a species}} of bonytongue. Despite being called an [...] "arowana", the African arowana is {{more closely related to}} <b>arapaimas,</b> the only other members in the Arapaimidae family, than the South American, Asian and Australian arowanas in the Osteoglossidae family (Arapaimidae is {{sometimes}} included in Osteoglossidae). Compared to these, the African arowana has a more terminal mouth and {{is the only one that}} feeds extensively on plankton.|$|R
25|$|Osteoglossids are basal {{fish that}} {{originated}} some {{time during the}} Cretaceous, and are placed in the actinopterygiid order Osteoglossiformes. As traditionally defined, the family includes several extant species from South America, one from Africa, several from Asia, and two from Australia. Today Arapaimidae is often regarded as a separate family, which includes the <b>arapaimas</b> and the African arowana. Consequently, the South American genus Osteoglossum, and the Asian and Australian genus Scleropages are the only extant genera that remain in the osteoglossid family. Arapaimidae and Osteoglossidae split about 220 million years ago (Mya), during the Late Triassic.|$|R
50|$|They are harpooned or {{caught in}} large nets. Since the <b>arapaima</b> needs to surface to breathe air, {{traditional}} <b>arapaima</b> fishermen harpoon {{them and then}} club them to death. An individual fish can yield as much as 70 kg of meat.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>arapaima,</b> pirarucu, or paiche are {{any large}} species of bonytongue in the genus <b>Arapaima</b> {{native to the}} Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. Genus <b>Arapaima</b> is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae. They are among the world's largest {{freshwater}} fish, reaching as much as 3 m. They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, <b>arapaima</b> have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species. Its local name, pirarucu, derives from the indigenous words for [...] "pira" [...] meaning [...] "fish" [...] and [...] "urucum" [...] meaning [...] "red".|$|E
50|$|The <b>arapaima</b> male is a mouthbrooder, {{like his}} relative, the Osteoglossum, meaning the young are {{protected}} {{in his mouth}} until they are older. The female <b>arapaima</b> helps to protect the male and the young by circling them and fending off potential predators.|$|E

5000|$|The {{aquarium}} {{is separated}} into three halls, each home to {{different types of}} fish and other aquatic wildlife. The first hall primarily contains freshwater species such as rudd and European eels, {{as well as some}} saltwater species involved in various conservation projects and captive-breeding programmes, such as broad sea fans, uarus and seahorses. The second hall displays various species of coral reef fish from around the world, such as clownfish, copperband butterflyfish and regal tangs, as well as real coral. The third hall houses species native to the Amazon River, including red-bellied piranhas, angelfish, <b>arapaimas</b> and ocellate river stingrays. As well as the three halls, the aquarium also features the [...] "Big Fish Tank", which contains large fish species that are all former pets, and had to be rescued because their owners did not have the proper equipment or understanding to look after them. The species in the Big Fish Tank include tambaqui, catfish and pirapitinga.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{verified}} data of water temperatures collected by CORSAN-RS from 1996 to 2004 in several cities {{of the state of}} Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, and analyzed the possibility of raising the most cultivated fish species in Brazil. The water temperature from 1996 to 2004 was 16 to 28 ºC in summer, 17 to 23 ºC in fall, 14 to 17 ºC (down to 9 ºC in the coldest months) in winter and 14 to 21 ºC in spring. Native species of this state, such as silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen), traíra (Hoplias malabaricus), dorado (Salminus brasiliensis), pintado (Pimelodus maculatus), as well as carps (family Cyprinidae), are resistant to the low winter temperatures. These species have a lower growth rate in coldest months (winter/spring) but a good development in warmer months (summer/fall), reaching a satisfactory performance throughout the year. In the periods of more intense cold, mortality of some introduced species, such as surubim from Amazon Basin (Pseudoplatystoma sp.), pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), pirarucu (<b>Arapaimas</b> gigas), pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) may occur. In addition, as most tropical species have a thermal range for growth and reproduction between 20 to 28 ºC, some species may have poor development even in fall. Therefore, water temperature in this state should be considered in the choice of fish species to be cultivated...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arapaima</b> gigas was {{originally}} {{regarded as the}} only species in the genus <b>Arapaima,</b> but the subsequent identification of further species, together with the rarity of specimens {{and the loss of}} several type specimens, has led to some uncertainty regarding classification within the genus and the identity of described individuals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{status of}} the <b>arapaima</b> {{population}} in the Amazon River Basin is unknown, hence it is listed on the IUCN red list as Data Deficient. It is difficult to conduct a population census in so large an area, and it is problematic to monitor catches in a trade that is largely illegal. Commercial <b>arapaima</b> fishing is banned by the Brazilian government due to its commercial extinction. Colombia bans the fishing and consumption of the <b>Arapaima</b> between October 1 and March 15 as it's within the seasons that the fish breeds.|$|E
