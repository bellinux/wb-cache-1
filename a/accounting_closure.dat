Using a new county-level database, we analyze the determinants of these involuntary <b>account</b> <b>closures,</b> focusing on explanations relating to household economics and financial decision making ability, social capital, bank policies, and credit access through payday lending. Involuntary closures are more frequent in counties with a larger fraction of single mothers, lower education levels, lower wealth, and higher rates of unemployment. Social capital also matters, with closures higher in counties with higher rates of property crime and lower rates of electoral participation. Bank policies relate to closures, with more closures in counties with more competitive banking markets and more multi-market banks. Finally, using national data and a natural experiment, we find that access to payday lending leads to higher rates of involuntary <b>account</b> <b>closure...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Police {{interviews}} with terrorist suspects are {{perhaps one of}} the most challenging interviews a police officer will experience. The purpose of this paper is to explore the social context of these interviews and the impact that this might have upon the way in which police officers carry them out, including the use of robust, even aggressive tactics. Design/methodology/approach – Risks associated with police interview tactics are identified, including obtaining unreliable information, problems with suspect cooperation and the potential impact upon communities including problems with the perceived legitimacy of the police and community cooperation. Findings – Ways of mitigating the risks are considered including improving police officer cultural awareness, a consideration of interview tactics and the use of ethical interview approaches such as the planning and preparation, engage and explain, <b>account,</b> <b>closure,</b> evaluation interview model and conversation management. Originality/value – The impact of the use of ethical interviewing is considered from a procedural justice perspective, and the paper illustrates how this approach may give rise to improved reliability of information from interviews and may impact upon perceptions of police legitimacy from communities. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The primary {{objectives}} of {{the study reported here}} were twofold. First, to investigate less experienced frontline police officers’ perceptions of their witness interviewing practices with specific reference to their use of the ten cognitive interview components taught during initial PEACE (a mnemonic for the stages of the interview; Planning and preparation, Engage and explain, <b>Account,</b> <b>Closure</b> and Evaluation) interview training. Second, to investigate this group of officers’ practical experiences of interviewing witnesses. Method. A sample of 221 young, in-service, non-specialist police officers from five UK police forces completed a self-report questionnaire concerning their perceived witness interviewing practices. Respondents were surveyed about their use of the PEACE cognitive interview components, their practical experiences of interviewing witnesses and victims, and their views on investigative interviewing training. Results. There was a consensus among these officers that they perceived using some of the PEACE cognitive interview components more frequently and perceived some of them to be more effective than others. Conclusion. This study provides a unique insight into the perceived interviewing practices of some of the least experienced and the least trained investigative interviewers who conduct the majority of frontline witness interviews. These officers report feeling inadequately trained, under pressure and generally ill equipped to conduct a PEACE cognitive interview...|$|R
40|$|The Credit CARD Act of 2009 was {{intended}} to prevent practices in the credit card industry that lawmakers viewed as deceptive and abusive. Among other changes, the Act restricted issuers' <b>account</b> <b>closure</b> policies, eliminated certain fees, and {{made it more difficult}} for issuers to change terms on credit card plans. Critics of the Act argued that because of the long lag between approval and implementation of the law, issuing banks would be able to take preemptive actions that might disadvantage cardholders before the law could take effect. Using credit bureau data as well as individual data from a survey of U. S. consumers, we test whether banks closed consumers' credit card accounts or otherwise restricted access to credit just before the enactment of the CARD Act. Because the period prior to the enactment of the CARD Act coincided with the financial crisis and recession, causality in this case is particularly difficult to establish. We find evidence that a higher fraction of credit card accounts were closed following the Federal Reserve Board's adoption of its credit card rules. However, we do not find evidence that banks closed credit card accounts or deteriorated terms of credit card plans at a higher rate between the time when the CARD Act was signed and when its provisions became law...|$|R

40|$|In January of 2016, the Center for Public Service (CPS) was {{approached}} by Energy Trust of Oregon to conduct {{a review of the}} tax assessor data on manufactured houses in Oregon. The purpose of this review was to find the average age at which manufactured housing units in Oregon are decommissioned. A brief review of the literature on this topic that has been published indicated that this question had not yet been answered in the field. Energy Trust Oregon is invested in making manufactured housing living more energy efficient, and less costly for occupants. To that end, the organization designed this investigation into the relative savings of replacing an inefficient unit today, versus waiting for the unit to be decommissioned in the future. The organization believes that they can demonstrate that it is both environmentally sustainable relating to energy usage and economically prudent to support a program that aims to swap out old, inefficient units for new, sustainable ones. Work on this project began in March 2016, and was conducted by a group of CPS researchers (CPS Research Team). Details about the team members are included {{at the end of this}} report. The CPS Research Team considered this project in three parts: case identification, data collection, and data analysis. These efforts are detailed below.
