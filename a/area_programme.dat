50|$|The drought of 1979-80 in West Bengal was {{the next}} major drought and caused a 17% decline in food {{production}} with a shortfall of 13.5 million tonnes of food grain. Stored food stocks were leveraged by the government, {{and there was no}} net import of food grains. The drought was relatively unknown outside of India. The lessons learnt from the Maharashtra and West Bengal droughts led to the Desert Development Programme and the Drought Prone <b>Area</b> <b>Programme.</b> The intent of these programmes was to reduce the negative effects of droughts by applying eco-friendly land use practices and conserving water. Major schemes in improving rural infrastructure, extending irrigation to additional areas, and diversifying agriculture were also launched. The lessons from the 1987 drought brought to light the need for employment generation, watershed planning, and ecologically integrated development.|$|E

In the US, decision makers fear that their open model for building scientific power, based {{to a great extent}} on recruiting talent from abroad, has passed its peak. But for the moment the US-China connection is still strong, growing, virtuous and mutually beneficial. In fact, the emerging multipolar science world looks set to be dominated by a US-China G 2. With its more inward-looking perspective, the EU needs to do more than focus on internal integration.

30|$|In India, the {{approach}} of watershed management is considered a principal strategy for comprehensive development of water resources primarily in the arid and semi-arid areas of the country. Existing policies {{of the government of}} India give more emphasis on strengthening such projects (Wani et al. 2008). In India, the first-generation programme of watershed development and management (1969 – 1974) was for the soil conservation and its management, while in the second-generation (1974 – 1979) watershed development and management programme emphasis was given on water conservation, further in the 3 rd generation (mid- 1990 s) programme emphasis has been given on participatory approach for management and development of watershed activities (Joshi et al., 2004). There were several programmes in India at state and national levels, related to watershed like Desert Development Programme (DDP), Integrated Mission for Sustainable Development (IMSD) and Drought Prone <b>Area</b> <b>Programme</b> (DPAP); however, in 2008 several individual programmes were merged into a single programme, which is known as “Integrated Watershed Management Program (Alemayehu et al. 2009; Imam 2011).|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} a major {{community-based}} marine protected <b>area</b> <b>programme</b> (CB-MPA) in an Indonesian island archipelago {{is the point of}} departure for this article. Despite a well-designed institutional structure to facilitate local participation, local knowledge about the CB-MPA is found to be low and resource access and influence on decision-making in the programme is negligible for the majority of islanders. At the same time, most of those who know about the programme consider it as pertaining to the public authority only. These findings stand in contrast to evidence on non-formal ways of protecting and managing marine areas in the same geographical area but outside the formal MPA institutional framework. In particular, the article identifies a number of emergent rules-in-use in marine management, which operate parallel to legally established MPAs. It is argued that emergent forms of marine area protection such as non-formal self-organising island exclusion zones (IEZ) offer as yet mostly unused potentials for formal MPA development, particularly in those coastal and marine areas without traditional forms of marine and coastal management.

40|$|Abstract | India has a {{distinguished}} tradition in crystallography and structural biology. However, biological macromolecular crystallography {{in the country}} has had a somewhat delayed start on account of paucity of adequate funds and insufficient interactions between crystallographers and biochemists. Preliminary results in the area {{began to appear in}} the early eighties. The support provided by the Department of Science & Technology in the mid eighties under its thrust <b>area</b> <b>programme</b> for macromolecular crystallographic studies at the Molecular Biophysics Unit of the Indian Institute of Science gave a major impetus to work in the area. The Bangalore centre also came to be recognised as a national nucleus {{for the development of the}} area in the country. Since then, over the years, biological macromolecular crystallography has grown into a major activity in India encompassing nearly 20 institutions and close to twice as many research groups. It is also now at the centre stage of modern biological research in India. The problems addressed by biological crystallographers in the country span a wide spectrum and their efforts have made considerable international impact. Collective initiatives such as those involving microbial pathogens and structure-based inhibitor design have also begun to emerge. 1...|$|E

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{production}} of hyaluronic acid (H) by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus in complex media formulated with peptones obtained from Scyliorhinus canicula viscera by-products. Initially, in batch cultures, the greatest productions were achieved using commercial media (3. 03 g/L) followed by peptones from alcalase hydrolyzed viscera (2. 32 g/L) and peptones from non-hydrolyzed viscera (2. 26 g/L). An increase of between 12 % and 15 % was found in subsequent fed-batch cultures performed on waste peptones. Such organic nitrogen sources were shown to be an excellent low-cost substrate for microbial H, saving more than 50 % of the nutrient costs. We appreciate the excellent technical support of Margarita Nogueira and Ana I. Duran (IIM-CSIC). We also thank to Ramiro Martinez (Novozymes A/S, Spain) for supplying us with alcalase.

40|$|Global {{efforts in}} {{macromolecular}} crystallography {{started in the}} thirties of the last century. However, definitive results began to emerge only in the late fifties and the early sixties. India {{has a long tradition}} in crystallography. The country had a head start in theoretical and computational structural biology, thanks to the efforts of G. N. Ramachandran and his colleagues in the fifties and the sixties. However, macromolecular crystallography got off the ground in India only in the eighties, particularly after the Bangalore group received adequate support from the Department of Science and Technology under their Thrust <b>Area</b> <b>Programme.</b> The Bangalore centre was also identified as a national nucleus {{for the development of the}} area in the country. Since then work in the area has spread widely and is being carried out by several groups, mainly led by scientists trained at Bangalore or their descendents, in about thirty institutions in India. In addition to the Department of Science and Technology, the effort is now supported by other agencies like the Department of Biotechnology and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The problems addressed by macromolecular crystallographers in India encompass almost all aspects of modern biology.

40|$|A High Resolution Operational Oceanography System that {{provides}} decision makers with short-term (within 48 hours) oil spill trajectory forecasting at local scale, {{has been developed}} in the Bay of Santander (Spain). The system is based on process models applied {{in a set of}} nested grids. Hydrodynamics in the study area are calculated with the COAWST modelling system which uses daily boundary conditions and meteorological forcing obtained from the European network MYOCEAN ([URL] and from the Spanish met office, AEMET, respectively. Daily COAWST’s outputs and meteorological forecast are ready to be used by the oil spill transport and fate model, TESEO. A web service that manages the operational system and allows the user to run hypothetical as well as real oil spill trajectories has been implemented. Data from two hydrodynamics field campaigns and from experimental tests carried out with two types of oils have been used to validate the hydrodynamic and the oil spill models.

40|$|The {{catchment}} of the River Kokemäenjoki covers ca. 27 100 {{square kilometers}} in western Finland, and the {{the length of}} the river is ca 120 km. The river discharges into the Bothnian Bay, the northern section of the Baltic Sea. The delta is changing and prograding towards the sea exceptionally rapidly. The pace of the growth of the deltaic formations,a s well as the major zones of the macrophytivc vegetation is nowadays some 30 – 40 meters a year. This makes the delta the most rapidly changing aquatic and littoral ecosystem in the Northern Europe. The Kokemäenjoki River delta is often characterized as a biological hotspot, and major sections of the estuary are included in several leading international nature conservation programmes, i. e. The Natura 2000 network of the European Union, the intergovernmental The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, {{as well as in the}} IBA, Important Bird <b>Area</b> <b>programme</b> established by the BildLife International organization. The diversities of both flora and fauna are very high – at least as regards of the northern location of the estuary. In the Kokemäenjoki River ca. 420 taxa of flowering plants (Spermatophyta) are permanently found (i. e. about a third of the ca. 1 200 flowering plants permanently growing in Finland). Of the pteridophytes (Pteridophyta), there are 17 out of the 57 species of the Finnish taxa growing at the delta. Of th...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{population}} has created tremendous pressure on livelihood resources {{and this is}} a common phenomenon throughout the world. Land and water forms the base for almost all natural livelihood resources. Soil erosion and degradation, and over extraction of ground water and abundant use for agriculture are the main threats for livelihood resources. Land and water has prime importance in GDP and GNP in India and also considered as a backbone of the Indian Economy. There is a heavy demand and acute need for conservation and management of rain water for agriculture as well as industry. However, over a period of planned development, the budgetary allocation is not observed to be adequate for these aspects. For achieving the sustainable development, India has to maintain the contribution of agriculture in GDPand GNP. For that, massive efforts are needed. Accordingly, Government of India has constituted the working group for assisting Planning Commission and Government of India in preparation of plans and programmes as well as designs the long term projects along with financial allocations. This sub group has recommended that Drought Prone <b>Area</b> <b>Programme,</b> Desert Development Programme, Integrated Watershed Development Project, Integrated Watershed Management Project, National Watershed Development in Rainfed Area, Soil Conservation in Catchment River Valley Projects, flood prone rivers and watershed projects in shifting cultivation area should be reorganized in which peoples' participation, demand of community, topology of region, etc., has to be considered on priority basis. The sub group also recommended reallocation of budgetary allocations. Major limitation this group has stated that prolonged implementation process, increased cost and weak monitoring and evaluation process are the main constraints in implementation of water related projects. Therefore, special efforts for financial support and necessary infrastructure is needed to strengthen integrated natural water resource management...|$|E
40|$|Institutions are {{mechanisms}} {{provided by}} {{individuals in the}} community to resolve social dilemmas and these define and restrict access to and control over resources. In the context of watershed development they are organizational structures evolved {{in the process and}} their mutual interaction mechanism. Watershed development approach has evolved over the decades bringing a paradigm shift in thinking of decision makers, which resulted in shifting responsibilities of natural resource management towards local communities and following participatory approaches in implementation. As a result the new generation of watershed development projects encounter multi stakeholder situation requiring institutional arrangements to achieve efficiency and sustainability. The present study has looked into four leading watershed development projects viz: Andhra Pradesh Rural Livelihoods Programme (APRLP), Sujala Watershed Program in Karnataka, Indo-German Watershed Program (IGWP) in Maharashtra and Drought Prone <b>Area</b> <b>Programme</b> (DPAP) following Hariyali Guidelines, Rajasthan in India, which is known to have designed innovative operational modalities to enhance communities’ participation in management and implementation of the projects. There are no efforts in critically comparing different projects but assembling elements of institutional mechanisms and their mutual interactions so as to abstract the potentially significant institutional interaction and arrangements that could enhance the efficiency of any programe. Also development of capacities of these institutions and stakeholders and their linkages are studied closely to complement and fortify the objective of this study. This study showed that through capacity building and development of social capital along with suitable institutional mechanisms at local watershed as well as supporting institutions in terms of gender, equity and sustainability, improved livelihoods could be achieved. Critical institutional mechanisms and actors’ linkages in these programs are used to infer “good institutional mechanisms” for improving impact of watershed programs in India...|$|E

40|$|This Thesis is {{concerned}} with the broad area of the evaluation of regional development policy. The Thesis provides the theoretical context and contributes to evaluation of policies based on provision of organised industrial infrastructure and support systems to national peripheries. It mainly focuses on the Industrial <b>Areas</b> <b>Programme</b> in Greece. The purpose of the research is to measure the effectiveness of the Programme as a lever for regional economic development. Specific interest is paid to the effects of the policy on the regional productivity and the necessity for technological advancement. Basic characteristics, the administrative structure of the country and the setting for the regional development problem are presented early in the Thesis. The institutional and legal framework for development and the emergence of the Industrial <b>Areas</b> <b>Programme</b> follow. In the theoretical part an analysis of the range of regional development theories and their connection with the Industrial <b>Areas</b> <b>Programme</b> is made. This is followed by more recent theories of development based on the implementation of modern technology and the conditions needed for this. An analysis of regional productivity is undertaken utilising the total factor productivity methodology. A productivity typology emerges and first linkages are made to the Industrial <b>Areas</b> <b>Programme.</b> The typology then becomes the base for a field study that surveyed the administration of the Industrial Areas of Greece and firms established therein. Information collected includes the range, infrastructure and facilities of these projects, the technological levels of the participant firms and the efforts made to advance such levels. The survey provides a most useful attitudinal framework for the evaluation of the Programme's effectiveness. Finally, a multi-faceted evaluation is made based first on analysis of employment growth and second on monetary flows {{in the form of a}} cost-benefit analysis. The latter provides a generalised methodology, utilising both a pay-back and a full-life evaluation procedure. Analyses in general ascribe some positive effects of the policy but of variable intensity across the projects. The final part resumes the theoretical evaluation, outlines the empirical measurements and findings and proceeds to discuss the policy implications of the Thesis...|$|R
