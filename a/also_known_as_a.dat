5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, <b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solar park, is {{a large-scale}} photovoltaic system (PV system) {{designed for the}} supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes {{also referred to as}} solar farms or solar ranches, especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (PHEV or PHV), <b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid {{electric vehicle}} with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional {{hybrid electric vehicle}} and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E

5|$|A virus particle, <b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which {{are surrounded by}} a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E

5|$|<b>Also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{manifold}} cage or regulator cage, this is {{a structure}} which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (<b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (<b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Guthy-Renker sells Proactiv {{as part of}} a {{continuity}} program, <b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> negative-option offer, whereby {{customers are}} sent repeat orders until they cancel. When purchasing directly from the company, customers automatically become members of a Proactiv club. A month after ordering, and every three months thereafter, they are sent a three-month supply costing $60 (in the US as of 2011), plus shipping and handling. They are billed monthly until they cancel the subscription. The approach is based on the customer lifetime value model.|$|E

5|$|In the Catholic Church, {{display of}} a cross behind the shield is {{restricted}} to bishops as a mark of their dignity. The cross of an ordinary bishop has a single horizontal bar or traverse, <b>also</b> <b>known</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Latin cross.

5|$|Professional divers may be {{required}} by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas {{to enable them to}} reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile.

This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.|$|E
