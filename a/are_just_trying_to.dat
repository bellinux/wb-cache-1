500|$|Killen {{said that}} writing the pilot episode's script {{was one of}} the more-difficult {{components}} of creating the show. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result they created outlines, distinguishing the separate realities with green or red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. Stating that things are [...] "initially confusing to us when we <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> break story," [...] he hoped that when viewers watched the pilot episode, they would be immediately oriented in the reality on screen at the time.|$|E
500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2013 World Championships in Athletics, held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium in August 2013, were {{overshadowed by}} {{comments}} and protests over {{the law by}} athletes. After winning a silver medal at the event, U.S. runner Nick Symmonds stated that [...] "whether you're gay, straight, black, white, we all deserve the same rights. If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we try to follow their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the album, {{as well as its}} cleaner sound and the group's {{appearances}} on MTV, caused many longtime fans to accuse the band of [...] "selling out". Many commentators stated that the band's polished pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. Although the video for [...] "All the Small Things" [...] was filmed as a mockery of boy bands and teen pop, [...] "fame [...] discriminate based on origin: soon the group was as famous as those it was parodying." [...] "Blink now had the backing of a major record company... just like the synthesized pop acts they were spoofing," [...] said British journalist Tim Footman. [...] "In what way were they less 'pop' than Sugar Ray and 98 Degrees?" [...] Matt Diehl, author of the book My So-Called Punk, called the basis for satire thin: [...] "To seasoned ears, Blink-182 sounded and looked just as manufactured as the pop idols they were poking fun at." [...] The band faced a backlash shortly after Enema of the State was released from several punk and emo acts who wished to not be associated with their music. Tristin Laughter, employee of Bay Area record label Lookout! Records, wrote in an issue of the influential zine Punk Planet that the band would have a genuinely negative impact on punk and accused the band of misogyny. DeLonge responded to the accusations, commenting, [...] "I love all those criticisms, because fuck all those magazines! I hate with a passion Maximumrocknroll and all those zines that think they know what punk is supposed to be. I think it's so much more punk to piss people off than to conform to all those veganistic views". While ska veterans Blue Meanies tried to empathize ("I think they [...] <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get in the mindset of a teenager, which means a lot of curiosity about sex,") others, such as John Lydon, frontman of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Ltd, dismissed the band as a [...] "bunch of silly boys... an imitation of a comedy act." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tom Jackson, the Ferguson {{police chief}} denied any {{suppression}} of the media. U.S. President Barack Obama addressed the First Amendment violations, saying, [...] "There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights.

2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes for us to see Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E

These fellas <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> show how sensational they can be, t' say nothing of talking like they was so damn superior to the rest of us. Don't read 'em. Read pure authors like Howard Bancock Binch, where, whenever any lady gets seduced or anything like that, the author shows it's because the villain is an atheist or something, and he treats all those things in a nice, fine, decent manner. Good Gawd! sometimes a fella 'd think, to see you scrooge up your nose when I'm shaving, that I'm common as dirt, but lemme tell you, right now, miss, I'm a darn sight too refined to read any of these nasty novels where they go to the trouble of describing homes that ain't any better than pig-pens. Oh, and another thing! I heard you telling Mrs. Sanderson you thought all kids oughta have sex education. My Gawd! I don't know where you get those rotten ideas! Certainly not from me. Lemme tell you, no kid of mine is going to be made nasty-minded by having a lot of stuff like that taught her. Yes, sir, actually taught her right out in school." ...|$|E
