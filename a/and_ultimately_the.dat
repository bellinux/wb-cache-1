5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This has implications in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E

5|$|Written by Barry Letts, the storyline {{for this}} four-part story was {{commissioned}} on 21 January 1975. It {{was based on}} an audition piece for the role of Sarah Jane Smith that Letts had written in 1973 and was initially known as Time Lord Story. Scripts were requested, but Hinchcliffe was unhappy with the draft of the first part <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> story was dropped.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{despite a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on royal power, Henry's rule was relatively circumscribed and constitutional. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces <b>and,</b> <b>ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> collapse of his authority at court. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces <b>and,</b> <b>ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
5|$|For several years, {{between the}} March 1841 arson and 1848, court convened in various private residences. Without a {{courthouse}} in Oregon, the county seat, proposals {{to move the}} county seat began to circulate. Ogle County communities, Byron, Mount Morris, Grand Detour and Daysville were all in contention for the designation, <b>and,</b> <b>ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> new courthouse. At the deciding meeting the representatives from Daysville removed their town from the running and sided with Oregon. The withdrawal of Daysville gave Oregon a slim majority of votes and it retained its status as county seat of Ogle County.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{different}} factions in Masyumi were in conflict over the path {{the party was}} taking; the NU members thought Masyumi was becoming too political, abandoning its Islamic roots. When the Natsir Cabinet began to collapse, the Masyumi put forth Fakih as a potential Minister for Religious Affairs. This act was controversial because {{four of the five}} allocated slots for the party were already filled by non-NU members, <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> NU pulled out of Masyumi, effective 5April 1952. Fakih had been chosen with a majority of five votes, while the next leading candidate, Usman Raliby, received four.|$|E

She scored the first goal (69') in the FIFA World Cup Final against Japan after coming on as a substitute at the half, as well as assisting on the Abby Wambach header (104') for a goal in extra time. Her performance made her {{the first player to}} ever record a goal and an assist in a World Cup final. Morgan finished eighth in the balloting for the 2011 FIFA World Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{a two-day}} final in four sets, to ultimately achieve his seventh French Open title and deny Djokovic a Career Grand Slam. With Nadal leading by two sets to one, and Djokovic leading 2–1 on {{serve in the}} fourth set, the match was suspended due to rain; it was initially thought that Djokovic had gained the momentum, having won eight consecutive games prior to the suspension of the match, however, Nadal was able to regroup and take the fourth set, <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> match, after Djokovic double-faulted on championship point down.|$|E
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be perched. In March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue <b>and,</b> <b>ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> B-2 bomber.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, {{the heir}} to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo; the {{assassination}} sparked the July Crisis <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> First World War, which broke out a month later on 28 July. The German battlecruiser , which had been assigned to the Mediterranean Division, sought the protection of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and so Admiral Anton Haus sent the fleet, including Kaiser Karl VI, south on 7 August to assist his German ally. Goebens commander, Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, intended to use the Austro-Hungarian move as a feint to distract the British Mediterranean Fleet which was pursuing Goeben; Souchon instead took his ship to Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire. Their decoy mission complete, Kaiser Karl VI {{and the rest of the}} fleet returned to port without engaging any British forces.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Alvarez (2009) nearly went {{unsigned}} as {{he faced}} a contentious {{process in which}} Alvarez and the Pirates reached an initial deal after the signing deadline (with permission from MLB); his agent Scott Boras and the Players Association filed a grievance challenging this post-deadline deal, <b>and</b> <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> Pirates renegotiated a deal with him in September that year. The Pirates have had seven compensatory picks overall since the first draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.|$|E
