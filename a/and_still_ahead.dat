Relievers Peter Moylan and Jonny Venters couldn't hold the lead, as the Giants promptly scored two runs on Juan Uribe's RBI fielder's choice and Cody Ross' RBI single.

Both errors were debatable. The first was a ball hit in the hole he didn't field cleanly with the speedy Andrés Torres running, earlier in the game. The second call was more controversial. With two on and one out and fielding a weakly hit groundball, González elected to throw to second but threw high to second baseman Omar Infante, who was ruled to have come off the base jumping for the throw.|$|E

It was fortunate for Schley that the Vizcaya, ordinarily a fast ship, was very slow due to having an extremely fouled hull and could not match the speed of the Colon which was now clear of the fight. Had the hull of the Vizcaya been clean, Schley would have found himself chasing two ships and not fighting one. The Teresa was now on fire and was so damaged that it had to turn north and beach itself. The battle between the Brooklyn and the Vizcaya was ferocious for a time as the ships steamed west, but the quality weaponry of the Brooklyn overwhelmed it, not to mention the Oregon which was astern and firing. The Vizcaya, terribly damaged after a torpedo exploded internally and on fire, was forced to also beach itself. By this time the Oquendo and the Spanish destroyers had also been overwhelmed by American fire.|$|R

The author sets out to present the arising socio-economic threats connected with the discussed processes and above all to shed light upon the technical and financial mechanisms connected with them. The author arrives at the following conclusions. Methods of applying new payment technologies, especially in money laundering, are as complicated as the economic system itself.
