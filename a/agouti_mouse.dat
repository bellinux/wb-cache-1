40|$|Leptin, {{a hormone}} {{secreted}} by adipose tissue, acts to inhibit appetite and promote metabolism, thereby reducing body weight.

Diverse Umweltbelastungen in der frühen Entwicklung spielen eine Rolle in der Krankheitsanfälligkeit im späteren Leben, und scheinen transgenerationale Effekte zu haben. Epigenetische Modifikationen bieten eine {{plausible}} Verbindung zwischen der Umwelt und Veränderungen in der Genexpression. Besonderes Interesse gilt den Methyldonatoren, die eine funktionelle Gruppe abgeben, und dadurch die Histonmodifikationen und die Chromatinstruktur beeinflussen können. Die "viable - yellow" Mäuse zeigen als erstes epigenetisches Beispiel, dass man durch bestimmte Nahrungseinflüsse (Methyldonatoren) das Risiko an Adipoitas zu erkranken, signifikant reduzieren kann. Epigenetics is a {{young and}} increasing field of Research, and provides the possibility to change the epigenome through certain nutritional influences, like Methyldonors. Methyldonors are Folic acid, Vitamin B 6, Betaine, Choline and Vitamin B 12. Without a doubt, {{there is a relationship}} between these nutritional factors. It has been proven that Methyldonors can modify the DNA-Sequence without altering the DNA itself. That rises the intrest, that certain nutritional influences can change the DNA - Sequenz through modifying the Chromatinstrucuture and Histontails, because a Methyldonor can provide the Methylgroup in the One Carbon Metabolism and influences therefore the Genexpression. Methyldonors are admitted through Food products, and can even be supplemented. Since Obesity, Diabetes mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease are recognized as a widespread disease, and the number of Diseases rises every year, Intervention and Therapie Treatment are getting more important for researchers. One important question is, if there is a possibiltiy to change or control the Epigenom through nutritional influences. Certain Environment expositons in the early development in the embryo have the ability to change the epigenome. Another question is, if there is a transgenerational inheritance, which can be obtained in the future generations, and also have a positve effect on the offspring. Researchers focused on the <b>Agouti</b> <b>Mouse</b> Model, that was the first epigentic example, it showed that Nutrition can alter the Epigenome through decrease of the obesity suszeptibility.

40|$|Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one {{the most}} potent orexigenic {{peptides}} found in the brain. It stimulates food intake with a preferential effect on carbohydrate intake. It decreases latency to eat, increases motivation to eat and delays satiety by augmenting meal size. The effects on feeding are mediated through at least two receptors, the Y 1 and Y 5 receptors. The NPY system for feeding regulation is mostly located in the hypothalamus. It is formed of the arcuate nucleus (ARC), where the peptide is synthesized, and the paraventricular (PVN), dorsomedial (DMN) and ventromedial (VMN) nuclei and perifornical area where it is active. This activity is modulated by the hindbrain and limbic structures. It is dependent on energy availability, e. g. upregulation with food deprivation or restriction, and return to baseline with refeeding. It is also sensitive to diet composition with variable effects of carbohydrates and fats. Leptin signalling and glucose sensing which are directly linked to diet type {{are the most important}} factors involved in its regulation. Absence of leptin signalling in obesity models due to gene mutation either at the receptor level, as in the Zucker rat, the Koletsky rat or the db/db mouse, or at the peptide level, as in ob/ob mouse, is associated with increased mRNA abundance, peptide content and/or release in the ARC or PVN. Other genetic obesity models, such as the Otsuka–Long–Evans–Tokushima Fatty rat, the <b>agouti</b> <b>mouse</b> or the tubby mouse, are characterized by a diminution in NPY expression in the ARC nucleus and by {{a significant increase in the}} DMN. Further studies are necessary to determine the exact role of NPY in these latter models. Long-term exposure to high-fat or high-energy palatable diets leads to the development of adiposity and is associated with a decrease in hypothalamic NPY content or expression, consistent with the existence of a counter-regulatory mechanism to diminish energy intake and limit obesity development. On the other hand, an overactive NPY system (increased mRNA expression in the ARC associated with an upregulation of the receptors) is characteristic of rats or rodent strains sensitive to dietary-induced obesity. Finally, NPY appears to play an important role in body weight and feeding regulation, and while it does not constitute the only target for drug treatment of obesity, it may nevertheless provide a useful target in conjunction with others...|$|E
40|$|Both {{oestrogen}} deficiency and the {{inflammatory disease}} {{contribute to the}} generalized bone loss seen in postmenopausal rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Oestradiol and the selective oestrogen receptor modulator raloxifene {{have been shown to}} ameliorate the disease in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a well-established animal model for human RA. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether raloxifene-treatment would be beneficial in long-term treatment of established CIA, both regarding anti-arthritic and anti-osteoporotic properties. Female dilute brown <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> were ovariectomized and CIA was induced.

Treatment with raloxifene is beneficial in long-term treatment of established CIA. It hampers the disease severity and frequency, protects the joints from destruction and protects against the development of osteoporosis. The proinflammatory cytokine IL- 6 was down-regulated in raloxifene-treated mice compared with controls. The serum levels of antibodies to collagen were not affected by raloxifene-treatment.

40|$|ELEVATED {{synthesis}} of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus {{has been proposed}} {{to play an important}} role in mediating the obese phenotype in genetically obese animals (1, 2). This hypothesis is widely viewed as credible because 1) experimental elevation of hypothalamic NPY can induce obesity (1); 2) in some forms of genetic obesity, NPY messenger RNA (mRNA) in the arcuate nucleus is elevated (3 – 6); 3) leptin inhibits NPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus (3, 7); and 4) obesity is attenuated in leptindeficient ob/ob mice that lack NPY (8). On the other hand, reduced POMC activity is also implicated in obesity, as 1) obesity in yellow <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> is associated with interference in response to �MSH, which is derived from POMC (9 – 13); 2) genetic deletion of an �MSH receptor produces obesity (14); 3) central administration of �MSH or a melanocortin- 4 receptor agonist inhibits food intake, whereas a melanocortin- 4 receptor antagonist stimulates food intake (13, 15); and 4) the expression of hypothalamic POMC mRNA is reduced in genetically obese ob/ob and db/db mice and is stimulated by leptin (16 – 18).

40|$|The agouti protein regulates {{pigmentation}} in {{the mouse}} hair follicle producing a black {{hair with a}} subapical yellow band. Its effect on pigmentation is achieved by antagonizing the binding of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) to melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc 1 r), switching melanin synthesis from eumelanin (black/brown) to phaeomelanin (red/yellow). Dominant mutations in the non-coding region of <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> cause yellow coat colour and ectopic expression also results in obesity, type 11 diabetes, increased somatic growth and tumourigenesis. At least some of these pleiotropic effects {{can be explained by}} antagonism of other members of the melanocortin receptor family by agouti protein. The yellow coat colour is the result of agouti chronically antagonizing the binding of alpha-MSH to Mc 1 r and the obese phenotype results from agouti protein antagonizing the binding of alpha-MSH to Mc 3 r and/or Mc 4 r. Despite the existence of a highly homologous agouti protein in humans, agouti signal protein (ASIP), its role has yet to be defined. However it is known that human ASIP is expressed at highest levels in adipose tissue where it may antagonize one of the melanocortin receptors. The conserved nature of the agouti protein combined with the diverse phenotypic effects of <b>agouti</b> mutations in <b>mouse</b> and the different expression patterns of human and <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti,</b> suggest ASIP {{may play a role in}} human energy homeostasis and possibly human pigmentation...|$|R

"May 2013 "Epigenetics is the study of how heritable phenotypes are transmitted without changes being made to the DNA sequence. One of the best characterized animal models for epigenetics is the viable yellow (Avy) mouse. These animals exhibit a range of coat colors that reflect the degree of methylation of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) inserted in the agouti gene. Yellow coat color Avy mice, with an under-methylated IAP, exhibit altered expression of the agouti gene, which leads to obesity and diabetes; in contrast, brown Avy siblings, with a highly methylated IAP, and black (a/a) pelage siblings, lacking the IAP, remain healthy. Along with overt phenotypic differences, epigenetic modifications are also thought to change normal behaviors. Here, we examined whether behavioral and body weight differences exist between brown and yellow morph (Avy/a) and black pelage (a/a) mice as they age. In another experiment, a diet high in methyl donors was fed to the Avy/a mice to determine if it would have an effect on coat color, weight, and/or diabetic status. We demonstrated that there are body weight and behavioral differences between non-agouti and <b>agouti</b> <b>mice.</b> Yellow mice were more lethargic and less motivated to complete the mazes compared to darker furred mice. Brown and black mice outperformed their yellow counterparts in almost all mazes and weighed less by puberty.

40|$|The <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> gene encodes an 131 {{amino acid}} paracrine {{signaling}} molecule that instructs hair follicle melanocytes {{to switch from}} making black to yellow pigment. Expression of agouti during the middle part of the hair growth cycle in wild-type mice produces a yellow band on an otherwise black hair. The ubiquitous unregulated expression of <b>agouti</b> in <b>mice</b> carrying dominant yellow alleles is associated with pleiotropic effects including increased yellow pigment in the coat, obesity, diabetes and increased tumor susceptibility. Agouti shows no significant homology to known genes, and the molecular analysis of agouti alleles has shed little {{new light on the}} important functional elements of the agouti protein. In this paper, we show that agouti expression driven by the human β-ACTIN promoter produces obese yellow transgenic mice and that this can be used as an assay for agouti activity. We used this assay to evaluate a point mutation associated with the a(16 H) allele within the region encoding agouti's putative signal sequence and our results suggest that this mutation is sufficient to cause the a(16 H) phenotype. Thus, in vitro mutagenesis followed by the generation of transgenic mice should allow us to identify important functional elements of the agouti protein...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence in both {{plants and animals}} that epigenetic marks are not always cleared between generations. Incomplete erasure at genes associated with a measurable phenotype results in unusual patterns of inheritance {{from one generation to}} the next, termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The Agouti viable yellow (A vy) allele is the best-studied example of this phenomenon in mice. The A vy allele is the result of a retrotransposon insertion upstream of the Agouti gene. Expression at this locus is controlled by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrotransposon, and expression results in a yellow coat and correlates with hypomethylation of the LTR. Isogenic mice display variable expressivity, resulting in mice with a range of coat colours, from yellow through to <b>agouti.</b> <b>Agouti</b> <b>mice</b> have a methylated LTR. The locus displays epigenetic inheritance following maternal but not paternal transmission; yellow mothers produce more yellow offspring than agouti mothers. We have analysed the DNA methylation in mature gametes, zygotes, and blastocysts and found that the paternally and maternally inherited alleles are treated differently. The paternally inherited allele is demethylated rapidly, and the maternal allele is demethylated more slowly, in a manner similar to that of nonimprinted single-copy genes. Interestingly, following maternal transmission of the allele, there is no DNA methylation in the blastocyst, suggesting that DNA methylation is not the inherited mark. We have independent support for this conclusion from studies that do not involve direct analysis of DNA methylation.

40|$|Nuclease {{sensitive}} element binding protein 1 (NSEP 1) is {{a member}} of the EFIA/NSEP 1 /YB- 1 family of DNA-binding proteins whose members share a cold shock domain; it has also been termed DNA-binding protein B and Y box binding protein- 1 because of its recognition of transcriptional regulatory elements. In addition, NSEP 1 functions in the translational regulation of renin, ferritin, and interleukin 2 transcripts, and our laboratory has reported that it plays a role in the biosynthesis of selenium-containing proteins. To test the functional importance of NSEP 1 in murine embryonic development, we have utilized a clone of ES cells in which the NSEP 1 gene had been disrupted by integration of a plasmid gene-trapping vector into the seventh exon. Injection of these cells into C 57 BL/ 6 blastocysts resulted in 11 high percentage chimeric mice; crosses to wild type C 57 BL/ 6 mice generated 82 F 1 <b>agouti</b> <b>mice,</b> indicating germ line transmission of the ES cell clone, but genotyping showed no evidence of the disrupted allele in any of these agouti offspring even though spermatozoa from four of five tested mice contained the targeted allele. Embryos harvested after timed matings of chimeric male mice demonstrated only the wildtype allele in 27 embryos tested at E 7. 5, E 12. 5, and E 18. 5. These results suggest that gene targeting of NSEP 1 induces a lethal phenotype in early embryos, due to either haploinsufficiency of NSEP 1 or formation of a dominant negative form of the protein. In either case, these data indicate the functional importance of the NSEP 1 gene in murine early embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} microscope study of ultrathin sections of trophoblast cells of implanting blastocysts {{resulting from the}} crossing of heterozygous yellow <b>agouti</b> <b>mice</b> has been conducted. Several conditions for successful preparation of the blastocysts have been described. These include avoidance {{of the use of}} sucrose in the buffers, reduction of specimen washing times and exclusion of propylene oxide from the dehydration procedure. Electron micrographs of cells from a blastocyst considered, on the basis of light microscopy, to be 'abnormal' revealed a cytoplasm with many 'empty' areas and numerous 'vacuolated' mitochondria. Electron micrographs of cells from blastocysts considered to be 'normal' revealed, in one instance, a preponderance of cells with very few of these 'abnormal' features, and, in the other instance, a preponderance of cells with many abnormalities. Both 'normal' blastocysts revealed cellular features usually regarded as either primitive or pathological, namely tight junctions, vacuolated mitochondria and mitochondria with cristae oriented parallel to their long axis. It was generally concluded that the appearance of the blastocysts, in the light microscope, at 100 - 105 hours of development, could not be used as a valid criterion of normality or abnormality, for, although a blastocyst classified as 'abnormal' under the light microscope appeared 'abnormal' also in the {{electron microscope}}, those classified as 'normal' under the light microscope appeared either 'normal' or 'abnormal' in the electron microscope.

40|$|The agouti {{gene product}} is a {{secreted}} protein that acts in a paracrine manner to regulate coat color in mammals. Several dominant mutations at the <b>agouti</b> locus in <b>mice</b> cause the ectopic, ubiquitous expression of agouti, {{resulting in a}} condition similar to adult-onset obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The human agouti protein is 85 % homologous to mouse agouti; however, unlike the <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> gene, human agouti is normally expressed in adipose tissue. To address whether expression of agouti in human adipose tissue is physiologically relevant, transgenic mice were generated that express agouti in adipose tissue. Similar to most humans, these mice do not become obese or diabetic. However, we found that daily insulin injections significantly increased weight gain in the transgenic lines expressing agouti in adipose tissue, but not in nontransgenic mice. These results suggest that insulin triggers the onset of obesity and that agouti expression in adipose tissue potentiates this effect. Accordingly, the investigation of agouti’s role in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in mice holds significant promise for understanding the pathophysiology of human obesity...|$|R
40|$|The Light {{mutation}} (Blt) is {{a dominant}} allele of the b-locus on mouse chromosome 4 which causes progressive dilution of coat colour. Melanocytes within the hair follicles of mutant mice develop normally but later degenerate, {{due to the}} accumulation of a toxic product, so that the hair becomes lighter with age. Previous studies on W-locus spotting mutants, from which melanocytes are absent, have shown that melanocytes in the stria vascularis of the inner ear are essential for the development and/or maintenance of the endocochlear potential (EP) which is normally around 100 mV. In this study, physiological recordings from the ears of Light mutants were correlated with strial ultrastructure. EPs recorded from all b/b controls and young homozygous and heterozygous mutants (20 – 22 days old) were normal (77 to 113 mV), but were reduced (19 to 59 mV) in about 30 % of ears from older mutants (Blt/Blt and Blt/b). Strial function therefore appears to develop normally but later degenerates in some mutants. This suggests that strial melanocytes {{are affected by the}} Light allele and that the continued presence of melanocytes is necessary for strial function. There was no obvious association between the recorded EP value and the ultrastructural appearance of the stria. No structural abnormalities of the stria were noted in control or mutant mice aged 20 days to 4 months including those which had a reduced EP. Strial atrophy was common in old controls and mutants (1 – 2 years), and appeared to be an age-related process rather than an effect of the Light mutation. Similarly, pigment build-up was common in all strial cells of old mice. However, the accumulations of lipofuscin-like pigment were much larger and more abundant in aged brown non-agouti mice than those observed in old <b>agouti</b> <b>mice,</b> which suggests that this age-related process also has a genetic component...|$|R

In contrast, DGAT 1 deficiency did not affect energy and glucose metabolism in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice, possibly due in part to a compensatory upregulation of DGAT 2 expression in the absence of leptin.

The obesity and hyperphagia may be mediated by impaired melanocortin activation of PVN neurons [...] and oxytocin deficiency in these mice. It has been demonstrated that modulating Sim1 levels postnatally also leads to hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting a physiological role for Sim1 separate from its role in development.|$|R
40|$|SummaryAge-related disease, not aging per se, causes most {{morbidity}} {{in older}} humans. Here {{we report that}} skeletal muscle respiratory uncoupling due to UCP 1 expression diminishes age-related disease in three mouse models. In a longevity study, median survival was increased in UCP mice (animals with skeletal muscle-specific UCP 1 expression), and lymphoma was detected less frequently in UCP female mice. In apoE null mice, a vascular disease model, diet-induced atherosclerosis was decreased in UCP animals. In <b>agouti</b> yellow <b>mice,</b> a genetic obesity model, diabetes and hypertension were reversed by induction of UCP 1 in skeletal muscle. Uncoupled mice had decreased adiposity, increased temperature and metabolic rate, elevated muscle SIRT and AMP kinase, and serum characterized by increased adiponectin and decreased IGF- 1 and fibrinogen. Accelerating metabolism in skeletal muscle {{does not appear to}} impact aging but may delay age-related disease...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the agouti gene and dominant mutations in that gene {{that lead to}} agouti-induced obesity, and recent work with transgenic mice to elucidate the role of agouti in obesity. Agouti was cloned in 1992 by the lab of Rick Woychik at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, making it {{the first of many}} recently cloned mouse obesity genes. Sequence analysis predicted that <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> is a secreted protein of 131 amino acids. The mature protein has a basic central region (lys 57 -arg 85), a proline-rich domain (pro 86 -pro 91) and a C-terminal region (cys 92 -cys 13 1) containing 10 cysteine residues which form 5 disulfide bonds. The human homologue of agouti has also been cloned by the Woychik lab and maps to human chromosome 20 q 11. 2. Human agouti is 132 amino acids long and is 85 % similar to the <b>mouse</b> <b>agouti</b> protein and is normally expressed in adipose tissue. The researchers have been able to recapitulate obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia with the ubiquitous expression of agouti. Agouti expression in either liver and adipose tissue alone does not cause obesity, and there`s a dose-dependent effect of agouti on body weight, food efficiency, body temperature, and insulin and glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{the pigment}} eumelanin is {{controlled}} by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) stimulation of melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc 1 r), whereas production of pheomelanin results from agouti antagonism of alpha-MSH signalling through Mc 1 r. The role of <b>agouti</b> in <b>mouse</b> pigmentation has been extensively investigated but a role for agouti signalling protein (ASIP) in human pigmentation has not been determined. To determine whether ASIP regulates known melanogenic genes in humans, ASIP was over-expressed in a human melanoma cell line. Levels of mRNA and protein were measured in genes known to be up or down-regulated by <b>agouti</b> in the <b>mouse,</b> namely microphthalmia (Mitf), tyrosinase (Tyr), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp 1), dopachrome tautomerase (Dct), Mc 1 r, silver, initiation transcription factor 2 (Itf 2) and mini chromosome maintenance protein 6 (Mcm 6). These melanogenic genes were {{not found to be}} significantly up or down-regulated by ASIP at the transcriptional level in human melanoma cells. However, ASIP down-regulation of tyrp 1 was observed at the translational level. To identify novel genes that may be regulated by ASIP in melanoma cells, microarrays were used to determine differences in gene expression between the control and ASIP transfected melanoma cells. The expression level of human RNAs were determined by microarray analysis using a 19, 200 cDNA and a 19, 200 oligonucleotide array representing 13, 000 and 18, 864 individual genes, respectively. Genes observed to be modulated by ASIP were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results identify five genes, namely PPARbeta, eIF- 4 B, RRM 2, MINOR and EVI 2 B that are down-regulated by ASIP, indicating a likely role for ASIP in human melanogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Early {{nutrition}} affects adult metabolism {{in humans}} and other mammals, potentially via persistent alter-ations in DNA methylation. With viable yellow <b>agouti</b> (Avy) <b>mice,</b> which harbor a transposable {{element in the}} agouti gene, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} metastable methylation status of specific transposable element insertion sites renders them epigenetically labile to early methyl donor nutrition. Our results show that dietary methyl supplementation of a/a dams with extra folic acid, vitamin B 12, choline, and betaine alter the phenotype of their Avy/a offspring via increased CpG methylation at the Avy locus and that the epigenetic metastability which confers this lability is due to the Avy transposable element. These findings suggest that dietary supple-mentation, long presumed to be purely beneficial, may have unintended deleterious influences on the estab-lishment of epigenetic gene regulation in humans. Human epidemiologic and animal model data indicate that susceptibility to adult-onset chronic disease is influenced by persistent adaptations to prenatal and early postnatal nutrition (1, 2, 13, 14); however, the specific biological mechanisms underlying such adaptations remain largely unknown. Cytosine methylation within CpG dinucleotides of DNA acts in concer...|$|R
50|$|Aphaeomelanism is the {{abnormal}} {{absence of}} phaeomelanin from the integumentary system and/or eyes. Phaeomelanin {{is produced by}} melanocytes {{in the absence of}} melanocortin 1 receptor. This absence is mediated by agouti signalling protein, which antagonizes melanocortin 1 receptor. Loss of function of agouti signalling protein can permit unmediated eumelanin production, producing a uniformly black-to-brown coat color. This condition can be observed in dogs, cats, and horses. The appearance of mammals with recessive agouti mutations is typically dense black. As with aeumelanism, the difference between lack of phaeomelanin and abundance of eumelanin is one of words. Some <b>agouti</b> alleles in <b>mice</b> are associated with health defects, {{but this is not the}} case in dogs, cats, or horses.|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of fetal origins of adult disease posits that early developmental exposures involve epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, that influence adult disease susceptibility. In utero or neonatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), a high-production-volume chemical {{used in the}} manufacture of polycarbonate plastic, is associated with higher body weight, increased breast and prostate cancer, and altered reproductive function. This study shows that maternal exposure to this endocrine-active compound shifted the coat color distribution of viable yellow <b>agouti</b> (Avy) <b>mouse</b> offspring toward yellow by decreasing CpG (cytosine-guanine dinucleotide) methylation in an intracisternal A particle retrotransposon upstream of the Agouti gene. CpG methylation also was decreased at another metastable locus, the CDK 5 activator-binding protein (CabpIAP). DNA methylation at the Avy locus was similar in tissues from the three germ layers, providing evidence that epigenetic patterning during early stem cell development is sensitive to BPA exposure. Moreover, maternal dietary supplementation, with either methyl donors like folic acid or the phytoestrogen genistein, negated the DNA hypomethylating effect of BPA. Thus, we present compelling evidence that early developmental exposure to BPA can change offspring phenotype by stably altering the epigenome, an effect that can be counteracted by maternal dietary supplements...|$|R
