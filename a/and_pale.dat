5|$|A. n. punicus, {{described}} by Erlanger in 1897, is resident in north-west Africa, {{north of the}} Sahara. It {{is very similar to}} nisus, being large <b>and</b> <b>pale.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beer colour is {{determined}} by the malt. The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. Pale lager <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with the fuel coke. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, {{but it was not until}} around 1703 that the term pale ale was used.|$|E

5|$|Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The larvae {{are small}} <b>and</b> <b>pale,</b> have {{bristles}} covering their worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scott Redhead {{reduced the}} species Crinipellis cremoricolor (originally {{described}} by Shaffer and Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the University of Michigan Biological Station) {{to a variety}} of C.crinipellis. The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7–12 by 3.8–5µm. According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and stem, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> pinkish-cinnamon gills.|$|E
5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the Asian cockroach, which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> colors.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests can {{used to help}} confirm identification of the mushroom. The cap cuticle turns grayish with {{the application of a}} drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4), and dark brown to amber with a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH). The flesh turns pale brown with KOH, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> yellow with ammonia (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Some falcons {{have the}} speed and agility to catch {{swallows}} and martins in flight, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> crag martins may be hunted by species such as the peregrine falcon, Taita falcon, African hobby and wintering Eurasian hobby. Pale crag martins often share their nesting sites with little swifts, which sometimes forcibly take over martins' nests.|$|E
5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> grey rump.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of DNA sequences from Australian collections labeled Macrolepiota konradii, M.gracilenta, M.mastoidea, and M.procera {{has shown that}} they are the same species as Macrolepiota clelandii. Similarly, several New Zealand collections were historically misidentified as Macrolepiota dolichaula. These names, given originally to European species, were erroneously applied to Australian collections. Else Vellinga subsequently emended the species concept of Macrolepiota clelandii to include specimens with four-spored basidia <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> fruitbody colouring. Phylogenetically, M.clelandii is in a clade with closely related species such as M.procera, M.dolichaula, and M.mastoidea. This clade is sister to a group containing Leucoagaricus and Leucocoprinus species. The presence of clamp connections in the hyphae place M.clelandii in the section Macrolepiota of genus Macrolepiota.|$|E
5|$|Stars is a wood {{engraving}} print; that is, it {{was produced by}} carving the artwork into the end grain of a block of wood (unlike a woodcut which uses the side grain), and then using this block to print the image. It was created by Escher in October 1948. Although most published copies of Stars are monochromatic, with white artwork against a black background, the copy in the National Gallery of Canada is tinted in different shades of turquoise, yellow, green, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> pink.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.|$|E

50|$|It {{is mainly}} grey-brown above <b>and</b> <b>paler</b> brown below. It has a <b>pale</b> grey rump <b>and</b> a <b>pale</b> patch above <b>and</b> behind the bill. The sexes are similar, but the {{juvenile}} has a less distinct rump.|$|R
5|$|The Smiths {{saw the man}} {{at around}} 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, 500 yards (457 m) from the McCanns' apartment, {{walking away from the}} Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was {{carrying}} a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5ft 7in–5ft 9in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on Crimewatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male has a {{short and}} narrow black bib {{and a broad}} chestnut eye stripe that {{does not meet the}} mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a culmen length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow.|$|E
5|$|The female {{has mostly}} pale brown upperparts, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It {{differs from the}} house sparrow in its {{slightly}} darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile {{is similar to the}} female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib.|$|E

5|$|The spores are 7–9 by 5–6.5μm, broadly , smooth, and {{strongly}} amyloid (it turns black when treated with Melzer's reagent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are not differentiated. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) {{are embedded in}} the gill edge and very inconspicuous, club-shaped, 26–36 by 5–10μm, and have tips that are covered with contorted projections that can be slender or thick. The flesh of the gills is homogeneous, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a distinct , a well-differentiated hypoderm (a region of tissue immediately under the pellicle), and a filamentous tramal body (gill tissue); it is pale yellowish to sordid brownish in iodine stain.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} californicus {{usually has}} a longer bill {{compared to the}} nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> lores less often than Podiceps nigricollis californicus. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, is {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upper parts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in {{breeding}} plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, <b>and</b> <b>pale</b> pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
