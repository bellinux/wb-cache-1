25|$|The {{authors of}} this study believe that the {{mentioned}} agricultural crisis will only begin to <b>affect</b> <b>us</b> after 2020, and will not become critical until 2050. The oncoming peaking of global oil production (and subsequent decline of production), along with the peak of North American natural gas production will very likely precipitate this agricultural crisis much sooner than expected. Geologist Dale Allen Pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.|$|E

Strauss-Kahn said he hoped other countries would join Japan in providing support to the 185-nation institution. Prime Minister Taro Aso told Japan was ready to lend up to $100 billion from our foreign reserves to the IMF if it finds itself with insufficient funds to help emergency economies. Nikkei Business Daily reported that selling U.S. government bonds held by Japan to provide cash to the IMF would <b>affect</b> <b>U.S.</b> bond yields so Tokyo may consider lending U.S. government bonds to the IMF as collateral for it to raise funds.|$|E
25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? The research evidence about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn <b>affect</b> <b>U.S.</b> energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E

25|$|The {{celestial}} sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are {{areas of the}} sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these <b>affect</b> <b>us</b> on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy {{has been around for}} a long time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends to focus on the physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.|$|E
