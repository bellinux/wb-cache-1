5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such <b>an</b> <b>imprint</b> on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E

5|$|Ace, {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. Ace then became <b>an</b> <b>imprint</b> of Penguin Group (USA).|$|E

Placement of the adhesive stamp in addition to the imprinted stamp in order to pay a higher postal rate is called [...] "uprated" [...] (Spanish= franqueos complementarios).

40|$|Using YPLG (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly), a tetrapeptide, as the template, <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> {{monolithic}} {{column was}} prepared {{and applied to}} the selective recognition of oxytocin based on the epitope approach and capillary electrochromatography (CEC). By optimizing the polymerization solution in terms of functional monomer, cross-linking reagent, porogen, and imprinted template via CEC evaluations of synthesized columns, <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> monolith with good recognition capacity (the imprinting factors for YPLG and oxytocin were 4. 499 and 4. 013, respectively) and high column efficiency (theoretical plates for YPLG and oxytocin were 22, 995 plates/m and 16, 952 plates/m, respectively) was achieved. In addition, the effects of various experimental parameters on the recognition of oxytocin, including the organic modifier content, the buffer concentration, and the pH value, were studied systematically. Furthermore, a mixture of oxytocin and other proteins was analyzed using this monolithic CEC column, and oxytocin was eluted much more slowly than other large biomolecules, which demonstrated the high selective recognition ability of such <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> monolith for oxytocin with PLG (Pro-Leu-Gly) as the epitope...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} {{expression}} of <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> gene {{is dependent on}} the sex of the parent from which it was inherited. As a result, reciprocal heterozygotes in a population may have different mean phenotypes for quantitative traits. Using standard quantitative genetic methods for deriving breeding values, population variances, and covariances between relatives, we demonstrate that although these approaches are equivalent under Mendelian expression, this equivalence is lost when genomic imprinting is acting. Imprinting introduces both parent-of-origin-dependent and generation-dependent effects that result in differences in the way additive and dominance effects are defined for the various approaches. Further, <b>imprinting</b> creates <b>a</b> covariance between additive and dominance terms absent under Mendelian expression, but the expression for this covariance cannot be derived using a number of the standard approaches for defining additive and dominance terms. Inbreeding also generates such a covariance, and we demonstrate that a modified method for partitioning variances can easily accommodate both inbreeding and <b>imprinting.</b> <b>As</b> with inbreeding, the concept of breeding values has no useful meaning for <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> trait. Finally, we derive the expression for the response to selection under imprinting, and conclude that the response to selection for <b>an</b> <b>imprinted</b> trait cannot be predicted from the breeder’s equation, even when there is no dominance...|$|R
