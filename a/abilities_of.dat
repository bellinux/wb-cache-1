The Correlation {{between the}} <b>Ability</b> <b>of</b> Reading Comprehension, Language Attitude and the <b>Ability</b> <b>of</b> Short Story Appreciation at Elementary School Students In Gugus Yudistira, Selogiri Wonogiri. Thesis: Surakarta: Indonesian Education Study Program, Post Graduate Program, Sebelas Maret University. June 2009. This {{research}} aimed {{to determine the}} correlation between (1) the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation, (2) language attitude and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation, and (3) both the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude together and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. The research was carried out at elementary schools in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri, from January to June 2009. The research method used was descriptive of correlational. The population of the research were the elementary school students in Gugus Yudistira Selogiri Wonogiri. The sample consisted of 120 students who were taken by using simple random sampling. The instruments used for data collection were: test for the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension, test for the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation; and questionary for language attitude. The technique used for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study shows that: (1) {{there is a positive}} correlation between the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (r y 1 =. 87 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18); (2) there is a positive correlation between language attitude and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (r y 2 =. 78 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18; (3) there is a positive correlation between both the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude together and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation (R y. 12 =. 86 at the level of significance α =. 05 with N = 120 where rt =. 18). The above results show that both the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and language attitude simultaneously give significant contribution to the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. It means that both variables could be good predictors for the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. The analysis also indicates that the correlation between the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation is stronger than that language attitude and the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation. It means that the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension be considered a better predictor for the <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> short story appreciation than language attitude. Consequently, the teacher should {{pay more attention to the}} <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> reading comprehension than the other aspect [...] - language attitude [...] - in improving short story appreciation class...|$|R
