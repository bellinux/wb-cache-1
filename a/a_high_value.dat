5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred to maintain <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or {{have participated in}} systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the data is thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} data is required.|$|E

5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E

25|$|Others {{believe that}} the {{disagreement}} among Israelis represents rifts and changes within Israeli society. Attorney Dalia Gavriely-Nur, a lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, said that the camp opposing the prisoners deal is holding onto a view of collectivist society, {{in which the individual}} was expected to sacrifice himself for the good of society; the camp supporting the prisoner release is expressing, however, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> on the sanctity of life, that symbolizes a shift to a more privatized society.|$|E
25|$|During {{the colonial}} era, {{distinctive}} forms of Australian art, music, {{language and literature}} developed through movements like the Heidelberg school of painters {{and the work of}} bush balladeers like Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson, whose poetry and prose did much to promote an egalitarian Australian outlook which placed <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> on the concept of mateship. Games like cricket and rugby were imported from Britain at this time and with a local variant of football, Australian Rules Football, became treasured cultural traditions.|$|E

25|$|A {{new series}} of {{banknotes}} had to be printed soon to meet higher security standards. The engravings were executed and designed by Endre Horváth, Hungarian graphic artist. New 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 pengő notes were printed and even a 1000 pengő banknote was added to this series - however, the latter had such <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> that a big proportion of the people hardly ever saw any. This new series had almost the same topic as the previous. On the other hand, the 5 pengő notes were soon replaced with silver coins.|$|E

However, Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858 to 1913), became Corporate Secretary of Standard Oil. As a part owner of Pratt and Company, Rogers, who was about 35 years old, now owned a share of Standard Oil himself. In the deal, Rockefeller had also added Henry Rogers to his team. He undoubtedly placed <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> on Rogers' potential. History does not tell us if he foresaw that the promising young man was destined to become one of his major partners.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{requirements of a}} National Park are {{that it should have}} great natural beauty, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> for open-air recreation and substantial continuous extent.

Lastly there is merit in variety and with the wide diversity of landscape which is available in England and Wales, it would be wrong to confine the selection of National Parks to the more rugged areas of mountain and moorland, and to exclude other districts which, though of less outstanding grandeur and wildness, have their own distinctive beauty and a high recreational value.|$|E
