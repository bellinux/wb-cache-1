The mixing <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems used in existing aircraft cabins create a uniform <b>air</b> temperature <b>distribution</b> and dilute contaminants in the cabins.

To improve the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system design for aircraft cabins, this investigation proposed an under-floor displacement <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system and a personalized <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system. This study first validated a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program with the experimental data of airflow, air temperature, and tracer-gas concentration from an environmental chamber.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{capabilities}} and accuracy of two publicly available underfloor <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> (UFAD) design tools (ASHRAE RP- 1522 and CBE). The comparison is based on the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> models, diffuser types, ability to predict the design cooling load, supply plenum heat balance, temperature profile and setpoint, plenum configuration, and <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> effectiveness. A combined database is fed into each tool’s <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> model to assess their accuracy. The results show the RP- 1522 model predicts thermal stratification slightly more accurately than the CBE model in cases using swirl and square diffusers, but both results are comparably accurate for design purposes. The CBE UFAD tool has the key advantage of being able to predict the UFAD cooling load and model four different plenum configurations and both interior and perimeter zones.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>distribution</b> {{systems are}} one of the major {{electrical}} energy consumers in air-conditioned commercial buildings which maintain comfortable indoor thermal environment and air quality by supplying specified amounts of treated air into different zones. The sizes of <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines affect energy efficiency of the distribution systems. Equal friction and static regain are two well-known approaches for sizing the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines. Concerns to life cycle cost of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, T and IPS methods have been developed. Hitherto, all these methods are based on static design conditions. Therefore, dynamic performance of the system has not been yet addressed; whereas, the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems are mostly performed in dynamic rather than static conditions. Besides, none of the existing methods consider any aspects of thermal comfort and environmental impacts. This study attempts to investigate the existing methods for sizing of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems and proposes a dynamic approach for size optimisation of the <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> lines by taking into account optimisation criteria such as economic aspects, environmental impacts and technical performance. These criteria have been respectively addressed through whole life costing analysis, life cycle assessment and deviation from set-point temperature of different zones. Integration of these criteria into the TRNSYS software produces a novel dynamic optimisation approach for duct sizing. Due to the integration of different criteria into a well- known performance evaluation software, this approach could be easily adopted by designers in busy nature of design. Comparison of this integrated approach with the existing methods reveals that under the defined criteria, system performance is improved up to 15...|$|R

Experimental measurements, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and inverse modeling are state-of-the-art methods available for studying the <b>air</b> <b>distribution.</b> This paper gave an overview of the different experimental models, such as scale models, simplified models, full-scale mockups, and actual air cabins.

40|$|This Strategy Guideline {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} challenges of using a compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system to handle the reduced loads and reduced air volume needed to condition the space within an energy efficient home. Traditional systems sized by 'rule of thumb' (i. e., 1 ton of cooling per 400 ft 2 of floor space) that 'wash' the exterior walls with conditioned air from floor registers cannot provide appropriate air mixing and moisture removal in low-load homes. A compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system locates the HVAC equipment centrally with shorter ducts run to interior walls, and ceiling supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls along the ceiling plane; alternatively, high sidewall supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls. Potential drawbacks include resistance from installing contractors or code officials who are unfamiliar with compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, {{as well as a}} lack of availability of low-cost high sidewall or ceiling supply outlets to meet the low air volumes with good throw characteristics. The decision criteria for a compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system must be determined early in the whole-house design process, considering both supply and return air design. However, careful installation of a compact <b>air</b> <b>distribution</b> system can result in lower material costs from smaller equipment, shorter duct runs, and fewer outlets; increased installation efficiencies, including ease of fitting the system into conditioned space; lower loads on a better balanced HVAC system, and overall improved energy efficiency of the home...|$|R
