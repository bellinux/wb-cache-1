5|$|To date, little {{scientific}} data {{is available to}} <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of cat predation on prey populations. Even well-fed domestic cats may hunt and kill, mainly catching small mammals, but also birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, and invertebrates. Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to {{the decline in the}} numbers of birds in urban areas, although the importance of this effect remains controversial. In the wild, the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction. In many cases, controlling or eliminating the populations of non-native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals. However, the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated. For example, cats can control the numbers of rats, which also prey on birds' eggs and young, so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing mesopredators.|$|E

25|$|Management and {{regulation}} are lacking in many fisheries today. Management measures are urgently needed to monitor fisheries (and illegal fisheries) to protect cetaceans.

25|$|The {{most serious}} {{consequence}} of untreated OSA {{is to the}} heart. Persons with sleep apnea have a 30% higher {{risk of heart attack}} or death than those unaffected. In severe and prolonged cases, increased in pulmonary pressures are transmitted to {{the right side of the}} heart. This can result in a severe form of congestive heart failure known as cor pulmonale. Dyastolic function of the heart also becomes affected. One prospective study showed patients with OSA, compared with healthy controls, initially had statistically significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (P=.003) and significantly lower levels of nitrite-nitrate (P=.008), which might be pathogenic factors in the cardiovascular complications of OSA. These factors reversed to normal levels after 12 weeks of treatment by CPAP, but further long-term trials are needed to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of this therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} Indian laws on female {{foeticide}} and its enforcement is unclear. United Nations Population Fund and India's National Human Rights Commission, in 2009, asked the Government of India to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the law. The Public Health Foundation of India, an premier research organization in its 2010 report, claimed {{a lack of}} awareness about the Act in parts of India, inactive role of the Appropriate Authorities, ambiguity among some clinics that offer prenatal care services, {{and the role of}} a few medical practitioners in disregarding the law. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has targeted education and media advertisements to reach clinics and medical professionals to increase awareness. The Indian Medical Association has undertaken efforts to prevent prenatal sex selection by giving its members Beti Bachao (save the daughter) badges during its meetings and conferences. However, a recent study by Nandi and Deolalikar (2013) argues that the 1994 PNDT Act may have had a small impact by preventing 106,000 female foeticides over one decade.|$|E

City residents filed a public interest petition to the Supreme Court of India against the felling of 'heritage' trees in the Siri Fort area to make way for Games facilities. The court appointed architect Charles Correa to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> and he severely criticised the designs on ecological grounds. In spite of this, in April 2009 the Supreme Court allowed the construction on the grounds that [...] "much time had been lost" [...] and [...] "the damage already caused to the environment could not be undone".|$|E

The spokesman, Bill Kyriakopoulos, said grade separation at Murrumbeena [...] "was not being considered as a long-term solution".|$|E

Although the rooftop is not normally accessible to the public, it is visually accessible from 33 taller buildings in the area. The garden consists of 20,000 plants of more than 150 species, including shrubs, vines and two trees. The green roof design team was headed by the Chicago area firm Conservation Design Forum in conjunction with noted [...] "green" [...] architect William McDonough. With an abundance of flowering plants on the rooftop, beekeepers harvest approximately [...] of honey each year from hives installed on the rooftop.

2500|$|There is {{some recent}} {{research}} which tries to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the Internet on profitability. It remains unclear what the total effect of computerization {{is on the}} relationship between investments and profits. Some argue that, in reality, computerization by itself does not alter the cost structure of products very much. Others argue, that computerization both enables a much faster turnover of capital, with great productivity gains and fewer employees, and permits entrepreneurs to set up business with computers at a much lower start-up cost than before. Perhaps the main effect of the internet relevant to business is that it has gigantically enlarged the possibilities for market access on a global scale: businesses set up for internet sales can reach vastly more customers in much less time. [...] The proof of that is, that purchases via the internet have constantly increased, often at the expense of ordinary street shops. One of the analytical problems is that the relative importance of computers, and their potential financial impact, differs considerably between different kinds of business.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1966, {{six months}} before the National Register of Historic Places was created, the National Park Service's history {{research}} programs had been centralized into the office of Robert M. Utley, NPS chief historian, in Washington, D.C., as part of an overall plan dubbed [...] "MISSION 66." [...] On October 15, 1966, the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding State Historic Preservation Offices. Initially the National Register consisted of those National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation as well as any other historic sites within the National Park system. The passage of the act, which was amended in 1980, represented the first time the United States had a broad based historic preservation policy. While the National Register did not provide specific protection to listed properties it did require federal agencies to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of activities on buildings and properties listed or eligible for listing on the NRHP. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{research}} programs were {{implemented in the}} U.S. to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of medical helicopters on mortality and morbidity in the civilian arena. Project CARESOM was established in Mississippi in 1969. Three helicopters were purchased through a federal grant and located strategically in the north, central, and southern areas of the state. [...] Upon termination of the grant, the program was considered a success {{and each of the}} three communities was given the opportunity to continue the helicopter operation. [...] Only the one located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi did so, and it was therefore established as the first civilian air medical program in the United States. The second program, the Military Assistance to Safety and Traffic (MAST) system, was established in Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio in 1969. This was an experiment by the Department of Transportation to study the feasibility of using military helicopters to augment existing civilian emergency medical services. [...] These programs were highly successful at establishing the need for such services. [...] The remaining challenge was in how such services could be operated most cost-effectively. [...] In many cases, as agencies, branches, and departments of the civilian governments began to operate aircraft for other purposes, these aircraft were frequently pressed into service to provide cost-effective air support to the evolving Emergency Medical Services.|$|E
