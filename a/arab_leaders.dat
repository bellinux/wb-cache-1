5|$|In {{the broader}} Arab world, the {{declaration}} {{was seen as}} a betrayal of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs. The Sharif of Mecca and other <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> considered the declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence in exchange for launching the Arab Revolt.|$|E
5|$|As the {{conflict}} raged, other Arab governments attempted {{to negotiate a}} peaceful resolution. As part of this effort, Gamal Abdel Nasser led the first emergency Arab League summit in Cairo on 21 September. Arafat's speech drew sympathy from attending <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders.</b> Other heads of state took sides against Hussein, among them Muammar Gaddafi, who mocked him and his schizophrenic father King Talal. A ceasefire was agreed upon between the two sides, but Nasser died of a massive heart attack hours after the summit, and {{the conflict}} resumed shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world. He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of the Arab world, bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders.</b> The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.|$|E

5|$|Sallal's {{popularity}} among his troops declined, and after two bazooka attacks {{on his home}} by disaffected soldiers, he took Egyptian guards. He ordered the execution of his security chief, Colonel Abdel Kader Khatari, after Khatari's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San'a, and had refused to recognize the committee of <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms. He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one, installing three army men in key ministries, and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself. Meanwhile, Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt {{for more than a}} year, and who were in favor of peace with the royalists. The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and General Amri. When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November, Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile. Sallal refused and went to Baghdad, hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists. As soon as he left Cairo, Nasser sent a cable to San'a, instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup.|$|E

25|$|On April 8, 1933, Arlosoroff {{organized}} a historic {{event at the}} King David Hotel in Jerusalem on the Jewish Agency's behalf. The luncheon, attended by Weizmann and prominent <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> of Transjordan, {{would be the first}} time Jewish Zionists and key Arabs gathered together to help promote cooperative efforts between the two groups. Arlosoroff hoped that by building an accord with the Arab sheiks of Transjordan, political relations with <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> of Mandatory Palestine might be enhanced. However, not everyone was pleased with Arlosoroff's vision for Jewish/Arab collaboration, nor the possibility of a bi-nationalistic future in Eretz Israel. After the luncheon, Arab radicals openly chastised the moderate Arabs who had attended the meeting. Certain <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> in Mandatory Palestine distanced themselves completely from the Transjordanian Arab delegation. Particular anger was directed at Transjordan's Emir Abdullah, the ruler over large territories in Transjordan, who had taken {{a leading role in the}} conciliation efforts. Jewish opposition to the King David Hotel meeting also became apparent as the major party of religious Zionism, Mizrachi, demanded that Arlosoroff should resign from his position at the Jewish Agency. Some radicals in the Revisionist movement went even further and questioned Arlosoroff's right to be alive.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Israël de Haan (31 December 1881 – 30 June 1924) was a Dutch Jewish {{literary}} writer, jurist {{and journalist}} who {{was assassinated in}} Jerusalem by the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah for his anti-Zionist political activities and contacts with <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early January the Haganah adopted Operation Zarzir, {{a scheme}} to assassinate leaders {{affiliated}} to Amin al-Husayni, placing the blame on other <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders,</b> but in practice few resources were devoted to the project and the only attempted killing was of Nimr al Khatib.|$|E

50|$|Abu Maatouk {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} of Abu Zayd al-Hilali, an epic TV series {{based on the}} life of the 11th-century <b>Arab</b> <b>leader</b> which was first shown on Abu Dhabi TV in 2004.|$|R
25|$|The war in Iraq saw Abu Dhabi TV mature into a {{credible}} Al-Jazeera rival. However, the war did not benefit Al-Arabiya, the newest of Arabic news networks. Created by the Saudi audio-visual group MBC {{to compete with}} Al-Jazeera (whose tone often displeases <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders),</b> Al-Arabiya was launched on February 19, 2003.|$|E
25|$|One {{result of}} the ambitions of the various <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> was a {{distrust}} of all the Palestinian leaders who wished {{to set up a}} Palestinian state, and a mutual distrust of each other. Co-operation was to be very poor during the war between the various Palestinian factions and the Arab armies.|$|E
25|$|Both the Arab {{reports and}} Jewish {{responses}} had hidden motives: the <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> wanted to encourage Palestinian Arabs to fight rather than surrender, {{to discredit the}} Zionists with international opinion, and to increase popular support in their countries for an invasion of Palestine. The Jewish leaders wanted to discredit Irgun and Lehi.|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 Mayhew offered £5,000 {{to anyone}} who could produce {{evidence}} that Nasser had stated that he sought to [...] "drive the Jews into the sea". Mayhew repeated the offer later in the House of Commons (Hansard, 18 October 1973) and broadened it to include any genocidal statement by an <b>Arab</b> <b>leader</b> (The Guardian, 9 September 1974), while reserving for himself {{the right to be}} the arbiter of the authenticity of any purported statements as well as their meaning. Mayhew received several letters from claimants, each one producing one quotation or another from an <b>Arab</b> <b>leader,</b> all of which Mayhew deemed to be fabricated.|$|R

25|$|<b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> {{and governments}} {{rejected}} {{the plan of}} partition in the resolution and {{indicated that they would}} reject any other plan of partition. The Arab states' delegations declared immediately after the vote for partition {{that they would not be}} bound by the decision, and walked out accompanied by the Indian and Pakistani delegates.|$|E
25|$|The Plan was {{accepted}} by the Jewish Agency for Palestine, despite its perceived limitations. <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> and governments rejected it and indicated an unwillingness to accept any form of territorial division, arguing that it violated the principles of national self-determination in the UN Charter which granted people {{the right to decide}} their own destiny.|$|E
25|$|Once again, Ismail Safwat {{called for}} the {{immediate}} deployment of the Arab state armies at the borders of Palestine, and for the need {{to go beyond the}} established policy of participating in little more than small-scale raids towards taking part in large-scale operations. For the first time, the <b>Arab</b> <b>leaders</b> discussed the possibility of intervening in Palestine.|$|E
25|$|In 682, Uqba ibn Nafi reassumed command. He {{defeated}} {{an alliance}} of Berber forces near Tahirt (Algeria), then proceeded westward in military triumph, eventually reaching the Atlantic coast, where he lamented at before him {{there was no more}} land to conquer for Islam. Episodes from his campaigns became legend throughout the Maghrib. Yet the Berber leader held prisoner, Kusaila, escaped. Later Kusaila led a fresh Berber uprising, which interrupted the conquest and claimed the <b>Arab</b> <b>leader's</b> life. Kusaila then formed an enlarged Berber kingdom. Yet Zuhair b. Qais, the deputy of the fallen <b>Arab</b> <b>leader,</b> enlisted Zanata tribes from Cyrenaica to fight for the cause of Islam, and in 686 managed to overturn Kusaila's newly formed kingdom.|$|R
