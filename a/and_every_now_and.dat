60|$|Harry {{proceeded}} to obey, Raeburn watching him, <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation, abstracting another jewel from the secretary's share, and adding {{it to his}} own.|$|E

60|$|Blushing, smiling, bowing, {{constrained}} {{from the}} novelty of his situation, <b>and</b> yet <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then quite at ease when his ear recalled a familiar voice, dear Mr. Glastonbury was gratified and happy.

60|$|Mrs. Parsons {{went up to}} her son, by whom sat the Colonel, {{looking at}} him wistfully. James lay on his back, {{breathing}} quickly, dull, listless, <b>and</b> apathetic. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then his dark dry lips contracted as the unceasing pain of his head became suddenly almost insufferable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno {{what to make}} of 'im. Looks to me for all {{the world}} like an 'alf-tame leopard." [...] <b>And</b> <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then a Forsyte would come up, sidle round, and take a look at him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said sadly, and listened. Basil's voice {{certainly}} was sounding above us, {{and not by}} any means in the rich and riotous tones in which he had hailed us before.

60|$|His manner {{all through}} this strange {{conversation}} {{had been very}} unlike what it usually was.

60|$|Conversation was {{a little}} difficult, though Mr. Sabin {{showed no signs of}} an {{impaired}} appetite.
