5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.|$|E

5|$|A {{recession}} in the 1930s was halted by increasing international tensions as World War II loomed; Sheffield's steel factories were set to work manufacturing weapons and <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the war effort. As a result, the city became a target for bombing raids, the heaviest of which occurred on the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940, {{now known as the}} Sheffield Blitz. More than 660lives were lost and many buildings destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of sea trials which began in 2014 the USS Zumwalt was officially commissioned into the US Navy on October 15, 2016 at Baltimore, Maryland. However, in November, 2016 the principal and only <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the Zumwalt's two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems, the Long Range Land Attack Projectile, was cancelled due to increased costs. USS Zumwalt is currently assigned to the US Pacific Fleet and is homeported in San Diego, California.|$|E
5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft <b>ammunition,</b> <b>for</b> which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.|$|E

5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E
5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 {{feet into the air}} and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of the}} French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} the Japanese {{had opened up}} with the artillery that they had brought up {{in support of the}} main defensive position on Tsimba Ridge, firing {{for the first time in}} the sector. This barrage was largely ineffective, inflicting only one casualty, as many of the shells proved to be faulty and did not detonate. The Australians also came across a large camp, including a field hospital, which they captured intact. Another group of huts was also discovered, from where they gained intelligence identifying the Japanese troops in the area as belonging to the 81st Infantry Regiment. They also managed to capture two 70mm guns, and <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E

5|$|East of the NK and ROK 8th Divisions, the NK 12th Division {{crossed the}} Naktong River at Andong, {{moving through the}} {{mountains}} in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. The division was far under strength {{and at least one}} of its artillery batteries had to send its guns back north because it had no <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> them. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division {{would be able to do}} this effectively, and thus was unprepared when its forces infiltrated the region so heavily.|$|E
5|$|Europeans would sail to the West African {{coast and}} trade African kings {{manufactured}} goods (rifles and <b>ammunition)</b> <b>for</b> slave. From there slaves {{would be sent}} to the West Indies or the east coast of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E

5|$|In August 1863, {{as part of}} {{his duties}} as aide-de-camp to General Barnard, Alexander was named {{as a member of a}} board of {{military}} officers who would examine the defenses of Washington and suggest improvements as needed. The board, created by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton, was designed to replace a civilian board that he had created in 1862. In a November 1863 meeting, this board recommended final allotments of guns and <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the forts protecting Washington, D.C., thus establishing the number of guns that would be in place during the Battle of Fort Stevens eight months later.|$|E
5|$|In Metroid Prime Hunters, the Nintendo DS's top screen shows Samus's HUD as {{seen from}} her visor, which {{displays}} the amount of remaining <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the currently selected weapon along with her health; in multiplayer games, the number of kills and time remaining in the round are also shown. The bottom touchscreen displays the radar. When using the default control scheme, movement is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by dragging the stylus along the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the castle is the keep, which has an {{external}} diameter of , an octagonal lower storey and circular walls on the upper levels. Originally this held accommodation for the captain and the garrison, but it was heavily redeveloped in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its exterior walls have eight recesses at ground level, originally used to store <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the castle's guns. The basement of the keep was redesigned in the 1890s, when electrical generators were installed, protected by a new, thicker, concrete ceiling. It may originally have been vaulted in stone in a similar style to nearby Hurst Castle.|$|E

5|$|It was {{designed}} to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
5|$|PiÅ‚sudski's arch-rival Roman Dmowski, {{traveled}} to Japan, where he argued against PiÅ‚sudski's plan, endeavoring {{to discourage the}} Japanese government from supporting at this time a Polish revolution which Dmowski felt would be doomed to failure. Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain PiÅ‚sudski's political arch-enemy {{to the end of}} PiÅ‚sudski's life. In the end, the Japanese offered PiÅ‚sudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the PPS and its combat organisation, while the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons {{which can be}} collected and freely switched by players throughout the game and require no reloading. Weapons that are recurrent throughout the series make a return, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity but is extremely powerful. Similarly, the chainsaw returns but has been reintroduced as a special-use weapon that relies upon fuel, but {{can be used to}} instantly cut through enemies and provide a greater-than-normal drop of <b>ammunition</b> <b>for</b> the player.|$|E
