However, she got divorced and was subsequently ostracized by her family and community when they discovered she was homosexual. The film shows her visiting her old neighborhood and an Orthodox fair.|$|E

A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of oral cancer, emphysema, and ultimately lung cancer, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{viewed the}} {{tradition}} of wives abandoning their own surname to assume that of their husbands {{as a manifestation of}} the legal annihilation of a married woman’s identity. Immediately after her marriage, with the agreement of her husband, she continued to sign correspondence as “Lucy Stone” or “Lucy Stone – only.” But during the summer, Blackwell tried to register the deed for property Stone purchased in Wisconsin, and the registrar insisted she sign it as “Lucy Stone Blackwell.” The couple consulted Blackwell’s friend, Salmon P. Chase, a Cincinnati lawyer and future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, who was not immediately able to answer their question about the legality of her name. So while continuing to sign her name as Lucy Stone in private correspondence, for eight months she signed her name as Lucy Stone Blackwell on public documents and <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be so identified in convention proceedings and newspaper reports. But upon receiving assurance from Chase that no law required a married woman to change her name, Stone made a public announcement at the May 7, 1856, convention of the American Anti-Slavery Society in Boston that her name remained Lucy Stone. In 1879, when Boston women were granted the franchise in school elections, Stone registered to vote. But officials notified her that she {{would not be allowed to}} vote unless she added “Blackwell” to her signature. This she refused to do, and because her time and energy were consumed with suffrage work, she did not challenge the action in a court of law.|$|E

25|$|In May 1839, he {{was offered}} another chance to form a government, this time by the new monarch, Queen Victoria. However, this too {{would have been a}} {{minority}} government, and Peel felt he needed a further sign of confidence from his Queen. Lord Melbourne had been Victoria's confidant since her accession in 1837, and many of the higher posts in Victoria's household were held by the wives and female relatives of Whigs; there was some feeling that Victoria had <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be too closely associated with the Whig party. Peel therefore asked that some of this entourage be dismissed and replaced with their Conservative counterparts, provoking the so-called Bedchamber Crisis. Victoria refused to change her household, and despite pleadings from the Duke of Wellington, relied on assurances of support from Whig leaders. Peel refused to form a government, and the Whigs returned to power.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E

500|$|A Billboard {{reviewer}} praised [...] "What Now" [...] {{and called}} the song an [...] "emotional highlight on an album filled with moments of resonance in its second half." [...] Giovanny Caquias of Culture Blues wrote that the song feels like the first [...] "candid" [...] and [...] "insightful" [...] track on Unapologetic. He continued, [...] "Rihanna gets a little introspective on What Now, and doesn’t resort to being overtly sexual or defiantly callous (more on that later), which gave me the feeling that she stripped away her armor {{for a moment and}} actually <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be 'real'." [...] Daily News Jim Farber wrote that the song shows a heft.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates {{the story of}} a failed {{relationship}} which initially started off well. Clarkson regrets having <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be vulnerable to her ex-boyfriend and she is determined that despite the pain that she feels, he will not get the satisfaction of seeing her cry. Michael Paoletta of Billboard praised Clarkson's vocal, writing [...] "Clarkson simply delivers a loose, tour-de-force vocal that simmers alongside a steroid-charged musical backdrop that is fun, fast and furious." [...] Scott Juba of The Trade praised the production of the song, writing [...] "The song’s strong hook pulls listeners in and involves them in the lyrics without ever becoming gimmicky or manipulative." [...] He also complimented Clarkson's vocal which [...] "oscillates between pain and defiance with near pinpoint accuracy." ...|$|E

500|$|Krause {{deemed the}} revelation of Adele's moving on [...] "an {{interesting}} twist, with unexpected repercussions", whereas Stevens' offering Bailey the money to open the free clinic, was negatively reviewed; looked upon as the most predictable event of the episode. Krause noted that both medical cases were confusing, assessing that [...] "it {{would have been nice}} {{to learn more about the}} severe dehydration that caused the runner's legs to swell." [...] In addition, Krause explained how the Amish angle was unexpected, but significantly helpful to the entertainment level, while a lack of realism in the medical case was highlighted: [...] "No one bothered to really mention that it would have been nice, had it been caught earlier. It was, but she <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> deteriorate." [...] The fight between Grey and Shepherd was deemed [...] "a tiff that Derek was entirely responsible for", but also a proof of [...] "how damaged Meredith really is". Krause expressed disappointment in the storyline involving O'Malley proposing to Torres: [...] "Callie certainly didn't look thrilled. If she believes George is proposing as a means to get over his grief, she's probably right and should likely run in the opposite direction." [...] Considering each of the attending physcians' chances of becoming the chief of surgery, Krause noted the possibility of Sloan being chosen as [...] "hilarious, but a tad unbelievable", whereas assessing that Montgomery's [...] "great traits" [...] might suffer, due to her relationship with Karev, which was described as [...] "certainly bringing into question her ability to stay on the straight and narrow". Krause characterized the whole as [...] "one of those guilty pleasures that many may not admit to".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Australian {{producer}} Ian Collie {{produced a}} documentary film on P. L. Travers titled The Shadow of [...] "Mary Poppins". During the documentary's production, Collie {{noticed that there}} was [...] "an obvious biopic there" [...] and convinced Essential Media and Entertainment to develop a feature film with Sue Smith writing the screenplay. The project {{attracted the attention of}} BBC Films, which decided to finance the project, and Ruby Films' Alison Owen, who subsequently hired Kelly Marcel to co-write the screenplay with Smith. Marcel's drafts removed a subplot involving Travers and her son, and divided the story into a two-part narrative: the creative conflict between Travers and Walt Disney, and her dealings with her childhood issues, describing it as [...] "a story about the pain of a little girl who suffered, and the grown woman who <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> let go". Marcel's version, however, featured certain intellectual property rights of music and imagery which would be impossible to use without permission from The Walt Disney Company. [...] "There was always that elephant in the room, which is Disney," [...] Collie recalled. [...] "We knew Walt Disney was a key character in the film and we wanted to use quite a bit of the music. We knew we'd eventually have to show Disney." [...] In early 2010, Robert B. Sherman provided producer Alison Owen with an advance copy of a salient chapter from his then upcoming book release, [...] [...] The chapter entitled, [...] "'Tween Pavement and Stars" [...] contained characterizations and anecdotes which proved seminal to Marcel's script rewrite, in particular, the anecdote about there not being the color red in London. In July 2011, while attending the Ischia Film Festival, Owen met with Corky Hale, who offered to present the screenplay to Richard M. Sherman. Sherman read the screenplay and gave the producers his support. Later that year, Marcel and Smith's screenplay was listed in Franklin Leonard's The Black List, voted by producers {{as one of the best}} screenplays that were not in production.|$|E
500|$|... is a Pulsian seeress hailing {{from the}} {{city-state}} of Paddra on Gran Pulse {{prior to the}} time of the War of Transgression, having written Analects relating to the event, Etro, Ragnarok, and the Eidolons. In the novel Fragments After, it is shown that Yeul was the first human created, and that for some unknown reason her soul does not fade after reaching the afterlife. Taking pity on her, Etro gives Yeul the ability to see the future, called the Eyes of Etro, and enables her to be continuously reincarnated throughout history. Though meant for the best, Yeul's ability to see the future becomes a curse, since each vision drains her lifeforce and she consequently always dies in her teens. Because of her fate, Caius Ballad, who had seen each Yeul live and die since before the War of Transgression, makes it his goal to destroy Etro and end time itself so Yeul would no longer die. Despite this, Yeul remains supportive of Noel and Serah's quest, and it is later revealed that she <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be reborn in order to be with Caius. Only one manifestation of Yeul is openly hostile towards the travelers and resentful of her fate. In Lightning Returns, the many versions of Yeul take up residence in the ruins of Etro's temple, with Caius as their guardian. It is revealed that Yeul's constant reincarnation caused her soul to fragment, with each previous life mingled with the Chaos and triggered the events of XIII-2. As the world ends, the souls of Yeul choose to stay and become the new goddess of death to restore the cycle of life Etro established. The final incarnation, who shares a strong bond with Noel and wishes for a new life, is allowed to leave and live as a normal human. Yeul is voiced by Amber Hood in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese.|$|E

She seemed to have enjoyed a rather wild life at the court of Caligula and according to Suetonius, she, along with Agrippina, <b>allowed</b> <b>herself</b> <b>to</b> be prostituted by her brother to his catamites.
