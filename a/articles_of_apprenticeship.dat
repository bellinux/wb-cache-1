30|$|The {{discussion}} {{over the}} lack <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> and the confirmed insufficient level of willingness {{on the part}} of enterprises in Germany to provide apprenticeship training provided the point of departure for this paper. It is stressed that analyses of the number <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> on offer are usually based on aggregated cross-sectional data for specific reference dates. However, comparisons of cross-sectional data over time can only shed light on general trends in vocational training participation. They do not however tell us anything about the overall dynamics. Consequently the aim {{of this paper is to}} analyse at company level the changes seen in the number <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> on offer.|$|R
30|$|Different {{models for}} panel {{regressions}} {{were calculated for}} the years 1999 to 2008. Being the most suitable model, the instrumental variable estimation approach from Hausman and Taylor was used for this. Pronounced effects on {{the change in the}} number <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> arose during the period under review particularly due to a marked correlation between the employment of qualified skilled workers and the number <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> on offer. Positive and negative changes in the stocks of skilled workers/specialist salaried employees with recognised vocational qualification led to corresponding responses {{on the part of the}} individual enterprises in their recruitment of young skilled workers through the provision <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> training.|$|R
30|$|The {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeship</b> training by firms largely {{depends on}} economic factors, {{such as the}} costs and benefits associated with training apprentices during the training period, but also on the expected benefits that arise after the training period. Based on existing empirical evidence on the provision <b>of</b> dual <b>apprenticeship</b> programmes, the functioning <b>of</b> an <b>apprenticeship</b> system per se is not limited to specific labour market institutions. However, a balanced cost-benefit ratio during the training period is more important for a firm located in countries or regions {{with a high degree of}} labour market competition, ensuring that the provision <b>of</b> <b>apprenticeships</b> remains an attractive strategy.|$|R
