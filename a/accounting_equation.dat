25|$|To {{determine}} whether one must debit or credit a specific account we use either the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation</b> approach {{which consists of}} five accounting rules or the traditional approach based on three rules (for Real accounts, Personal accounts, and Nominal accounts) to {{determine whether}} to debit or to credit an account.|$|E

50|$|One line of {{argument}} {{is to use the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>equations</b> in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) to say that, as a matter of accounting, government spending must come from somewhere, and thus has no net impact on aggregate demand, unemployment, or income.|$|R
50|$|That is, NIPA <b>accounting</b> <b>equations</b> {{hold for}} a fixed GDP: the point of fiscal {{stimulus}} is to change GDP, and that changes in government spending are only exactly offset by decreases in other spending or investment if GDP is unchanged. Keynesians argue that fiscal stimulus can increase GDP, thus making this point moot.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{accounting}} sense, assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts, {{because they are}} typically shown on the left-hand side of the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation</b> (A=L+SE/OE). Likewise, an increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are recorded {{on the right-hand side}} (credit) of those accounts {{in order to maintain the}} balance of the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation.</b> This means if [...] "assets are increased with left-hand entries, the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation</b> is balanced only if increases in liabilities and owner’s equity are recorded on the opposite or right-hand side. Conversely, decreases in assets are recorded on the right-hand side of asset accounts, and decreases in liabilities and equity are recorded on the left-hand side". Similar is the case with revenues and expenses, what increases shareholder's equity is recorded as credit because they are in the right side of equation and vice-versa.|$|E

2500|$|A {{business}} will most often {{have more than}} one asset account. An essential asset account in any business is the business's bank account (see: [...] "Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements" [...] below for more examples) The same applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources (called creditors or payables), then I must open two accounts to represent this present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income and equity/capital (see extended <b>accounting</b> <b>equation).</b> This is the extent of [...] "my" [...] business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices (the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.). With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position of my business at any time (my success, failure, or any other attributes that I might need to know).|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} is {{also called the}} American approach. Under this approach transactions are recorded based on the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation,</b> i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital. The <b>accounting</b> <b>equation</b> is a statement of equality between the debits and the credits. The rules of debit and credit depend {{on the nature of}} an account. For the purpose of the <b>accounting</b> <b>equation</b> approach, all the accounts are classified into the following five types: assets, liabilities, income/revenues, expenses, or capital gains/losses.|$|E

This then allows them to predict future profit trends and adjust business practices accordingly.

The appropriate rates and 'at-risk' populations are introduced as a preliminary to developing the equations of the account-based model.

In the non-tradeable sector, excess demand creates excess employment and inflation via the Phillips curve, while in the tradeable sector much of the excess demand is absorbed by the trade balance. We set up an unobserved-components model including both a Phillips curve and a current <b>account</b> <b>equation</b> to estimate 'sustainable output' for 45 countries.
