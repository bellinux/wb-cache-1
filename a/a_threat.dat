5|$|In the northwest, the Fan {{fire started}} on June 25 and was {{originally}} considered <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> {{to the town}} of Gardiner, Montana, just outside the park's north entrance. It was the most successfully fought of all the 1988 fires. Though the fire was not contained for a couple of months, by mid-August it was no longer considered <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to lives and property.|$|E
5|$|Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, {{were not}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to the Puerto Rican parrot {{population}} {{when it was}} more readily self-maintaining, {{but as a result}} of the fragmentation and reduction of the population these disasters are now <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> as well. Hurricane Hugo passed through the species' range in September 1989, and reduced the population from 47 to 23 individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> by cattle ranchers {{due to its}} predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. The bird is also considered <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> {{to the safety of}} aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps—as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport.|$|E
50|$|Males vocalize {{through a}} bark or whimper, either <b>a</b> gluttural <b>threat,</b> <b>a</b> low-intensity <b>threat,</b> <b>a</b> full <b>threat,</b> or <b>a</b> {{submissive}} call. Females growl and {{also have a}} high-pitched pup attraction wail call.|$|R

5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (<b>a</b> <b>threat</b> that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} represents <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to biodiversity in Croatia, as {{developed and}} agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity {{is the introduction}} of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was {{established}} to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets.

5000|$|Moreover, the {{securitization}} act, to be successful, must {{be accepted}} by the audience, regardless of the subject matter being <b>a</b> real <b>threat.</b> <b>As</b> Thierry Braspenning-Balzacq puts it: [...] "securitization is a rule-governed practice, the success of which does not necessarily depend on the existence of <b>a</b> real <b>threat,</b> but on the discursive ability to effectively endow a development with such a specific complexion".|$|R
25|$|Fear {{and anxiety}} can be {{differentiated}} in four domains: (1) duration of emotional experience, (2) temporal focus, (3) specificity of the threat, and (4) motivated direction. Fear {{is defined as}} short lived, present focused, geared towards <b>a</b> specific <b>threat,</b> and facilitating escape from threat; anxiety, on the other hand, is defined as long-acting, future focused, broadly focused towards <b>a</b> diffuse <b>threat,</b> and promoting excessive caution while approaching <b>a</b> potential <b>threat</b> and interferes with constructive coping.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the storm's arrival, a class four cyclone alert {{was issued}} for Rodrigues Island. Between March11 and 13, flights {{to and from}} Rodrigues were {{canceled}} due to high winds. In addition, Cyclone Kalunde briefly posed <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> to Mauritius.|$|E

5|$|While the FAN was {{supplied}} {{economically and}} militarily by Sudan and Egypt, Goukouni received the armed support of Kamougué's FAT and Acyl's CDR {{shortly after the}} beginning of the battle, and was provided with Libyan artillery. On 6 June, the FAN assumed control of the city of Faya. This alarmed Goukouni, and he signed, on 15 June, a Treaty of Friendship with Libya. The treaty gave Libya a free hand in Chad, legitimising its presence in that country; the treaty's first article committed the two countries to mutual defence, and <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> against one constituted <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> against the other.|$|E
