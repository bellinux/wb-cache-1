40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{drinking}} water, coagulants - such as aluminium salts - are widely used for precipitation and separation of impurities from raw water. The residual from the process is sludge, which presents a disposal problem. The REAL process is a method for recycling the aluminium from the sludge. In a first step, the aluminium hydroxide is dissolved in sulphuric acid. In a second step, an ultra filtration will separate all suspended matter and large molecules, leaving a concentrate of 15 - 20 % dry solids. The permeate will contain the trivalent aluminium ions together with 30 - 50 % of the organic contaminants. In a third step, by concentrating the permeate in a nano filter, the concentration of aluminium will be high enough to, in a fourth step, be precipitated with potassium sulphate to form a pure crystal: potassium <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The potassium <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate</b> is comparable to standard <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> The process will give a residual in form of a concentrate from the ultra filtration, representing a few per cent of the incoming volume.
