25|$|As of 2011, {{most of the}} U.S. {{car fleet}} was able to run on blends of up to 10% ethanol, and motor vehicle {{manufacturers}} produced vehicles designed to run on more concentrated blends.

These states, particularly Minnesota, had more ethanol usage, and <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> at Washington University, these states accumulated substantial environmental and economic benefits as a result. Florida required ethanol blends as {{of the end of}} 2010, but has since repealed it. Many cities had separate ethanol requirements due to non-attainment of federal air quality standards. In 2007, Portland, Oregon, became the first U.S. city to require all gasoline sold within city limits to contain at least 10% ethanol. Chicago has proposed the idea of mandating E15 in the city limits, while some area gas stations have already begun offering it.|$|E

While claims varied, the official Muslim League Bengal Government estimates of those killed were placed at a conservative 200.

Ghulam Sarwar Hossain, a religious leader who belonged to a local political party dominated by Muslims, was the main organiser of the riot.

2500|$|In 1975 Don Javier abdicated as the Carlist king {{in favor}} of Carlos Hugo and <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>source,</b> he would have {{expelled}} Sixto from Carlism for refusing to recognize the decision. It {{is not clear what}} his view on the commencing Spanish transición was; following the 1976 Montejurra events he lamented the dead, and officially disowned political line of Don Sixto and called for Carlist unity. However, on a private letter, Don Javier claimed that at Montejurra [...] "the Carlists have confronted the revolutionaries", which has been interpreted as the followers of Don Sixto being the real Carlists according to Don Javier. Early March 1977 proved convulsive. On Friday 4th, accompanied by his son Sixto, he was interviewed by the Spanish press and his responses showed Carlist orthodoxy. That same day he issued a declaration certified by a Paris notary objecting to his name being used to legitimize a [...] "grave doctrinal error within Carlism", and implicitly disowned the political line promoted by Carlos Hugo. However in few days Don Javier issued another declaration, certified by a different Paris notary, confirming his oldest son as [...] "my only political successor and head of Carlism". In order to justify the first declaration, Carlos Hugo alerted the police that his father had been abducted by Sixto, an accusation which was denied publicly by Don Javier himself. Then it was Doña Madalena who declared that her husband had been taken by Carlos Hugo from hospital against medical advice and his own will, and that Carlos Hugo had threatened his father to sign the second declaration. Eventually Don Javier was transferred to Switzerland, where he died shortly; the widow blamed the oldest son and 3 daughters for his death.|$|E
