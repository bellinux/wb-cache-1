40|$|The age-response for {{the killing}} of HeLa S 3 cells by X-rays during {{the latter part of}} the {{generation}} cycle has been examined in detail. As synchronous cells move from the G 1 /S boundary through S phase, the relatively high sensitivity of late G 1 cells gradually decreases; minimum sensitivity is reached in mid-S and maintained during the remainder of that phase. The response of cells as they progress from S to the point in G 2 at which they are temporarily arrested by radiation (or by inhibitors of protein synthesis) was measured in populations free of both S phase cells and late G 2 cells that had passed the arrest point: cells retain their high resistance from early G 2 up to the <b>arrest</b> <b>point.</b> The response of G 2 cells that have passed the <b>arrest</b> <b>point</b> before being irradiated was examined by exposing randomly growing cultures to X-rays and collecting cells periodically thereafter, as they entered mitosis. Survival values very close to those of sensitive mitotic cells were found in the 2 h period after irradiation during which unarrested cells continued to reach mitosis. Values typical of lateS/early G 2 were found only after cells that had been arrested began arriving at mitosis. Thus, HeLa S 3 cell undergo an abrupt increase in sensitivity at or near the <b>arrest</b> <b>point.</b> The sensitivity to a second irradiation of cells arrested in G 2 by a conditioning X-ray dose increases rapidly in the early part of the arrest period...|$|E

Using basic principles of biochemical kinetics, we convert network diagrams into sets of ordinary differential equations and then explore their solutions by analytical and computational methods.

40|$|Meiosis in {{mammalian}} females {{is marked}} by two <b>arrest</b> <b>points,</b> at prophase I and metaphase II, which must be tightly regulated {{in order to produce}} a haploid gamete at the time of fertilization. The transition metal zinc has emerged as a necessary and dynamic regulator of the establishment, maintenance, and exit from metaphase II arrest, but the roles of zinc during prophase I arrest are largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms of zinc regulation during the first meiotic arrest. Disrupting zinc availability in the prophase I arrested oocyte by treatment with the heavy metal chelator N,N,N 0,N 0 -tetrakis-(2 pyridylmethyl) -ethylenediamine (TPEN) causes meiotic resumption even in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of meiosis. We further show that the MOS-MAPK pathway mediates zinc-dependent prophase I arrest, as the pathway prematurely activates during TPEN-induced meiotic resumption. Conversely, inhibition of the MOS-MAPK pathway maintains prophase I arrest. While prolonged zinc insufficiency ultimately results in telophase I arrest, early and transient exposure of oocytes to TPEN is sufficient to induce meiotic resumption and bypass the telophase I block, allowing the formation of developmentally competent eggs upon parthenogenetic activation. These results establish zinc as a crucial regulator of meiosis throughout the entirety of oocyte maturation, including the maintenance of and release from the first and second meiotic <b>arrest</b> <b>points.</b> egg, MAPK, meiosis, MOS, oocyte, zin...|$|R

40|$|When protein {{synthesis}} is completely blocked from before fertilization, the sea urchin zygote arrests in first S phase and the paternal centrosome reduplicates multiple times. However, when {{protein synthesis}} is blocked starting in prophase of first mitosis, the zygote divides and the blastomeres arrest in a G 1 -like state. The centrosome inherited from this mitosis duplicates {{only once in}} each blastomere {{for reasons that are}} not understood. The late G 1 rise in cyclin E/cdk 2 kinase activity initiates centrosome duplication in mammalian cells and its activity is needed for centrosome duplication in Xenopus egg extracts. Since the half-time for cyclin E turnover is normally approximately 1 h in sea urchin zygotes, the different behaviors of centrosomes during G 1 and S phase arrests could be due to differential losses of cyclin E and its associated kinase activities at these two <b>arrest</b> <b>points.</b> To better understand the mechanisms that limit centrosome duplication, we characterize the levels of cyclin E and its associated kinase activity at the S phase and G 1 <b>arrest</b> <b>points.</b> We first demonstrate that cyclin E/cdk 2 kinase activity is required for centrosome duplication and reduplication in sea urchin zygotes. Next we find that cyclin E levels and cyclin E/cdk 2 kinase activities are both constitutively and equivalently elevated during both the S phase and G 1 arrests. This indicates that centrosome duplication during the G 1 arrest is limited by a block to reduplication under conditions permissive for duplication. The cytoplasmic conditions of S phase, however, abrogate this block to reduplication...|$|R
40|$|Growth {{arrests of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in early G 1 phase brought by various means were {{classified}} into two types {{according to the}} mode of growth recovery after release of the restraints against growth. The first type, including arrests caused by cdc 25, cdc 33, cdc 35, and ils 1 mutations at the nonpermissive temperature and also by sulfur starvation, showed a subsequent delay in the onset of budding when shifted back to permissive conditions. The length of the delay {{was positively correlated with}} the time that cells had been arrested. The second type, including those caused by cdc 28 and cdc 24 mutations and by alpha factor, did not affect the mode of growth recovery after the shift to permissive conditions irrespective of the time that cell proliferation had been restricted. Growth arrests of the first type seem to allow yeast cells to enter a resting state equivalent to the G 0 state of higher eucaryotes because features of the G 0 shown with lymphocytes and other cultured cells including unusually long delay before the growth recovery (L. H. Augenlicht and R. Baserga, 1974, Exp. Cell Res., 89 : 255 - 262; and Kumagai, J., H. Akiyama, S. Iwashita, H. lida, and I. Yahara, 1981, J.

We have investigated the nature of the second arrest in matured but unfertilized Caenorhabditis elegans embryos using time-lapse imaging of GFP-tubulin or GFP-histone.

40|$|Thymocytes {{from severe}} {{combined}} immune deficient (SCID) mice undergo developmental arrest {{at an early}} stage, before most TCR gene rearrangement. They therefore represent a natural test case to assess those aspects of T cell development that are TCR independent. Multiparameter flow cytometry was {{used to analyze the}} array of immature phenotypes present in the SCID thymus at steady state, as defined by the markers CD 4, CD 5, Sca- 1, NK 1. 1, CD 44, heat-stable antigen (HSA), and IL- 2 R alpha. The results suggest a simple developmental block in SCID mice rather than a program of aberrant differentiation. SCID thymocytes displayed efficient, developmentally regulated functional responses. Approximately 20 - 25 % of the cells, mostly within the IL- 2 R alpha +HSA+CD 44 low fraction, could be induced to express IL- 2. This IL- 2 inducibility was highly dependent on IL- 1 costimulation, in agreement with the behavior of normal immature thymocytes. These results formally demonstrate that competence to express IL- 2 is developed independently of TCR expression or gene rearrangement. Comparison of the response properties of various SCID thymocyte subsets indicated that IL- 2 inducibility is first likely to be acquired at an early (Sca- 1 ++CD 44 ++HSAlow) stage. A later functional transition was revealed by comparing patterns of IL- 2 R alpha regulation in normal and SCID IL- 2 R alpha +HSA+CD 44 low thymocytes. The SCID thymocytes uniformly maintained IL- 2 R alpha expression on in vitro stimulation, whereas only a minority of the normal cells in the corresponding subset could do so unless IL- 1 was also added. The SCID <b>arrest</b> <b>point</b> thus appears to separate the IL- 2 R alpha +HSA+CD 44 low stage into distinct early (TCR independent) and late phases. Normal cells that progress beyond the SCID <b>arrest</b> <b>point</b> appear to lose, rather than gain, competence to make various responses, even before they leave the IL- 2 R alpha +HSA+CD 44 low stage.

40|$|AbstractIn most {{eukaryotic}} cells, DNA replication {{is confined}} to S phase of the cell cycle [1].

This does not, however, exclude an essential S-phase checkpoint function of Pds 1 beyond the early S-phase <b>arrest</b> <b>point</b> of a HU block. Here, we show that Pds 1 p is an essential component of a previously unsuspected checkpoint control system that couples the completion of S phase with mitosis.

Quintilian quite literally believed that an evil man could not be an orator, “for the orator’s aim is to carry conviction, and we trust those only whom we know to be worthy of our trust” (Gwynn, 231). This was quite possibly a reaction to the corrupt and dissolute times in which Quintilian lived; he may have attributed the decline {{in the role of the}} orator to the decline in public morality. Only a man free from vice could concentrate on the exacting study of oratory.

He proceeded to inform De Lima that most of the drug pushers they have arrested had dealings with inmates of the Bilibid. Before the meeting ended, Magalong told her [...] "we have to raid NBP because that is where drug trade is happening." [...] The secretary reportedly responded by saying she will call for an inter-agency meeting.|$|R
