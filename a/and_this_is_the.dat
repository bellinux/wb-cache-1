5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent. It was used from 1867 until 1973 when {{the site was}} largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for the local population. Then Woodlands Road Cemetery was used <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> site of HMS Glatton's Memorial with the graves of one officer and 56 men.|$|E
5|$|Biograph films before 1903 {{were mostly}} actualities (documentary footage of actual persons, places and events), but Sherlock Holmes Baffled {{is an example}} of an early Biograph comedy {{narrative}} film, produced at the company's rooftop studio on Broadway in New York City. According to Christopher Redmond's Sherlock Holmes Handbook, the film was shot on April 26, 1900. Julie McKuras states that the film was released in May of the same year. Despite being in circulation, Sherlock Holmes Baffled was only registered on February 24, 1903, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> date seen on the film's copyright title card. The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a Vitagraph film titled Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom (1905).|$|E

5|$|His {{importance}} had dwindled {{with the}} victory of Agnes and her supporters, and with the accession of Baldwin V, infant son of Sibylla and William of Montferrat. Baldwin was a sickly child and he died the next year. In 1186 he was succeeded by his mother Sibylla and her second husband Guy of Lusignan, ruling jointly. William was probably in failing health by this point. Rudolf Hiestand discovered that the date of William's death was 29 September, but the year was not recorded; whatever the year, {{there was a new}} chancellor in May 1185 and a new archbishop of Tyre by 21 October 1186. Hans E. Mayer concluded that William died in 1186, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> year generally accepted by scholars.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 census, {{over five}} million Canadians {{identified}} themselves {{as a member of}} a visible minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Indigenous peoples are not considered a visible minority under the Employment Equity Act, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> definition that Statistics Canada also uses.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians that these two breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> source of the merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{date of the}} Hutchinson {{massacre}} is not known. The first definitive {{record of}} the occurrence was in John Winthrop's journal, where {{it was the first}} entry made for the month of September, though not dated.

5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for {{track and field}} are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every two years since 1985 <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.|$|E
5|$|The second {{argument}} that Fodor provides {{in favour of}} representational realism involves the processes of thought. This argument touches on {{the relation between the}} representational theory of mind and models of its architecture. If the sentences of Mentalese require unique processes of elaboration then they require a computational mechanism of a certain type. The syntactic notion of mental representations {{goes hand in hand with}} the idea that mental processes are calculations which act only on the form of the symbols which they elaborate. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> computational theory of the mind. Consequently, the defence of a model of architecture based on classic artificial intelligence passes inevitably through a defence of the reality of mental representations.|$|E

5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's {{motion to}} dismiss for lack of Article III {{standing}} and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is {{the current state of}} electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss. Under U.S. law as of July 2012, it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that compensable damages arise. The case remained on the California court's docket as of July 2012.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

5|$|Seaborgium is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium. Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it {{a wide spread of}} talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
5|$|The {{work is not}} a law code {{issued by}} King Henry, but a {{compilation}} of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters then follow, then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural topics are included, such as how summonses to court should be formed, what notices {{need to be made}} before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.|$|E
