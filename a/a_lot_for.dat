5|$|Cisneros {{grew up in}} a well-off {{ranching}} {{family from}} Los Indios, Texas, and was married to David Cisneros, a surgeon from Brownsville. They had five children. She was a well-respected volunteer in the local medical community, and was president of the southern chapter of the Cameron-Willacy Counties Medical Society. The association where she volunteered helped raise funds for medical scholarships. In addition, people close to Cisneros said she was a practicing Catholic and that she cared <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> her family. She volunteered at St. Joe, and was well-liked in the social group she was part of. Since Los Indios was mostly a ranching community close to the U.S.-Mexico border, Cisneros's religiosity was heavily influenced by curanderismo, a practice of religious and folk medicine healing rooted in ancient Mexican culture.|$|E

The business developed rapidly, and already in 1907 the men bought <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> larger premises in Aura riverside close to Korppolaismäki. They invested heavily on facilities; in 1909 the works covered a two-floor brickhouse with a forging shop, assembly shop, boiler room, wood drying room and galvanising shop. The boats were built in a large boathouse and launched on two slipways. The main building was for offices and material stock, which was in two floors total 1270 m².

500|$|The company reformulated the BK Broiler in 1998 into a larger, more male-oriented {{sandwich}} {{served on}} a Whopper bun, increasing its patty size while changing the ingredients to mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. The idea behind the up-sizing of the product was to give the customer a sense of value, with a company spokesman stating [...] "When they [...] see a lot, it seems like they're getting <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> their money, {{and even if they}} don't eat it all, they think they're being treated fairly."

500|$|Lead singer Chester Bennington {{arrived late}} in the {{recording}} process of the album, having been chosen to replace Scott Weiland in the band Stone Temple Pilots, and then proceeded to record High Rise and tour with the band for most of 2013.

Bennington stated in an interview with Kerrang!: [...] "Mike wrote tons while I was touring with Stone Temple Pilots last year.

500|$|The {{price of}} VVVVVV {{when it was}} {{originally}} released was $15. [...] This was seen by McWhertor as being the game's [...] "one unfortunate barrier" [...] to entry: [...] "While there's plenty to see and do after blazing through the game's core campaign, the steeper than expected asking price will probably turn some off." [...] Likewise, Gillen wrote in his review that the cost [...] "does strike you as <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> an Indie lo-fi platformer", while insisting that [...] "it is worth the money". [...] Since its original release, the price of VVVVVV {{has been reduced to}} $5.

500|$|Finnessey {{was born}} to Patrick and Linda Finnessey, and {{she grew up in}} Florissant, Missouri.

Finnessey recounted that she [...] "had a mullet, tinted glasses, acne and braces." [...] The teasing made it difficult for her to focus on her studies, so for her junior year she transferred to the private all-girls Incarnate Word Academy, where she graduated in 1996. She completed a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology from Lindenwood University in December 1999. Following graduation, she worked briefly as a full-time substitute teacher in Jackson, Missouri, before starting graduate school.

500|$|After {{the first}} race, Stewart {{drove to the}} victory lane; the win earned him $55,725. He said, [...] "The fact that we've won 17 times here and not won on the right day is proof it's good momentum, but it's no {{guarantee}} obviously. It's nice to come here, especially for Steve and I, being our first race together, {{to be able to}} come out and have two really good strong and solid races back-to-back is an awesome start for us." [...] Earnhardt felt that the race was [...] "pretty good" [...] and praised Stewart for his victory. He also said that he aimed to start the Daytona 500 without using a backup car. Ambrose was happy with his third-place finish, [...] "We learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> Sunday, we got a good result.

500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|Regarding if {{they would}} break the fifth season into pods again as with season four, Bell said, [...] "A 22-episode arc is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> people to hold onto. By {{breaking}} it up into either smaller arcs or different pods, by introducing a set of antagonists and putting them down, or moving from space to space, our experience has been that it’s something the viewers enjoy, {{and it makes it}} a little easier to digest when you’re telling some of these stories." [...] Whedon also noted it would depend on how the season would be [...] "broken up in terms of airing. If everything is running back-to-back, it feels weird to start calling it different things... We will try to have it in bite-sized chunks." [...] The season will begin airing its episodes on December 1, 2017, once Inhumans has aired its eight episodes, with the intent for all 22 episodes to air mostly uninterrupted.|$|E

500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of all this and work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>for</b> a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

[...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

500|$|Illmatic is also {{credited}} with reviving the Queensbridge rap scene. Once home to prestigious pioneers such as Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shanté, Queensbridge {{had been one}} of the most productive hip hop scenes in the country during the 1980s. In an April 2006 article, an XXL columnist wrote of the history and impact of the Queensbridge hip hop scene, stating [...] "Since the 1980s, New York City's Queensbridge Housing Projects has been documented perhaps better than any other geographic location. Starting with super producer Marley Marl's dominant Juice Crew in the ’80s all the way through ’90s mainstays like Nas, Cormega and Capone, the Bridge has produced the highest per-capita talent of any ’hood." [...] Yet during the early 1990s, the Queensbridge rap scene was otherwise stagnant [...] According to Nas: [...] "I was coming from the legacy of Marley Marl, MC Shan, Juice Crew kind of vibe. Knowing these guys out in the neighborhood. At that time, the Queensbridge scene was dead.
