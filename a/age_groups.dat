However, all of the significant values were on the lower ends of what is considered a strong correlation and the combined over 65 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and the total group likely owe their significance to the women over 65 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Despite showing a significant increased trend in average hospital charge, the women less than 65 <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> the combined less than 65 <b>age</b> <b>group,</b> and the men over 65 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> {{did not have a}} significant positive trend in their average Medicare reimbursement. Again, this suggests that Medicare reimbursement is not simply a proportion of what the hospitals charge.|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{clinical}} and pathological features, treatment modality approaches in the elderly, especially in patients aged 80 years and older. MethodsFrom the databases at two educational hospitals during the period from January 1978 and December 2007, medical records of lung cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed. The patient population was divided into three age groups: less than 70 years (the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group),</b> 70 – 79 years (the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group),</b> and 80 years or older (the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group).</b> Time trends were also studied in two-time intervals: first study period up to 1997, which represents past practice standards, the second study period up to 2007, which represents contemporary practice. ResultsPatients aged 80 years and older comprised 7. 5 % of 2775 consecutive patients with lung cancer, and there was a rapid increase in the proportion of patients aged 80 years or older from the earlier to the later time period. The ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> had higher proportion of poor performance status (PS) and comorbid disease than the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Unchanged proportion of patients with poor PS and advanced disease at presentation were observed in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> The ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> was less likely to be subjected to surgery or chemotherapy, and had inferior outcomes when compared with the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Survival improvement was not observed in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Multivariate analysis showed good PS, early clinical stage and surgery were favorable prognostic factors in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> ConclusionIn order to improve the outcome, detection of early stage lung cancer in patients with good PS and thorough pretreatment evaluation for appropriate treatment are indeed essential even for the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of patients...|$|R

5|$|While {{reduction}} of sodium intake {{to less than}} 2,300mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200mg (contained in 3g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake the greater the fall in systolic blood pressure for all <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> and ethinicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.|$|E
