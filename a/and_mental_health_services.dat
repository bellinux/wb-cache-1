5|$|The Civilian Public Service (CPS) was {{a program}} of the United States {{government}} that provided conscientious objectors with an alternative to military service during World War II. From 1941 to 1947, nearly 12,000 draftees, willing to serve their country in some capacity but unwilling to perform any type of military service, accepted assignments in work of national importance in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.

40|$|Purpose: The first {{objectives}} {{of the current study}} was to determine whether disparities exist in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use between minority and majority Canadian Francophone and Anglophone communities both within and outside of Quebec. The second objectives was to examine if official language minority-majority status was associated with the presence of common <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> utilization. Methodology: The current study used data from the Canadian Community <b>Health</b> Survey: <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>and</b> Well-being, Cycle 1. 2. 7 Two main comparisons were made: Quebec Francophones to Quebec Anglophones, and outside Quebec Francophones to outside Quebec Anglophones. Twelve-month and lifetime prevalences of <b>mental</b> disorders <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use were examined through bivariate analyses. Logistic regression analyses determined whether official language minority-majority status significantly predicts <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use using the Determinants of Health Model 8 - 10 and Andersen’s behavioural model. 11 - 13 Results: Very few {{significant differences were found between}} official language groups both outside and within Quebec, though some notable differences were found between Quebec and outside Quebec: Anglophones and Francophones outside Quebec had a higher prevalence of poor <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>and</b> low life satisfaction compared their respective language counterparts in Quebec. Respondents from outside Quebec had a higher prevalence of consulting with a psychiatrist than respondents from Quebec. There was no significant association between membership in an Official Language Minority Community <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems, <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Implications: Although our results indicate that very few differences exist between official language minority and majority groups, these findings remain important and can help aid key stakeholders redirect resources and develop policies and programs towards areas and geographic locations wherein health disparities exist...|$|R

40|$|Although {{immigrant}} {{adolescents are}} at least at equal risk of developing internalizing problems as their non-immigrant peers, immigrant adolescents {{are less likely to}} use <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> care. The present study is the first to examine ethnic differences in problem identification to find explanations for this disparity in <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Specifically, the extent to which emotional problem identification mediates the relationship between immigrant status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use for internalizing problems in three immigrant populations in the Netherlands (i. e., Surinamese, Turkish, and Moroccan) was investigated. A two-phase design was used to include adolescents at risk for internalizing problems. Data were used from the second phase, in which 349 parents and adolescents participated (95 native Dutch, 85 Surinamese, 87 Turkish, and 82 Moroccan). Results indicated that <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use for internalizing problems is far lower among immigrant adolescents than among native Dutch adolescents, although differences between immigrant groups were also substantive. A lack of emotional problem identification was identified as an essential mediator in the relationship between immigrant status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use. Since the results suggest the low levels of problem identification in our immigrant samples may serve an explanatory role in the relationship between immigrant status <b>and</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>service</b> use, future research should aim at understanding these ethnic differences in problem identification.

25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} a common and flavorsome topping for breads and cakes. One gram of poppy seeds {{contains}} up to 33 micrograms of morphine and 14 micrograms of codeine, and the Substance Abuse <b>and</b> <b>Mental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Services</b> Administration in the United States formerly mandated that all drug screening laboratories use a standard cutoff of 300 nanograms per milliliter in urine samples. A single poppy seed roll (0.76grams of seeds) usually did not produce a positive drug test, but a positive result was observed from eating two rolls. A slice of poppy seed cake containing nearly five grams of seeds per slice produced positive results for 24 hours. Such results are viewed as false positive indications of drug use and were {{the basis of a}} legal defense. On November 30, 1998, the standard cutoff was increased to 2000 nanograms (two micrograms) per milliliter. Confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry will distinguish amongst opium and variants including poppy seeds, heroin, and morphine and codeine pharmaceuticals by measuring the morphine:codeine ratio and looking for the presence of noscapine and acetylcodeine, the latter of which is only found in illicitly produced heroin, and heroin metabolites such as 6-monoacetylmorphine.|$|E
