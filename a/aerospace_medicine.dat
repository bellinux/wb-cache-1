5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's <b>Aerospace</b> <b>Medicine</b> Center, was published {{on the front page of}} the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E

5000|$|... 1990s era [...] <b>Aerospace</b> <b>medicine’s</b> {{support and}} {{development}} of critical care in the air marked its first major milestone in 1997 with the USAFSAM’s inception of the Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) program that integrated Air Force aeromedical operations worldwide. CCATT was created {{in response to a}} shift in Air Force aeromedical evacuation doctrine following the first Persian Gulf War. The shift involving patient care from “return to duty” to “evacuate and replace” provided the impetus for CCATT’s development as a training program that emphasized stabilizing patients in the aeromedical evacuation system. CCATT’s development has since expanded the Air Force’s aeromedical clinical transport capabilities by providing intensive care unit support on board transport aircraft.|$|R

Their report was, in turn, challenged by university-based experts Richard Clapp and Jeannie Stellman, both of whom continue to assert contaminated aircraft exposed the aircrews as well as aerial port and maintenance veterans. As of August 2012, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has denied service-connection (the linking of a veteran's illness to military service) to every application for medical benefits.|$|E

Brooks became the headquarters for the School of <b>Aerospace</b> <b>Medicine</b> (SAM). In 1957, SAM scientists moved into the newly completed center at Brooks AFB. SAM aided the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with Project Mercury and served as a back-up site for lunar samples brought back to Earth on the Apollo missions between 1969–1972.
