Along an exptl. path, no phase change could be obsd. visually within a temp. range between 30 °C and 150 °C. The microemulsions are characterized with quasi-elastic light scattering measurements at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> and temp. dependent small angle neutron scattering (SANS) expts. between 30 °C and 150 °C. DLS measurements at <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> indicate a swelling of the formed structures with increasing amt. of EAN {{up to a certain}} threshold.

We evaluated the small angle scattering data via the GIFT method, for comparison we also applied the model of Teubner and Strey (TS) which was often used to describe scattering curves of microemulsions. The GIFT method gives good fits throughout the exptl. path, while the TS model gives relatively poor fits.

At high concn. or in the melt, assocn. among the end-groups of entangled chains (> 25 M_e) frustrates their reptation relaxation. This broadens the time range in which the materials behave in an elastomeric manner. The activation energy of end-assocn. can be tuned using polyvalent hydrogen bonding. Here, we compare polybutadienes that have either two or four carboxylate groups at each end.

It can show postural changes where it changes its body shape or moves and exposes different areas to the sun/shade, and through radiation, convection and conduction, heat exchange occurs. Vasomotor responses allow control of the flow of blood between the periphery and the core to control heat loss {{from the surface of the}} body. Lastly, the organism can show insulation adjustments; a common example being “goosebumps” in humans where hair follicles are raised by pilomotor muscles, also shown in animals’ pelage and plumage. This allows heat to be trapped between hairs. Below the thermal neutral zone there is the zone of LCT (lower critical temperature) and above there is the zone of UCT (upper critical temperature). The organism reaches the LCT when the Ta (<b>ambient</b> <b>temp.)</b> decreases. When an organism reaches this stage the metabolic rate increases significantly and thermogenesis increases the Tb (body temp.) If the Ta continues to decrease far below the LCT hypothermia occurs. When the Ta reaches too far out of the UCT the rate heat gain and heat production become higher than the rate of heat dissipation (heat loss through evaporative cooling), resulting in hyperthermia.|$|R

In this part of work, it is had the cryst. structure of the dinitromesitylen (DNM) who is solved starting from the diffraction of x-​rays starting from a monocrystal at the <b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> Parallel to the exptl. study, we undertook theor. calcns. conformation of the insulated mol. of DNM by using the methods of the DFT (D. Functional Theory) ​. Calcns. of optimization of the mol. conformation of the DNM by using the chain of program GAUSSIAN 03 and functional MPW 1 PW 91, B 3 LYP level with the 6 -​ 311 G and LANL 2 DZ bases gave a conformation Cs with results very close to the expt. for the lengths and the angles of bond. The computation results obtained starting from the base set (6 -​ 311 G) and functional MPW 1 PW 91 give for the conformation of Dinitromesitylen (DNM) a good agreement of about a 1. 9 ​% for the lengths of bond and 1. 2 ​% for the angles of bond compared with the results of the diffraction of x-​rays. Calcns. of Raman and infra-​red spectroscopy undertaken starting from the results of optimization by using same functional MPW 1 PW 91 and B 3 LYP and the sets of bases 6 -​ 311 G LanL 2 DZ led to the values of frequencies very close to the exptl. results...|$|R
40|$|Planococcus halocryophilus strain Or 1, {{isolated}} from high Arctic permafrost, grows and divides at - 15 °C, the lowest temperature demonstrated to date, and is metabolically active at - 25 °C in frozen permafrost microcosms. To understand how P. halocryophilus Or 1 remains active under the subzero and osmotically dynamic conditions that characterize its native permafrost habitat, we investigated the genome, cell physiology and transcriptomes of growth at - 15 °C and 18 % NaCl compared with optimal (25 °C) temperatures. Subzero growth coincides with unusual cell envelope features of encrustations surrounding cells, while the cytoplasmic membrane is significantly remodeled favouring a higher ratio of saturated to branched fatty acids. Analyses of the 3. 4 Mbp genome {{revealed that a}} suite of cold and osmotic-specific adaptive mechanisms are present {{as well as an}} amino acid distribution favouring increased flexibility of proteins. Genomic redundancy within 17 % of the genome could enable P. halocryophilus Or 1 to exploit isozyme exchange to maintain growth under stress, including multiple copies of osmolyte uptake genes (Opu and Pro genes). Isozyme exchange was observed between the transcriptome data sets, with selective upregulation of multi-copy genes involved in cell division, fatty acid synthesis, solute binding, oxidative stress response and transcriptional regulation. The combination of protein flexibility, resource efficiency, genomic plasticity and synergistic adaptation likely compensate against osmotic and cold stresses. These results suggest that non-spore forming P. halocryophilus Or 1 is specifically suited for active growth in its Arctic permafrost habitat (<b>ambient</b> <b>temp.</b> ~ - 16 °C), indicating that such cryoenvironments harbor a more active microbial ecosystem than previously thought...|$|R
