50|$|Consumer psychologists {{suggest that}} most buyers tend {{to enter the}} store and shop to their right first. Some {{supermarkets}} therefore choose to place {{the entrance to the}} left-hand side as the consumer will likely turn right upon entry, and this allows the consumer to do a full anticlockwise circle around the store before returning to the checkouts. This suggests that supermarket marketers should use this theory to their advantage by placing their temporary displays of products on the right-hand side to entice you to make an unplanned purchase. Furthermore, <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> are extremely popular with product manufacturers, who pay top dollar to have their products located there. These <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> are used to lure customers into making a snap purchase and to also entice them to shop down the aisle. The most obvious place supermarket layout influences consumers is at the checkout. Small displays of chocolates, magazines and drinks are located at each checkout to tempt shoppers while they wait to be served.|$|R
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} Saint Mary the Virgin existed by 1151, when William of Aston {{gave it to}} the Augustinian Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire. The present {{building}} is mostly Decorated Gothic, with early 14th century windows and north and south arcades. However, the south <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> in a chapel that has a 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic east window and the nave has a 15th or 16th century clerestory.|$|R

A wide central aisle divides the box pews, their <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> topped with a trefoil motif. Two narrower aisles run through the side sections from either entrance. The floor is carpeted. The intricate stained-glass windows depict Biblical scenes of importance to the church's evangelical beliefs.|$|R
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} St Michael and All Angels was a chapel of Dorchester parish until the 19th century. The oldest {{parts of the}} church include the arcade of the south aisle, which was built in about 1180. Elsewhere in the church are three 13th century Early English lancet windows. The south <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> in a Decorated Gothic chapel that was added in the 14th century. The Perpendicular Gothic arcade of the north aisle is later.|$|R
5000|$|The church, since 1939, {{presents}} a Latin cross shape. It {{is divided into}} three naves accessible by three doors on its facade. These aisles are 42 meters long and end in three different points of the building: the left <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> at the entrance of the sacristy, the nave reaches the chancel and the right <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> with a door. On the southern side of the church there are two other entrances. Among them, an entrance is located under the bell tower, which was built after the demolition of Ca de sciatt, which was an area reserved for people too poor and ashamed to go to church. The demolition of Ca de sciatt was ordered by Sorteni. The nave is divided from the side aisles by corinthian columns that support the vault in the gallery, designed by Sorteni. A large dome dominates the area from the transept to the chancel. In the church there are also two side chapels dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and St. Joseph. The altar is dedicated to him and it is a late baroque work. The raised presbytery ends with a semicircular apse.|$|R
50|$|The {{impressive}} {{interior is}} the result of major restoration in the 1950s. It returned the building to a severe appearance and with harmonious embellishments previously distorted by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The pillars and columns support the many arches that lead to the apse. The plastered roof vaults date from the late fourteenth century renovation of Bishop Stephen from Carrara. The <b>aisles</b> <b>end</b> in a sort of ambulatory, interrupted by the large niche {{at the top of the}} apse, where the tabernacle was placed.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral of San Giorgio {{started in}} 1738 by {{architect}} Rosario Gagliardi, {{in place of}} the temple destroyed by the 1693 earthquake, and of which is {{the only place in the}} city a Catalan-Gothic style portal can still be seen. The façade contains a flight of 250 steps and massive ornate columns, as well as statues of saints and decorated portals. The interior has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two <b>aisles</b> <b>ending</b> in half-circular apses. It is topped by a large Neoclassical dome built in 1820.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is divided into}} a nave and two <b>aisles,</b> <b>ending</b> into three apses, with an orthogonal transept. The nave, like the transept, features a trussed ceiling and, at its sides, has a fake passageway (matroneum) under which are corbels with human, animal or bestial depictions. It stands on two rows of piers, which are each different from another. Some are cruciform, while others are squared; some capitals are sculpted with elements taken from the Christian or medieval mythology, while others feature simpler plant or abstract motifs. The aisles are cross vaulted.|$|R
50|$|The main sight is the Abbey of Santa Giustina, {{founded in}} 722 by the Lombard king Liutprand. In 1033 it was {{enlarged}} by the marquis of Sezzadio, Oberto, and reached its greatest splendour in the 11th through 13th centuries, remaining under the Benedictines until 1474. The church {{has a large}} cotto façade divided by pilasters and crowned by Lombard bands. The interior has a nave and two <b>aisles</b> <b>ending</b> with apses. In the apses are frescoes from the 14th and 15th centuries, while the crypt has an 11th-century mosaic pavement.|$|R
50|$|The Cathedral is a {{prime example}} of Apulian Romanesque architecture. The façade has three portals and {{numerous}} decorations, depicting Christian symbols as well as griffins and other fantastic figures. There are two rose windows.

Among the numerous works of art are a wooden statue and the reliquary of Saint Blaise, a fresco portraying the Madonna and Child with St. Sebastian, a panel of the Virgin of Constantinople and a noteworthy wooden cross. Under the church are the remains of the Palaeo-Christian church and Roman tombs.|$|R
50|$|There {{used to be}} an older, small {{church on}} the site of today's San Secondo. This church was {{probably}} built by the Benedictines. In {{the first half of the}} 11th century the structure was raised and enlarged up to its current size.The architecture is typically Romanesque, with a projecting façade. The interior consists of a nave flanked by two aisles. The central nave and the left <b>aisle</b> <b>end</b> both with an apse with a small window. The right aisle's apse has probably been demolished to make room for the bell tower, an elegant structure with mullioned windows in its upper section.|$|R

50|$|The {{floorplan}} of Saint Cecilia's {{is that of}} a simple, three-aisled church without towers or transepts. The southernmost {{aisle and}} the centre of the nave end in a rounded apse. The northern <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> in an apse used as a sacristy, built in 1479. In the upper choir of the middle aisle are frescoes, difficult to see clearly, that were damaged during world war two. The original, arched wooden roof in the middle aisle remains on the site. and the tympanum dates from 1160, which can be viewed as part of the museum’s collection. A copy of it can be seen from outside, at the north entrance.|$|R

The altar has rich decorations with columns and statues. Above the tabernacle is the statue of Madonna with the dead Christ lying in her lap, with statues of Moses and Elijah on the sides. On the altar wings there are larger statues of the four evangelists, and, below them, figures of virtues and, on an antependium, a statut of the Lamb of God. The southern <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> with an apse housing remains of frescoes. Above the aisles is a matroneum.|$|R

500|$|Recognised for its age and tracery, {{the church}} has been {{designated}} a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north <b>aisle</b> <b>ending</b> at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the [...] designs.|$|R

Each has a large round headed arch containing a window and in the northern recess is a small door. Above each arch is plain wall surmounted by a blind arcade, string course at the roof line and plain parapet. The flanking towers are Norman in the lower part with the style being maintained in the later work. Above the plain bases there are four stories of blind arcading topped with an octagonal spire.|$|R

5000|$|The nave is {{separated}} from the chancel with a low rood screen of sturdy and ornately carved construction. Each window is finished with bright stained glass, of different ages, and with different depictions. The pews are built of oak and the <b>aisle</b> <b>ends</b> of the pews are, unusually, finished with huge oak timber scalloped plinth which are richly carved with beasts and birds. [...] Large chandeliers provided the lighting and are supported on long iron rods from the roof. The nave is simple in contrast.

50|$|A {{novelty of}} the Euphrasian {{basilica}} is {{that rather than}} being enclosed by a straight wall, as all sacred buildings were up to that time, it makes use of the breadth and length of the apse of the central nave, built {{in the shape of}} a polygon from the outside, whilst the two <b>aisles</b> <b>end</b> in smaller semicircular apses, hollowed into the wall. Thus the Euphrasian basilica is the earliest example of a triple-apsed church in Western Europe. The atrium is a typical example of Byzantine architecture, as are the columns, the tiles on the altar rail and all the abundant mosaics. Most impressive is the representation of Christ with the apostles, and beneath it a frieze of 13 medallions with a picture of Christ as the Lamb in the centre, surrounded by 12 medallions depicting various martyrs.|$|R

In the sixteenth century, owing to an earthquake, the church was much remodelled. The west front was covered with a heavy buttress wall four feet thick at the base, which blocked the two entrances into the side aisle. The north wall was rebuilt, and the windows in the west and east end of the church were blocked up. All the paintings which remain are of the period of the rebuilding, save a figure of St. John the Baptist in the west end, and even this has been chipped to form a key for the later series of frescoes. The monastic buildings are of considerable size, but are now much ruined.|$|R
