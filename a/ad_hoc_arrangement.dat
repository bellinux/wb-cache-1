25|$|Amtrak's {{early years}} are {{often called the}} Rainbow Era which refers to the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the rolling stock and {{locomotives}} {{from a pool of}} equipment acquired by Amtrak at its formation, that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners. This rolling stock, which for the most part still bore the pre-Amtrak colors and logos, formed the multi-colored consists of early Amtrak trains. By mid-1971, Amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased, including 286 second-hand locomotives (of the EMD E and F types), 30 GG1 electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars, and continued leasing even more motive power. By 1975, the official Amtrak color scheme was painted on most Amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearing.|$|E

In this paper the aims and motivation of the New South Wales Government in establishing the regulatory regime in 1912 and the subsequent effectiveness in achieving them are determined.

50|$|Being {{the first}} franchisee, an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> allowed Dave Frisch unique freedoms. His {{double-deck}} Big Boy hamburger was slightly different than Wian's. Dave Frisch also created his own Big Boy character: a thinner boy with reddish or blond hair, wearing striped rather than checkered overalls, {{presented in a}} running or skipping pose. Known as the East Coast Big Boy, this mark represented Frisch's and its licensees Manners and Azar's through 1969. Most Frisch's Big Boy restaurants still display statues from this design, albeit usually repainted with brown hair and checkered overalls. In 2017 a redesigned statue resembling the West Coast Big Boy was introduced.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{parts of}} this railway system proper were constructed to standard gauge from 1859 onwards as a to replace an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> of individual plateways.

50|$|The 1950 {{congress}} {{provided an}} occasion for workers in the radiology industry to meet {{for the first time}} in over a decade and to discuss the direction future congresses should take.

50|$|Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia all {{wished to}} claim Macedonia, {{as a key}} {{strategic}} part of their newly formed kingdoms. Throughout the 19th century, each kingdom tried to claim Macedonia as its own. This was done through the media of church and education, particularly between Greece and Bulgaria. Through the advancement of Greek or Bulgarian language, and provision of local priests either from the Bulgarian Exarchate or Orthodox Church of Constantinople, an entire village would be claimed to be 'Greek', while its neighbour would be 'Bulgarian'. This <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> did not follow any geographic or ethnic correlates, and occurred {{at the expense of}} the development of a local, Macedonian identity, and often involved harassment of peoples in order to profess loyalty to Greece or Bulgaria, and abdicate profession of any independent identity.|$|E

50|$|In {{relation}} to co-operation in investigation and evidence gathering, it is implied from the Rome Statute that {{the consent of}} a non-party state {{is a prerequisite for}} ICC Prosecutor to conduct an investigation within its territory, and it seems that it is even more necessary for him to observe any reasonable conditions raised by that state, since such restrictions exist for states party to the Statute. Taking into account the experience of the ICTY (which worked with the principle of the primacy, instead of complementarity) in {{relation to}} co-operation, some scholars have expressed their pessimism as to the possibility of ICC to obtain co-operation of non-party states. As for the actions that ICC can take towards non-party states that do not co-operate, the Rome Statute stipulates that the Court may inform the Assembly of States Parties or Security Council, when the matter was referred by it, when non-party state refuses to co-operate after it has entered into an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> or an agreement with the Court.|$|E
50|$|The States-General (Staten-Generaal in Dutch) or the Generality (Generaliteiten) {{for short}} was a {{descendant}} of the medieval Burgundian and Habsburg States-Generals. In medieval times and under the Habsburgs, they met infrequently to discuss matters of common interest and to vote taxes {{for the benefit of}} the Dukes of Burgundy and their Habsburg heirs. At first the States-General was thought of as an extraordinary body. After the abjuration of the king in 1581 and the separation of the northern Netherlands from the Spanish dominions, the States-General replaced the king as the supreme authority and as the central government of the northern Netherlands, which then became known as the United Provinces. As alluded to above, this was an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangement</b> since no prince would anger Spain by accepting sovereignty over the provinces. As the years went by, and the confidence of the governing regents and Princes of Orange grew, the desire to be ruled by a foreign prince diminished. From 1593, the States-General met daily, including on Sundays, usually between 11 and 1, and, after some variation in the earlier years, it came to sit in the Binnenhof, in The Hague, near the States of Holland.|$|E
40|$|Countryside {{recreation}} {{policy in}} Scotland is currently delivered through numerous <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangements.</b> This paper assesses the economic {{effectiveness of these}} arrangements using cost?benefit analysis. The benefits associated with recreation enhancements are measured using the contingent valuation method, while the costs are assessed through a survey of public and voluntary section expenditure on informal recreation. The analysis demonstrates that recreation policies are generally economically efficient in that they target enhancement programmes that are shown to generate high economic benefits. The exception to this is related to investments in visitor centres. The paper concludes that the cost?benefit methodology adopted in this research can provide useful information for the strategic analysis of countryside recreation policyPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This Handbook aims to give {{practical}} {{guidance on}} the essential questions which {{have to be}} addressed in the establishment of deposit insurance schemes. It examines the rationale for deposit insurance and the risk that insurance creates moral hazard. It then discusses the differences between formal deposit insurance schemes and implicit (or <b>ad</b> <b>hoc)</b> <b>arrangements</b> for depositor insurance, and the feasibility of private insurance. After describing different types of scheme it deals with more detailed matters such as triggers for the payment of compensation, the selection of those categories of deposit which are to be protected, compensation ceilings and co-insurance. Finally, it discusses the financing of compensation payments and administrative arrangements. This handbook is also available in Russian and Spanish. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper makes a {{case for}} a government-led {{cultural}} inquiry. Drawing together examples {{across a range of}} areas in Australian media and cultural policy, it points out a widespread pattern of inconsistencies, <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>arrangements</b> and reversals. This pattern cannot be attributed to the inadequacies of any single government, but reflects a basic confusion about the kinds of policy objectives which it is now appropriate to pursue. While established policy frameworks are proving increasingly inadequate in responding to a rapidly changing environment, they have not been fundamentally rethought. Given the importance to Australia of media and cultural industries, there is an urgent need to clarify the basic principles on which policy is formulated...|$|R
