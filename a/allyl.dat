5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an aryl or <b>allyl</b> group, the reagent {{is referred}} to as a semi-stabilized ylide. These have been developed extensively, second only to the classical methylene reagents (R1=R2=H).

5|$|The Carroll {{rearrangement}} is a rearrangement {{reaction in}} organic chemistry and involves {{the transformation of}} a β-keto <b>allyl</b> ester into a α-allyl-β-ketocarboxylic acid. This organic reaction is accompanied by decarboxylation and the final product is a γ,δ-allylketone. The Carroll rearrangement is an adaptation of the Claisen rearrangement and effectively a decarboxylative allylation.|$|E
5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has a crisp texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|Organotellurium {{compounds}} such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl <b>allyl</b> telluride are {{precursors for}} synthesizing metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes.

5|$|The Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (often {{referred to}} as simply the Nazarov cyclization) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of cyclopentenones. The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants, depending on the reagents and substrates employed. It was originally discovered by Ivan Nikolaevich Nazarov (1906–1957) in 1941 while studying the rearrangements of <b>allyl</b> vinyl ketones.|$|E
5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, {{it was his}} study of the rearrangements of <b>allyl</b> vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic olefin isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% {{is used in}} the manufacture of organic compounds, and 18% in the manufacture of inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced is used for bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates in the production of PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, <b>allyl</b> chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E

25|$|The first {{reported}} Claisen rearrangement is the -sigmatropic rearrangement of an <b>allyl</b> phenyl ether to intermediate 1, which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.|$|E
25|$|The bonding of π-bonded {{species can}} be {{extended}} over several atoms, e.g. in <b>allyl,</b> butadiene ligands, but also in cyclopentadienyl or benzene rings can share their electrons.|$|E
25|$|If an {{aldehyde}} or {{carboxylic acid}} occupies the ortho or para positions, the <b>allyl</b> side-chain displaces the group, releasing it as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The Claisen {{rearrangement}} (not to {{be confused}} with the Claisen condensation) is a powerful carbon–carbon bond-forming chemical reaction discovered by Rainer Ludwig Claisen.

25|$|The {{ethyl ester}} of propionic acid (1) was {{brominated}} and then converted to the Wittig reagent using triphenylphosphine. Aldehyde 6 {{was obtained from}} <b>allyl</b> alcohol (4) by protection as the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl ether (5) followed by ozonolysis. Wittig reagent 3 and aldehyde 6 reacted in a Wittig reaction to give unsaturated ester 7, which was deprotected to give dienophile 8 (Scheme 1, compound 1).|$|E
25|$|About 200,000 tonnes of {{tetrahydrofuran}} {{are produced}} annually. The {{most widely used}} industrial process involves the acid-catalyzed dehydration of 1,4-butanediol. Ashland/ISP is one the biggest producers of this chemical route. The method {{is similar to the}} production of diethyl ether from ethanol. The butanediol is derived from condensation of acetylene with formaldehyde followed by hydrogenation. DuPont developed a process for producing THF by oxidizing n-butane to crude maleic anhydride, followed by catalytic hydrogenation. A third major industrial route entails hydroformylation of <b>allyl</b> alcohol followed by hydrogenation to the butanediol.|$|E
25|$|The first {{lipophilic}} thiamine derivative to {{be discovered}} was allithiamine, which was isolated from garlic (Allium sativum) in 1951. Allithiamine is an <b>allyl</b> disulfide derivative. After the discovery of allithiamine, several additional derivatives were synthesized {{with the hope that}} they would have better pharmacokinetic properties than thiamine. Thiamine is unable to diffuse across plasma membranes because it has a positively charged thiazole moiety. Instead, it must be transported across plasma membranes by high affinity carriers, and the rate of transport is low. Sulbutiamine overcomes the poor oral bioavailability of thiamine because it is highly lipophilic. The synthesis of sulbutiamine was reported by Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. in 1965.|$|E
25|$|For instance, {{the natural}} enzyme chorismate mutase, which catalyzes the Claisen {{rearrangement}} of chorismate, features many other interactions {{in addition to}} the hydrogen bonds involved in stabilizing the enolate-like fragment, which {{is an example of the}} anionic fragment stabilization strategy discussed above. A key interaction is the stabilization of the other cationic <b>allyl</b> fragment through a cation-pi interaction in the transition state. The use of many additional hydrogen bonds has several putative purposes. The stabilization of multiple hydrogen bonds to the enzyme helps overcome the entropic cost of binding. Additionally, the interactions help hold the substrate in a reactive conformation, and the enzyme-catalyzed reaction has near-zero entropy of activation, while typical Claisen rearrangements in solution have very negative entropies of activation.|$|E

500|$|Discovered in 1912 by Rainer Ludwig Claisen, the Claisen {{rearrangement}} is {{the first}} recorded example of a -sigmatropic rearrangement. This rearrangement is a useful carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction.

500|$|Phytochemistry : The seeds contain {{saponins}} but no {{calcium oxalate}} raphide crystals, chelidonic acid (unlike Asparagales) or cysteine derived sulphur compounds (<b>allyl</b> sulphides), another distinguishing feature from the characteristic alliaceous odour of the Allioideae.

500|$|A {{large number}} of {{alternative}} synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions.

[...] Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method3). [...] In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate {{which in turn is}} treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with [...] which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by benzyl chloride can be converted into [...] acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method4).|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} pungent {{taste of}} horseradish {{is from the}} compound <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate.

[...] The <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme. When an animal chews the plant, the <b>allyl</b> isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal.
