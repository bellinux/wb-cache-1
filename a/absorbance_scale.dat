The useful range of the <b>absorbance</b> <b>scale</b> is from 0-2 but it is desirable to keep within the range 0-1 because, above 1, the results become unreliable due to scattering of light.|$|E
40|$|Hydrolysis {{of barley}} {{proteins}} into peptides and amino acids {{is one of}} the most important processes during barley germination. The degradation of the endosperm stored proteins facilitates water and enzyme movements, enhances modification, liberates starch granules and increases soluble amino nitrogen. Protease activity is the result of the activities of a mixture of exo- and endo-proteases. The barley proteins are initially solubilized by endo-proteases and the further by exo-proteases. Four classes of endo-proteases have been described: serine-proteases, cysteine-proteases, aspartic-proteases and metallo-proteases. The objective of this work was to develop a rapid and colorimetric enzymatic assay to determine the endo-proteolytic activity of the four endo-protease classes using two different substrates: azo-gelatin and azo-casein. Optimum conditions for the assays such as: pH,reaction time and temperature and <b>absorbance</b> <b>scale</b> were determined. Azo-gelatin presented several difficulties in standardizing an “in solution” assay. On the other hand, azo-casein allowed standardization of the assay for the four enzyme classes to produce consistent results. The endo-proteoteolytic method developed was applied to determine the endo-protease activity in barley, malt and wort...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The current {{opinion is}} that the reflux of jejunal juice over the whole length of a long Roux-en-Y jejunal loop is very uncommon. We aimed to {{challenge}} this concept by monitoring the presence of bile in the organ proximal to a 60 -cm loop during a 24 -hour period with use of the Bilitec device, an optoelectronic instrument capable of measuring absorbance of a beam of light, the wavelength of which {{is close to the}} absorbance peak of bilirubin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients, 8 of whom had been cholecystectomized, were investigated after total gastrectomy (group I, n = 17), distal gastrectomy (group II, n = 7), or duodenal switch (group III, n = 17). The percentage of recording time absorbance > 0. 25 (<b>absorbance</b> <b>scale</b> ranging from 0 to 1) was calculated in reference to data from healthy subjects. RESULTS: Bile was detected in 17 patients (41 %), 5 belonging to group 1, 2 to group II, and 10 to group III (P = 0. 165). Bile exposure remained within the range of controls in 14 patients whereas it was above this range in 3 patients, 2 of whom had disabling heartburn and severe esophagitis. The percentage of time absorbance > 0. 25 did not significantly differ from one group to another (P = 0. 257) or according to whether patients had been cholecystectomized or not (P = 0. 439). However, unlike cholecystectomized patients, patients still having their gallbladder refluxed predominantly during postprandial periods. Lengthening of the loop from 60 cm to 110 cm in the 2 symptomatic patients with a pathologic bile reflux resulted in relief of heartburn and healing of esophagitis in both while bile reflux was abolished in 1 and dramatically reduced in the other. CONCLUSIONS: Bile refluxes over the whole length of 4 Roux-en-Y loops out of 10. In most patients, bile reflux remains within the range of healthy subjects, producing neither symptoms nor mucosal damage; and it occurs independently of the organ proximal to the loop, but its timing of occurrence is modified by cholecystectomy. Although only for exceptional indications, lengthening of an incompetent loop is effective in patients with excessive bile reflux and severe related symptoms and lesions.

40|$|Legg et al Discrepancies in the {{calibration}} {{of reaction}} rate analysers Many enzyme assays {{are linked to}} the formation or utilisation of NADH so that reaction rates can be monitored at 340 nm. The absorbance spectrum of naphthol green is sufficiently different from that of NADH to render calibration using this substance undesirable, and NADH or the particular chromophore used to monitor the reaction, e. g. p-nitrophenol, should be used. The new calibration procedure confirmed the extent of the disparity between the two instruments noted when performing enzyme analyses and supported the view that the problem was one of instrumentation, possibly electronic in origin. An electronic calibration procedure produced by the company was successful in bringing the instruments back into specification and cured the problem of the disparity between the 0. 05 and 0. 20 <b>absorbance</b> <b>scales.</b> Exactly what is accomplished when electronic calibration is carried out remains uncertain. Certainly such items as the ratio of the two <b>absorbance</b> <b>scales</b> and linearity across the recorder are correctly adjusted during this procedure, but {{the manner in which the}} photocell output is linked to true absorbance is not clear. In the light of the authors’ experience, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that electronic calibration merely succeeded in ensuring that both instruments investigated produced the same result. It may not ensure that the output from an instrument is linked to true absorbance. For this reason, a correction factor may still need to be applied to the results obtained after electronic and absorptiometric calibration has been carried out. It is suggested that results which are within + 5 % of the true absorbance need not be corrected, while instruments operating outside of these limits should have a correction factor applied until they can be serviced and the error corrected. This may well depend on the type of analysis being performed on the instrument. The calibration procedure outlined could be performed at intervals of about six months. It can be adapted to calibrate any other type of reaction rate analyser and has been " used successfully in calibrating both the AKES (MSE Scientifi...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} high-pressure {{liquid chromatography}} procedure {{for determining the}} concentration of pipemidic acid in human plasma was developed, which uses a normal-phase silica gel column and aqueous mobile solvent system {{similar to that used}} in reverse-phase chromatography. Precolumn derivatization of pipemidic acid was achieved by a methylation reaction with boron trifluoride in methanol after extraction from plasma with chloroform containing 4 % ethanol. The percent recovery of pipemidic acid was 88. 3 +/- 7. 7, the variation of which became negligible when quinacrine was used as an internal standard for the determination. High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis was performed by conventional silica gel and mobile solvent mixtures containing 3 % of 0. 14 % HClO 4 solution, 19 % methanol, and 78 % chloroform. The UV detector was set at 265 nm. The detection limit of pipemidic acid methyl ester was as low as 10 ng of the injection amounts or 0. 5 micrograms of the plasma per ml, with 0. 01 <b>absorbance</b> units (full <b>scale)</b> and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 New {{analytical}} methods and instrumentation were {{developed for the}} determination of dissolved oxygen (DO) at low concentrations in water. The methods were based on monitoring the absorbance increase due to the oxidation of reduced indigo carmine (IC) by oxygen in the sample in different types of spectrometer cells. Spectrophotometer cells included a 1. 2 -cm vial cell and liquid core waveguide (LCW) cells with path lengths from 20 to 100 cm. The LCW based spectrophotometer consisted of a miniature peristaltic pump, a multi-port reactor, and a LCW cell (24 -cm, Teflon-AF tubing) which were connected together in a flow loop and enclosed in a unique housing filled with a reductant solution. This configuration allows double containment of the components and purging of the solutions to reduce the oxygen contamination. Unique sampling methodology based on syringes or a unique micro-pump sampler and on double-septum caps enabled transferring of small-volume samples (1 mL or less) from septum-sealed bottles into the spectrometer cells containing IC with minimal atmospheric contamination. The new methodology was applied for the determination of low DO concentrations in prepared standards and anaerobic cultures under Fe(III) -reducing, sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions. A detection limit of 0. 03 mg/L DO for a 0. 5 -mL sample was achieved with the 1. 2 -cm vial and N 2 purging of the headspace in the cell. The novel use of hydrogen purging of the solution circulating through the LCW cell for continual reduction of IC with a Pt catalyst was demonstrated. This purging {{made it possible to}} negate the effects of oxygen diffusing into the reagent and oxidizing IC, to keep the <b>absorbance</b> on <b>scale</b> with the long pathlength, and to achieve a DL for DO of 0. 03 mg/L with a 0. 1 -mL sample volume...|$|R

The surface morphologies of the thicker r-depositions on the three different thermoplastics have been analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) at varying micrometer <b>scales.</b> <b>Absorbance</b> spectroscopy {{has been used to}} characterize the optical properties of all coatings. Intrinsic stress release phenomena are revealed on thicker layers through the detection of characteristic surface corrugations. Based on contact angle measurements, the different size of these morphological entities is discussed in terms of different surroundings at the formed sp 2 clusters in the films. Superimposed structures developed between coalescence grains have been furthermore observed on top of the thicker layer on PET, demonstrating that the growth of a-C:H material on plastics occurs by a multilayer mode. For all coatings, the total sp 2 content increases with increasing f- and r-deposition. Even if thinner layers show dissimilar sp 2 contents and even if different specific sp 2 organizations exist between the developed coatings on POM compared to HDPE and PET, for thicker r-depositions the total sp 2 content assimilates for all films...|$|R
30|$|The entire {{field of}} polymer studies by FTIR {{spectrometry}} is extremely broad. Extensive reviews of Infrared polymer spectrometry are available (Koenig 1980 a,, b; D’Esposito and Koenig 1978; Zahid 1993; Griffiths and Haseth 1986; Belfer et al. 1999). Vibrational spectrometry {{has been applied}} to the identification of polymeric materials for both qualitative and quantitative determination of chemical composition. Many parameters can be investigated including polymer end groups, chain branching, configuration and steric and geometric isomerism. It {{can also be used to}} identify and determine the concentration of impurities, additives and residual monomers in polymeric materials. The effects of external conditions on polymers, the change in state with temperature and pressure as well as the effects of deformation, fatiguing and weathering can also be studied. The analysis of polymers using FTIR spectrometry is done by isolation of spectral features. Spectral subtraction is frequently employed to isolate spectral features of a component in a polymer blend, to remove solvent bands or to isolate spectral features after a chemical reaction or physical change in the sample (Lin et al. 2001). By this method, known as <b>scaled</b> <b>absorbance</b> subtraction, bands of constituents of interest can be isolated and contaminants can be identified. Some studies on the effect of interactions of water and foulants with membrane surfaces by ATR/FTIR have been reported (Cho et al. 1998; Santos and Duarte 1998; MacCarthy and Rice 1985). Recent studies on the characterization on UF membranes used as pretreatment for seawater desalination have been reported using ATR/FTIR as tool (Shona et al. 2009).|$|R
