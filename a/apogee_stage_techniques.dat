This study examined if the <b>stages</b> <b>technique</b> in concept mapping increases the concept-map creating level and academic achievement of students in math. In this manner, the “Sets” unit in the ninth grade mathematics curriculum was chosen. Students from two ninth grade classrooms were used as the subject group of the study. Two concept-mapping techniques—stages and non-stages—were tested on two groups having 25 students from each class, respectively. The scores obtained from pre- and post-tests, and the evaluation of concept maps were analyzed by using independent samples t-test.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation on wireless MIMO channel capacity effect based on double <b>stage</b> diversity <b>technique</b> for indoor environments.

A new configuration (double <b>stage</b> <b>technique)</b> of spatial diversity and polarization diversity is introduced in this investigation, and measured for an indoor environment. Comparative analyses on the linear and X-polarized configurations of the antenna has been conducted for spacings between 0. 5 and 2 ? at 2. 4 GHz. The {{results show that the}} channel capacity for the double stage diversity configuration could achieve more than 5. 6 b/s/Hz. Furthermore, the space between antennas could be reduced up to 150 %, compared to a linear polarized configuration. Thus, the double <b>stage</b> diversity <b>technique</b> has high potential for use in designing a compact system of wireless MIMO communication infrastructure, especially for LTE systems...|$|R
