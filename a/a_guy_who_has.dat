Korman phoned Salke, calling the script [...] "remarkable" [...] and praising Killen: [...] "...for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never written a {{procedural}} show in his life", he was [...] "making two cases work." [...] Initially, Salke and Korman hoped to sell acquisition rights to other networks (including Fox). Although it successfully made {{its way into the}} lower executive branches of the company, the script was ultimately declined by Fox entertainment president Kevin Reilly. Gary Newman, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television, opted not to develop a deal with cable-television networks. Believing it should be a broadcast-network show, he did not accept the idea that the difference between cable and network dramas was their degree of intelligence.|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm telling you, this script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E

Luna, Jansen, Whitehead, and Birdsell reprise their roles from {{earlier in the}} series. When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have {{some of these people}} in the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick." [...] On having Johnson and Reyes join up with S.H.I.E.L.D., Whedon called it uneasy [...] "for everyone involved. Daisy has {{made it very clear that}} she doesn’t want to be with our team. There’s all that history and pain there. For Robbie, this is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> never had a team, and probably doesn’t function well within one. We’ll see pretty quickly that it’s an uneasy alliance and it’s going to cause a lot of drama." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{aspects of}} Guevara's {{personality}} and beliefs affected the filming process. For instance, close-ups of Del Toro were avoided due to Guevara's belief in collectivism, with Soderbergh remarking, [...] "You can't {{make a movie}} about <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> these hard-core sort of egalitarian socialist principles and then isolate him with close-ups." [...] According to Edgar Ramirez, who portrays Ciro Redondo, the cast [...] "were improvising a lot" [...] while making The Argentine, and he describes the project as a [...] "very contemplative movie", shot chronologically. While filming outdoors, Soderbergh used natural light as much as possible. Del Toro, who speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, tried to speak the best Argentinean Spanish (Rioplatense Spanish) he could without sounding [...] "stiff". Prior to shooting the film's final scenes that depict Guevara's time in Bolivia {{at the end of}} his life, Del Toro shed 35 pounds to show how ill Guevara had become. The actor shaved the top of his head rather than wear a bald cap for the scenes depicting Guevara's arrival in Bolivia in disguise.|$|E
500|$|To help refresh the show, {{several new}} writers were hired, {{including}} Greenstein, Joe Keenan, who {{also served as}} an executive producer, and Bob Daily, {{who was also a}} producer. Daily commented, [...] "When we came on in season three, the mandate was to bring the show back to its roots. That meant having plotlines spring from relatable experiences, no matter how operatic or convoluted." [...] For the season's main mystery, Cherry and the writers wanted to incorporate more of the series' regular characters rather than bringing in various new ones, like they had done in the second season with Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her family. They developed the Orson plot line around the [...] "idea that one of our women marries <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> dark secrets and possibly a violent streak." [...] Cherry opined: [...] "I thought there was something exciting about that, but real and relatable." [...] Greenstein commented that the writers worked backwards from the second season's cliffhangers to develop the Orson storyline, forsaking the original material that had been developed earlier. The cast responded positively to the new material for the season.|$|E

The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm.
