5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{made his}} debut for the Hornets in the team's season opener against the Miami Heat on October 28, scoring 17 points {{off the bench}} in a 104–94 loss. On December 17, he scored a season-high 35 points in a 109–99 {{overtime}} win over the Toronto Raptors. On March 21, 2016, he scored 15 of his 29 points {{in the fourth quarter}} to help Charlotte rally from a 30–7 deficit in the second quarter for a 91–88 comeback victory over San Antonio, snapping the Spurs' six-game winning streak. Charlotte was the first team to score seven points or fewer in the opening quarter <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to win since 2008. It was also the largest comeback surrendered by the Spurs in the Tim Duncan era, which began in 1997. Lin was 11-of-18 from the field and hit all four three-point attempts, including three in the fourth quarter, and provided the go-ahead jumper with 48 seconds left. Lin's first and only season with the Hornets came to an end after the Hornets were defeated by the Heat {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} Spaghetti Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All <b>and</b> <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{approach}} to Battle Mountain and P'il-bong {{was much more}} difficult from the east, the American-held side, than from the west, the North Korean side. On the east side there was no road climbing halfway to the top; {{from the base of}} the mountain at the edge of the Haman valley the only way to make the ascent was by foot trail. Climbers took two to three hours to reach the top of P'il-bong from the reservoir area, and required from three to four hours to get on top of Battle Mountain from the valley floor. The turnaround time for supply trains to Battle Mountain was six hours. Often a dispatch runner required eight hours to go up Battle Mountain <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> down. In some places the trail was so steep that climbers had to set up ropes to hold along the side of the trail. North Korean night patrols constantly cut telephone lines. The wire men had a difficult and dangerous job trying to maintain wire communication with units on the mountain. Food, water and ammunition were frequently short for the units at the tops of the peaks.|$|E

Herring let Nogueira get back to his feet, and Nogueira was then able to recover <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> with a dominant decision victory.|$|E

25|$|On Monday May 6, 1968, St. Petersburg city {{sanitation}} workers went {{on strike}} and implemented a work stoppage at the Lake Maggiore sanitation compound. Workers expressed concern over a new pay plan implemented a month prior, that failed to produce “shared savings” that were to be passed along to the workers as promised. As {{a result of these}} perceived failed promises, sanitation workers demanded a wage increase of 25-cents an hour before they would return to work. City Manager Lynn Andrews, having agreed with similar demands in the two previous strikes, asked the strikers to take the day off <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> Tuesday while claiming he was in no position to grant any wage increases.|$|E
25|$|The Eagles {{opened the}} 2014 season winning their {{first three games}} and making NFL history as the only team ever to trail by ten or more points in their first three games <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to win. Nick Foles {{struggled}} with turnovers, but ultimately did well and led the Eagles to a 6–2 record, before breaking his collarbone, resulting in his job getting taken over by Mark Sanchez, who outplayed Foles despite facing more playoff teams. The Eagles held the divisional title from week one to week 15 against the Cowboys. After going 9–3 with their crucial win over the Cowboys, the Eagles lost their next 3, and a week after losing the NFC East title, they lost an upset against the 3–11 Redskins and were eliminated from playoff contention with the Cowboys' win over the Colts.|$|E

He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique.

Ted has a wife and kids who are referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion.

25|$|On the {{following}} morning of 14 February 1779, Cook and his men launched from Resolution along with a company of armed marines. They {{went directly to the}} ruling chief's enclosure where Kalaniʻōpuʻu was still sleeping. They woke him and directed him to come with them away from the town. As Cook and his men marched the ruler out of the royal enclosure, Cook himself had hold of the elder chief as they walked away from the town towards the beach. Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wife, Kānekapōlei, saw them as they were leaving and yelled after her husband but he did not stop. She called to the other chiefs and the townspeople to alert them to the departure of her husband. Two chiefs, Kanaʻina (Kalaimanokahoʻowaha), the young son of the former ruler, Keaweʻopala and the king's personal attendant named Nuaa followed the group to the beach with the king's wife behind them pleading along the way for the aliʻi nui to stop <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hoyos did {{not look}} any closer, but rushed to the station and took a special train to Vienna. He hurried to the Emperor's Adjutant General, Count Paar, and {{requested}} him to break the appalling news to the Emperor. The stifling protocol that characterized every movement in the Hofburg swung ponderously into action; Paar remonstrated that only the Empress could break such catastrophic news to the Emperor. Baron Nopcsa, Controller of the Empress's Household, was sent for, and he in turn sent for Countess Ida Ferenczy, Empress Elisabeth's favorite Hungarian lady-in-waiting, to determine how Her Majesty should be informed. Elisabeth was at her Greek lesson, and was impatient at the interruption. White to the lips, Ferenczy announced that Baron Nopcsa had urgent news. Elisabeth replied that he must wait <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> later. The countess insisted {{that he must be}} received immediately, finally being forced to add that there was grave news about the Crown Prince. This account comes from Ferenczy herself and Archduchess Marie Valerie, to whom Elisabeth dictated her memory of the incident, in addition to the description in her diary.|$|E
25|$|Menu {{started from}} pole {{position}} while Dahlgren behind was tagged by Nykjær which saw the Volvo driver spin <b>and</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> across the track {{at the first}} corner {{as the rest of}} the field passed. Coronel and Tarquini then came together which caught out Tiago Monteiro, Javier Villa, Barth and Yoshimoto; Tarquini and Villa were able to continue. The safety car was brought out while the stranded cars were removed, when the race resumed on lap seven it was Muller leading from Menu and Huff. The following lap Menu was able to make a successful pass for the lead, two laps later Muller then made a mistake and dropped behind Huff and Nykjær. Aleksei Dudukalo had a narrow escape when he spun on the exit of the final corner and came close to hitting the pit wall while team–mate Tarquini had recovered to ninth place after his first lap collision. At the end of the race, Menu led a Chevrolet 1–2 with Huff while Nykjær claimed his first outright podium result in third and the independents' victory with it. Muller was fourth while Taniguchi claimed his best result in the championship by finishing seventh behind Turkington. Bennani in eighth resisted a late charge from Tarquini.|$|E
