40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyDavid B. MengelResearch {{has shown}} that {{nitrogen}} fertilizer is needed most years to optimize winter wheat yields in Kansas. Anhydrous ammonia (AA) {{has long been a}} favorite N fertilizer of producers as it {{has proven to be a}} reliable and economical source of N. Anhydrous application methods and equipment have changed little over the past 70 years. Recently John Deere has developed their 2510 HSLD (2510 H) <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> <b>applicator</b> designed to improve efficiency and performance in no-till systems. The 2510 H is designed to be run at high speed with low soil disturbance and low draft. This is achieved by using a rolling coulter type injection unit, designed much like modern single disk opener grain drill units, to apply AA at relatively shallow depths. With this low soil disturbance design, topdress AA applications may also be possible. Due to the environmental risks associated with wheat production, many Kansas producers prefer an N management system that consists of a “starter” application at planting with the majority of the N fertilizer applied in the spring. This approach makes certain that the crop survives the winter before the investment in N is made and eliminates the potential for fertilizer N being lost over the winter months. It has not been feasible to use AA for topdressing in the past due to the damage to the growing crop from application with traditional knife style applicators. The first part of this research revisits traditional preplant AA application methods by evaluating proper unit spacing and the use of nitrification inhibitors as well as comparing these AA treatments to common topdress applications of N. Over three site years, few consistently significant advantages between unit spacing, use of nitrification inhibitor or N management method were found. Unit spacing did show a notable trend favoring 50 cm spacing. The second part of this research was a two-year experiment conducted with the objective of assessing the feasibility of topdressing with AA using the 2510 H as compared with topdressing with granular urea. A number of factors such as application direction in relation to crop row, speed of application and timing as a function of crop development were examined to minimize crop injury and maximize crop yield. The initial 2010 study was promising, showing no significant yield loss topdressing with AA compared to topdressing with urea. The experiment was repeated at two locations in 2011. Results were mixed, indicated that soil conditions and the plants ability to recover from the AA application injury were important for the success of topdressing with AA. Lastly, an economic evaluation of the production economics of preplant and topdress AA was compared to the traditional practice of topdressing winter wheat with urea. Through evaluation of the agronomic and economic factors affecting the feasibility of uses of AA and the 2510 H, three main conclusions can be made: 1. Preplant application of AA has no agronomic advantage and only a small economic advantage over topdressing with urea when yields are the same. 2. Topdressing with AA is agronomically feasible but is at an economic disadvantage when compared to topdressing with urea, due to the yield reduction associated with the AA method. 3. Further research focused on reducing yield loss with topdress AA applications is needed before this N management strategy can be promoted on a large scale...|$|E

40|$|Some {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> is indistinguishable from other common nitrogen (N) fertilizers for corn (Zea mays L.) production, however, new soil and plant tissue tests give researchers more sensitive and precise tools for detecting situations where N may be deficient or sufficient. The existence of these new tools creates {{a need for a}} reexamination of the properties of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> fertilizer. This dissertation reports results from several studies using N- 15 -labeled and nonlabeled <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> for corn production in Iowa. The objectives were (i) to evaluate the possibility that injection of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> at sidedressing could result in reduced availability of N for growing corn plants, (ii) to evaluate the late-spring soil nitrate test and the end-of-season cornstalk test as tools for comparing broadcast N applied at different times of the year, (iii) evaluation of the effects of rate and timing of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> on late-spring soil nitrate concentrations, end-of-season stalk nitrate concentrations, and corn yields, and (iv) comparisons of the effects of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> and broadcast ammonium sulfate applied at selected rates and times;Results revealed no marked tendency for delayed availability of N for corn from sidedressed <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia.</b> However, substantial quantities of N were incorporated into forms not readily available for plants. The late-spring soil nitrate test and the end-of-season cornstalk test were more effective tools for comparing the N-supplying power of broadcast fertilizers applied at different times than were measurements of corn grain yields alone. Yields of corn grain tended to show no effect of N rate or application time when <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> was applied at selected times of the year.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> {{is one of}} {{the medium}} where the steel is easy to suffer stress {{corrosion}} cracking. Many stress corrosion crack accidents of ammonia storage tanks have been reported all over the world for recent years. 16 MnR low alloy steel with good composite mechanical properties is the most common used pressure vessel steel in China, it has better anticorrosion properties than the low alloy high strength steel, especially in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments. Many stress corrosion crack researches have been done for 16 MnR steel in wet hydrogen sulfide service for last decades, but less has been done in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments. Stress corrosion tests with eight constant strain pre-cracked specimen were carried out in this work. The pre-cracked specimen were loaded with loading bolts and put into the special ammonia storage tank for tests, they were taken out from the tank periodically to measure crack length. The stress corrosion crack growth rate and the threshold stress intensity factors KISCC of 16 MnR steel in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> environments were measured. Based on test results, the effects of environmental factors and steel strength on stress corrosion cracking of 16 MnR steel in <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> service were analyzed.

40|$|<b>Anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia,</b> {{containing}} 82 %N, is {{the highest}} analysis nitrogen fertiliser available for commercial use. Lyons (1966) states that it has many economic advantages in handling, transporting and application over conventional nitrogen fertilisers and that the high nitrogen content, plus {{the fact that it}} {{can be applied to the}} soil without further manufacturing costs, has made it the most economical form of nitrogen fertiliser in the USA. It was therefore concluded that a comparative research study into crop responses to <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia</b> and other nitrogen fertilisers could be a valuable prerequisite to its commercial use in New Zealand, and should commence with glasshouse and then field evaluation using small scale experiments initially. The investigations in this thesis mostly involve small scale pot and field trials using a small precision applicator based on the injection equipment used by Parr and Papendick (Parr and Papendick 1967). This work is followed by a study of root distribution using 32 P and the uptake on <b>anhydrous</b> <b>ammonia.</b> A field experiment was set up using a large field applicator to evaluate the optimum period between application and spring sowing.
