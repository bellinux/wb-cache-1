Data from sensors with multiplate radiation shields and collocated, fan-aspirated <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> from three buoy deployments during TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment) and the Arabian Sea Mixed Layer Dynamics Experiment {{are used to}} describe the errors in the naturally ventilated measurements. The naturally ventilated sensors have mean daytime errors of 0. 27 !C and maximum instantaneous errors of 3. 4 !C. The errors are at times larger than the difference between the air and sea surface temperatures. These errors lead to mean daytime biases in sensible and latent heat fluxes of 1 – 4 W m" 2 and instantaneous errors up to 22 W m" 2. The heating errors increase with increasing shortwave radiation and diminish with increasing wind speed. The radiative heating is also found to be a function of sun elevation with maximum heating errors occurring at elevations of approximately 45 !. A simple model of sensor heating that balances the radiative heating with convective and conductive cooling is presented. This model can be used with empirically determined coefficients and observations of wind speed and shortwave radiation to quantify the radiative heating errors in naturally ventilated <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|Both {{approaches}} are used {{almost exclusively on}} electronic fuel injection (EFI) engines. Both sensor designs output a 0.0-5.0 volt or a pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal that {{is proportional to the}} air mass flow rate, and both sensors have an intake <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> (IAT) <b>sensor</b> incorporated into their housings for most post OBDII vehicles. Vehicles prior to 1996 could have MAF without an IAT. An example is 1994 Infiniti Q45.|$|R
50|$|There are {{exceptions}} to this however. Some vehicles, such as the 1992 and 1993 Fox body Mustangs, do use such as a system {{even though they have}} multi-port fuel injection, presumably to help the air-fuel mixture burn at the proper rate in cold weather, as even though the fuel has finely atomized, it has not properly vaporized, and therefore flame propagation will be otherwise slower. These vehicles have a MAF sensor, <b>Air</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> and when equipped with the 2.3L 4-cylinder, two spark-plugs per cylinder. This combination ensures the air is just warm enough to vaporise the droplets and does very noticeably improve performance and emissions {{at the same time in}} cold, northern winter weather.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{change of the}} RC45 when {{released}} {{was the use of}} Programmed Fuel Injection. Fuel injection had been used on bikes previously but these had either been rather antiquated analog computers or very simple digital units with a minimal number of sensors for input, which resulted in very crude fueling. The RC30 had used 38 mm constant velocity carburettors which, for road use are quite nice, maintaining a high air velocity across a wide rpm range, though were not as well suited for racing. The RC45 did away with carburetors and in their absence a brace of four 46 mm throttles were replaced, Honda now had the throttle area it needed to make big horsepower at high revolutions. The system Honda used on the RC45 was very similar to the system used on the NR750. Contrary to popular belief the RC45’s fuel injection is not like a 4-stage carburetor, rather it is a proper fuel only system. Honda kept the ignition system separate. The Honda system obtained information from the following sensors: crankshaft position sensor, camshaft position sensor, <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> coolant temperature sensor, manifold absolute pressure sensor, throttle position sensor, barometric sensor and battery voltage. With all of these sensors relaying information to the ECU, Honda could have quite easily incorporated the ignition control unit. The reason that they had not came down to the supplier of parts: they had different manufacturers supplying the ecu and cdi units. Regardless, it allowed the use of very large throttle plates seamlessly over a very wide engine operating range. The engine of the RC45 also used many magnesium castings, as of rather recently, it has become quite common to see fuel injection and magnesium engine parts on motorcycles, though in the early-to-mid 1990’s this was expensive and incredibly innovative.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn France, the {{building}} sector {{is the main}} energy consumer. Moreover single-family houses represent about 60 % of annual dwelling construction. Assessment of energy performance of occupied dwellings is therefore a very important task. The challenge is therefore {{to reduce the number}} of sensors, while keeping a sufficient robustness and precision of the information. In this paper we try to contribute to this field. The main idea is to use existing industrial sensors, and to limit their number with minimal loss of information. Experimental data are analyzed in order to quantify possible correlations between them. Strong correlation indicated that it is possible to reduce number of measurements. In the first part of the paper an experimental unoccupied house is analyzed. Then some measurements from real occupied dwelling are investigated.

5000|$|The computer, in 1993, was run via Speed Density, which {{measured}} {{engine speed}} (RPM) and load (MAP in kPa) to compute airflow requirements {{and then use}} that against the VE table to get the proper fueling for conditions. An IAT (Intake <b>Air</b> <b>Temperature</b> <b>sensor)</b> was also used as air density changes with temperature. In 1994 however, the computer logic was changed over to a Mass Air Flow system. This system uses a Mass Air Flow Sensor {{placed in front of}} the throttle body to measure the incoming airflow into the motor. This is measured by using a heated wire in the sensor in the airstream path which has heat pulled away from it via the incoming air. This reduced heat is converted into a voltage signal which is sent to the PCM which then converts that voltage signal into mass flow. The computer uses engine sensors to judge engine conditions and provide the proper fueling off of this mass airflow reading. This {{was one of the main}} differences between the 93 and 94+ F-Body cars (and 92-93 Vette's compared to 94-96) and one of the items that makes a 93 model unique. Another prominent difference between the [...] "Speed Density" [...] 93's and the 94+ cars is how the programming (or custom tuning) of the computer takes place. In 1993, the stock computer uses a Memcal chip, which is a removable chip from the computer. Contained in this chip is the program for the car to run. In the 1994+ cars, this was swapped to a non-removable reflashable chip, which could be reprogrammed via the Assembly Line Diagnostic Link, or ALDL, located underneath the driver side of the dash, next to the center console. Many people view this as a more user-friendly and easier way to tune the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Automatic fault {{detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) {{can help enhance}} building energy efficiency by facilitating early detection of occurrence of system faults, especially those of air-conditioning systems, thus enabling rectification of the faults before much energy is wasted due to such faults. However, building owners may not invest in FDD unless they are convinced of the energy cost savings that can be achieved. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study on the energy cost impacts of a range of common system faults in variable air volume (VAV) air-conditioning systems, which are widely adopted for their good part-load energy efficiency. The faults studied include room <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck VAV box damper, supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck outdoor air damper and stuck/leaking cooling coil valve. The simulation results indicate that some faults may significantly increase energy use in buildings, for example, negative room <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck open VAV box damper, negative supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck open outdoor air damper and stuck open and leaking cooling coil valve. Since building occupants may adapt to the symptoms of these faults, such as reduced room air temperature, and thus may not complain about them, the occurrence of such faults are not immediately apparent unless a FDD system is available. Some other faults, e. g. positive supply <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, positive room <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> offset, stuck closed cooling coil valve and stuck closed VAV box damper, may allow less energy to be used but will lead to unbearable indoor environmental conditions, such as high indoor temperature. Such faults, therefore, can easily be detected even without a FDD system, as there will be feedback from the building occupants. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
