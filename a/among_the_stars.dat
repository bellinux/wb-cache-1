25|$|Eustathius {{said that}} Poseidon first saw her dancing at Naxos {{among the other}} Nereids, and carried her off.

25|$|The {{rotation}} {{axis of the}} Earth describes, over {{a period}} of 25,700 years, a small circle (blue) <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> centered on the ecliptic north pole (the blue E) and with an angular radius of about 23.4°, an angle known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis 5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.|$|E

Some stellar coronae, particularly in young stars, are much more luminous than the Sun's. For example, FK Comae Berenices is the prototype for the FK Com class of variable star. These are giants of spectral types G and K with an unusually rapid rotation and signs of extreme activity. Their X-ray coronae {{are among the most}} luminous (Lx ≥ 1032 erg·s−1 or 1025W) and the hottest known with dominant temperatures up to 40 MK.|$|E

25|$|Coronal stars, or stars {{within a}} coronal cloud, are {{ubiquitous}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> {{in the cool}} half of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

The experiments aboard ANS succeeded in finding X-ray signals from Capella and Sirius (α CMa). X-ray emission from an enhanced solar-like corona was proposed for the first time. The high temperature of Capella's corona as obtained from the first coronal X-ray spectrum of Capella using HEAO 1 required magnetic confinement unless it was a free-flowing coronal wind.|$|E
25|$|Other stories {{say that}} Asclepius was killed because after {{bringing}} people {{back from the}} dead, Hades thought that no more dead spirits {{would come to the}} underworld, so he asked his brother Zeus to stop him. This angered Apollo who in turn killed the Cyclopes who made the thunderbolts for Zeus. For this act, Zeus suspended Apollo from the night sky and commanded Apollo to serve Admetus, King of Thessaly for a year. Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes that made his thunderbolts. After Asclepius's death, Zeus placed his body <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> as the constellation Ophiuchus ("the Serpent Holder").|$|E
25|$|According to the myth, Zeus {{gave the}} infant Dionysus {{to the care}} of Hermes. One version of the story is that Hermes took the boy to King Athamas and his wife Ino, Dionysus' aunt. Hermes bade the couple to raise the boy as a girl, to hide him from Hera's wrath. Another version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> (see Hyades star cluster). Other {{versions}} have Zeus giving him to Rhea, or to Persephone to raise in the Underworld, away from Hera. Alternatively, he was raised by Maro.|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{is named}} after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed {{next to each other}} <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the North Celestial Pole on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} The New Atalantis by Delarivier Manley (1709), {{distinguished}} from the two others by the single letter, is an equally dystopian work but set this time on a fictional Mediterranean island. In it sexual violence and exploitation is made {{a metaphor for the}} hypocritical behaviour of politicians in their dealings with the general public. In Manley’s case, the target of satire was the Whig Party, while in David Maclean Parry's The Scarlet Empire (1906) it is Socialism as practised in foundered Atlantis. It was followed in Russia by Velemir Khlebnikov's poem The Fall of Atlantis (Gibel' Atlantidy, 1912), which is set in a future rationalist dystopia that has discovered the secret of immortality and is so dedicated to progress that it has lost touch with the past. When the high priest of this ideology is tempted by a slave girl into an act of irrationality, he murders her and precipitates a second flood, above which her severed head floats vengefully <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{precession}} in On the Length of the Year. Two kinds of year {{are relevant to}} understanding his work. The tropical year is {{the length of time}} that the Sun, as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> on the celestial sphere). The sidereal year is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p.209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p.218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.|$|E
