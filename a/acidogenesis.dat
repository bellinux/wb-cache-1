On the other hand, copper (Cu) inhibited <b>acidogenesis</b> at all tested concentrations ranging 5 - 400 mg 1 - 1. Production of acetate was inhibited by both metals at all concentrations; but production of propionate and hydrogen was favored at low concentrations of Zn (up to 80 mg 1 - 1) and Cu (up to 40 mg 1 - 1).

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} degradation of polymeric materials was studied in batch tests by {{determination of the}} conversion yields to volatile fatty acids (<b>acidogenesis)</b> or to methane (methanogenesis). By both methods, filter paper, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), and two starch‐containing plastic materials (low and high starch contents) were examined with glucose and polyethylene as positive and negative control, respectively. Conversion yields were {{expressed in terms of}} Theoretical Oxygen Demand (ThOD). Methanogenesis and <b>acidogenesis</b> are basically analogous with respect to the final conversion yield. PHB and filter paper show a high conversion yield, comparable to glucose. The material with low amount of starch additive presents very low conversion yields, whereas the starch‐based material is significantly degraded, even if in percentages not higher than starch content. Acidogenic tests are always quicker than methanogenic tests. The rate determining step is generally the hydrolysis of the particulate substrate in the case of <b>acidogenesis</b> and the methane formation in case of methanogenesis. Moreover, <b>acidogenesis</b> appears less sensitive to inhibition in the presence of sulphate.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{of olive oil}} mill effluents (OME), even when performed with the most appropriate technology (i. e. anaerobic digestion) meets great difficulties in reaching the depuration efficiencies required by national regulations all over the Mediterranean area. This paper was aimed at gaining better insight into the degradation of the main compounds contained in the OME; in particular, {{the interaction between the}} two successive stages occurring in the anaerobic digestion, the <b>acidogenesis</b> and the methanogenesis, was investigated. First of all, the best operating conditions were identified. Most of the lipids were degraded both in <b>acidogenesis</b> and methanogenesis tests. On the other hand, polyphenol-like substances were not degraded at all in acidogenic conditions, whereas they were partially removed in methanogenic conditions. A little methanogenic activity, established in acidogenic conditions because of the partial degradation of the chemical inhibitor, seems to be the key factor determining lipids degradation even in <b>acidogenesis</b> tests. Synthetic solutions were also tested. Oleic acid was degraded both in <b>acidogenesis</b> and methanogenesis tests, provided that an easily biodegradable substrate (glucose) was added to the solution. The presence of glucose was also required for the degradation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in methanogenic conditions. This acid was not degraded at all in acidogenic conditions, thus confirming the results obtained in the tests on OME. Even if slightly lower, bioconversion yields of OME in <b>acidogenesis</b> are remarkably less sensitive to the effect of pH and substrate conditions than in methanogenesis. This result suggests that a two-phase anaerobic digestion might be adopted as a suitable process for optimizing OME degradation...|$|E

30|$|The latency {{phase is}} 2  h, {{resulting}} {{from the use of}} an organic complex chemical composition, which needs the intervention of bacteria in the first three stages of anaerobic digestion (hydrolysis, <b>acidogenesis</b> and acetogenesis) to degrade and convert the substrates available for the methanogenic stage (acetate, CO 2 and H 2). This time (2  h) is very short in other works, which have very high latency time of up to a few days (Afilal et al. 2014; Budiyono et al. 2010). Therefore, this short latency time showed that the inoculum used in this study includes a range of bacteria for hydrolysis, with high-performance <b>acidogenesis</b> and acetogenesis, which rapidly degrades droppings and makes the substrates available for the production of methane. Thus, this short period may be utilized by methanogenic bacteria that are acclimatizing to environmental conditions and new substrates (Nopharatana et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{low-cost}} alternative approach (i. e., adding aged refuse (AR) into waste activated sludge) to significantly enhance anaerobic digestion of sludge was reported. Experimental {{results showed that}} with the addition dosage of AR increasing from 0 to 400 mg/g dry sludge soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) increased from 1150 to 5240 mg/L at the digestion time of 5 d, while the maximal production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) increased from 82. 6 to 183. 9 mg COD/g volatile suspended solids. Although further increase of AR addition decreased the concentrations of both soluble COD and VFA, their contents in these systems with AR addition at any concentration investigated were still higher {{than those in the}} blank, which resulted in higher methane yields in these systems. Mechanism studies revealed that pertinent addition of AR promoted solubilization, hydrolysis, and <b>acidogenesis</b> processes and did not affect methanogenesis significantly. It was found that varieties of enzymes and anaerobes in AR were primary reason for the enhancement of anaerobic digestion. Humic substances in AR benefited hydrolysis and <b>acidogenesis</b> but inhibited methanogenesis. The effect of heavy metals in AR on sludge anaerobic digestion was dosage dependent. Sludge anaerobic digestion was enhanced by appropriate amounts of heavy metals but inhibited by excessive amounts of heavy metals.

Throughout the enrichment process, which lasted up to 73 cycles, the sludge samples were analyzed for their volatile suspended solids (VSS) as well as ECP's protein (ECP(p)) and carbohydrate (ECP(c)) contents.

The simulation results obtained support the approach by good predictions of the dynamic behavior of cumulative methane production, pH values {{as well as the}} concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate and inorganic nitrogen. The sensitivity analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation showed that the stoichiometric coefficients for amino acids <b>acidogenesis</b> had high sensitivities to the outputs of the model. The model further indicated that the Gibbs free energies from the uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), valerate and butyrate were positive through the digestion, while the free energies for other components were negative. During the digestion, the cumulative heat productions from microbial activities and methane were 77. 69 kJ and 185. 76 kJ, respectively.

The experimental work was carried out at the laboratories of the Department of Civil Engineering, Environmental and Materials (DICAM) of the Faculty of Engineering. The main objective was to enhance the treatment of high organic loading waste, such as manure and cheese whey, through advanced anaerobic digestion systems {{in order to obtain}} biogas rich in methane. On the basis of the premise that the environmental conditions pertaining in most anaerobic wastewater digesters are not optimal for both fermentative and methanogenic microorganisms, the research was particularly focused on the implementation of two-phase anaerobic digesters. In fact a two-phase process permits selection and enrichment of different bacteria in each digester by independently controlling the digester operating conditions. Thus, the first phase (<b>acidogenesis)</b> can be operated to optimize acidogenic growth and the second phase (methanogenesis) to optimize methanogenic growth. (Ince O., 1998).

40|$|<b>Acidogenesis</b> is {{responsible}} to convert complex organics into volatile fatty acids (VFA), whose metabolic rate and production type have important effects on the whole anaerobic digestion. A novel strategy for enhancing anaerobic wastewater treatment via dosing Fe powder (40 g) in an acidogenic reactor (2 L) is described. The {{results showed that the}} hydrolysis/fermentation was accelerated by Fe dosing. As a result, the acidogenic performances in COD removal (45 - 56 %) and VFA production (1170 - 1340 mg/L) were less affected by shortened hydraulic retention time (HRT) from 6 to 2 h. However, COD removal declined to 25 % and VFA production decreased to 661 mg/L in a reference reactor without Fe dosing (A 2). Besides, Fe dosing optimized fermentation type, namely, the production of propionate was decreased, which was favorable for subsequent acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis indicated that Fe dosing increased the abundance of acidogens, especially acetogens. The methanogenic reactor fed with the effluent of A 1 had higher COD removal and treatment stability with almost no propionate detected.
