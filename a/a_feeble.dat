5|$|New {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> document.|$|E
5|$|The years {{following}} the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. <b>A</b> <b>feeble</b> attempt at a common peace {{had been made in}} 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.|$|E
5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E

It was <b>a</b> <b>feebler</b> relief, <b>a</b> <b>feebler</b> triumph she felt now, but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as {{beautiful}} as ever, perhaps more beautiful, for there was a more luxuriant womanliness about Hetty of late.

Australian slow left-armer Brad Young took a hat-trick to finish with an exceptional analysis of 4–2–4–4.

The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her or his child, able to offer only <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> apology as Dot departs sadly.|$|E

On 24 January, two battalions of GM 32 deserted westwards towards Thailand. They were talked back to their positions; however, GM 32 still seethed on the verge of mutiny. On 27 April 1972, the operation ended when GM 32 was withdrawn back to Pakxe before they could rebel again, leaving the remainder of the task force to man <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> blocking position.|$|E
25|$|When {{the news}} reached the Spanish headquarters, Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands, and {{commander-in-chief}} of the Spanish {{forces in the}} Low Countries, sent his son Don Fadrique with 4,000 soldiers (other 16,000 soldiers were coming from the north), along with the Maestre de Campo Chiappino Vitelli, to defeat Louis of Nassau and retrieve Mons. On 23 June Fadrique's forces arrived at Mons and laid siege to the city. Furthermore, in early June, the Duke of Alba, {{at the head of}} the bulk of the Spanish army, recaptured Valenciennes after <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> defence of the Protestant garrison, depriving the rebels, and their French allies, of one of their main bases.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, it is {{stated that}} Issachar {{was born on}} the fourth of Av, and lived 122 years. According to the midrashic Book of Jasher, Issachar married Aridah, the younger daughter of Jobab, a son of Joktan; the Torah states that Issachar had four sons, who were born in Canaan and migrated with him to Egypt, with their descendants remaining there until the Exodus. The midrashic Book of Jasher portrays Issachar as somewhat pragmatic, due to his strong effort in being more learned, less involved with other matters which led him to such actions like taking <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> part in military campaigns involving his brothers, and generally residing in strongly fortified cities and, depending on his brother Zebulun's financial support in return for a share in the spiritual reward he gains.|$|E

25|$|However, the Giants {{did have}} a chance to win. Delvin Joyce {{returned}} Chandler's short kickoff 32 yards to the 47-yard line. Collins then led them to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds left. But Junkin botched a snap for a 41-yard field goal attempt, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> pass play that fell incomplete. The Giants were also called for having an illegal man downfield on the play, and the game ended. The following day, it was revealed that the penalized player (guard Rich Seubert) had in fact checked in as an eligible receiver before the field goal attempt, although a different Giant lineman (guard Tam Hopkins) actually was illegally downfield. NFL Vice President of Officiating Mike Pereira admitted pass interference also should have been called on 49ers defensive end Chike Okeafor for pulling down Seubert. Had the two right calls been made, the down would have been replayed at the previous spot, the San Francisco 23.|$|E
25|$|I {{could not}} help {{thinking}} what <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> and futile effort to keep down Jacobinism this bill must be, when compar'd with the effect to be produc'd by all the consequences arising from compromising with its existence under color of a peace with the Nation—what {{is to be done}} with all their Coms Ambassadors, Consuls, and Citizens? Are they to range at large, in every town and every house, preaching their doctrines, and perhaps even buying proselytes?—are Englishmen to be sent to Paris to be witnesses of the successful result of audacious usurpation, and of the elevation of Tom Paine, from a Staymaker to a fine Gentleman, from an Exciseman to a Sovereign, as the reward of the Rights of Man and the Age of Reason—I fear Restriction and Coercion will avail little against the influence of example—but our Ministers have made up their minds, to save Jacobinism, at its last gasp, and the experiment of shaking hands with it...|$|E
25|$|In April 1756, Alwardi Khan {{died and}} was succeeded by his twenty-three-year-old grandson, Siraj-ud-daulah. His {{personality}} {{was said to}} be a combination of a ferocious temper and <b>a</b> <b>feeble</b> understanding. He was particularly suspicious of the large profits made by the European companies in India. When the British and the French started improving their fortifications in anticipation of another war between them, he immediately ordered them to stop such activities as they had been done without permission. When the British refused to cease their constructions, the Nawab led a detachment of 3,000 men to surround the fort and factory of Cossimbazar and took several British officials as prisoners, before moving to Calcutta. The defences of Calcutta were weak and negligible. The garrison consisted of only 180 soldiers, 50 European volunteers, 60 European militia, 150 Armenian and Portuguese militia, 35 European artillery-men and 40 volunteers from ships and was pitted against the Nawab's force of nearly 50,000 infantry and cavalry. The city was occupied on 16 June by Siraj's force and the fort surrendered after a brief siege on 20 June.|$|E
