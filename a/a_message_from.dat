The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E

5|$|Beaujeu, having {{fulfilled}} {{his mission}} in escorting the colonists across the ocean, returned to France aboard the Joly in mid-March 1685. Many of the colonists chose {{to return to}} France with him, leaving approximately 180. Although Beaujeu delivered <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> La Salle requesting additional supplies, French authorities, having made peace with Spain, never responded. The remaining colonists suffered from dysentery and venereal diseases, and people died daily. Those who were fit helped build crude dwellings and a temporary fort on Matagorda Island.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, Lambert {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Hamelin, promising to release all the prisoners under conditions of parole within one month if Île de la Passe and Iphigenia were both surrendered without resistance. The message also threatened that if Lambert refused, the French would attack and overwhelm the badly outnumbered British force. Recognising that food supplies were low, reinforcements had not arrived and that his ammunition stores were almost empty, Lambert agreed to the terms. Lambert later received <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> Decaen proposing similar terms and notified the French governor that he had surrendered to Hamelin. Decaen was furious that Hamelin had agreed terms without consulting him, but eventually agreed to accept {{the terms of the}} surrender as well. The wounded were treated by French doctors at Grand Port and later repatriated, although the remainder of the prisoners were placed in a cramped and unpleasant prison at Port Napoleon from which, despite the terms of the surrender, they were not released until British forces captured the island in December.|$|E

5|$|Various {{protocols}} {{have been}} drawn up detailing {{a course of action}} for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received. No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law, and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.|$|E

5|$|At 07:15 Admiral Nagumo {{ordered the}} B5Ns on Kaga and Akagi rearmed with bombs for another attack on Midway itself. This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft. The process normally took {{about an hour and a}} half; more time would be required to bring the aircraft up to the flight deck, and to warm up and launch the strike group. Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted.

5|$|Despite the misgivings of the expedition's commanders, {{the fleet}} left Brest as {{scheduled}} on 15 December 1796, one day ahead of <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> the Directory calling off the entire operation. De Galles {{knew that the}} British would be watching Brest harbour: their frigates were a constant presence {{as part of the}} Inshore Squadron of the blockade. In an effort to disguise his force's intentions, he first anchored in Camaret Bay and issued orders for his ships to pass through the Raz de Sein. The Raz was a dangerous narrow channel littered with rocks and sandbanks and subject to heavy surf during bad weather, but would also obscure the size, strength and direction of the French fleet from the British squadron offshore, which French scouts claimed consisted of 30 ships.|$|E
