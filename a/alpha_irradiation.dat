The stability has been determined by UV-Visible spectroscopy. In the absence of <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation,</b> the results have shown that Tc(VII) is reduced in HTFMS between 4 and 11 M.

At highly concentrated HTFMS (11 M), the Tc(VII) species remains stable.

40|$|The {{option of}} direct {{disposal}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} in a deep geological formation raises the need to investigate the long-term behavior of the UO 2 matrix in aqueous media subjected to alpha-beta-gamma radiation. The beta-gamma emitters account {{for most of the}} activity of spent fuel at the moment it is removed from the reactor, but diminish within a millennial time frame by over three orders of magnitude to less than the long-term activity. The latter persists over much longer time periods and must therefore be taken into account over a geological disposal time scale. Leaching experiments with solution renewal were carried out on UO 2 pellets doped with alpha emitters (Pu- 238 and Pu- 239) to quantify the impact of <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation</b> on UO 2 matrix alteration. Three batches of doped UO 2 pellets with different alpha flux levels (3. 30 x 10 (4), 3. 30 x 10 (5), and 3. 2 x 10 (6) alphacm(- 2) s(- 1)) were studied. The results obtained in aerated and deaerated media immediately after sample annealing or interim storage in air provide {{a better understanding of the}} UO 2 matrix alteration mechanisms under <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Interim storage in air Of UO 2 pellets doped with alpha emitters results in variations of the UO 2 surface reactivity, which depends on the alpha particle flux at the interface and on the interim storage duration. The variation in the surface reactivity and the greater uranium release following interim storage cannot be attributed to the effect of alpha radiolysis in aerated media since the uranium release tends toward the same value after several leaching cycles for the doped UO 2 pellet batches and spent fuel. Oxygen diffusion enhanced by <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation</b> of the extreme surface layer and/or radiolysis of the air could account for the oxidation of the surface UO 2 to UO 2 +x.

The main objective was to study particles impacts on the detectors applicable to future observations in orbit and possible hard and/or soft curing to restore its performances. Cobalt- 60 gamma ray irradiations did not show significant degradation, so we mainly focused on single events effects (SEE). Protons and <b>alphas</b> <b>irradiations</b> were then performed at the Van de Graaf tandem accelerator at the Institut de Physique Nucleaire (IPN, Orsay, France), respectively at 20 MeV and 30 MeV. Observation showed that the shape of signal perturbations clearly depends on the location of the impacts either on the detector itself or the read-out circuit. Software curing has then to be anticipated in order to deglitch the signal.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{hypothesis}} of direct disposal of spent fuel in a geological nuclear waste repository, interactions between the fuel mainly composed of UO 2 and its environment must be understood. The dissolution rate of the UO 2 matrix, which depends on the redox conditions on the fuel surface, will {{have a major impact}} on the release of radionuclides into the environment. The reducing conditions expected for a geological disposal situation would appear to be favorable as regards the solubility and stability of the UO 2 matrix, but may be disturbed on the surface of irradiated fuel. In particular, the local redox conditions will result from a competition between the radiolysis effects of water under <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation</b> (simultaneously producing oxidizing species like H 2 O 2, hydrogen peroxide, and reducing species like H 2, hydrogen) and those of redox active species from the environment. In particular, Fe 2 +, a strongly reducing aqueous species coming from the corrosion of the iron canister or from the host rock, could influence the dissolution of the fuel matrix. The effect of iron on the oxidative dissolution of UO 2 was thus investigated under the conditions of the French disposal site, a Callovian-Oxfordian clay formation chosen by the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra), here tested under <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation.</b> For this study, UO 2 fuel pellets doped with a radioactive alpha emitter (238 / 239 Pu) were leached in synthetic Callovian-Oxfordian groundwater (representative of the French waste disposal site groundwater) in the presence of a metallic iron foil to simulate the steel canister. The pellets had varying levels of alpha activity, in order to modulate the concentrations of species produced by water radiolysis on the surface and to simulate the activity of aged spent fuel after 50 and 10, 000 years of alpha radioactivity decay. The experimental data showed that whatever the sample alpha radioactivity, the presence of iron inhibits the oxidizing dissolution of UO 2 and leads to low uranium concentrations (between 4 × 10 − 10 and 4 × 10 − 9 M), through a reactional mechanism located in the very first microns of the UO 2 /water reactional interface. The mechanism involves consumption of oxidizing species, in particular of H 2 O 2 by Fe 2 + at the precise place where these species are produced, and is accompanied by the precipitation of an akaganeite-type Fe 3 + hydroxide on the surface. The higher the radioactivity of the samples, the greater the precipitation induced. Modeling has been developed, coupling chemistry with transport and based on the main reactional mechanisms identified, which enables accurate reproduction of the mineralogy of the system under study, giving the nature of the phases under observation as well as the location of their precipitation. Obviously without excluding a potential contribution from the hydrogen produced by the anoxic corrosion of the iron foil, this study has shown that iron plays a major role in this oxidizing dissolution inhibition process for the system investigated (localized alpha radiolysis). This inhibitor effect associated with iron is therefore strongly dependent on the location of the redox front, which is found on the surface in the case of <b>alpha</b> <b>irradiation</b> UO 2 /water reactional interface...|$|E

Additionally, in vitro and ex vivo studies do not provide a comprehensive explanation of the causal effects of radiation in tissues as these methods lack the complexity of a complete organism with interacting tissues. Thyroid tissue consists of many different cell types, both tissue-specific (thyrocytes and C cells) and general cells (e.g., endothelial, muscular, and fat cells). It is not likely that a single gene {{will be able to}} function as a retrospective biomarker for biodosimetry; however, computational informatics have been used to construct a 74 multi-genetic signature {{that can be used to}} distinguish between four different absorbed doses (0.5, 2, 5, and 8 Gy using Cs- 137 as a gamma source), an approach which this present study supports [...]...|$|R
