40|$|Scaling {{the size}} of {{parallel}} systems while maintaining the system performance is an important problem. A default scaling approach by using larger networks to interconnect more processors works only up to a limited extent and the derived configurations using this approach are not cost-effective. Recent <b>advents</b> in VLSI and packaging technologies now offer multiple processors on a single multichip module. This offers potential to design larger systems by replacing each processor in a base system by a processor-cluster. Similarly, <b>advents</b> in the interconnection network technology now provide {{the ability to use}} wider and faster network channels. In this paper we analyze the scaling of systems by taking into account current interconnection and processor-integration technolgies. The impact of software overhead to send and receive messages in parallel system on its scalability is also demonstrated. Our results indicate that systems with high message overhead costs can be scaled in a cost-effec [...] ...|$|R
