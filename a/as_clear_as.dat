5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E

25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> fiber, one could see {{all the way to the}} bottom even of the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|MEG signals {{were first}} {{measured}} by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before {{the availability of}} the SQUID, using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.|$|E

The Rolling Stones performed two sets that night and it is the second concert that was more heavily bootlegged and has sharper sound. Bootleggers had collaborated to record Stones shows across the United States, recording them on two-track Sony recorders for months prior to the release of the album. At least one source claims that the recordings initially came from rock promoter Bill Graham's staff, who used the tapes for broadcast on KSAN and released their edit on Lurch Records in early 1970.|$|E

[...] When comparing Sephiroth with the Final Fantasy VI villain, Kefka Palazzo, GamesRadar commented that he [...] "seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown." [...] 1UP.com took a humorous approach to Sephiroth's several appearances after apparent deaths and in other games, ranking him third in their [...] "They Is Risen" [...] feature, which covered the ten most notorious video game resurrections. The publication noted that if the character continued to be used, Square Enix would eventually [...] "run out of ways to remix One-Winged Angel." [...] GameSpy editor Ryan Scott called Sephiroth the [...] "King of Overrated Characters" [...] during GameSpy's villain feature for Dissidia Final Fantasy, arguing that gamers were impressed by him only because of his design and by how he killed Aerith during Final Fantasy VII. On the other hand, AnimeFringe called him [...] "the most notorious villain in the entire Final Fantasy series" [...] and [...] "quintessential bishōnen {{in the eyes of}} many fans -- male and female," [...] comparing him with Kefka and praising his complexity.|$|E
500|$|In the {{hypothetical}} case of Smith v. Jones in which Congress enacted a statute that says [...] "Smith wins", the majority {{would find it}} unconstitutional because it [...] "would create no new substantive law." [...] In the Chief Justice's view, it would: before the passage of {{the hypothetical}} statute, the law did not provide that Smith wins; after passage of the hypothetical statute, it does. For the Chief Justice, [...] "the question is whether its action constitutes an exercise of judicial power." [...] Both the hypothetical [...] "Smith wins" [...] statute and §8772 both have the same effect, which is essentially the legislature's [...] "'policy judgment'" [...] that one side in the case wins. He compared the majority's opinion, which found that §8772 left plenty of issues for the District Court to adjudicate, to [...] "a constitutional Maginot Line, easily circumvented by the simplest maneuver of taking away every defense against Smith's victory, without saying 'Smith wins.'" [...] Section8772 only required the courts to make two decisions—that Bank Markazi had an equitable interest in the assets and no one else did—that were both already clear before §8772 was enacted. By the majority's view of [...] "plenty", [...] the Chief Justice contended that, in the hypothetical case Smith v. Jones, the majority would uphold a judgment for Smith if the court finds that Jones was served notice of the lawsuit and the case was within the statute of limitations. Strongly criticizing the majority, the Chief Justice, quoting Federalist No. 48, concluded that the majority's [...] "failure to enforce [...] in a case <b>as</b> <b>clear</b> <b>as</b> this reduces Article III to a mere 'parchment barrier against the encroaching spirit' of legislative power." ...|$|E
