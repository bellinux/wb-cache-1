5|$|Although {{no serious}} {{injuries}} arose from any short-pitched deliveries while <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> theory field was actually set, the tactic still led to considerable ill feeling {{between the two}} teams, particularly when Australian batsmen suffered actual injuries in separate incidents, which inflamed the watching crowds. The controversy eventually spilled into the diplomatic arena.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> robot <b>leg</b> (or robotic <b>leg)</b> is <b>a</b> {{mechanical}} <b>leg</b> {{that can}} be used to perform the same functions that <b>a</b> human <b>leg</b> can. The robotic leg is typically programmed to execute similar functions that <b>a</b> human <b>leg</b> would perform. <b>A</b> robotic <b>leg</b> is similar to a prosthetic leg; however, <b>a</b> robotic <b>leg</b> can be controlled electrically or mechanically. In order to have the robotic leg exhibit behaviors of <b>a</b> human’s <b>leg,</b> surgeons have to redirect the nerves that previously controlled some of the person’s lower-leg muscles in order to cause the thigh muscles to contract. Sensors are also embedded in the robotic leg to measure the electrical pulses that are created by both a re-innervated muscle contraction, and the existing thigh muscle.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most track relays, {{each member}} of the team runs a {{different}} distance. A distance medley relay is made up of <b>a</b> 1200 meter <b>leg</b> (three laps on a standard 400 meter track), <b>a</b> 400 meter <b>leg</b> (one lap), <b>an</b> 800 meter <b>leg</b> (two laps), and <b>a</b> 1600 meter <b>leg</b> (four laps) in that order. The total distance run is 4000 meters, or nearly 2.5 miles. Aside from the 400 meter segment, which is <b>a</b> sprint, all <b>legs</b> are <b>a</b> middle distance run. Prior to going metric, the distance medley relay consisted of <b>a</b> 440 yard <b>leg,</b> <b>an</b> 880 yard <b>leg,</b> <b>a</b> 1320 yard <b>leg</b> and <b>a</b> one mile <b>leg.</b> The total distance for the old distance medley relay was 4400 yards and the total distance for the current metric distance medley relay is 4374.45 yards - slightly over 25 yards shorter than the old race.|$|R
50|$|The {{format of}} the Classic changed over the years. In 2002, the tournament had a sets format with best of 7 legs per set. In 2003, the tournament had <b>a</b> <b>legs</b> only format {{throughout}} with a round robin group stage of 8 groups with 3 players each, before it became straight knockout from the quarter finals onwards. In 2004 and 2005, the tournament reverted to straight knockout with a sets format with best of 5 legs per set throughout. In 2006, the tournament had <b>a</b> <b>legs</b> only format in the Last 32, before reverting to a sets format with best of 5 legs per set for the Last 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and the Final. From 2007 to 2009, the tournament remained straight knockout but moved back to <b>a</b> <b>legs</b> only format throughout.|$|R

50|$|In each sub-tree of {{a binary}} plan, there is <b>an</b> outside <b>leg,</b> {{also known as}} <b>a</b> power <b>leg,</b> and <b>an</b> inside <b>leg,</b> known as <b>a</b> profit <b>leg.</b> When new {{distributors}} are recruited, they are always placed underneath their recruiter, typically in the next available node in the power leg, even if the recruiter {{does not have any}} leaf nodes left. This contrasts with the profit leg which is typically filled with members who have been directly sponsored or enrolled by their immediate ancestor.|$|R
50|$|A C-stand with <b>an</b> upper most <b>leg</b> {{which is}} {{moveable}} on the vertical axis is called <b>a</b> Stair <b>Leg</b> C-stand as the unit {{can be placed}} on a stairway. Also called <b>a</b> Rocky Mountain <b>leg.</b>|$|R

5000|$|One {{reason for}} Amar Singh's high amount of wickets {{was that he}} bowled with an {{aggressive}} field setting and more importantly, he aimed at the stumps while bowling. His field settings generally consisted {{of two or three}} slips, a gully, a cover point, and third man on the off side. On the leg side he usually had <b>a</b> short fine <b>leg,</b> <b>a</b> forward short <b>leg,</b> <b>a</b> silly mid-on and <b>a</b> long <b>leg.</b> He maintained this field against all batsmen.|$|R
50|$|The men's Distance medley relay at the 2015 IAAF World Relays {{was held}} at the Thomas Robinson Stadium on 3 May.

The {{previous}} world best, set by a Kenyan team in 2006 at the Penn Relays was elevated to World Record status due to the inclusion of the event in the World Relays. The event takes in <b>a</b> 1200m <b>leg</b> followed by <b>a</b> 400m <b>leg,</b> then <b>a</b> 800m <b>leg</b> before finishing with <b>a</b> 1600m <b>leg.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nash himself {{claimed that}} he could have ended Bodyline in two overs without needing to resort to <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> field, as he {{believed}} that the English batsman could not hook and a few overs of sustained, fast short pitched bowling would have caused England to abandon their Bodyline tactics.|$|E
5|$|Next was a tag team {{match for}} the WWF Tag Team Championship, where the team of Owen Hart and Yokozuna (managed by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji) defended their titles against The Smoking Gunns (Bart and Billy Gunn). Owen pinned Bart for the victory after Yokozuna {{delivered}} <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> drop to Bart's chest, therefore retaining the championship.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston.

50|$|Another design goal can be, that stride {{height and}} length etc. can be {{controlled}} by the operator. This can relatively easily be achieved with <b>a</b> hydraulic <b>leg</b> mechanism, but is not practicable with <b>a</b> crank-based <b>leg</b> mechanism.|$|R
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Hulk Hogan {{defended his}} title against Yokozuna. Yokozuna {{controlled}} {{the beginning of}} the match until he ran at Hogan in the corner but missed an avalanche splash. Hogan tried twice to body slam Yokozuna but could not pick him up. Yokozuna performed a bear hug on Hogan and tried to pin him after executing a belly to belly suplex. Hogan kicked Yokozuna in the face three times and knocked him down to the mat. He performed <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> drop, his signature move, on Yokozuna but was unable to pin him. As Hogan prepared to attempt to body slam Yokozuna, manager Harvey Wippleman, disguised as a planted photographer, jumped up onto the edge of the ring. His camera exploded in Hogan's face, which allowed Yokozuna to knock Hogan down and perform <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> drop. Yokozuna pinned Hogan to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Banzai drop on Hogan after the match.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} between The Mexicools and The Blue World Order in a six-man tag team match.

5|$|After Combat Rock, the Clash {{began to}} disintegrate. Headon {{was asked to}} leave the band just before the album's release because heroin {{addiction}} was damaging his health and drumming.
