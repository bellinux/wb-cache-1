500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
2500|$|A 2008 Boston Globe report {{asserted}} that waiting {{time for the}} majority of trips actually increased as a result of demand induced by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, [...] "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> time stuck in traffic, not less." [...] The Globe also {{asserted that}} their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study did not look at highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.|$|E

2500|$|This {{refractory}} period {{makes it harder}} for females to mate, and females will continue to have difficulty as their age and mating frequency increase. [...] Males who have recently copulated will not transfer as many nutrients to their next mate, but will spend a longer duration of time for each mating. [...] This increases the mating costs for females because they <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> time copulating and receiving fewer nutrients from the ejaculate. [...] Males take advantage of this because females do not reduce their mating costs by copulating with virgin males. [...] In addition, males will transfer the most methyl salicylate to their first mate to ensure its paternity. [...] However, a female who mates with a virgin male will have the most difficulty re-mating, therefore delaying her from engaging in the preferred polyandry. [...] Males tailor their ejaculate {{in the sense that the}} first ejaculate is meant to prolong the {{refractory period}} of the female, and every subsequent ejaculate is meant to maximize efficiency in sperm competition.|$|E
2500|$|Many brands are now heavily {{using this}} mobile app {{to boost their}} {{marketing}} strategy. Instagram {{can be used to}} gain the necessary momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smartphone users. Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share pictures of their favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: Starbucks, MTV, Nike, Marc Jacobs, and Red Bull are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with Harper's Bazaar to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose [...] "outfit of the day" [...] photos on Snapchat get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture. According to Harper's Bazaar, industry estimates say that brands <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> than $1 billion per year on consumer-generated advertising. Founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom even went to Paris Fashion week, going to couture shows and meeting with designers to learn more about how style bloggers, editors, and designers are currently dominating much of the content on his application.|$|E

50|$|Retail leakage {{occurs when}} local people <b>are</b> <b>spending</b> <b>more</b> for goods, than local {{businesses}} actually acquire.

After all, retail leakage does not necessarily translate into opportunity. For instance, {{there could be a}} tough competition in a nearby locality that leads the market for same type of product. Many small - to medium-sized communities experience leakage of retail expenditures as local citizens drive to neighboring towns to shop at national retail chains (e.g. Tesco, Asda) or eat at national restaurant chains (e.g. Slug and Lettuce, Harvester). Attracting such national retail chain stores and restaurants to a community can prevent this type of expenditure leakage and create local jobs.|$|E
