5|$|In 1691, Arsenije {{struck a}} deal with Leopold I, who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs ecclesiastic {{autonomy}} and some degree of self-administration, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities. Leopold recognized Arsenije as the leader of Habsburg Serbs in both religious and secular affairs, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> that this power would be held by all future Archbishops. In 1712, Sremski Karlovci became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E

5|$|The most {{conclusive}} aqueous chemistry {{studies of}} rutherfordium {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} well {{received}} among contemporary music critics, although retrospective analysis {{has been less}} favorable. It managed to enter the top 30 on the Billboard 200 with no commercial radio play; it charted in several other countries as well. The album was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene. A remixed and remastered edition of the album, including several bonus tracks, was released in August 2004.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, lookouts on Greyhound {{were able}} to {{establish}} that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack. Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards, his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance. In doing so, Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line, creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed. At 05:00, Elphinstone raised French colours {{in an effort to}} confuse the Dutch officers <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander. Aalbers was not fooled, and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05:30, the Dutch frigate replied immediately. With the frigates engaged, Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria, Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas. In response, Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier, which continued its fire against Pallas, while William, bringing up the rear of the Dutch line, pulled out completely and sailed for the coast.|$|E
5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted {{that he may have}} been based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur from the town of Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E

5|$|During the summer, he {{experimented with}} various {{different}} racquets {{and played the}} German Open with a blacked-out 98-inch Wilson racquet, instead of his regular Pro Staff 6.1 90 BLX racquet with the smaller 90-inch hitting area. He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> it was a mistake to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E
5|$|Feige {{stated in}} January 2013 that Ant-Man {{would be part}} of Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> in May that the {{screenplay}} needed to be modified in order to fit into the universe, as the project had been in development before the first Iron Man film. Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014, and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013. In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete The World's End, as that film's producer Eric Fellner was diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal began {{a process}} of decolonisation and began a {{withdrawal}} from Portuguese Timor (later East Timor). Australians had long taken {{an interest in the}} colony; the nation had sent troops to the region during World War II, and many East Timorese had fought the Japanese as guerrillas. In September 1974, Whitlam met with President Suharto in Indonesia <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> that he would support Indonesia if it annexed East Timor. At the height of the Cold War, and {{in the context of the}} American retreat from Indo-China, he felt that incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia would enhance the stability of the region, and reduce the risk of the East Timorese FRETILIN movement, which many feared was communist, coming to power.|$|E

5|$|Land {{interaction}} during Krovanh's {{passage of}} Luzon significantly weakened the cyclone, and upon the system's reemergence into the South China Sea by 2000UTC on August22, Krovanh {{was classified as}} only a tropical storm by the JMA. Redevelopment was rather rapid following emergence, and just four hours later the storm was redesignated as a severe tropical storm. On August24, the storm began to develop tight banding and reformed its prior banding eye feature, which later organized into a well defined eye. Later that day Krovanh clipped the northeastern coast of Hainan before crossing the Leizhou Peninsula on August25. During this time, the JMA upgraded Krovanh back to typhoon intensity <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> that the storm was reaching a secondary peak in strength. The JTWC indicated a similar development as the typhoon traversed the Gulf of Tonkin. However, according to the JMA, Krovanh waned into a severe tropical storm shortly before the storm made its final landfall on Cẩm Phả, Vietnam at approximately 1500UTC on August25. Over land, Krovanh deteriorated rapidly, and both agencies ceased monitoring the system on August26 while it was well northwest of Hanoi.|$|E
5|$|On March5, 2003, meteorologists {{from the}} University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium issued an {{extended}} range forecast for the typhoon season, noting {{the likelihood of}} near average tropical cyclone activity {{as a result of}} projected neutral sea surface temperatures. The forecast indicated the potential for 26.2tropical storms, compared to the 10– and 30-year average of 27.8 and 26.3storms, respectively. The following month, the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26.7, indicating a slightly above average season. Over next two months, however, fluctuations in sea surface temperatures, particularly those in the Central Pacific, caused the group to revise their predictions downward <b>and</b> <b>indicated</b> the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast. A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their forecasts to indicate a near-average season in their final August forecast update, which predicted 27tropical storms. The group was very accurate in their forecasts, with their April and August forecasts being the most accurate.|$|E
