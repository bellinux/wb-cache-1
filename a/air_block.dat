5000|$|The Darkstalkers {{characters}} have a three-level [...] "Special Stock" [...] gauge like in Night Warriors: Darkstalkers Revenge, {{allowing them to}} perform ES Moves (enhanced versions of their regular special moves) or EX Specials (their super moves). They can also perform Guard Cancels (a counterattacking special move) and Chain Combos (which allows them to link any basic moves with another one of equal or greater strength). Darkstalkers characters can <b>air</b> <b>block</b> and dash, as well as do standing-up attacks and move while they're down.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Sharp, who {{qualified}} on {{the outside}} of the second row, suffered a humiliating gaffe when his pit crew neglected to remove the protective <b>air</b> <b>blocks</b> from the radiator inlets. The car pulled away from the grid with the <b>air</b> <b>blocks</b> still inserted, precipitating a swift and uncontrollable overheating condition. Though the crew was able to get the car back out on the track, the damage was done, and the car dropped out short of the halfway point with transmission and engine failure. The incident prompted some teams across the grid to pay more attention to pre-race checklists and affix fluorescent [...] "warning strips" [...] or brightly-colored flags to the <b>air</b> <b>blocks</b> and other similar devices to avoid similar failures in the future.|$|R

40|$|Propagation of {{acoustic}} {{waves in}} an one-dimensional water duct containing many <b>air</b> filled <b>blocks</b> is studied by the transfer matrix formalism. Energy distribution and interface vibration of the <b>air</b> <b>blocks</b> are computed. For periodic arrangement band structure and transmission rate are calculated analytically, whereas the Lyapunov exponent and its variance are computed numerically for random situations. A distinct collective behavior for localized waves is found. The results are also compared with optical situations. Comment: 11 pages revtex file, 11 eps figure...|$|R
50|$|The Street Fighter II {{characters}} {{follow the}} playing style of Super Street Fighter II Turbo. Each Street Fighter II character {{only has a}} single-level Super Combo gauge {{that allows them to}} perform a Super Combo at MAX level. They cannot <b>air</b> <b>block</b> nor dash like other characters, but can stand up quickly when they fall to the ground. Unlike Super Turbo, each character has two Super Combo moves. Despite representing Street Fighter II, the graphics for Ryu and Bison are actually from their Capcom vs. SNK incarnation, while Guile is from Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Zangief received a new sprite (edited from his Street Fighter Alpha one) just for this game.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{stability}} and reliability of the piezoelectric micro-pump, the cause of <b>air</b> <b>block</b> phenomenon is analyzed {{on the structure of}} wheel check valve. During the movement of the bubble in the micro-channel, pressure drop occurs, the main factor which influences the bubble going through is opening height of the wheel check valve. Five groups of wheel check valves with different structures are used to test the wheel check valve opening height and <b>air</b> <b>block</b> probability. The experiment results show that reducing the wheel check valve thickness or diameter ratio can both increase the wheel check valve opening height, and decrease the <b>air</b> <b>block</b> probability. Through experiment, the optimum combination of the wheel check valve structure is obtained within the samples: as the thickness is 0. 02 mm, the diameter ratio is 1. 2, the wheel check valve opening height gets 252 µm, and within the given bubble volume, the <b>air</b> <b>block</b> probability is less than 2 %...|$|E

It is also worth noting that from 31 July to 3 August a diurnal variation in PWV is regularly repeated, with an enhancement in the afternoon (further details are given in the section ‘Temporal variations of GPS-derived PWV around Jakarta’).The measurement error in PWV retrieval by GPS was roughly evaluated by comparing the PWV time series of the two co-located stations, i.e., BAKO and BAK 2 : the mean and standard deviation of their difference were 0.02 and 0.94 mm, respectively. Any inter-station PWV variation exceeding 2 mm (i.e., twice the standard deviation) was thus considered as containing significant geophysical information, i.e., spatial fluctuations of water vapor.

40|$|This article {{describes}} disc brakes, which {{in comparison to}} traditional block brakes are more often used in rail vehicles. Because of numerous advantages in comparison to a traditional <b>air</b> <b>block</b> brake, disc brakes, {{are more and more}} often utilized in passenger carriages and other railway vehicles. Stable and constant – in the whole speed range – coefficient of friction µ, with the value: µ = 0. 35 is a basic advantage of disc brake systems [7]. Attempt to increase train speed, triggers application of greater braking power i. e. braking systems rapidly absorbing and dispersing stored heat energy. For stimulation of cooling processes of friction set (brake disc and friction pad), discs with ventilation canals shaped by various vanes, are used. Thanks to such solution discs take off about 40 % [4] of heat generated during braking. However, natural ventilation causes losses of energy for rotation of the disc during ride with switched off brakes, which is especially important for trains with little frequency of brakings and in cases when the profile of the track does not stimulate long-lasting braking. This article presents selected issues of operational use of rail disc brake such us total resistance generated by brake disc divided into resistance of disc inertia as mass in rotational motion and resistance generated by disc’s ventilator, and influence of blocked ventilation canals on braking process...|$|E
40|$|It {{used to be}} {{said that}} the gardeners who got the best results from their plants did so by talking to them. Now it seems that the plants can 'talk' back and tell you their needs! When plants draw up water, their cells are like {{millions}} of tiny straws and the 'sucking action is so strong that air bubbles get trapped in the water. These emit ultrasonic pops and crackles which can be detected by special microphones. The more drought-stressed a plant becomes, the stronger the sucking action and the louder the noises emitted. Scientists are speculating that {{it should be possible to}} use ultrasound to measure the drought resistance of new varieties. These high frequency noises may give botanists other information such as when a tree is ready to come into leaf. It would seem that the noisier the tree the later it breaks into leaf. This is because of the variation in size of the water 'pipelines' within each species of tree. The larger the bore of pipe the more air gets trapped, and this acts like an <b>air</b> <b>block</b> in a water pipe causing the tree to be slower to come into leaf. Scientists have even discovered that dead wood continues to emit noises and this too can be turned to an advantage. American researchers have made a kiln that is computerised to pick up the ultra-sonic noises given off by wood as it dries, to recognize the danger sounds of wood drying too quickly and turn down the heat. This can represent huge savings in warped and useless wood ruined from drying at temperatures that were too high or too rapid. As futuristic or as far-fetched as 'talking plants' may sound, scientists are excited by the diverse possibilities that tapping into these ultrasonic sounds could open up.
