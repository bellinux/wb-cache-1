500|$|Tiny Mix Tapes {{included}} the album as its 21st-best {{album of the}} year, and summarized the album as [...] "hyperreal... frivolous... eerily familiar and scarily comfortable: pop structures moving one step closer toward the 'synthetic music box' from Huxley's Brave New World." [...] Fact ranked Far Side Virtual as its sixth-best album of the year, and called it [...] "he finest, most accessible example yet of James Ferraro’s ability to turn the detritus and dreck of US pop/commercial culture into gold – or, at any rate, something stomach-turningly psychedelic, mentally disturbing yet oddly celebratory." [...] Dummy named the album one of its [...] "12 albums for 2011," [...] and Ruth Saxelby concluded that Ferraro [...] "neither celebrates nor critiques the internet's reign but simply observes it with deep fascination. Andy Warhol style, it reflects the ambiguity of consumer culture in the digital age back <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a Pixar-animated wink." [...] The album placed at 316 on The Village Voice Pazz & Jop poll, with votes from four critics.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> an expression that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E

2500|$|The Edens {{flew back}} to England just before Christmas 1956. A young witness of their {{departure}} from Kingston airport recalled Lady Eden looking [...] "glacial" [...] and her husband, pale. Lady Avon noted that, on their return, [...] "everyone [...] looking <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> thoughtful eyes". Early in January 1957, the Edens stayed with the Queen at Sandringham, where Sir Anthony informed her of his intention to resign as Prime Minister. Eden tendered his resignation formally at Buckingham Palace on 9 January. When Harold Macmillan was appointed as his successor in preference to R. A. Butler, Lady Avon wrote to Butler (whom two years earlier she had described in her diary as [...] "curiously unnatural") that she thought politics [...] "a beastly profession ... and how greatly I admire your dignity and good humour". (In 1952 she had told Duff Cooper that she thought modern politics something of a [...] "farce".) ...|$|E

Look, picking potatoes is every bit as worthy as playing a guitar. But I can tell you that a man -with fine, sensitive fingers is not going to be able to make a go of picking potatoes: and I can also tell you that a man with fingers swollen from picking potatoes is not going to be able to play a guitar because he hasn't got the manual dexterity and he hasn't got the dedication. This is a profession like any other which you have to dedicate yourself to completely. It is an art of professionals." ...|$|E

2500|$|By the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be {{a mythical}} figure. Poets treated her either as an {{individual}} {{or at least as}} the type of a certain kind of woman. The French poet Albert Glatigny addresses “Circé” in his Les vignes folles (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies. Louis-Nicolas Ménard's sonnet in Rêveries d'un païen mystique (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality. Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. Lord de Tabley's [...] "Circe" [...] (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ‘A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch’d side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers’. That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of T.S.Eliot's student poem “Circe’s Palace" [...] (1909) in the Harvard Advocate. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ‘look <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the eyes of men whom we knew long ago’. Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "Truth be told, it's quite refreshing {{for an artist}} to embrace their perceived public image, but the joke is really on us. Why? Because it's Cher Lloyd who has the last laugh with another hit on her hands." [...] X. Alexander of Idolator said [...] "Instead of blasting us with that 'Swagger Jagger', she's coming <b>at</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the uber-catchy 'Want U Back' — a good choice, since we haven't {{been able to get}} it out of our heads since we first heard it." [...] Virgin Media's Matthew Horton wrote that the song has [...] "dynamic catchy bounce." [...] David Griffiths from 4Music praised the track, writing: [...] "It might not sound a million miles away from Miley Cyrus' 'Party in the USA', but it's got Cher's stamp all over it. From her dead pan delivery ('Please, this ain't even jealousy, she ain't got nothin' on me') to her screams of frustration peppered throughout the track, this has the potential to be an enormous global hit." [...] Bradley Stern from [...] "MuuMuse" [...] commented: [...] "It is one of the album’s catchiest, cutest moments–even if Lloyd’s gritting her teeth and clenching her fists with rage."
