According to the zoo officials, the rescued python could have escaped from its enclosure, when it was young, 4 to 5 years ago. When the workers tried to take the reptile, it bit one of the animal keepers, but since it was a non-poisonous one, the <b>animal</b> <b>keeper</b> was not harmed fatally and was provided treatment for the injury. The reptile was feeding on small mammals, roaming freely inside the zoo, which helped it survive without any problem.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{species of}} predatory animals, {{typically}} large fish such as catfish and cichlids but sometimes also {{animals such as}} freshwater turtles, are provided with feeder fish because they accept them more readily than alternatives. Other <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> believe that feeder fish are particularly nutritious, being what their pets would eat in the wild.

40|$|Background: Adulteration of food {{substances}} {{have been}} a global challenge and causes health effects including deaths and morbidities both in developed and developing countries. Adulteration of feeds could {{be the source of}} introducing toxic substances in meat, milk, eggs and their products with the health consequences in human users. In Tanzania news reports have cited the use of human medicines especially antiretroviral medicines in animal feeds. Therefore the study intended to asses and insight the situation. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the adulteration practice of animal feeds with human medicines by <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> in Dar es Salaam region. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross—sectional study conducted over five month period among <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> in Dar es Salaam region. A total of 120 <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> were involved in the study. Veterinary care givers and the principal investigator visited the homes of <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> during data collection. Structured questionnaires with both open and closed ended questions were used for data collection. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS/PC+ version 17. 0 computer packages- Results: Out of 120, 102 <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> participated in to the study in which 56 (54. 9 %) were from Ilala, 25 (24. 5 %) were from Temeke and 21 (20. 6 %) from Kinondoni. Majority of <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> 70 (72 %) used human medicines in animal feeds many of which were antibiotics; examples, 48 (73 %) Tetracycline, 26 (40 %) Chloramphenicol, l 6 (2 l %) amoxicillin, 4 (6 %) ampicilin and 5 (7. 7 %) Metronidazole. Some <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> 4 (6. 2 %) and 4 (6. 2 %) indicated to use Antiretroviral (Duovir N) and oral contraceptives respectively. Over the counter products were also detected to be used in which 16 (24 %) used Piriton (chlopheniramine) and 29 (4 -l %) use Paracetamol. Out of those who used human medicines in the feeds majority 58 (90. 6 %) indicated to use for the treatment of animal diseases while 6 (9 - 4 %) used for promoting growth. Fourty nine, (73. 1 %) of the respondent buy the drugs from the medical store (Duka 1 aDawa Baridi), l 4 (20. 9 %) buy the drugs from the pharmacy while the rest 4 (6 %) obtained medicines from hospital. Conclusion: The study has revealed that large proportions of the respondents use essential human medicines in animal feeds, majority of which are obtained from the medical stores. This is irrational use of medicines and has implication on potential for toxicity, drug interaction, drug resistance and treatment costs- The findings provide valuable information for meat consumers, regulatory bodies, clients and community at larg...|$|R

All had rhinitis and 10 also had bronchial asthma. Forty seven other technicians who had stopped working with laboratory animals showed the same relative numbers of respiratory tract symptoms and of confirmed allergy to laboratory animals as did those currently handling animals. Seven of 23 <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> had work related symptoms. LAA symptoms were found in four and confirmed animal allergy in two. All four <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> with <b>animal</b> related symptoms had rhinitis, none had bronchial asthma.

40|$|Exotic {{small animals}} that are {{commonly}} kept as pets include aquarium fish, cage and aviary birds, rodents, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), reptiles and amphibians. These different kinds of animals, even species within the same class, may differ markedly from each other regarding physiology and requirements. Although these species are common in both Swedish households and in pet trade, many <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> have {{a lack of knowledge}} about the origin and requirements of their pets. This is a cause of several health problems seen in animals which are held in captivity. In Sweden, the county administrative boards perform all animal welfare controls. Thus, {{it is important for the}} animal welfare inspectors to have enough knowledge about the animals, to enable them to ensure a good animal welfare and to have the ability to explain to <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> why any occuring husbandry deficiencies is not acceptable. The control checklists with associated guidelines, produced by the Swedish Department of Agriculture and used by the animal welfare inspectors, are however relatively limited regarding exotic small animals, especially the aquarium fish. Even the Swedish animal welfare legislation (DFS 2005 : 8) is quite limited regarding these animals and needs improvement as well as being made more comprehensive. It should, for example, not be considered appropriate to house rabbits and guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) together since Bordetella bronchiseptica, a bacteria often found in the respiratory tracts of healthy rabbits, may cause lung infections in guinea pigs. To improve the welfare of the exotic small animals kept by humans, more knowledge amongst <b>animal</b> <b>keepers</b> is required as well as an improvement of the Swedish animal welfare legislation and the material used by the Swedish county administrative boards during animal welfare controls. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to provide guidance for welfare controls of exotic small animals using the existing control checklists, produced by the Swedish Department of Agriculture, as models...|$|R
