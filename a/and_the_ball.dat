5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|In the match, {{which took}} place in Bologna, Italy, San Marino had the {{kick-off}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was quickly played through the inside-right channel. England defender Stuart Pearce attempted a back-pass to goalkeeper David Seaman. Pearce's pass was under-hit and Gualtieri ran on to touch the ball past Seaman. The goal was timed at 8.3 seconds, which remains the fastest World Cup goal scored in either qualifying or the finals. England took 20 minutes to equalise and eventually finished winning the match 7–1.|$|E

50|$|Padel is {{typically}} played in doubles on an enclosed court a third {{the size of}} a tennis court. Scoring is the same as normal tennis <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> used are similar but with a little less pressure, the main differences are that the court has walls <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> can be played off them in a similar way as in the game of squash and that solid, stringless racquets are used. The height of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> being served must be at or below the waist level.|$|R
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured {{at each end of}} the field for the Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{exceptional}} {{because he}} played point guard despite being 6ft 9in (2.06m), a size reserved normally for frontcourt players. He combined {{the size of}} a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a swingman, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> handling talent of a guard, making him {{one of the most dangerous}} triple-double threats of all time; his 138triple-double games are second only to Oscar Robertson's 181. Johnson is the only player in NBA Finals history to have triple-doubles in multiple series-clinching games.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) is {{revealed}} {{to have an}} obsession with soccer, {{and the rest of}} the employees pretend to feel the same way about it. When Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{began their}} next drive {{at their own}} 26-yard line, but went three-and-out. Buffalo punter Peter Fardon kicked the ball {{over the head of}} UConn {{returner}} Jasper Howard; rather than let the ball go, he ran backwards chasing after it. Trying to grab the ball over his shoulder, he muffed the catch, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> bounced into the end zone, where it was recovered by Buffalo's Ray Anthony Long for a Bull touchdown. The special-teams miscue by Howard allowed Buffalo to tie the game at 10–10 with 11:36 remaining in the second quarter.|$|E

5|$|Trailing by 11, {{and with}} time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{was picked up}} by Virginia Tech's Jim Baron who returned it into the end zone for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 2810 with 5:06 remaining in the game.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Balls,</b> {{also known}} as Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balls,</b> were formed in May/June 2002 after Large moved to Portland from San Francisco. Storm <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Balls</b> {{consisted}} of Davey Loprinzi (aka [...] "Hotrod" [...] Davey Nipples, formerly of Sweaty Nipples) on bass guitar, James Beaton on keyboards, and Brian Parnel on drums. <b>The</b> <b>Balls</b> drew what local media called a [...] "cult-like" [...] following in clubs, primarily during Wednesday night shows at Dante's. They perform [...] "lounge-core, mash-up" [...] renditions of artists such as ABBA, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick, Billy Idol, Led Zeppelin, Motörhead and Olivia Newton-John {{as well as their}} own compositions.

5|$|Virginia Tech {{players and}} coaches {{attempted}} to leave the field, only to be informed that Indiana called a timeout with one second remaining. Despite Tech head coach Frank Beamer's protests, Indiana's Manolopoulos was {{able to return to}} the field to attempt a 51-yard goal. The kick was blocked <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> recovered by Tech's Antonio Banks, who returned it 80yards for a touchdown. The score, which came with no time remaining on the clock, gave Tech a 2813 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|With 4:50 {{remaining}} on the clock, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included a pass to Davin Meggett for 31yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eightseconds on the clock. The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27–24.|$|E
5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight on <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E

5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Alavés {{kicked off}} {{the second half of}} extra-time and within seconds, Babbel was booked for {{bringing}} down Alavés defender Delfí Geli 30 yards from goal. The resulting free-kick was put wide by Hermes Desio. Three minutes later, Liverpool had a chance to score, but Fowler could not reach Steven Gerrard's cross <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was subsequently cleared from the Alavés penalty area. In the 115th minute of the match, Alavés were reduced to nine men, when Antonio Karmona received a second yellow card for fouling Smicer. McAllister took the resulting free-kick, which was headed into his own goal by Geli. As a result of the golden goal, Liverpool had won the match 5–4 to win their third UEFA Cup and complete a Treble.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5000|$|Ball washers {{may be used}} {{to clean}} golf balls. Various designs exist, and many golf courses provide stand-mounted ball-washers near the tee box of each hole. Some courses even have ball and club washers on each golf cart. According to strict rules, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is not allowed to be cleaned between a player's tee shot <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> landing on <b>the</b> green, except to the degree {{necessary}} to inspect <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for damage that would make it unplayable. Once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> has landed on the green, the player may pick up <b>and</b> wipe off <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to remove attached dirt or debris that would impede <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> rolling along <b>the</b> green, <b>and</b> between holes <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> may be thoroughly cleaned.|$|R
50|$|The {{main body}} colour is black, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> are yellow <b>and</b> black. <b>The</b> spinners are {{coloured}} pink. The colouring {{of the details}} are also different from the American Battle Dome.|$|R

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by wadding of paper or hay, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E

5|$|Following the turnover, the Eagles' offense {{began work}} at their 46-yard line. Davis {{completed}} a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis {{was able to}} gain the first down with a pass to Rich Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was recovered {{in the end zone}} by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on offense at its 20-yard line. Following the turnover, Tech went three and out, punting back to Boston College with 2:11 remaining before halftime.|$|E
