25|$|First, {{there is}} the {{communication}} between each member of a couple with their respective mate. Nancy tries to engage her husband, Charlie, in a mutually beneficial discussion about her needs and their future, but he derides her ideas. Nancy wants to explore and be adventurous in their retirement, while Charlie wants to rest <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> Throughout the play, their inability to communicate and understand each other's wants and needs creates tension and hostility.|$|E
25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{theme in}} Seascape {{is that of}} evolution and progress. This theme manifests itself in several ways in the play. One is subtle. The relationship of Nancy and Charlie {{is in the process}} of evolution. They are on the verge of a major life change, retirement. Charlie would like to use this time to rest <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> Nancy sees this desire as regression rather than evolution. Her family responsibilities fulfilled, Nancy wants to explore the world, perhaps moving from beach to beach, meeting new people and having new experiences. The couple's relationship will change, and Nancy tries to move it forward. Charlie wants things to stay the same.|$|E
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as {{he might have done}} and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> is incredible. The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E

25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official gestures of friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to stand by <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing,</b> Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later slowly but surely disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered a heart attack or perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E
25|$|Charlie {{is married}} to Nancy and {{is part of the}} human couple {{at the center of the}} play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing.</b> He does not {{understand}} his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged.|$|E
500|$|Gatski {{signed up}} for an Army reserve unit after the 1942 season as America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified. Marshall canceled its football program in 1943 as Gatski entered his senior year, but his unit was activated and he was sent with an infantry division {{to fight in the}} European theater of World War II. He went to England and followed American troops as they landed in Normandy and marched further into Europe. [...] "I wasn't in any heavy fighting," [...] he later said. He was a Private First Class in the Army. Gatski returned from duty in 1945, but Marshall had yet to resume its football program, so he enrolled at Auburn University in Alabama and finished out his studies, playing part of the season on the school's football team. [...] "Marshall hadn't started back up, and I hadn't played football for two years," [...] he later explained. [...] "I didn't want to sit around <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing,</b> so I went to Auburn." ...|$|E

When one of Vonnegut's characters, Kilgore Trout, finds the question [...] "What is the purpose of life?" [...] written in a bathroom, his response is, [...] "To be the eyes and ears and conscience of the Creator of the Universe, you fool." [...] Marvin finds Trout's theory curious, given that Vonnegut was an atheist, and thus for him, there is no Creator to report back to, and comments that, [...] " [...] Trout chronicles one meaningless life after another, readers are left to wonder how a compassionate creator could stand by <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> while such reports come in." [...] In the epigraph to Bluebeard, Vonnegut quotes his son Mark, and gives an answer to what he believes is the meaning of life: [...] "We are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing,</b> so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E
500|$|In the Easter 2007 episode, Dot {{takes an}} {{abandoned}} baby she finds in a church. This was filmed in Kent at Stansted, St. Giles Church in Wormshill, The Ringlestone Inn near Harrietsham and Court Lodge Farm. After being {{contacted by the}} child's Ukrainian mother Anya, Dot offers to care for both of them, however Jim turns Anya in to the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury questioned the plausibility of the storyline, observing: [...] "Babies aren't abandoned {{in the real world}} very often. But you can barely cross [...] Square [...] without tripping over poor tots who their mothers don't want." [...] Laws also felt that the speed at which the immigration department operated was [...] "amazingly on-the-ball", when in reality many illegal immigrants [...] "slip through the net". The Daily Mail Jaci Stephen deemed the storyline one of the worst in EastEnders history, writing a critical review in which she opined that the use of the infant playing Tomas was tantamount to abuse, and criticised several scenes which saw the baby [...] "screeching until he was red in the face." [...] Stephen questioned: [...] "How can the show justify this and, more to the point, how can his real-life mother stand by <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to comfort the poor little mite?" ...|$|E

On 11 November, 26 Whanganui Māori were arrested and Bryce, frustrated {{in his attempt to}} identify those from outside central Taranaki, telegraphed Hall to advise he intended destroying every whare in the village. He told Hall: [...] "Consider, here are 2000 people sitting still, absolutely declining to give me any indication of where they belong to; they will sit still where they are <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> else." ...|$|E
2500|$|That autumn, in {{an attempt}} to save his marriage, Frédéric {{returned}} to Paris with Alice; he was unsuccessful. Alice visited Frédéric's mother: revealing that {{she was in love with}} de Trafford, she asked her help in obtaining a divorce. Her mother-in-law advised her to think of her two daughters <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> she might later regret. Alice soon returned to Kenya and her lover. Hoping to keep Alice's extramarital affair from becoming a scandal, her mother-in-law loaned Alice a furnished flat in a quiet street in Paris to use as a [...] "love nest" [...] with de Trafford. Under pressure by his family, Frédéric quickly sued for divorce.|$|E
2500|$|Although the ALF members reject {{violence}} against people, many activists support attacks on property, comparing {{the destruction of}} animal laboratories and other facilities to resistance fighters blowing up gas chambers in Nazi Germany. Their argument for sabotage is that the removal of animals from a laboratory simply means they will be quickly replaced, but if the laboratory itself is destroyed, it not only slows down the restocking process, but increases costs, possibly {{to the point of}} making animal research prohibitively expensive; this, they argue, will encourage the search for alternatives. An ALF activist involved in an arson attack on the University of Arizona told No Compromise in 1996: [...] "t is much the same thing as the abolitionists who fought against slavery going in and burning down the quarters or tearing down the auction block ...

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1931, Douglas {{continued}} his studies in sociology at the University of Chicago. He never did complete his PhD thesis, but was deeply disturbed by his field work in the Depression-era [...] "jungles" [...] or hobo camps where about 75,000 transients sheltered in lean-tos venturing out by day to beg or to steal. Douglas interviewed men who once belonged to the American middle class—despondent bank clerks, lawyers and doctors. Douglas said later: [...] "There were little soup kitchens run by the Salvation Army and the churches... In the first half-hour they'd be cleaned out. After that there was nothing... It was impossible to describe the hopelessness." [...] Douglas was equally disturbed {{that members of the}} Socialist Party sat around quoting Marx and Lenin, waiting for a revolution while refusing to help the destitute. Douglas said: [...] "That experience soured me with absolutists... I've no patience with people who want to sit back and talk about a blueprint for society <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{an intense}} heat wave {{striking}} Danville, stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb are exhausted <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> but rest in their backyard. Eventually, they [...] decide {{to build a}} beach in their backyard to spite a morning radio DJ. Their sister Candace wants to expose them to their mother for doing so, but she only sees their initial draft of a small sandbox with water and brushes it off. Some time later, they successfully construct a full-scale beach, to which everyone in the neighborhood, including Isabella and her Fireside Girls troop go to cool off and enjoy themselves. Candace sees this and once again is set to inform their mother. This mood soon changes, when she finds out that Jeremy, a boy for whom she has romantic feelings for, will be coming to the beach to surf so she decides to stay. She finds pleasure in the beach after being crowned [...] "Queen Wahini" [...] following an accidentally flawless limbo performance and catches the attention of Jeremy.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Representative Earl Blumenauer {{introduced}} the Captive Primate Safety Act introduced on January 6, 2009, {{which would have}} added monkeys, great apes, and lemurs {{to the list of}} [...] "prohibited wildlife species" [...] that cannot be sold or purchased through interstate and foreign sales. The attack led the Humane Society of the United States to join with the Wildlife Conservation Society in supporting the Act. [...] Travis' attack resulted in the bill's reintroduction by co-sponsor, Rep. Mark Kirk, on February 23, 2009. [...] Rep. Rob Bishop argued against the bill during the floor debate, noting it would cost $4 million annually <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> directly to prevent chimpanzee attacks on humans.

[...] On February 23, 2009, the House voted 323 to 95 in favor of the bill, [...] and the editorial boards of several major newspapers, including The New York Times and Newsday, supported its passage.
