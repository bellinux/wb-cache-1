5|$|Orbetello {{was erected}} in <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> between two inner bays {{of a big}} lagoon. Various {{fortified}} positions made it a strong defensive position: Porto Ercole at the east, San Stefano at the west, and the fort San Filippo on the Monte Argentario island, linked to the mainland by a narrow isthmus. In the end, the French army landed at Talamone, where Brézé left to the Prince a half-dozen of vessels and galleys to bombard the forts of the town. Meanwhile, he went to Porto San Stefano with 5 sailing ships and 4 galleys and bombarded the fort until it surrendered. After the loss of those positions, Don Carlo de la Gatta, the castillan of Orbetello, retreated to the hermitage of Cristo. The isthmus was occupied thanks to a battery mounted aboard the French galleys, and soon the lagoon was filled with armed boats gathered by Jean-Paul de Saumeur, Chevalier Paul. Don Carlo de la Gatta, supported by just 200 Spanish and Italian soldiers, had very few opportunities to resist without help. An early relief force of 35 boats and 5 escort galleys sent from Naples with munitions and supplies was beaten, so a major fleet action was expected.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{thought that the}} island, believed to be 2–3thousand years old, developed from an offshore shingle ridge, and had thus always been an island, but current thinking is that the island {{was originally}} <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> extending west from Holkham dunes. Support for this theory comes from boreholes and from radiocarbon dating of a shell to 837AD, that appeared to indicate the existence of saltmarshes behind the shingle barrier at that time. A 1585 map also appears to show <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> at this location, and a 1630 inventory of the lands of Robert of Brancaster, the local Lord of the Manor, did not show list the island as a separate entity.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of bronze and iron metalworking skills allowed for cookware made from metal to be manufactured, although {{adoption of the}} new cookware was slow due to the much higher cost.

50|$|Scytodes thoracica is <b>a</b> <b>spitting</b> spider, {{so-called}} {{because it}} <b>spits</b> <b>a</b> venomous sticky silken substance over its prey. Its size ranges between 3 - 6 mm.

25|$|It is {{theorized that}} Padre Island formed from {{offshore}} shoals, with later growth aided by spit accretion. (<b>A</b> <b>spit</b> is a long, narrow tongue of sand extending from a mainland shoreline and {{formed by the}} shoreline drifting of sediments.) After a history of shifting, abandonment and reestablishment by storm breaches, many tidal inlets were slowly closed. Short islands were joined to form today's longer islands.|$|E
25|$|Meat was {{frequently}} roasted on <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> {{and as many}} cabins were devoid of ovens, cornbread was generally baked directly on the fireplace coals. A common staple of pioneer life was waffles, baked from batter in a folding iron mold three or four feet long. Modern canning processes were unknown and the wintertime larder consisted primarily of bread and meat. Vegetables were consumed seasonally, with pumpkin, red peppers, corn, and venison dried for later use.|$|E
25|$|The game ends {{when the}} Hood arrives {{at one of}} the pubs and is touched by the {{landlord}} from his front step. The landlord then takes charge of the Hood for the year, and is supposed to give everyone a free drink. The winning pub pours beer over the Hood and then hangs it behind the bar (each pub has two hooks especially for this purpose). According to legend, it used to be roasted on <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> over the pub fire having been doused with ale, which was then drunk by those present.|$|E

25|$|Since {{his death}} White has been {{described}} as a satyr. To answer this by saying that he was a great architect is not to answer at all…what is more important is that he was a most kindhearted, most considerate, gentle and manly man, who could no more have done the things attributed to him than he could have roasted a baby on <b>a</b> <b>spit.</b> Big in mind and in body, he was incapable of little meanness. He admired a beautiful woman as he admired every other beautiful thing God has given us; and his delight over one was as keen, as boyish, as grateful over any others.|$|E
25|$|The old and {{the most}} {{important}} part of the city is centred on <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> of land between the Kathajodi River and the Mahanadi River, bounded on the southeast by Old Jagannath Road. The city, being a part of the Cuttack Municipal Corporation consisting of 59 wards. Cuttack stretches from Phulnakhara across the Kathajodi in the south to Choudwar in north across the Birupa River, while in the east it begins at Kandarpur and runs west as far as Naraj. Four rivers including Mahanadi and its distributaries Kathajodi, Kuakhai, Birupa run through the city. Further Kathajodi is distributed into Devi and Biluakhai which often makes the geographical area look like fibrous roots.|$|E
25|$|After {{the body}} was carried to the cemetery, a {{sacrifice}} was performed {{in the presence of}} the corpse. Until the time of Cicero, it was customary to offer a sow to Ceres, a sow also being a characteristic offering to chthonic deities. The sacrificial victim was then allotted for consumption among the participants. The portion for the deceased was put on <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> and cremated with the body. Ceres' portion was burned on an altar. The family ate the portion that was due the living. A family of lesser means offered a libation of wine, incense, produce or grain; the allocation of these offerings is not recorded. After this apportioning, the deceased had transitioned and could no longer share in the meals of the living and the domestic gods; he now partook of what was appropriate for the spirits of the dead, the Manes.|$|E

500|$|This coast shows {{excellent}} {{examples of}} landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and a tied island, the Isle of Portland.

500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as <b>a</b> <b>spit</b> shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E
