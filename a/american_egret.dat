5000|$|One {{key feature}} of the Doub Farm is an unnamed {{intermittent}} stream that flows through the property roughly from north to south, passing close {{in front of the}} house and barn. The stream's hydrology reflects the karst topography of the region. The stream is a [...] "losing" [...] stream, with flow being fed by multiple springs emerging from limestone outcrops on the Doub Farm but then losing flow as the stream passes farther from the springs. The stream and adjoining wetlands are typically dry in mid summer and fall with streamflow returning with heavier rain and snowmelt events in winter. The stream typically dries out by later June or July. While flowing, the stream and its wetlands attract enormous numbers of Canada geese and occasional great blue herons and <b>American</b> <b>egrets.</b> Great blue herons frequent the stream as it dries down in late spring and large numbers of carp become entrapped in isolated pools of remnant water. The stream flow is much lower than expected for its watershed of more than 1200 acres north of the Doub Farm. Much of the runoff from the watershed likely flows through underground channels interspersed in the limestone rather than on the surface in the stream. The floodplain associated with the stream is however quite broad and episodically carries torrents of rushing waters expected only from much larger streams. Peyton Doub remembers many such events, some breaking away large sections of fencing crossing the stream.|$|R
50|$|Along with {{hiking and}} bird watching, kayaking and {{stand-up}} paddle boarding are popular {{activities on the}} slough. Watching sea otters, sea lions, seals, brown pelicans, <b>American</b> avocets, cormorants, <b>egrets,</b> terns {{and a host of}} other wildlife from the water is an experience that provides a unique perspective of how the slough is used by the native inhabitants. People are encouraged to keep at least 100 feet of distance between them and wildlife on the slough.|$|R
50|$|Menunketesuck Island {{is part of}} the Salt Meadow Unit of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. Over {{the last}} several summers, the island has hosted {{important}} populations of water birds - including the Least Tern, <b>American</b> oystercatcher, Great <b>Egret,</b> Glossy Ibis, Black-crowned night heron and various gull species. Ground nesting birds like terns and oystercatchers nest directly on the island's shore in the sand and rocks. Their nests are especially susceptible to disturbance by predators, domestic cats, domestic dogs, and humans. The long-legged wading birds, such as egrets and ibises, use the island's trees to nest and raise their young. The surrounding waters, mudflats and nearby marshes constitute a tremendous ecosystem for birds like these to find food, shelter and space.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is a major}} {{transition}} area for migratory birds crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and as such is a good birdwatching area. Twenty bird species regularly winter here, while 200 species are reported as migratory birds. There are 25 species of waterfowl, such as geese and flamingoes, which are common sights. Some of the common species of birds reported are Bermuda white-eyed vireo, cattle egret, great <b>egret,</b> snowy <b>egret,</b> <b>American</b> black duck, ring-necked duck, American wigeon, Eurasian teal and blue-winged teal. There are also waders, coots, moorhens, and great blue, green and tricolored herons. During the spring season longtails, or white-tailed tropicbirds, are a common sight. Shorebirds include various shanks, dowitchers and sandpipers. Eastern mosquitofish occur in large numbers, helping with mosquito control and providing food for the herons. White-tailed tropicbirds are reported to nest on the coastal cliffs.|$|R
