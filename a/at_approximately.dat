5|$|<b>At</b> <b>approximately</b> 2:45UTC on July 9, the {{hurricane}} made landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina. Shortly thereafter, Cindy began re-curving northwestward along the fall line, and eventually weakened to a tropical depression. The depression abruptly {{turned toward the}} east-northeast over North Carolina during the afternoon hours of July 9. Cindy then began to accelerate as it curved slightly towards the northeast, and eventually regained tropical storm status late on July 10 as it emerged into the Atlantic. Cindy scraped the southern fringe of the Delmarva Peninsula {{near the mouth of}} the Chesapeake Bay <b>at</b> <b>approximately</b> 00:00UTC on July 11, and rapidly traveled northeastward during the day. Cindy passed over Cape Cod near the mid-morning of July 11, during which a series of shortwave troughs passed near the storm, producing high-level outflow that helped Cindy maintain intensity. Later on July 11, Cindy moved ashore in New Brunswick and made landfall over Prince Edward Island the following day. The storm subsequently moved over Quebec and Labrador, where it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
