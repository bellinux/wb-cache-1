5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware {{of what kind of}} a place it is.|$|E
25|$|By 1922 the {{turbulent}} {{political situation in}} Mexico had stabilized somewhat, {{clearing the way for}} work to begin on the Carnegie Institution's Chichen Itza project. Morley and Carnegie Institution President Charles Merriam visited Chichen Itza in February 1923. The Mexican government was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> restoring the massive pyramid, El Castillo. Morley gave Merriam a tour of the area he believed would be best for excavation and restoration, a mound complex then known as the Group of One Thousand Columns (which included the Temple of Warriors).|$|E
25|$|Lanyon and Dargan were keen to {{retrieve}} their reputations {{and there was}} a period of furious activity as they worked to correct deficiencies identified in the Board of Trade report. The directors carried out their own inspection of the line on 6 April and felt sufficiently confident about what they had seen to ask Captain Laffan to make a second inspection. This he did and his report of 8 April was more encouraging than the previous one. Although there were some strictures, Captain Henry Drury Harness RE, secretary to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade formally advised the directors of the B on 14 April that the railway could be opened for public service. However, authorisation had been sent previously by telegraph and the railway was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|The union {{continued}} {{to expand its}} membership after World War II, reaching its apex at 500,000 members in 1965, one year after Dubinsky's retirement. Dubinsky's focus on maintaining {{the stability of the}} industry and the union's place in it dampened the union's desire to gain significant wage increases for its members. The union gradually lost its ability to keep sweatshop conditions from returning, even in the former center of its strength in New York. While the union still had one-half million members in the years immediately after Dubinsky's retirement, the forces that brought about the decline and eventual disappearance of the ILGWU thirty years later, when it merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to form the union known as UNITE, were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> In his last years, Dubinsky was often accessible to the union's members.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1508, Raphael {{had moved}} to Rome, where he lived {{for the rest of}} his life. He was invited by the new Pope Julius II, perhaps at the {{suggestion}} of his architect Donato Bramante, then engaged on St. Peter's Basilica, who came from just outside Urbino and was distantly related to Raphael. Unlike Michelangelo, who had been kept lingering in Rome for several months after his first summons, Raphael was immediately commissioned by Julius to fresco what was intended to become the Pope's private library at the Vatican Palace. This was a much larger and more important commission than any he had received before; he had only painted one altarpiece in Florence itself. Several other artists and their teams of assistants were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on different rooms, many painting over recently completed paintings commissioned by Julius's loathed predecessor, Alexander VI, whose contributions, and arms, Julius was determined to efface from the palace. Michelangelo, meanwhile, had been commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the middle}} of the fifteenth century the patriarch Shemon IV Basidi made the patriarchal {{succession}} hereditary, normally from uncle to nephew. This practice, which resulted in a shortage of eligible heirs, eventually led to a schism in the Church of the East. The patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539–58) caused great offence {{at the beginning of his}} reign by designating his twelve-year-old nephew Khnanisho as his successor, presumably because no older relatives were available. Several years later, probably because Khnanisho had died in the interim, he designated as successor his fifteen-year-old brother Eliya, the future patriarch Eliya (VI) VII (1558–91). These appointments, combined with other accusations of impropriety, caused discontent throughout the church, and by 1552 Shemon VII Ishoyahb had become so unpopular that a group of bishops, principally from the Amid, Sirt and Salmas districts in northern Mesopotamia, chose a new patriarch, electing a monk named Yohannan Sulaqa, the former superior of Rabban Hormizd Monastery near the Assyrian town of Alqosh. However, no bishop of metropolitan rank was available to consecrate him, as canonically required. Franciscan missionaries were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> among the Nestorians, and they persuaded Sulaqa's supporters to legitimise their position by seeking their candidate's consecration by Pope Julius III (1550–5).|$|E

500|$|On September 2, 2014, {{during the}} ABC airing of , Walt Disney Animation Studios' chief {{creative}} officer John Lasseter {{announced that a}} Frozen short film with a new song would be released in the future. On the same day, Variety announced that the short would be released in early 2015 under the title Frozen Fever, with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee returning as co-directors, Peter Del Vecho returning as producer and a new song by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Olaf the snowman would also make an appearance in the short. On December 3, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Aimee Scribner would be a co-producer and that Frozen Fever would debut in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. In late December, the co-directors told the Associated Press [...] "There is something magic about these characters and this cast and this music. Hopefully, the audiences will enjoy the short we're doing, but we felt it again. It was really fun." [...] Around the same time, Dave Metzger, who worked on the orchestration for Frozen, disclosed he was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on Frozen Fever.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{wrote to}} several of the sculptors, and found Aitken {{interested}} in creating the $50 pieces. The Mint Director's tentative negotiations with Aitken for the large gold coins and with Buffalo nickel designer James Earl Fraser for the award medal ended when Roberts resigned in November to take a banking job; McAdoo appointed Dr. Frederic Dewey as Acting Director of the Mint. Dewey and McAdoo did little regarding the Panama–Pacific coins until Congress began to pass the authorizing legislation in early January 1915. Once it had passed both houses, and was awaiting Wilson's signature, Dewey arranged for a meeting in New York with Aitken, Keck, Longman, and Manship. The authorizing act required the Mint to begin delivering coins by the opening date of the fair, [...] February 20, 1915, and although this proved impractical, the Mint still acted quickly. McAdoo approved the choices of Aitken for the $50 pieces, Longman for the quarter eagle, Keck for the dollar, and Manship for the half dollar on January 21. [...] All four artists were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and Aitken responded to the notification of his hiring by submitting designs, which were similar to the actual coins.|$|E
500|$|Osborne was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> {{on a new}} play, The Entertainer, {{an allegory}} of Britain's post-colonial decline, centred on a seedy variety comedian, Archie Rice. Having read the first act—all that was {{completed}} by then—Olivier asked to be cast in the part. He had for years maintained that he might easily have been a third-rate comedian called [...] "Larry Oliver", and would sometimes play the character at parties. Behind Archie's brazen façade there is a deep desolation, and Olivier caught both aspects, switching, {{in the words of}} the biographer Anthony Holden, [...] "from a gleefully tacky comic routine to moments of the most wrenching pathos". Tony Richardson's production for the English Stage Company transferred from the Royal Court to the Palace Theatre in September 1957; after that it toured and returned to the Palace. The role of Archie's daughter Jean was taken by three actresses during the various runs. The second of them was Joan Plowright, with whom Olivier began a relationship that endured for the rest of his life. Olivier said that playing Archie [...] "made me feel like a modern actor again". In finding an avant-garde play that suited him, he was, as Osborne remarked, far ahead of Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, who did not successfully follow his lead for more than a decade. Their first substantial successes in works by any of Osborne's generation were Alan Bennett's Forty Years On (Gielgud in 1968) and David Storey's Home (Richardson and Gielgud in 1970).|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} the horses were obtained, and Malchus, seeing that, now he had lost all the {{presents}} intended for the chiefs, it would be useless to pursue his mission further, especially as he had learned that the Roman agents had <b>already</b> been <b>at</b> <b>work</b> among the tribes, returned with his party to Hannibal's camp.|$|R
50|$|The {{emergence}} {{of this new}} political entity, {{in the frame of}} the Cold War, was complex and painful. Several tentatives were made to organise newly independent states in order to oppose a common front towards both the US's and the USSR's influence on them, with the consequences of the Sino-Soviet split <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>works.</b> Thus, the Non-Aligned Movement constituted itself, around the main figures of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India, President Sukarno of Indonesia, leader Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, and Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt who successfully opposed the French and British imperial powers during the 1956 Suez crisis. After the 1954 Geneva Conference which ended the French war against Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, the 1955 Bandung Conference gathered Nasser, Nehru, Tito, Sukarno, and Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China.|$|R

2500|$|Even though Ford was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on {{the next}} Thunderbird {{generation}} by 1986, the company sought to continue {{to cash in on}} the existing generation's success. As such, for 1987 the Thunderbird received a significant refresh complete with new sheetmetal and a revised front fascia with more aerodynamic single-piece headlamps. Mechanically the car was mostly unchanged. V6s models carried over port fuel injection from 1986 while the Turbo Coupe's turbocharged 4-cylinder engine gained an intercooler, increasing output to [...] and 240lbs of torque. 1988 was this Thunderbird generation's last as Ford prepared to unveil an all-new Thunderbird for 1989.|$|E
2500|$|By February 1999, just a {{few months}} into the 997 {{development}} programme that began {{in the fourth quarter of}} 1998, designers were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on the 997 body design. After numerous reviews during the rest of 1999 and full size clays built from 2000 into 2001, during 2001 a final design by designer Grant Larson was approved. Early prototypes were built in late 2001 for testing, based off of the newly set parameters. While the exterior styling was revised, it was again more evolution rather than revolution; typical of Porsche and the Carrera. The rear bodywork was a total of [...] wider than its predecessor. However, the most notable aesthetic difference between the 997 and the 996 was the return to oval headlights like those of pre-996 Carreras, with separate indicator units. The interior was re-designed with new controls; however, it was more reminiscent of classic 911 interiors than of the outgoing 996. The body in general remained low profile with a drag coefficient of 0.28 for the Carrera and 0.29 for the Carrera S.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} things to note about Carr's Luciferian conspiracies is that he believes they were <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> during Christ's time. As Taguieff points out, there is a transhistorical scheme in Carr's idea of world conspiracy. In this kind of philosophy of history anticipating a final [...] "World Government", the Illuminati are part of a satanic historical force that contributes to the evil original plot. According to that point of view Carr believes that there are [...] "natural born" [...] conspiracists which is nothing more for Taguieff than myth and paranoia invented from a delirious worldview. [...] It is indeed an original aspect of Carr's theories since most plot theorists usually start their [...] "genealogy" [...] with the modern age, especially with the French Revolution. As a Christian traditionalist, Carr believes that the world conspiracy is based on a Manichaean way of thinking; this view is common to many anti-Mason and anti-Communist conspiracy theorist, starting from Nesta Webster. There is another common variant in seeing the world conspiracy being based on the Sabbatean/Frankist teachings, but it also acknowledges Manichaean influences.|$|E

2500|$|The authors {{explain that}} the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find [...] "solace in prayer," [...] {{and in this way}} {{overcome}} fear.

2500|$|The opera's premiere was {{received}} by an enthusiastic audience and earned critical praise, {{although there was}} general agreement that the second act needed some trimming. Iolanthe became the fourth consecutive major success for Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer, Richard D'Oyly Carte, following H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), The Pirates of Penzance (1879) and Patience (1881). Increasingly viewing his work with Gilbert as frivolous, beneath his skills and repetitious, Sullivan had intended to resign from the partnership with Gilbert and Carte after Iolanthe, but {{on the day of}} its premiere, he received a letter from his broker, Edward Hall, notifying him that Hall had lost all his money, including £7,000 of Sullivan's investments, the bulk of his fortune. Sullivan's lifestyle was not inexpensive, and he was helping to support his late brother's large family, as well as his mistress, Fanny Ronalds, and her family. He soon concluded that the only certain way to restore his financial security was to continue writing Savoy operas. On 8 February 1883, he signed a new five-year creative partnership agreement with Gilbert and Carte; Gilbert was <b>already</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> on their next piece, Princess Ida. On 22 May 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his [...] "services ... rendered to the promotion of the art of music" [...] in Britain.|$|E
