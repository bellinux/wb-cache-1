5|$|Uranium-233 is {{made from}} thorium-232 by neutron bombardment, usually in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> and 233U is also fissile. Its decay series ends at bismuth-209 and thallium-205.|$|E
5|$|The americium-241 and curium-242 {{isotopes}} {{also were}} produced by irradiating plutonium in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> The latter element {{was named after}} Marie Curie and her husband Pierre who are noted for discovering radium and for their work in radioactivity.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>a</b> typical <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> fueled with uranium-235, the {{presence}} of 135Xe as a fission product presents designers and operators with problems due to its large neutron cross section for absorption. Because absorbing neutrons can detrimentally affect <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor's</b> ability to increase power, reactors are designed to mitigate this effect; operators are trained to properly anticipate and react to these transients.|$|R

5|$|Californium-249 {{is formed}} from the beta decay of berkelium-249, {{and most other}} {{californium}} isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross-section).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its high}} cost, {{portable}} X-ray devices use thulium {{that has been}} bombarded in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> as a radiation source. These sources have a useful life of about one year, as tools in medical and dental diagnosis, {{as well as to}} detect defects in inaccessible mechanical and electronic components. Such sources do not need extensive radiation protection – only a small cup of lead.|$|E
5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always abundant in actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved. Instead, actinium is prepared, in milligram amounts, by the neutron irradiation of 226 in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E

5|$|Arriving in 1986, {{the crew}} finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank {{to hold the}} whales they need {{for a return to}} the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, {{the chief of the}} planning board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E

25|$|In <b>a</b> fission <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> uranium-238 {{can be used}} to {{generate}} 239Pu, which itself can be used in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapon or as a nuclear-reactor fuel supply. In <b>a</b> typical <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> up to one-third of the generated power does come from the fission of 239Pu, which is not supplied as a fuel to the reactor, but rather, produced from 238U.|$|R
5|$|Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California {{produced}} 28 μg {{of plutonium}} in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, {{and found that}} it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but {{it was not possible to}} produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because {{it was based on}} proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton Project {{developed}} {{techniques for}} extracting polonium-210 from the lead dioxide ore {{in which it}} occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium {{was used as an}} initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|A {{fuel element}} failure is a rupture in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor's</b> fuel {{cladding}} {{that allows the}} nuclear fuel or fission products, either {{in the form of}} dissolved radioisotopes or hot particles, to enter the reactor coolant or storage water.|$|R

5|$|The {{second line}} of {{development}} {{pursued by the}} Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, {{the best way to}} obtain large quantities of the element is in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is transmuted into uranium-239, which rapidly decays, first into neptunium-239 and then into plutonium-239. Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from fission products.|$|E
5|$|The third {{scenario}} {{involved an}} explosion at <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> facility which shuts down {{two of three}} reactors. Everyone is killed in the disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find the operating reactor building, enter the building (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the control panels {{to determine if a}} melt-down is imminent. The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{relationship}} with its neighbours since 1990 {{has generally been}} good. The country also {{plays an important role}} in promoting regional security. Bulgaria has an active tripartite economic and diplomatic collaboration with Romania and Greece, maintains strong relations with EU members, the United States, and Russia, and continues to improve its traditionally good ties with China and Vietnam. The HIV trial in Libya, which followed after the imprisonment of several Bulgarian nurses in Benghazi in 1998, had a significant impact on relations between Bulgaria, the European Union, and Libya. It resulted in the release of the nurses by Muammar Gaddafi's government, which was granted a contract to receive <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> and weapons supplies from France in exchange.|$|E

The University of Washington began nuclear engineering classes {{as part of the}} College of Engineering in 1953, and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> to be installed on-campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, {{the first of its kind}} in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron.

5|$|For {{some twenty}} years, Teller advised Israel on nuclear matters in general, {{and on the}} {{building}} of a hydrogen bomb in particular. In 1952, Teller and Oppenheimer had a long meeting with David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, telling him {{that the best way to}} accumulate plutonium was to burn natural uranium in <b>a</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor.</b> Starting in 1964, a connection between Teller and Israel was made by the physicist Yuval Ne'eman, who had similar political views. Between 1964 and 1967, Teller visited Israel six times, lecturing at Tel Aviv University, and advising the chiefs of Israel's scientific-security circle as well as prime ministers and cabinet members.|$|E
