40|$|The {{problems}} of object classification (labeling the nodes of a graph) <b>and</b> <b>link</b> prediction (predicting the links in a graph) {{have been largely}} studied independently. Commonly, object classification is performed assuming {{a complete set of}} known <b>links</b> <b>and</b> <b>link</b> prediction is done assuming a fully observed set of node attributes. In most real world domains, however, attributes <b>and</b> <b>links</b> are often missing or incorrect. Object classification is not provided with all the links relevant to correct classification <b>and</b> <b>link</b> prediction is not provided all the labels needed for accurate link prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach that addresses these two problems by interleaving object classification <b>and</b> <b>link</b> prediction in a collective algorithm. We investigate empirically the conditions under which an integrated approach to object classification <b>and</b> <b>link</b> prediction improves performance, and find that performance improves over a wide range of network types, and algorithm settings. 1...|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} new town was planned, Crawley was a retail centre for the {{surrounding}} area: there were 177 shops in the town in 1948, 99 of which were on the High Street. Early new town residents relied on these shopping facilities until the Corporation implemented the master plan's designs for a new shopping area on the mostly undeveloped land east of the High Street and north of the railway line. The Broadwalk and its 23 shops were built in 1954, followed by the Queen's Square complex and surrounding streets in the mid-1950s. Queen's Square, a pedestrianised plaza surrounded by large shops <b>and</b> <b>linked</b> to the High Street by The Broadwalk, was officially opened in 1958 by Queen Elizabeth II. The town centre was completed by 1960, by which time Crawley was already recognised as an important regional, rather than merely local, shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth <b>and</b> <b>linked</b> to the old castle by covered passageways called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers.
