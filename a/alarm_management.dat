50|$|<b>Alarm</b> <b>management</b> {{becomes more}} and more {{necessary}} as the complexity and size of manufacturing systems increases. A lot of the need for <b>alarm</b> <b>management</b> also arises because alarms can be configured on a DCS at nearly zero incremental cost, whereas in the past on physical control panel systems that consisted of individual pneumatic or electronic analogue instruments, each alarm required expenditure and control panel real estate, so more thought usually went into the need for an alarm. Numerous disasters such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl accident and the Deepwater Horizon have established a clear need for <b>alarm</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E
50|$|By default, the {{assignment}} of alarm trip points and alarm priorities constitute basic <b>alarm</b> <b>management.</b> Each individual alarm {{is designed to provide}} an alert when that process indication deviates from normal. The main problem with basic <b>alarm</b> <b>management</b> is that these features are static. The resultant alarm annunciation does not respond to changes in the mode of operation or the operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objectives are}} {{no different from the}} previous basic <b>alarm</b> annunciation <b>management</b> objectives. Dynamic <b>alarm</b> annunciation <b>management</b> focuses the operator’s attention by eliminating extraneous alarms, providing better recognition of critical problems, and insuring swifter, more accurate operator response.|$|R

50|$|In short, {{one needs}} to extend the {{objectives}} of <b>alarm</b> <b>management</b> beyond the basic level. It {{is not sufficient to}} utilise multiple priority levels because priority itself is often dynamic. Likewise, alarm disabling based on unit association or suppressing audible annunciation based on priority do not provide dynamic, selective alarm annunciation. The solution must be an <b>alarm</b> <b>management</b> system that can dynamically filter the process alarms based on the current plant operation and conditions so that only the currently significant alarms are annunciated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} communication systems many applications oriented to parameter monitoring are developed, such as automatic tracking systems. In this paper, an automatic tracking system based on a network of presence and range sensors, is presented. The main goal is to offer a low cost alternative to increase security staff effectiveness and to avoid problems of scattered <b>alarms</b> <b>management.</b> For this purpose, information from different sources is fusioned to provide as output the trajectories of detected objects. Simulation results, with measurements of different sensors, show the suitability of the proposed distributed multisensor-multitarget fusion system to the specified requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Contextual <b>Alarms</b> <b>Management</b> System (CALMS) {{project is}} to develop {{sophisticated}} models to predict the onset of clinical cardiac ischemia before it occurs. The system will continuously monitor cardiac patients and set off an alarm when they appear about to suffer an ischemic episode. The models take as inputs information from patient history and combine it with continuously updated information extracted from blood pressure, oxygen saturation and ECG lines. Expert system, statistical, neural network and rough set methodologies are then used to forecast the onset of clinical ischemia before it transpires, thus allowing early intervention aimed at preventing morbid complications from occurring. The models will differ from previous attempts by including combinations of continuous and discrete inputs. A commercial medical instrumentation and software company has invested funds in the project with a goal of commercialization of the technology. The end product will be a system that analyzes physiologic parameters and produces an alarm when myocardial ischemia is present. If proven feasible, a CALMS-based system {{will be added to}} existing heart monitoring hardware...|$|R

5000|$|Recognizing that alarms were {{becoming}} a problem, {{industrial control system}} users banded together and formed the <b>Alarm</b> <b>Management</b> Task Force, which was a customer advisory board led by Honeywell in 1990. The AMTF included participants from chemical, petrochemical, and refining operations. They gathered and wrote a document on the issues associated with <b>alarm</b> <b>management.</b> This group quickly realised that alarm problems were simply a subset of a larger problem, and formed the Abnormal Situation Management Consortium (ASM is a registered trademark of Honeywell). The ASM Consortium developed a research proposal and was granted funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1994. The focus of this work was addressing the complex human-system interaction and factors that influence successful performance for process operators. Automation solutions have often been developed without consideration of the human that needs {{to interact with the}} solution. In particular, alarms are intended to improve situation awareness for the control room operator, but a poorly configured alarm system does not achieve this goal. [...] The ASM Consortium has produced documents on best practices in <b>alarm</b> <b>management,</b> as well as operator situation awareness, operator effectiveness, and other operator-oriented issues. These documents were originally for ASM Consortium members only, but the ASMC has recently offered these documents publicly.|$|E
