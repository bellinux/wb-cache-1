5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

25|$|On day 290, {{they are}} {{hanging out in}} a cafe. Tom {{wants to go back}} to Summer's place but she insists on seeing The Graduate and weeps at the ending, which surprises Tom as he'd <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a romantic fairy tale. They visit the record store, but Summer is distracted, appears to have lost {{interest}} in Tom, and kisses him good night. Tom tempts her with an offer of pancakes at a diner, where Summer casually announces that the relationship hasn't been working and breaks up with Tom while they are waiting for the food to arrive. Summer wants them to remain friends, but Tom is devastated.|$|E

Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E
500|$|In early March 2017, in an {{interview}} with Brie Larson, published by People magazine, Fonda stated, [...] "One of the great things the women's movement has done is to make us realise that (rape and abuse is) not our fault. We were violated and it's not right." [...] She said, [...] "I’ve been raped, I’ve been sexually abused as a child and I’ve been fired because I wouldn’t sleep with my boss." [...] She said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was my fault; that I didn’t do or say the right thing. I know young girls who’ve been raped and didn’t even know it was rape. They think, ‘It must have been because I said ‘no’ the wrong way.’" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Marry You" [...] {{is one of}} {{the eleven}} songs {{composed}} and produced by The Smeezingtons, the collaboration of Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine, for Mars's debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Lawrence explained the inspiration behind the song in an interview with American Songwriter stating, [...] "e had this image of a slow-mo video in Vegas of a couple running, and she’s in her gown and he’s in his tux, the wedding party is behind them. This sort of crazy, daring, wedding feeling". Lawrence was surprised at the impact of the song after watching some YouTube videos. He stated that [...] "e <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a good song and catchy, but we didn’t think it would affect pop culture the way that it has. The first time we saw one of those YouTube videos...we were almost in tears... the power of what it is we can create. These ideas, words, and lyrics and how they can get into the fabric of society and affect people’s lives in such an amazing way." [...] In an interview with Idolator Bruno Mars said that the song had its beginning by [...] "just playing the chords," [...] and then freestyling the lyrics [...] "I think I wanna marry you!". He continued, [...] "you’re in Vegas...had way too many drinks, and you love everybody, and {{you want to do something}} that you probably shouldn’t do and you’ll regret in the morning." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon's first son, Julian, {{was born}} during his {{marriage}} to Cynthia as his commitments with the Beatles intensified {{at the height of}} Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, [...] "I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" [...] Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, [...] "It's not an acid song." [...] McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, [...] "Hey Jules", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song [...] "Hey Jude". Lennon later said, [...] "That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in the sports section. Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday. The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can't sell a seven-foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent." [...] In his prime, Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted. Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain's previous record 78-point game, [...] "It {{was only a matter of}} time until he reached 100, you could wait for it." [...] Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing, then said, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was inevitable that he would do it. But when he did, I stopped and thought about it. I couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is the Romany patteran?" [...] {{she broke}} off to ask. [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as patter, or patois, the Gypsy patois, and somehow {{it strikes me as}} absurd to follow a {{language}} over the world--a sort of philological excursion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Johansson {{spoke about}} the project {{at the time of}} the [...] "Relator" [...] single release; [...] "The idea of two people vocalizing their {{relationship}} through duets...I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as just a small project between friends. It perfectly captured where I was in my life at the time".|$|R
40|$|I {{know this}} won’t be a popular position, but I {{think that the}} high moral view of journalist/comedian John Oliver about journalism {{is part of the}} problem. I enjoy his work and have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it’s</b> a part of the multifarious {{contemporary}} journalism ecology, just as Jon Stewart was before him. But in his latest critique of the woes of the news media, his (mildly funny) take on local US journalism [which is hugely well funded compared to ‘local’ journalism anywhere else] is rather conservative. He blames the public for failing to pay for the kind of investigative journalism celebrated in the award-winning movie Spotlight. He is guilt-tripping us...|$|R
2500|$|Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for the {{previous}} instalments, returned for Goblet of Fire. On adapting the 734-page book into a feature-length film, Kloves commented that [...] "we <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be two movies, but we could never {{figure out a way}} to break it in two. So it will be a different experience from the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} her life, Bertrand {{preferred}} {{her privacy}} and did not grant interviews. After a nearly eight-year battle with ovarian and breast cancer, she died aged 56 on January 27, 2007, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in the company of her children. Bertrand's mother and sister also died of cancer. Her daughter said, [...] "My grandmother also died young; so, my mother <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> could happen to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Costume {{designer}} Deborah Nadoolman Landis {{noted that}} {{the inspiration for the}} series as well as Indiana Jones' outfit was Charlton Heston's Harry Steele in Secret of the Incas (1954) and called Raiders of the Lost Ark [...] "almost a shot for shot" [...] remake of the Heston film, citing that Indiana Jones was [...] "a kinder, gentler Harry Steele": [...] "We did watch this film together as a crew several times, and I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> strange that the filmmakers did not credit it later as the inspiration for the series." ...|$|E

5000|$|KFC CMO Kevin Hochman told PRWeek, [...] "The {{plan was}} always to rotate colonels. We <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> like James Bond.

[...] Although the rotating [...] "Real Colonel Sanders" [...] campaigns have generated mixed reviews, analysts and company executive credit it with helping to boost sales.|$|R
2500|$|The Byrds' version, {{released}} {{as a single}} on April 2, 1968, reached number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100. They transformed it into a classic of the then burgeoning genre of country rock, whereas on the basement version the country music flavor {{is more of an}} undercurrent, suggested by [...] "the lilting chorus melody". Roger McGuinn felt that the song was perfect for the Byrds: [...] "It was country-ish and had that Dylan mystique where you couldn't really figure what he was talking about, yet the lyrics nevertheless drew you in. ... I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was about when Bob was laid up in Woodstock after the bike accident and sure wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|The initial Death's Head 3.0 story also {{included}} a number of elements which tied it into previous Amazing Fantasy stories - Death's Head's sentience and power source comes from AIM's attempts to first capture and then replicate the power that created Captain Universe. Issue #16 revealed the scientist that began the project was Monica Rappaccini, mother of the new Scorpion, {{on the back of}} her attempts to capture the Uni-Power in other titles. Varina Goddard is revealed via AIM records to be Monica's granddaughter. Furman says he has [...] "mixed feelings" [...] about the story, as he likes it but feels that this isn't Death's Head; “I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> strange that poll was to bring back one character and what readers got was another entirely... I’d have much rather done the original.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Reeves {{was anxious}} {{not to break}} up Wells's marriage, though {{she wanted to have}} his child. The news that she was {{pregnant}} in the spring of 1909 shocked the Reeves family, and the couple fled to Le Touquet-Paris-Plage where they attempted domestic life together. Neither of them did well with domesticity; loneliness and anxiety concerning her pregnancy, as well as the complexity of the situation drove her to depression, and after three months they decided to leave Le Touquet. Wells took her to Boulogne and put her on the ferry to England, while he stayed to continue his writing. Reeves went to stay with Wells and his wife Jane when they returned to Sandgate. But then on 7 May 1909, she was married to Rivers Blanco White. In her latter life she wrote [...] "I did not arrange to marry Rivers, he arranged it with H.G, but I have <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> the best that could possibly have happened".|$|E
5000|$|... "He's <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> about <b>it,</b> but {{the thing}} about it is there is no guarantee," [...] Turgeon said. [...] "Let's just say we're {{going to try to get}} him a redshirt year. I'm not going to sit here and fight it in the media. It's {{something}} we are going to try. He wants to try but we are fighting an uphill battle on this one." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Patric van Blerk's words, Into the Night We Slide is [...] "a lovely adventure, {{which never}} caught fire mainstream, but has enjoyed {{the sort of}} passionate niche-loyalty that made a {{treasure}} out of African band Freedom’s Children’s Astra. I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as the Jo’Burg Records equivalent to the other gems which took decades to go gold and platinum, such as Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing {{could be}} more to my taste," [...] the monk said joyfully. [...] "I did not feel quite sure, before, whether I was glad or sorry that my {{expulsion}} was put off, for I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> would come to that some day; but now that I learn for what service Hotspur intends me, I feel as if I could shout for joy.|$|R
2500|$|... "They're a lie," [...] said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. [...] "You're telling an {{engineer}} when {{to push a}} button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Walter Hill thought [...] "the {{audience}} {{will go with}} you when you set up an abstract world with teenage values and play out a drama within this. It was kind of real but it wasn't really. I always said whenever someone says fantasy they immediately think of more Disney--esque. The idea of a hard hitting drama in a fantasy world, that was kind of different at the time... I <b>always</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> as a musical. They kind of saw it worked in the world of an MTV video.|$|R
