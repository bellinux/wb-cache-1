Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of even more interesting newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E
5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing. Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater is <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E

5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella is <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> {{race and gender}} norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers {{understand the difference between}} gender and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{has since}} become <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> successful crew resource management. For much of aviation's history, the captain was considered the final authority, and crews were to respect the captain's expertise and not question him. This began {{to change in the}} 1970s, especially after the Tenerife airport disaster. Crew Resource Management, while still considering the captain the final authority, instructs crewmembers to speak up when they detect a problem, and instructs captains to listen to their concerns. United Airlines instituted a Crew Resource Management class in the early 1980s. The NTSB would later credit this training as valuable toward the success of United 232's crew in handling their emergency. The FAA made Crew Resource Training mandatory {{in the aftermath of the}} accident.|$|E

5|$|Carr also theorizes {{that the}} {{capacity}} to contemplate may diminish as computer algorithms unburden an Internet user's brain {{of much of the}} painstaking knowledge work — the manipulation of abstract information and knowledge — that was previously done manually. In comparing the Internet with Frederick Winslow Taylor's management system for industrial efficiency, Carr makes the point that back then some workers complained that they felt they were becoming mere automatons due to the systemic application of Taylorism — a theory of management that analyzes and synthesizes workflow processes, improving labor productivity. Carr selects Google as <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a company in which computer engineers and software designers have applied Taylorism to the knowledge industry, delivering increasingly robust information that may have the effect of minimizing opportunities to ponder ambiguities. Additionally, he argues that the Internet's dominant business model is one that thrives as companies either collect information on users or deliver them advertisements, therefore companies capitalize on users who move from link to link rather than those who engage in sustained thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim {{woman who had been}} divorced by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought the application of the Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

5|$|The theatre, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Georgian architecture. The oldest {{part of the building}} is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above the door is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly, Roa Bastos' own {{experiences}} {{played a significant}} role in his emphasis on human suffering. As a young man he fought in the Chaco war between Bolivia and Paraguay, an event he portrayed in Hijo de hombre. Later he saw the devastation of WWII at first hand in Europe, the violent strife of 1947 in Paraguay, and the rise of the Argentinian military dictatorship in 1976. His collection of short stories published in 1953, El trueno ebtre las hojas, set the stage for Hijo de hombre and Yo, el Supremo with its dark portrayal of devastating political struggle and oppression. Two decades later, Yo, el Supremo was published, providing <b>a</b> <b>prime</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Roa Bastos' idea of the engaged writer. It offered an unflattering, fictionalized account of the final thoughts and ramblings of Paraguay's first dictator, at a time when Paraguay was under the stranglehold of a regime that adopted many of the same policies of oppression and isolationism. Roa Bastos was not alone in using literature to engage in contemporary events during the Latin American Boom period. In the 1960s and 1970s, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and others adopted the same approach. Together, these writers created the Dictator novel genre.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to analyze Percy Bysshe Shelley’s St. Irvyne (1810) and “The Wandering Jew; or the Victim of the Eternal Avenger” (1811) in their entirety, thereby {{contributing}} to the growing study of his early works. Because of the early age at which Shelley produced “The Wandering Jew” and St. Irvyne, seventeen and eighteen years old respectively, these works have not been studied very closely. <b>As</b> <b>prime</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> Gothic literature, they have much to offer {{in the way of}} understanding the genre. Shelley’s youthful writings are also crucial resources for developing a further understanding of his later work. Interest in “The Wandering Jew” as an object of literary criticism has been revived by the recent appearance of an accurate complete text in a new edition of Shelley’s works. The product of this research is an annotated bibliography based on “The Wandering Jew,” St. Irvyne, Shelley’s other early Gothic novel Zastrozzi, and several Gothic novels which may have influenced Shelley’s early Gothic works. The bibliography summarizes book reviews written in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and relevant literary criticisms for each of the chosen texts. Shelley would have read the selected Gothic novels in his youth and his time at Eton College. These novels include The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho, and The Monk. Shelley adopted many of the themes and conventions present in these novels and would draw upon them for years to come. Examining these Gothic novels, their early reception, and later criticisms enables {{a better understanding of the}} development of the genre which became the context of Shelley’s first attempts at writing prose and poetry.
