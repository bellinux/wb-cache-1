50|$|An <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis</b> is {{a growth}} of keratin {{on the skin}} caused by arsenic, which occurs {{naturally}} in the earth's crust and is widely distributed in the environment, Arsenical compounds are used in industrial, agricultural, and medicinal substances. Arsenic is also found to be an environmental contaminant in drinking water (well water) and an occupational hazard for miners and glass workers. Arsenic may also causes other conditions including: Bowen's disease, cardiovascular diseases, developmental abnormalities, neurologic and neurobehavioral disorders, diabetes, hearing loss, hematologic disorders, and various types of cancer. Arsenical keratoses may persist indefinitely, and some may develop into invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Metastatic arsenic squamous cell carcinoma and arsenic-induced malignancies in internal organs such as the bladder, kidney, skin, liver, and colon, may result in death.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} done to examine the role of Nigella sativa in 28 {{patients}} of palmer <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis.</b> Patients were randomized into two groups: Group A (n- 15) receive capsules of placebo and vitamin E (200 mg) whereas Group B (n= 13) receive capsules of N. sativa oil (500 mg) and vitamin E (200 mg) orally for 8 weeks. The mean (± SD) clinical scoring of palmer <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis</b> in Group A before and after treatment was 99. 3 ± 21. 5 and 62. 3 ± 14. 3 respectively (37 % reduction). On the other hand, in N. sativa oil treated group, the mean clinical score was 119. 1 ± 20. 3 before treatment which was reduced to 39. 2 ± 8. 4 (p< 0. 0001) after treatment (67 % reduction). There were 65 % reduc-tion of total arsenic in nail of Group A and 30 % in Group B.

40|$|Spirulina, a dietary supplement, {{improves}} {{the symptoms of}} arsenical palmer keratosis. To understand its mechanism of action, palm skin extracts of moderate palmer <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis</b> (n= 10), arsenic exposed controls (n= 10) and healthy volunteers (n= 10) were collected before and after treatment with spirulina powder 10 g/day orally for 12 weeks. The mean (±SD) amount of zinc in the palm skin of healthy volunteers was 13. 1 ± 5. 7 ng/cm 2, which was not changed significantly in patients (11. 3 ± 5. 3 ng/cm 2). The amount of vitamin E in healthy volunteers was 6. 0 ± 0. 3 ng/cm 2 which was severely reduced in patients (3. 5 ± 0. 6 ng/cm 2). The amount of linoleic acid was lowered in patient (26. 7 ± 17. 1 ng/cm 2) which was statistically significant in comparison to healthy volunteers (p= 0. 029). After supplementation of spirulina, zinc level in the palm skin of arsenic exposed controls was increased {{but it was not}} statistically significant (p= 0. 068). The vitamin E and linoleic acid levels were not changed significantly in the skin of palm. In conclusion, <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis</b> showed significantly low levels of vitamin E and linoleic acid without any significant change in zinc level. After supplementation of spirulina, low levels of these three compounds were not returned towards the normal levels...|$|E
40|$|Keratosis, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} skin manifestations of arsenicosis, can be treated by either oral or topical formulation of drug. In this study we examined the effectiveness and tolerance of propylene glycol for the treatment of <b>arsenical</b> palmer <b>keratosis.</b> Sixty patients of arsenicosis with palmer keratoses were randomly divided into three groups and different concentrations (15, 30 and 45 %) of propylene glycol were applied topically into their palms once at bedtime for eight weeks. The perception of the patient about the progress of treatment was scored with “Likert scale”. The mean (±SD) score of patient’s perception following completion of treatment were 1. 27 ± 1. 26 (using 15 % propylene glycol), 2. 88 ± 1. 26 (30 % propylene glycol), and 3. 75 ± 1. 06 (45 % propylene glycol) respectively. The scores increased with higher concentra-tions. Thirty percent or more concentration of propylene glycol was effective for mild to severe form of keratosis. Propylene glycol was well tolerable. In conclusion, both roughness and thickness of <b>arsenical</b> palmer <b>keratosis</b> can be reduced using propylene glycol and as the concentration of the drug increases it increases its effectiveness without any significant adverse effect...|$|R
40|$|Thousands of Bangladeshi are {{suffering}} from arsenic-induced keratosis affecting palms and soles. Palmer keratosis, particularly in young female, affects the socioeconomic condition. Till today there is no effective treatment. Twenty patients of mild to moderate degree of <b>arsenical</b> palmer <b>keratosis</b> were treated with garlic oil in soft capsule (10 mg) daily orally for 12 weeks. Similar treatment was given to 17 arsenic exposed controls and 15 healthy volunteers for comparison. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated by change in the clinical score of palmer keratosis and amount of total arsenic in nail after 12 weeks. The mean (± SD) clinical scoring of patients before treatment was 102. 8 ± 19. 0. It was reduced to 36. 0 ± 8. 7 after completion of treatment (65 % reduction). The mean amounts of total arsenic in nail of patients and arsenic exposed controls were 13 to 14 -fold higher in comparison to healthy volunteers. Treatment with garlic oil reduced about 50 % of the total arsenic accumulated in nails. Common adverse effects were garlic smell and gastric irritation. However, there was no drop out case due to these adverse effects.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of vitamin E {{in the treatment of}} <b>arsenical</b> melanosis and <b>keratosis,</b> the buccal cells of 19 patients, 14 arsenic exposed controls and 13 healthy volunteers were collected for the estimation of vitamin E both before and after supplementation with vitamin E (200 IU, caplet) daily orally for 20 weeks. The vitamin E levels in the buccal cells of patients were significantly low in comparison to healthy volunteers (healthy vs patients: 17. 2 ± 4. 4 vs 12. 3 ± 6. 1 mg/mg of protein; p= 0. 012). These low level of vitamin E in patients returned toward normal levels following supplementation with vitamin E for 20 weeks (p= 0. 044). The vitamin E levels in serum of patients were also low (healthy vs patients: 18. 9 ± 4. 4 vs 10. 2 ± 2. 6 mg/mL; p= 0. 000). Supplementation with vitamin E overcomed the low levels of vitamin E in serum. The cholesterol levels in buccal cells and serum of patients were significantly low in comparison to healthy volunteers (buccal cells of healthy vs patients: 24. 5 ± 14. 1 vs 10. 3 ± 9. 8 mg/mg of protein; p= 0. 005; serum of healthy vs patients: 153. 5 ± 22. 8 vs 125. 3 ± 37. 0 mg/dL; p= 0. 012).

40|$|Millions now {{suffer the}} effects of chronic arseniasis related to {{environmental}} arsenic exposure. The biological mechanisms responsible for arsenic-induced toxicity and especially chronic effects, including cancer, are not well known. The U. S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) is participating in an international research effort to improve this understanding {{by the development of}} the International Tissue and Tumor Repository for Chronic Arsenosis (ITTRCA). The ITTRCA obtains, archives, and makes available for research purposes, tissues from subjects exposed to arsenic. We provide here a short overview of arsenic-induced pathology, briefly describe arsenicinduced lesions in the skin and liver, and present five case reports from the ITTRCA. Arsenicinduced skin pathology includes hyperkeratosis, pigmentation changes, Bowen disease, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinomas. A unique spectrum of skin lesions, known as <b>arsenical</b> <b>keratosis,</b> is rather characteristic of chronic arseniasis. Bowen disease, or squamous cell carcinoma in situ of the skin, has been well documented as a consequence of arsenical exposure. A spectrum of liver lesions has also been attributed to chronic arseniasis. Of these, hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, cirrhosis, and hepatoportal sclerosis have been associated with arsenic exposure. We present case reports that relate to these health conditions, namely, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and Bowen disease of the skin and hepatocellular carcinoma and angiosarcoma of the liver. Four patients had been treated with arsenical medications for such conditions as asthma, psoriasis, and syphilis, and one case occurred in a boy chronically exposed to arsenic in drinkin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Arsenical</b> <b>keratosis</b> {{and skin}} cancer {{are among the}} most common health effects {{associated}} with acute and chronic exposures to arsenic. This study examines the acute and chronic dose-responses of arsenic in established human cell lines using keratinocytes (HaCaT), melanocytes (CRL 1675) and dendritic cells (THP- 1 + A 23187). Chronic conditions were established by treating the three cell lines with at least 8 passages in 0. 2 µg/mL arsenic trioxide. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the fluorescein diacetate assay after 72 hrs of exposure. Single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay) was used to measure DNA damage. Acute exposure to arsenic had LD 10 and LD 25 values of 0. 38 µg/mL and 3. 0 µg/mL for keratinocytes; 0. 19 µg/mL and 0. 38 µg/mL for melanocytes; and 0. 38 µg/mL and 0. 75 µg/mL for dendritic cells. Cytotoxicity assays for chronically exposed cells resulted in LD 10, and LD 25 values of 0. 4 µg/mL and 0. 8 µg/mL for keratinocytes; 0. 10 µg/mL and 0. 20 µg/mL for melanocytes; and 0. 10 µg/mL and 1. 0 µg/mL for dendritic cells. The Comet assay showed that arsenic was highly genotoxic to the three cell lines. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) in DNA cleavage were observed between acute and chronic exposures. In acute exposure arsenic genotoxicity was more severe with dendritic cells while melanocytes were more sensitive to arsenic cytotoxicity. Similarly, chronically exposed dendritic cells showed the maximum genotoxic damage while melanocytes were more sensitive to arsenic cytotoxicity. In conclusion, this research shows that arsenic i...|$|E
