5|$|Although {{its origins}} are obscure, {{the site of}} the present ancient church has been used for Christian worship since it was settled in the early sixth century, {{probably}} by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named. Much of the early history of the church must remain speculative rather than definitive, due the absence of documentary or archaeological evidence. However, there are certain elements which <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> clear.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic finds at {{the site}} include {{frequent}} finds of incense-burners with handles and molded decoration. The most common domestic ceramics are of a micaceous ware and include ceramic comals (a type of griddle). Imported ceramics include Chinautla Polychrome and White-on-red, they <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> common {{at the site}}. Brown bowls are of a type also found in Zaculeu and Mixco Viejo, both of which also had a Late Postclassic occupation. Three-legged metates (a kind of mortar) were frequently recovered from the excavations and black obsidian blades were found in great quantities. Simple jade jewellery was also found.|$|E
5|$|The {{general area}} of the {{composition}} of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. Scholars <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern Madhya Pradesh.|$|E

5000|$|The term ALARP {{arises from}} UK legislation, {{particularly}} the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which requires [...] "Provision {{and maintenance of}} plant and systems of work that are, so far as <b>is</b> <b>reasonably</b> practicable, safe and without risks to health". The phrase So Far As <b>is</b> <b>Reasonably</b> Practicable (SFARP) in this and similar clauses is interpreted as leading to a requirement that risks must {{be reduced to a}} level that is As Low As <b>is</b> <b>Reasonably</b> Practicable(ALARP).|$|R

5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, burglar alarm (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> well established in the named organisms.|$|E

25|$|In general, butyl, polysulfide, polyurethane, {{and other}} {{inorganic}} or rubber-based sealants <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> compatible with copper. Acrylic, neoprene, and nitrile-based sealants actively corrode copper. Silicone sealants are somewhat successful with copper but their suitability should be verified before application.|$|E
25|$|The entropy of inhomogeneous {{systems is}} the sum of the entropies of the various subsystems. The laws of {{thermodynamics}} hold rigorously for inhomogeneous systems even though they may be far from internal equilibrium. The only condition is that the thermodynamic parameters of the composing subsystems <b>are</b> (<b>reasonably)</b> well-defined.|$|E
25|$|Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> similar. Both exclude English {{varieties}} in Europe. As Görlach {{does not}} include EFLs at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties (pidgins, creoles and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.|$|E

The craftsmen and women generally choose religion as the main theme of their work.|$|E

Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon caused a considerable increase in people using the trails, often in directions different from the original trail users.|$|E

Intentional torts have several subcategories, including tort(s) against the person, including assault, battery, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. Property torts involve any intentional {{interference with the}} property rights of the claimant. Those commonly recognised include trespass to land, trespass to chattels, and conversion.|$|E

In addition to stadium seats, there would be 20,000 £10 (US$19) tickets for the Olympic Park to watch events on big screens.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{system is a}} tiled leach field combined with a septic tank. The basic idea {{is to provide a}} small system with primary sewage treatment. Sludge settles {{to the bottom of the}} septic tank, is partially reduced by anaerobic digestion, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> safe.|$|E
25|$|New Brunswick's {{urban areas}} have modern, service-based economies {{dominated}} by the health care, educational, retail, finance, and insurance sectors. These sectors <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> equitably distributed in all three principal urban centres. In addition, heavy industry and port facilities are found in Saint John; Fredericton is dominated by government services, universities, and the military; and Moncton has developed as a commercial, retail, transportation, and distribution centre with important rail and air terminal facilities.|$|E

25|$|To date, most {{research}} has focused on FLiBe, because lithium and beryllium <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> effective moderators and form a eutectic salt mixture with a lower melting point than each of the constituent salts. Beryllium also performs neutron doubling, improving the neutron economy. This process occurs when the beryllium nucleus re-emits two neutrons after absorbing a single neutron. For the fuel carrying salts, generally 1% or 2% (by mole) of UF4 is added. Thorium and plutonium fluorides have also been used.|$|E
25|$|The type {{specimens}} of C. pauli {{were collected from}} the Jiufotang Formation, dating from the early Albian and now belong to {{the collection of the}} Paleontology Museum of Beipiao, in Liaoning, China. They are referred to by the inventory numbers LPM 0200, the holotype; LPM 0201, its counterslab (slab and counterslab together represent the earlier BPM 1 3-13); and the paratype LPM 0159, a smaller skeleton. Both individuals are preserved as articulated compression fossils; they <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> complete but partially damaged.|$|E
25|$|The genus Scuticaria {{has been}} {{traditionally}} placed close to Maxillaria but recent research shows {{they are more}} closely related to the genus Bifrenaria. Despite their interesting appearance, they are hardly seen in nature and, because their culture is complicated, they are not common in private collections and orchid shows either. No other use for these species is reported besides ornamentation. Because it is a well established genus, formed by few species that <b>are</b> <b>reasonably</b> easy to separate, there were few publications about them during the last decades.|$|E
