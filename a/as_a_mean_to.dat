25|$|A 2008 {{report by}} the RAND Corporation {{analyzing}} a theoretical 2020 attack by mainland China on Taiwan suggested that the US would likely {{not be able to}} defend Taiwan. Cruise missile developments may enable China to partially or completely destroy or make inoperative US aircraft carriers and bases in the Western Pacific. New Chinese radars will likely be able to detect US stealth aircraft and China is acquiring stealthy and more effective aircraft. RAND Corporation argued that the reliability of US beyond-visual-range missiles <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> achieve air superiority is questionable and largely unproven.|$|E
25|$|The {{birth of}} the New Indies Style was related with the {{introduction}} of new building material, the rise of Modernism and the introduction of the Agrarian Law of 1870 in Java. The new law opened Java to foreigners, enabling them to establish private enterprises in the Dutch East Indies. A new type of buildings, developments and standards have to be implemented in the Dutch East Indies. The colonial government, under the Departement voor Burgerlijke Openbare Werken (Public Works Department), developed new standards for the construction of buildings - such as hospitals, schools, town halls, post offices, and other public utilities - to consider local (tropical) climate <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> reduce the cost of building construction and maintenance cost. One of the earliest example is The Harbour Master’s Office in Semarang from early 19th-century example.|$|E
25|$|Aggression {{can have}} {{adaptive}} benefits or negative effects. Aggressive behavior {{is an individual}} or collective social interaction that is a hostile behavior {{with the intention of}} inflicting damage or harm. Two broad categories of aggression are commonly distinguished. One includes affective (emotional) and hostile, reactive, or retaliatory aggression that is a response to provocation, and the other includes instrumental, goal-oriented or predatory, in which aggression is used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> achieve a goal. An example of hostile aggression would be a person who punches someone who insulted him or her. An instrumental form of aggression would be armed robbery. Research on violence from a range of disciplines lend some support to a distinction between affective and predatory aggression. However, some researchers question the usefulness of a hostile versus instrumental distinction in humans, despite its ubiquity in research, because most real-life cases involve mixed motives and interacting causes.|$|E

25|$|The Council of the Charter of Journalistic Ethics in Georgia had {{a meeting}} on 25 March 2010, in which they {{discussed}} journalistic ethics in the Georgian media. Special Report anchor Natia Koberidze was due to attend the meeting but later withdrew. Koberidze stated that {{she was ready to}} attend the Council meeting, but due to its public format, decided to withdraw as the meeting could be used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> attack her. Eter Turadze, the Council head, stated at the meeting that it was not being held to punish anyone, although sanctions could be considered if the Council felt that journalistic ethical norms were breached. Turadze also said that the stated aim of the meeting was to call upon journalists to act according to ethical norms. As a result of Koberidze's non-attendance at the meeting, the Council sent her 16 questions via email, which among other things asked her who was responsible for the fake news report being broadcast with visible warnings that it was only a simulation, and whether she had been put under any pressure. Koberidze replied to the questionnaire by saying that she did not violate the Charter, as warnings were given to viewers as the programme began that it was a simulation. She also stated she was not aware who was responsible for the absence of visible warnings during the programme.|$|E
25|$|Although Malaka {{became a}} datuk, {{he left his}} village in October 1913 to study at Rijkskweekschool, a {{government}} teacher education school which was funded by engkus of his village. Arriving at the Netherlands, Malaka initially experienced a culture shock. He also, under-estimating the North European climate, was infected by a pleuritis in early 1914, which did not heal completely until in 1915. During his time in Europe, his knowledge about revolution <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> transformation of society started to increase. The first inspiration source was de Fransche Revolutie, a book by the German historian, author, journalist and social democratic politician Wilhelm Blos 1889, about the French revolution and historical events in France from 1789 until 1804. This book was {{given to him by}} Horensma. After the Russian Revolution of October 1917, Malaka increasingly became more and more interested in communism and socialism and communism contra reformist socialism. He was reading the books by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. Friedrich Nietzsche was also one of his early political role models, and may have given him the idea that one man could perform great deeds if he only dared to assume the role of hero. Nietzsche argued that what makes a hero (at least in Greek tragedy) is an interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian nature in man – or between the controlled, distanced, structured logical planning (Apollonian) and the wild euphoric, closeness of experience (Dionysian). During this time, around 1917 – 1920 Malaka highly disliked Dutch culture and was impressed by the German and American societies. He then signed up to be a German soldier; however, he was rejected because the German Army did not accept foreigners. There, Malaka met Henk Sneevliet, {{one of the founders of}} Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging (ISDV, forerunner of Partai Komunis Indonesia or PKI). Malaka was also interested in Sociaal-Democratische Onderwijzers Vereeniging (Association of Democrat Social Teachers). In November 1919 Malaka graduated and received his diploma, hulpactie. According to his father, during that time they communicated via mystical means called Tariqa.|$|E
