5|$|With Taurasi {{joining the}} core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma {{confidently}} predicted another championship in 2001, but the season {{turned out to be more}} difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East Tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buzzer</b> shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first National Championship.|$|E
5|$|In January of the 2014–15 season, James missed {{two weeks}} due to left knee {{and lower back}} strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In {{the second round of}} the playoffs, he hit a {{baseline}} jumper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls. In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} collegiate game, against Duke, Farmer played 7 minutes and air balled his only shot. After an early season loss to Notre Dame in the Big Four Classic dropped the Wildcats' record to 23, Sutton noted that Farmer, Sean Sutton, and LaRon Ellis had all missed {{practice}} {{time with the}} flu. After managing just 17 points in the Wildcats' first five games, Farmer scored 10 points in 20 minutes in the team's sixth game against Northwestern State. With 12 seconds {{to go in the}} game and Kentucky trailing 8482, Farmer was whistled for an intentional foul on Northwestern State's Roman Banks while trying to draw a charge on an inbounds play. Banks maintained that Farmer had tugged Banks toward him and fallen down, attempting to draw the call, but Farmer and Sutton both denied the alleged chicanery. Banks hit one of two free throws, and Farmer missed a potentially game-tying three-point shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer,</b> dropping the Wildcats to 24 on the season. Farmer followed up with a 15-point performance in a win against Western Carolina. In the Kentucky Invitational Tournament, where Kentucky lost its opening round game to Bowling Green before winning the third-place game against Marshall, Farmer scored 12 points in each game.|$|E

5|$|On April 24, 2007, the Raptors {{won their}} first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 {{victory over the}} New Jersey Nets, but lost the series 4–2. The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court {{advantage}} in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets {{took charge of the}} series, winning games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer.</b> Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, Roy {{scored a}} career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns. He made 14 of 27 {{shots from the}} field, 19 of 21 from the free-throw line, and 5 of 7 from the three-point line. He also added six assists, five rebounds and a blocked shot, all without a turnover. On January 24, Roy tied a Blazers {{franchise}} record with 10 steals against the Washington Wizards. On February 8 with the Blazers trailing by 1 against the Knicks, Roy made a layup <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> to win it 109–108. As of February 16, 2009, Roy has had 24 shots which tied or won the games with 35 seconds or less. Roy was again selected as a reserve in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game, where he scored 14 points in 7-for-8 shooting, grabbed 5 boards, and dished out 5 assists in a game-high 31 minutes of action. On April 13, Roy was named Western Conference Player of the Week, the fourth time he has won the award. Roy and Clyde Drexler are the only Portland Trail Blazers to win the award four times. Roy finished 9th in MVP voting for the 2008–09 season, garnering one 4th-place vote and four 5th-place votes {{for a total of}} 7 points. Roy was named to the All-NBA Second Team on May 13, and was the first Blazer to make an All-NBA team since the 1991–92 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney, Chamberlain seriously injured his knee. He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule, {{suffering}} a total rupture of the patellar tendon {{at the base of}} his right kneecap, and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season. Owing to a great start, he managed to average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Again, the Lakers charged through the playoffs, and in the 1970 NBA Finals, the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks, loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Cherry observed that Reed, a prolific midrange shooter, was a bad matchup for Chamberlain: having lost lateral quickness due to his injury, the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed's preferred high post jump shots. In Game 1, New York masterminded a 124–112 win in which Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> to tie the game at 102; however, the Knicks took the game 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by double digits, Reed pulled his thigh muscle and seemed to be done for the series. By conventional wisdom, Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense: L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York.|$|E
2500|$|In a cat's whisker {{detector}} {{only certain}} {{sites on the}} crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions, and the device was very sensitive to {{the pressure of the}} crystal-wire contact, which could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. Therefore, a usable contact point had to be found by trial and error before each use. The operator dragged the wire across the crystal surface until a radio station or [...] "static" [...] sounds were heard in the earphones. [...] Alternatively, some radios (circuit, right) used a battery-powered <b>buzzer</b> attached to <b>the</b> input circuit to adjust the detector. <b>The</b> spark <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer's</b> electrical contacts served as a weak source of static, so when the detector began working, the buzzing could be heard in the earphones.

5000|$|The Hoosiers trailed {{the entire}} {{first half of}} the game until Wittman scored <b>at</b> <b>the</b> halftime <b>buzzer</b> with a deep corner shot.

50|$|Three {{teams of}} two start the game, with one player from each team <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzers</b> and their {{teammates}} standing behind them. Wax asks {{a total of}} eight questions during this round. Once she finishes reading each question, a 10-second timer starts; the point value is determined by how long the players wait to buzz in. Values start at 1 point, then increase to 3, 5, 8, 12, and finally 15 points just before time expires. When a player buzzes in, his/her teammate must answer the question without conferring. A correct answer awards the points to that team, while a miss awards them to both opposing teams. For the last three questions, a miss automatically scores 15 points for the opposing teams regardless of the current question value.|$|R
25|$|On January 27, 1985, Bird hit {{an amazing}} {{baseline}} jumper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> while {{falling out of}} bounds to give the Celtics a 128–127 win over Portland.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 2015, Pierce made a {{two-point}} {{shot with}} three defenders on him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> {{to defeat the}} Atlanta Hawks 103–101 and take a 2–1 series lead in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. He finished the game with 13 points and 7 rebounds. In Game 6 of the series on May 15, the Wizards were down 94–91 with seconds remaining when Pierce launched a three-pointer, hoping to extend the Wizards' season by forcing overtime. The shot swished, apparently tying the score <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer,</b> but the play was reviewed, showing the clock expired before Pierce released the basketball. Pierce finished the playoffs averaging 14.6 points and shot 52.4 percent from three in 10 playoff games.|$|E
25|$|Although the Nets won {{the series}} in 5, {{it would be}} most {{remarkable}} for more playoff heroics by Reggie Miller; Miller banked in a 40-footer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> to force OT, and then fly in for a dunk over 3 Net defenders with 3.1 {{seconds left in the}} extra session to force the 2nd overtime.|$|E
5000|$|There {{can be a}} mix of <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> {{team and}} <b>the</b> {{presentation}} team participates in fourth quarter. Five players sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzers</b> with an additional five in reserve. The first question is given to both teams with members in seat one. the preceding questions continue down to seat two, three, and so forth. When a question is given to seat one, for example, no one but seat one may answer. The students must wait until the judge calls on them. If a student answers correctly, they are awarded two points. If the answer is wrong, however, one point is deducted from the score and a foul {{is given to the}} player. If a student does not know the answer, they may pass. This means they receive a foul, but no point deduction. If both students pass, answer wrongly, or time runs out and the right answer has still not been given, the judges declare [...] "Free for all". The student must wait until the judge finishes saying [...] "Free for all." [...] Anyone on either team at this point has five seconds (or the remaining time in the 30 seconds, whichever is longer) to buzz in and answer.|$|R
5000|$|In this round, the {{deciding}} round called [...] "Mixed-Up Mad Libs", the host read {{a series of}} statements that had a crazy word inserted in each one.

50|$|For {{the first}} time in ANW history, the athletes competed on Stage 4. Travis Rosen was {{selected}} as the first competitor on ANW to attempt the final stage and he made it all the way up Midoriyama's 90-foot tower with a 77-foot rope with a time of 0:35.77. However, Sean McColl beat Rosen's time by 3/10th of a second (0:00.31), winning the competition for Team Europe as they became the World Champions of ANW. Rosen missed on his first attempt <b>at</b> hitting <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the rope climb.|$|R
25|$|In Game 4, Sacramento again {{got out to}} a fast {{start with}} a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final {{possession}} {{with a chance to}} tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry at the arc, who hit a 3 over Webber <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer</b> to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two more crucial 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant with 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.|$|E

50|$|Duke however {{tore through}} the Midwest Regional, {{defeating}} St. John's to join UNLV, Kansas, and rival North Carolina in the Final Four in Indianapolis. Entering the semifinals against UNLV, the Blue Devils were facing an undefeated and top-ranked Runnin' Rebels squad that boasted a 45-game winning streak and featured National Player of the Year Larry Johnson. In {{one of the}} biggest upsets in Final Four history, however, Duke got its revenge from a year ago by a score of 79-77 after Laettner hit two free throws with 12 seconds remaining and UNLV guard Anderson Hunt missed a three-point attempt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end-of-game <b>buzzer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Coming {{out of the}} half, Orlando cut {{the lead}} to 5 with 7:45 {{remaining}} in the 3rd on a 3-pointer by Rafer Alston. Lamar Odom answered with back-to-back 3-pointers to restore the Laker lead to double digits. Leading {{by as much as}} 18 in the half, Los Angeles led by 15 going into the 4th quarter.

The Pistons {{took control of the}} game with six seconds left in the first half when Bill Laimbeer hit a 3-point shot to put the Pistons up 54-40. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar then fired an inbound pass intended for Byron Scott, but it was intercepted by Isiah Thomas who let fly with another three-pointer which went in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> halftime <b>buzzer.</b> <b>The</b> Pistons had a 57-40 halftime lead and never looked back, stealing Game 1 with a 105-93 win.|$|R

25|$|As {{the series}} shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed {{almost the entire}} fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92-91 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led L.A. with 30 points, but missed a {{potential}} game winner <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>buzzer.</b> O'Neal had 28 points, but did not take {{a shot in the}} 4th quarter and fouled out.|$|E
