25|$|The UK case of R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, {{ex parte}} Coughlan (1999) {{established}} that legitimate expectations {{may have a}} substantive element as well. This involves a consideration of whether a change in policy was justified even after the individuals who {{would be affected by}} the change had already been consulted by the decision-making authority. In other words, a finding of substantive legitimate expectation may prevent a decision-maker from going back on a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive a substantive benefit of some kind. Substantive legitimate expectation was found to be <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> judicial review in Singapore in Chiu Teng. The Court of Appeal has yet to rule definitively on whether substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized in Singapore as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> judicial review. In any case, it is arguably a form of illegality rather than procedural impropriety.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation was first developed in English law as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> judicial review in administrative law {{to protect a}} procedural or substantive interest when a public authority rescinds from a representation made to a person.

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Western Force in then Super 14 Rugby {{competition}} there was a push to have a 30,000+ capacity rectangular stadium in Perth. Western Force and Perth Glory joined forces to lobby the Western Australian Government for <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> this size. The Force previously played games out of the 40,000-seat oval-shaped AFL ground Subiaco Oval, which hosted several Glory games before, generally NSL Finals games, most notably the 1999–2000 season NSL Grand Final when an all-time NSL record crowd of 43,242 fans saw Wollongong Wolves beat Glory on penalties following a 3–3 draw. With the Force moving to nib Stadium prior to the 2010 Super 14 Season a small increase in capacity was made to the ground, increasing capacity from around 18,000 to 20,500 increased corporate areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms, {{which is}} both a charter of rights and a human rights act, was amended to {{prohibit}} discrimination based on sexual orientation. Thus, the province of Quebec became the first jurisdiction in the world larger than a city or county to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination in {{the private and public}} sectors. In 1984, in the Province of Manitoba LGBT activists pushed for inclusion of protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation with tactics including a 59-day hunger strike by Richard North. In 1987, Manitoba passed the Human Rights Code which included protections from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Today, sexual orientation is explicitly mentioned as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> prohibited discrimination in the human rights acts of all jurisdictions in Canada.|$|E

500|$|The High Court in Fong Thin Choo arguably {{recognized}} {{errors of}} material fact as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> review when it endorsed Lord Wilberforce's remarks in Tameside {{that if a}} judgment {{to be made by}} a public authority requires the existence of certain facts, the court must determine [...] "whether the judgment has been made upon a proper self-direction as to those facts", and the court can interfere if the authority has acted [...] "upon an incorrect basis of fact".

500|$|The act or {{decision}} {{of a public}} authority is challengeable if it acted in bad faith, that is, it [...] "intentionally abused its power or was reckless {{as to whether it}} did so". Thus, the Singapore Court of Appeal held in Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis (2008) that the Attorney-General [...] "may not use his prosecutorial power in bad faith for an extraneous purpose". The applicant must adduce sufficient evidence to prove bad faith; mere suspicion is inadequate. The court will consider all the evidence as well as any explanation provided by the respondent, and an inference against the respondent can be drawn if no explanation is given. In the UK context, bad faith is seldom relied on as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> review as it is absent in most cases, or difficult to prove.|$|E

500|$|A UK case {{in which}} {{improper}} purpose as <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> judicial review was considered was Wheeler v. Leicester City Council (1985). Leicester City Council banned a rugby club, Leicester Football Club, from using one of its recreation grounds because {{some members of the}} club had taken part in a tournament in South Africa. At that time, the Government of South Africa practised apartheid, and the Council had a policy not to support this. However, the club members who travelled to South Africa, while not agreeing with apartheid, believed that the social barriers created by apartheid could be broken down by maintaining sporting links with the country. The club members had not acted unlawfully by choosing to participate in the tournament, and neither had the club by permitting them to do so. Lord Templeman said that: ...|$|E

The parchment is unusually thick and has a thin insoluble layer of primer. The wooden frames were primed in a thick layer of white, which overlaps the parchment in places. The borders were gilded at some time; technical analysis found particles of gold leaf on the lower border.

500|$|The Milton Keynes Stadium Consortium or [...] "Stadium MK", led by Pete Winkelman and {{his company}} Inter MK Group, was formed in 2000. It {{proposed}} a large development in the southern Milton Keynes district of Denbigh North, including a 30,000-capacity football stadium, a [...] Asda hypermarket, an IKEA store, a hotel, a conference centre, and a retail park. The plan to build <b>a</b> <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> this size was {{complicated by the fact}} that there was no professional football club in Milton Keynes and that the highest-ranked team in the town, (another) Milton Keynes City—based in Wolverton in northern Milton Keynes, and formerly known as Mercedes-Benz F.C.—played in the then eighth-tier Spartan South Midlands League, four divisions below the Football League. The developers could not justify building such a stadium for a club of this small stature. Rather than wait for MK City or another local team to progress through the pyramid, Winkelman resolved to [...] "import" [...] an established League club to use the ground.|$|E
