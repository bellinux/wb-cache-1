As the first step towards developing a model for this scenario, we sampled microbial communities from the <b>aeration</b> <b>basin</b> of a MWWTP at three seasonal time points. Having established a baseline for community composition, we investigated how the community changed when propagated in the laboratory, including cell culture media conditions that could provide selective pressure in future studies.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{in order to establish}} whether N 2 O could be used to predict nitrification failure (through non-invasive means). Previous research had shown a strong correlation between N 2 O gas and NH 3 in the effluent, giving rise to the possibility N 2 O can be used as an indicator for failure in the nitrification process. Two pilot-scale activated sludge plants were used, each with two lanes. The smaller consisted of a 601 aeration tank and a 20 1 clarifier; the larger pilot plant had an aeration tank of 315 1 and a clarifier of 1001. The small pilot plant experiments showed that N 2 O gas was given off almost immediately from O- 2 deprivation/NH 3 shock loads, but did not follow the expected trend of the time lag of NH 3 in the effluent.

Addition of metal coagulants on the <b>aeration</b> <b>basin</b> (simultaneous precipitation) involves lowest cost; however, inert solids reduce the volatile solids percentage which can be deleterious to the biological process. The general objective {{of the present study}} was to analyze the feasibility of P removal in a wastewater model system of the dairy industry using simultaneous precipitation in a laboratory-scale activated sludge reactor by addition of ferric chloride. Results showed that the addition of a high dose Fe:P (molar ratio) = 1. 9 - 2. 3 : 1 on the <b>aeration</b> <b>basin</b> of the reactor caused a progressive enrichment of the sludge with inorganic solids. This phenomenon, which involved a gradual deterioration of the environmental quality of the biological system, led finally to a strong decline of the reactor performance. The organisms associated to flocs (crawling ciliates and attached ciliates) were the more sensitive to these changes. A mathematical model allowed the estimation of the concentration of total fixed suspended solids as well as the decrease in the abundance of these organism groups as a function of time of Fe(III) application, considering the influent flow rate, the influent Fe concentration, and the waste flow rate of the sludge. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the sludge biotic index (SBI) can early predict the decreasing of the system performance due to metal salts overload.

40|$|In the <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> {{of sewage}} {{treatment}} plants, compressed air is supplied to diffusers {{near the bottom}} of tanks to aid in the conversion by aerobic bacteria of dissolved and suspended solids of sewage into particles that will settle. Air bubbles breaking at the air-water interface will aerosolize bacteria that concentrate in the uppermost microlayer. The microbiological output of a plant in New York City with such a system was monitored. Samples of the gaseous effluent were collected inside the aeration building, inside the building's stack, 300 meters upwind (background sampler), and 300 meters downwind (test sampler), using Andersen samplers. Among the genera identified in the atmosphere in and around the plant were Mycobacterium, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus, all potentially pathogenic. The disinfection power of ozone, which is generally used for odor control, was also tested. Samples were taken from the ozone mixing chamber in the stack of the thickentng tank building. No significant difference in general bacterial counts could be detected at different levels of ozone production. It appears that in the air, ozone is an ineffective bactericidal agent. Results in this preliminary study demonstrate the need to evaluate the hazard of microbial aerosols generated by sewage treatment plants similar to the one studied. The possibility of such hazards is of special interest where facilities are located upwind of populations especially susceptible to infections, because of age of debility.

40|$|Foaming in {{activated}} sludge systems {{is characterized by}} the formation of a thick, chocolate brown-colored scum that floats on the surface of <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> and secondary clarifiers. These viscous foams have been associated with the presence of filamentous mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes. To aid in evaluating the microbial representation in foam, we developed and characterized group-, genus-, and species-specific oligonucleotide probes targeting the small subunit rRNA of the Mycobacterium complex, Gordona spp., and Gordona (Nocardia) amarae, respectively. The use of a universal base analog, 5 -nitroindole, in oligonucleotide probe design was evaluated by comparing the characteristics of two different versions of the Mycobacterium complex probe. The temperature of dissociation of each probe was determined. Probe specificity studies with a diverse collection of 67 target and nontarget rRNAs demonstrated the specificity of the probes to the target groups. Whole-cell hybridizations with fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled probes were performed with pure cultures of various members of the Mycobacterium complex as well as with environmental samples from a full-scale {{activated sludge}} plant which experienced foaming. Quantitative membrane hybridizations with activated sludge and anaerobic digester foam showed that 15. 0 to 18. 3 % of the total small-subunit rRNAs could be attributed to members of the Mycobacterium complex, of which a vast majority consisted of Gordona rRNA.

40|$|The {{formation}} of viscous foams on <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> and secondary clarifiers of activated sludge plants {{is a common}} and widespread problem. Foam formation is often attributed {{to the presence of}} mycolic acid-containing actinomycetes (mycolata). In order {{to examine the relationship between}} the number of mycolata and foam, we developed a group-specific probe targeting the 16 S rRNA of the mycolata, a protocol to permeabilize mycolata, and a statistically robust quantification method. Statistical analyses showed that a lipase-based permeabilization method was quantitatively superior to previously described methods (P << 0. 05). When mixed liquor and foam samples were examined, most of the mycolata present were rods or cocci, although filamentous mycolata were also observed. A nested analysis of variance showed that virtually all of the measured variance occurred between fields of view and not between samples. On this basis we determined that as few as five fields of view could be used to give a statistically meaningful sample. Quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to examine the relationship between foaming and the concentration of mycolata in a 20 -m 3 completely mixed activated sludge plant. Foaming occurred when the number of mycolata exceeded a certain threshold value. Baffling of the plant affected foaming without affecting the number of mycolata. We tentatively estimated that the threshold foaming concentration of mycolata was about 2 × 106 cells ml− 1 or 4 × 1012 cells m− 2. We concluded that quantitative use of FISH is feasible and that quantification is a prerequisite for rational investigation of foaming in activated sludge...|$|R

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is an energy intensive process often requiring {{the use of}} advanced treatment technologies. Stricter effluent standards have resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced treatment over time. Accordingly, associated energy consumption has also increased. Concerns about lowering operating costs for WWTPs and reducing associated greenhouse gas generation present an incentive to investigate energy use in WWTPs. This research investigated the impact of wastewater strength and the introduction of advanced treatment technologies, to replace traditional technologies on energy use to treat wastewater in WWTPs. Major unit processes were designed for a 100 MGD plant and variables controlling energy were identified and used to compute energy consumption. Except for primary clarification and plate and frame press dewatering, energy consumption computed using fundamental equations are within values in the literature. Results show that energy consumption for dissolved air flotation thickeners, centrifuges, gravity thickeners, and <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> are heavily influence by wastewater strength. Secondary treatment and tertiary treatment require a significant amount of energy. Secondary treatment requires 104 times the energy of preliminary treatment, 17 times the energy of solids processing, and 2. 5 times the energy of tertiary treatment. Secondary treatment requires 41 times the energy of preliminary treatment, and 7 times the energy of solids processing. The results of this research provide a means of estimating energy consumption in the design and operation phase of a WWTP. By using the fundamental equations and methodology presented, alternative technologies can be compared or targeted for future energy savings implementation. Limitations of the methodology include design assumptions having to be made carefully, as well as assumptions of motor and equipment efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Gas {{injection}} {{is known}} {{to play a major}} role on the particle size of the sludge, the oxygen transfer rate, as well as the mixing efficiency of membrane bioreactors and <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> in the waste water treatment plants. The rheological characteristics of sludge are closely related to the particle size of the sludge floc. However, particle size of sludge floc depends partly on the shear induced in the sludge and partly on physico-chemical nature of the sludge. The objective of this work is to determine the impact of gas injection on both the apparent viscosity and viscoelastic property of sludge. The apparent viscosity of sludge was investigated by two methods: in-situ and after sparging. Viscosity curves obtained by in-situ measurement showed that the apparent viscosity decreases significantly from 4000 Pa s to 10 Pa s at low shear rate range (below 10 s − 1) with an increase in gas flow rate (0. 5 LPM to 3 LPM); however the after sparging flow curve analysis showed that the reduction in apparent viscosity throughout the shear rate range is negligible to be displayed. Torque and displacement data at low shear rate range revealed that the obtained lower apparent viscosity in the in-situ method is not the material characteristics, but the slippage effect due to a preferred location of the bubbles close to the bob, causing an inconsistent decrease of torque and increase of displacement at low shear rate range. In linear viscoelastic regime, the elastic and viscous modulus of sludge was reduced by 33 % & 25 %, respectively, due to gas injection because of induced shear. The amount of induced shear measured through two different tests (creep and time sweep) were the same. The impact of this induced shear on sludge structure was also verified by microscopic images...|$|R
40|$|In the Research Centre Karlsruhe a {{waste water}} {{treatment}} plant with 1000 population equivalents is operated employing the activated sludge process, whereby the waste water is supplied by a separate sewerage system. Caused by this, the waste water quantities are considerably varying, and, furthermore, the inflow contains high ammonia concentrations, making an optimal cleaning performance difficult. Additionally the crude waste water has a low BOD/nitrogen relation, which is disadvantageous for a biological nitrogenelimination. At the end of 1997 the outflow concentration standards were modified {{in the course of a}} new permission by water right, based now on the minimum requirements of the German Waste Water Ordinance for treatment plants of the size class 4, because the effluent of the STP feeds a sensible river. This meant that for the first time a limit value for phosphorus of 3 mg/L P was set and that concerning nitrogen a reduction of the limit from 40 mg/L N on 18 mg/L N was decided. It was the aim of the investigations to lower the nitrate concentrations in the purified waste water from about 25 mg/L N to 10 mg/L N without, although mostly unavoidable, extra investment costs and without increasing the running costs. As first step the conditions in the STP of the Research Centre Karlsruhe were thoroughly investigated. From this analysis a catalogue of possible measures were obtained, of which up to now two points were put into operation: 1. introduction of a denitrification step by anoxic opecation of one of the two <b>aeration</b> <b>basins</b> 2. increase of the BSB/N relation in the inflow water by the dosage of the kitchen wastes of the mess of the Research Centre Karlsruhe thus serving as an external source of carbon. These measures could be put into operation mainly just by variating the operational modes and with nearly no additional costs. By this, a considerable improvement of the quality of the purified waste water and, furthermore, a noticeably saving of the running cost of the STP was achieved. (orig.)
