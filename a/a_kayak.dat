5|$|Minnie Island State Park offers {{opportunities}} for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat. Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity, which is redundant because {{the island is}} accessible by boat. The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use <b>a</b> <b>kayak</b> to access the island because the island is heavily wooded {{and it is difficult}} to find a spot to dock.|$|E
25|$|Kayaking – use of <b>a</b> <b>kayak</b> {{for moving}} across water. It is {{distinguished}} from canoeing by the sitting {{position of the}} paddler {{and the number of}} blades on the paddle. <b>A</b> <b>kayak</b> is a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks.|$|E

50|$|As {{compared}} to the other big <b>kayaks,</b> <b>a</b> recreational <b>kayak</b> has characteristics which are different like a larger cockpit that is easy to open, make an entry and exit from. It has a wider beam of about 27-30 inches for more stability in water and is generally less than 12 feet in length. This smaller dimensions of the recreational kayak makes it smaller than a longer boat. As {{compared to}} the big <b>kayaks,</b> <b>a</b> recreational <b>kayak</b> is light, and thus it is easier to handle {{both in and out of}} water. This recreational kayak is cheaper as compared to <b>a</b> big <b>kayak.</b> Since the recreational <b>kayak</b> has <b>a</b> wider hull, recreational kayaks will not track lines, especially straight lines as compared to longer and narrower models. <b>A</b> recreational <b>kayak</b> has limited cargo carrying capacity as compared to <b>a</b> huge <b>kayak.</b> The materials used to manufacture the recreational kayak is rotomolded polyethylene which is less expensive and has fever options. Recreational kayaks are generally used for fishing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{volume of}} a squirt boat is {{generally}} {{less than half}} of the volume of <b>a</b> normal <b>kayak</b> of the same length. This often ranges from 24-35 gallons (90-130 liters) for a squirt boat, but 50-70 gallons (190-260 liters) for <b>a</b> typical <b>kayak.</b>|$|R

The biggest attraction is to navigate the waterway in <b>a</b> <b>kayak,</b> canoe, fishing boat or a motorboat. It is also possible to visit part of the canal and the Augustów lakes in a passenger ship.|$|E

All kayaks had ayaperviik on them. This one has a woman's frowning face with a down-turned mouth carved on it. Perhaps the other side would have a man's smiling face carved on it.|$|E
25|$|Kayaks are {{generally}} differentiated from canoes by the sitting {{position of the}} paddler {{and the number of}} blades on the paddle. In <b>a</b> <b>kayak</b> the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double bladed paddle. In a canoe the paddler faces forward and sits or kneels in the boat, using a single bladed paddle. In some parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, kayaks are considered a subtype of canoe. Continental European and British canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} a number of {{techniques}} for unassisted righting and re-entry of <b>a</b> <b>kayak</b> after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, it is much easier to climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.|$|E
25|$|Wrist-length mittens {{used to be}} {{commonly}} made of seal or caribou {{skin with}} the fur and the rough edge of the seam on the outside. Sealskin mittens were frequently made from leftover pieces of skin after boots were cut from them. The back and palm were separate pieces and the thumb one piece; gloves were unknown. Women wore fur mittens reaching nearly to the elbow with wolverine trim along the upper edge. Mittens of silver salmon skins which reached to the elbow were worn by men when hunting in <b>a</b> <b>kayak</b> in spring. The fish were cut down the back and the belly skins used for mittens. These sometimes were lined with grass or had grass mittens, woven all in one piece, inside; often they had a border of bleached sealskin. The combination of fish skin mittens with grass padding was less bulky for paddling than fur mittens. According to Curtis (1930, p.11), mittens of dehaired sealskin that reached barely to the wrist were also worn by men in the spring.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the city}} {{is located on the}} Tuolumne River and near the Stanislaus River, it has no {{operating}} port for oceangoing ships due to the shallow depths of these rivers, and also due to a small dam on the Tuolumne River near Highway 99. In Modesto there is also a small creek aptly named Dry Creek, which although badly polluted by agricultural runoff, is adjacent to several parks in Modesto. Most of the rivers and streams are otherwise not accessible to public use or view due to fences and private property rights. There are no public boat ramps or docks within the city limits. Although summertime brings high temperatures, swimming is prohibited by local ordinance in rivers, creeks, and the many irrigation canals. Rivers and lakes near Waterford are wide enough to be accessible for <b>a</b> <b>kayak,</b> or small motorboat, and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when hydroelectric power dams were installed upstream for valuable flood control, irrigation, and electric power generation. The nearest large open seaport is the Port of Stockton, used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.|$|E
