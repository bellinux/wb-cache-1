50|$|Vladimir Kozlov and Dmitry Oreshkin <b>analysed</b> <b>results</b> {{from the}} polling {{stations}} that used electronic ballot counting systems (KOIB or kompleksy po obrabotke izbiratelnykh bulletney, complexes for processing of electoral ballots) and the polling stations that utilized manual counting of ballots. In Moscow on the polling stations with automatic ballot counting the average participations was 57.3% with 65.9% {{out of this}} number voting for Dmitri Medvedev. In the polling stations with manual processing of ballots the participation was 70.5% with 75.3% voting for Dmitri Medvedev. The similar results were obtained for other Russian regions. Moreover, some polling stations used automatic ballot processing for Russian presidential election, 2008 but manual processing for Russian legislative election, 2007 registered significant shift from the winning candidate towards the opposition while all the stations that used automatic processing for the legislative elections but manual for the presidential elections registered a dramatic shift in support for the winning candidates. According to the authors the data prove a significant manipulations (about ten percent) on the polling station in support for Dmitri Medvedev and the United Russia. According {{to the head of}} Russian Central Elections Commission (CEC) Vladimir Churov in future the Election Commission would use only manual ballot processing.|$|E

The analyses are carried out by adopting a simplified constitutive law of steel at high temperature, characterized by an elastic-perfectly plastic curve without hardening. In addition, in order to evaluate the influence of this simplified constitutive law on the <b>analyses</b> <b>results,</b> the 3 D finite element model is also analysed through the software ABAQUS/Standard, in which the constitutive law of steel at high temperature is modelled according to Eurocode 1993 - 1 - 2...|$|R

Audio data samples of both mono and stereo types were encrypted. In the application here, single and double dimension discrete-time chaotic systems were used.

The aim {{of the study is}} to examine the prehistorical living to find a hint for symbiosis lifestyle, which is a big interest for modern society. Prehistoric period (Jomon period) of Aichi prefecture in Tokai region, Japan is selected as a case study area. The different reaction of Jomon settlements against the global environmental change occurred in the period was considered. The consideration pointed out the conditions and factors which influence the environmental endurance of the settlements. The reconstruction of the site-catchment was implemented based on the geoinformatics technology, especially by utilizing GIS as a supportive measure. The spatially <b>analysed</b> <b>results</b> were translated into realistic representation by Computer Graphics. The integration of spatially <b>analysed</b> <b>results</b> and the archaeological knowledge have deepened the understanding of the prehistorical events. 1...|$|E
