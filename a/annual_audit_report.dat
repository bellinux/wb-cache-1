40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Korea’s fair disclosure regulation on the timeliness and informativeness of earnings announcements. The present regulation for Korean listed firms requires that if a company’s sales revenue, operating income (or loss) and net income (or loss) have changed by over 30 % compared to the prior year, the firm must disclose this information through a preliminary financial report (PFR) even before the company is audited by external auditors. To analyze {{the effects of this}} policy, we first investigate the timeliness of preliminary financial report disclosures. We examine the extent to which Korean listed companies actually comply with the requirement for prompt notification of information concerning material changes in financial performance. Second, we investigate the informativeness of preliminary financial reports by analyzing differential stock market reactions to different timings of preliminary financial report disclosures. Our empirical results reveal {{that more than half of}} our sample firms release their preliminary financial reports after external audits are completed, thereby potentially invalidating the effectiveness of the regulation. In addition, we find that preliminary financial reports have information value only if they are disclosed prior to <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> <b>report</b> dates. This finding supports the notion that timeliness increases the informativeness of preliminary financial report disclosure by curbing insiders’ ability to potentially profit from their information advantage...|$|E

They were allocated to consecutive ten-year periods by their time of diagnosis. Patient and tumour characteristics have been relatively stable. Eighty percent of all patients received surgical treatment and the amputation rate decreased from 64 % to 23 %. The percentage of patients receiving chemotherapy has remained around 80 %. The use of radiotherapy in primary treatment decreased gradually from 33 % to 18 %. Sarcoma specific survival (SSS) at five years for all patients increased significantly from 39 % to 53 %. Similar trends for improvement were seen for both OS and ES.

External auditing is a regular activity for mental health services in Australia but internal auditing activities are conducted at the discretion of each service. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of 6 years of internal auditing activities in a mental health service. A review of the scope, audit tools, purpose, sampling and design of the internal audits and identification of the recommendations from six consecutive <b>annual</b> <b>audit</b> <b>reports</b> was completed. <b>Audit</b> recommendations were examined, as well as levels of implementation and reasons for success or failure.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Commerce (MCOM) at Strathmore UniversityThis study sought to investigate the effect of business diversification on the financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya. The study {{was based on the}} fact that the banking sector in Kenya is highly regulated with significant business restrictions and attendant disclosures which have created incentives for the banks to diversify. However, the effect of business diversification on financial performance remains inconclusive with diverse studies finding minimal or no relationship while others finding positive significant effect. The study used a mixed research design where descriptive and quantitative research designs were used. The population for this study was all the forty two commercial banks in Kenya. Sources of data were both secondary and primary where quantitative techniques were used to undertake data analysis. To determine the relationship that existed between the variables, both multiple regression analysis and chi-square tests were adopted. The study found that business diversification significantly positively affected how the commercial banks in Kenya performed. The exact effect was however established to be largely dependent on bank-size. Business diversification significantly improved financial performance for small banks. Under medium sized banks category, only location diversification affected financial performance in a significant manner. For large banks all the four forms of business diversification did not have a significant effect on their financial performance. Respondents perceived business diversification to positively affect financial performance of commercial banks in Kenya to a moderate extent. The study was limited by examining financial performance by use of the CAMELS model in a developing country and being conducted in a single industry. Further, CAMELS was measured using a constructed index by data being obtained from the commercial banks’ <b>annual</b> <b>audited</b> <b>reports.</b> The study highlighted the need to develop business diversification strategies specifically tailored for each of the tiers of commercial banks with a focus on all forms of diversification for small banks, location diversification for the medium-sized banks and enhancement of existing forms of diversification among large commercial banks...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Swedish law require companies’ <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> to be <b>audited.</b> Due to that {{auditing}} {{have the}} effect of a quality stable to honest and reliable reports. Now the Swedish law is making exemption of the audit duty for small companies. This means that auditing is voluntary. Therefore, when small companies choose to take away auditing they will also choose to take away the quality stable in their annual report. The quality stable is of matter for creditors’ decision to supply financial resources, due to that the quality stable from auditing contributes to trust. With trust, small companies will get financial resources from banks. By taking away auditing will lead to less trust which affects the supply of financial resources.    Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to examine from banks’ perspective trust for company in relation to the annual report, and company´s possibilities of financial credit from banks.         Method: This study carried out the multiple case studies to gain richer understanding on trust. The case study aims to examine a small sample of the population. This method also generates answers to how as well as what and why. The author randomly chose three banks and carried out in-depth interviews with them. Theory: Auditing is the auditor’s statement of the annual report. It requires the auditor to be independent and have integrity when making the statement. The role of the auditor is to state the reliability of the annual report. Therefore, his role is vital to the contribution of trust. Driscoll (1978) and  (1988)  made research on trustee and trustor’s relationship. Their research bases on the several contributions to trust and the process of remaining trust between them. Which, in this study the reliability, <b>audited</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> is main source that contributes to trust. The vital link in this trustee (company) and trustor (bank) relationship is the <b>audited</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report.</b> Conclusion: The study contributes to a lack in auditing reduces creditor’s (bank) trust in the annual report. The auditor’s statement of risk is vital for creditors in making decision upon financial support to small companies.
