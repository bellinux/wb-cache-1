5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his coat pocket.|$|E
5|$|Until the 21st century, Istiodactylus was {{the only}} known {{pterosaur}} of its kind, and was placed in its own family, Istiodactylidae, within the group Ornithocheiroidea. Istiodactylus differed from other istiodactylids by having a proportionally shorter skull. The distinctive teeth of Istiodactylus indicate {{that it was a}} scavenger that may have used its teeth to sever morsels from large carcasses in the manner of <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> cutter. The wings of Istiodactylus may have been adapted for soaring, which would have helped it find carcasses before terrestrial carnivores. Istiodactylus is known from the Wessex Formation and the younger Vectis Formation, which represent river and coastal environments that were shared with various pterosaurs, dinosaurs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in fact she is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes the target is Oscar when Angela angrily crushes <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E

One benefit is that for websites that one frequently visits that requires a password, cookies make it so {{they do not have}} to sign in every time. <b>A</b> <b>cookie</b> can also track one's preferences to show them websites that might interest them. Cookies make more websites free to use without any type of payment. Some of these benefits are also seen as negative.

These ads, which are personalized to one's likes, can often freeze one's computer or cause annoyance. Cookies are mostly harmless except for third-party cookies. These cookies are not made by the website itself, but by web banner advertising companies. These third-party cookies are so dangerous because they take the same information that regular cookies do, such as browsing habits and frequently visited websites, but then they give out this information to other companies.|$|E
25|$|Object {{creation}} {{is a process}} in two phases, creation and insertion. Creation causes the allocation of an empty object and the reservation of any resources required by the object manager, such as an (optional) name in the namespace. If creation was successful, the subsystem responsible for the creation fills in the empty object. Finally, if the subsystem deems the initialization successful, it instructs the object manager to insert the object, which makes it accessible through its (optional) name or <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> called a handle. From then on, the lifetime of the object is handled by the object manager, and it's up to the subsystem to keep the object in a working condition until being signaled by the object manager to dispose of it.|$|E

25|$|A hybrid marker, {{also known}} as a {{referencing}} exit marker or REM, is a more recently developed line marker used as a directional marker by the diver placing it, and seen as <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> by others. They are rectangular with slots like the arrow and cookie forms for attachment to a line, and have a relatively large blank space on one end to add identification on one side and to write on the other side. Referencing exit markers are asymmetrical so can be used to show the direction which the diver came from. They are personal markers, and should not be used by others to judge the suitability of a route as the practicability of an exit may depend {{on the size of the}} diver and the equipment carried.|$|E

[...] She criticized the product placement, writing, [...] "Not only is the pizza delivery guy included {{in more than half}} of the DVD, but the logo is present and the kids are shown munching ecstatically on the pizza at the end of the movie.

500|$|The name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] {{refers to}} its feeding habit of gouging round plugs, as if cut out with <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> cutter, out of larger animals. Marks made by cookiecutter sharks {{have been found}} {{on a wide variety}} of marine mammals and fishes, as well as on submarines, undersea cables, and even human bodies. It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid. Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for {{hovering}} in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey. Its dark collar seems to mimic the silhouette of a small fish, while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores. When a would-be predator approaches the lure, the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw-like set of lower teeth. This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E
500|$|Alf Clausen, who {{has scored}} {{most of the}} Simpsons music, began {{his work on the}} show with this episode.

As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff {{that you want to}} bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and... be creativeâ€”See where your mind and your ideas take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E
500|$|An {{account of}} the {{journeys}} of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions {{of the use of}} the mukhomor there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, Citizen of the World. The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time. Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books The Seven Sisters of Sleep and A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi. This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. A hallucinogenic [...] "scarlet toadstool" [...] from Lappland is featured as a plot element in Charles Kingsley's 1866 novel Hereward the Wake based on the medieval figure of the same name. Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow describes the fungus as a [...] "relative of the poisonous Destroying Angel" [...] and presents a detailed description of a character preparing <b>a</b> <b>cookie</b> bake mixture from harvested Amanita muscaria. Fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner.|$|E
