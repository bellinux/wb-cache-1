5|$|A seizure {{underwater}} {{requires that}} the diver {{be brought to the}} surface <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> Although for many years the recommendation has been not to raise the diver during the seizure itself, owing to the danger of arterial gas embolism (AGE), {{there is some evidence that}} the glottis does not fully obstruct the airway. This has led to the current recommendation by the Diving Committee of the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society that a diver should be raised during the seizure's clonic (convulsive) phase if the regulator is not in the diver's mouth– as the danger of drowning is then greater than that of AGE– but the ascent should be delayed until the end of the clonic phase otherwise. Rescuers ensure that their own safety is not compromised during the convulsive phase. They then ensure that where the victim's air supply is established it is maintained, and carry out a controlled buoyant lift. Lifting an unconscious body is taught by most diver training agencies. Upon reaching the surface, emergency services are always contacted as there is a possibility of further complications requiring medical attention. The U.S. Navy has procedures for completing the decompression stops where a recompression chamber is not immediately available.|$|E
25|$|H.R. 4990, a bill {{to amend}} the Internal Revenue Code to require tax-exempt {{organizations}} to file their returns in electronic form.

25|$|Decompression {{sickness}} must {{be treated}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> Definitive treatment is usually recompression in a recompression chamber with hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Exact details will depend on severity and type of symptoms, response to treatment, and the dive history of the casualty. Administering enriched-oxygen breathing gas or pure oxygen to a decompression sickness stricken diver on the surface is the definitive form of first aid for decompression sickness, although death or permanent disability may still occur.|$|E

25|$|Cases are calendared {{for trial}} <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable</b> (on a first in/first out basis) after the case becomes at issue. When a case is calendared, {{the parties are}} {{notified}} by the Court of the date, time, and place of trial. Trials are conducted before one judge, without a jury, and taxpayers are permitted to represent themselves if they desire. However, {{the vast majority of}} cases are settled by mutual agreement without the necessity of a trial. However, if a trial is conducted, in due course a report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth findings of fact and an opinion. The case is then closed in accordance with the judge's opinion by entry of a decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} the police to arrest is much more {{extensive}} than that for citizens. They have the unqualified power to arrest pursuant to a warrant, and the police officer effecting the arrest is not responsible for any irregularities in the warrant {{as long as he}} is acting pursuant to it. A police officer can execute a warrant notwithstanding the warrant is not in his possession at the time, but the warrant shall, on the demand of the person affected, be shown to him <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable</b> after the arrest. If no warrant is obtained, the police can only effect an arrest pursuant to section 50 of the Police Force Ordinance (Cap.232).|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{to build a}} rivalry and capture francophone {{interest}} in Montreal, O'Brien and Gardner conceived of creating a team consisting of francophone players, to be managed by francophones. 'Les Canadiens', known today as the Montreal Canadiens, was admitted on December 4, 1909 to be managed by Jack Laviolette, but owned by O'Brien, on the understanding ownership was {{to be transferred to}} francophone sportsmen <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> In all, O'Brien and his father, Michael John O'Brien, were financing four teams in the league: the Renfrew Creamery Kings (which became known as the Renfrew Millionaires), Cobalt, Haileybury, and Les Canadiens. The Cobalt and Haileybury clubs were from the Timiskaming Professional Hockey League (TPHL) and Renfrew from the Federal Hockey League (FHL). Along with the Wanderers, the league had five teams.|$|E

If confirmed, an authorisation can only last for up to 14 days. An authorisation can be cancelled at any time, or restricted in respect {{of the time it}} ends or the area which it covers, but it cannot be expanded. New authorisations can be made regardless of whether previous authorisations exist, or have been cancelled or have expired.|$|R

25|$|The French {{ambassador}} to the United States registered {{a complaint with the}} President of the United States that Argonaut, by entering Lynnhaven bay, either before she captured Esperance or shortly thereafter, had violated a treaty between France and the United States. The French also accused the British of having brought Esperance into Lynnhaven for refitting for a cruise. The President passed the complaint to the Secretary of State, who forwarded the complaint to the Governor of Virginia. The Governor inquired into the matter of the British Consul at Virginia. The British Consul replied that the capture had taken place some 10 leagues off shore. The weather had forced Argonaut and her prize to shelter within the Chesapeake for some days, but that they had left <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> Furthermore, Argonaut had paroled her French prisoners when she came into Lynnhaven and if had entered American territorial waters solely to parole her French prisoners no one would have thought that objectionable. The authorities in Virginia took a number of depositions but ultimately nothing further came from the matter.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the evening prison staff have had access at ground level to all wings in the main prison. No bodies have been found. Earlier today prison staff gained access to the main prison {{building}} in order to remove barricades to allow the surrender of inmates who wished to do so. No inmates were injured during this process. Nine prison staff were taken to outside hospital for treatment. Two remain overnight for observation. Negotiations were carried out by prison staff ... 31 inmates surrendered. All of those who surrendered have been interviewed, medically examined and fed. They will be transferred to other accommodation <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following the {{disruption}} {{caused by a}} protestor in the previous year's race, Royal Marines provided support to the security arrangements surrounding the race. Race director David Searle urged nobody to repeat {{the disruption}} of 2012, saying [...] "What I would say to anybody thinking of doing that, is that it's unbelievably dangerous ... We had practised emergency stops and it worked". The manner of any potential restart was modified to allow the race re-commence <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> The Metropolitan Police had made contact with the protestor, Trenton Oldfield, to assist him making a more peaceful protest should he wish to do so, but he declined the offer and {{did not attend the}} race in any capacity.|$|E

500|$|Since Al-Kateb's {{application}} for a visa was rejected, he was classified as an unlawful non-citizen. Section 196 of the Migration Act provides that unlawful non-citizens can only be released from immigration detention if they are granted a visa, deported, or removed from Australia. Section 198(6) of the Act requires immigration officials to [...] "remove [...] <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> reasonably <b>practicable</b> an unlawful non-citizen".|$|R
500|$|After several weeks, Melville {{learned from}} a Russian {{traveler}} that two Americans were recuperating [...] at Bulun. Weather conditions were now suitable for travel, so Melville hired a pair of expert local dog drivers {{to take him to}} Bulun. He left Danenhower [...] in charge, with instructions to lead the party to Bulun <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable,</b> and from there to proceed as best he could to Yakutsk, a large city hundreds of miles to the south. Melville [...] arrived in Bulun on November 3, where he found Nindemann and Noros, weak but recovering. From them, Melville learned of De Long's plight and his urgent need for rescue. The pair had endured a harrowing experience since leaving De Long nearly a month previously. They had struggled for ten days, sleeping in improvised shelters and eating what they could catch or shoot. In this fashion they reached a small, abandoned camp which they later learned was named Bulcour. Here, they had been found by a nomadic band of Yakut hunters, who had taken them [...] to a large camp at Kumakh-Surt. To their great frustration they were unable to make the Yakuts understand that they were shipwrecked mariners whose comrades were in dire straits. They did manage to convey their desire to reach Bulun, and were taken there by sled, arriving on October 29 a few days before Melville joined them there.|$|E
500|$|The {{name change}} of the {{legislation}} reflected Brownlee's growing belief that farmers' financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain. [...] Angry over the federal government's decision to allow the first incarnation of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) to lapse, many Albertan farmers began to advocate the [...] "pooling" [...] of their wheat, which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain speculators by introducing collective marketing, with each farmer receiving an averaged, identical price. Farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were more adamant about {{the return of the}} CWB; Prime Minister King eventually agreed to its re-creation, provided that at least two of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the Board. [...] By June 1923, the provinces had not found anybody suitable. Interest in pooling experienced a resurgence. [...] In July, a UFA meeting, which Brownlee attended as the government's representative, endorsed the creation of a wheat pool <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable.</b> Brownlee and his cabinet colleague Richard Gavin Reid undertook an investigation of how soon this might be, which included a trip to San Francisco to meet with Aaron Sapiro, an American agricultural cooperative leader. Sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks, though both Brownlee and Reid disagreed and returned to Canada committed to caution. [...] However, in their absence the Edmonton Journal and Calgary Herald had invited Sapiro to tour Alberta, and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among UFA members for immediate action, in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 2010 {{changes in}} {{sentencing}} guidelines, there existed a significant disparity {{in how the}} length of sentences for the possession of crack cocaine and powder cocaine. These changes resulted from reports by the federal Sentencing Commission that the crack-to-powder mandatory minimum ratio of 100-to-1 was too high and unjustified. Along with Congress' acceptance of these proposals in the 2010 Act, Congress also directed the federal Sentencing Commission to [...] "promulgate the guidelines, policy statements, or amendments provided for in this Act <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable,</b> and in any event not later than 90 days". However, the Act did not say whether {{it was meant to}} be retroactive in any respect.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 July 2006, {{the latest}} body to {{consider}} the issue of long-term waste management, the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM), published its final report. Its main recommendation was that geological disposal should be adopted. This would involve burial at a depth between 200 – 1000m deep in a purpose-built facility with no intention to retrieve the waste in the future. It was concluded that this could not be implemented for several decades, {{and that there were}} [...] "social and ethical concerns within UK society about the disposal option that would need to be resolved as part of the implementation process". Such a repository should start to be closed <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>practicable</b> rather than being left open for future generations.

[...] Other lines were initially operated with the steam motors once the track had been laid but before the installation of the electrical infrastructure had been completed. [...] Steam motors were also used for shunting, to haul special purpose cars used for maintenance, and to haul special services on particularly busy peak days.|$|E
