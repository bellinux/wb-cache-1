5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side}} of Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E

[...] Modern Records released an edited version in 1952 titled [...] "New Boogie Chillun". [...] After Hooker began {{his association with}} Vee-Jay Records, he recorded [...] "Boogie Chillun" [...] in 1959, which closely follows the original single. [...] Because of the similarity, the 1959 version is sometimes misidentified as the 1948 version and vice versa (at 2:36, the Vee-Jay version is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> minute shorter than the original). The first two takes from the September 1948 Detroit recording session began appearing on various compilation albums in the 1970s, sometimes with the titles [...] "John Lee's Original Boogie" [...] and [...] "Henry's Swing Club".

The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford. Cal's victory broke an 81-game conference winning streak for the Cardinal. Gottlieb led the Bears to a 17-1 conference record, making them Pac-12 Conference co-Champions—the first conference championship in California Women's Basketball history.

2500|$|The first racing {{with the}} {{redesigned}} car was the 2011 Daytona 500 and its supporting races (Budweiser Shootout and Gatorade Duels), all held on brand new pavement for Daytona International Speedway. [...] The Daytona 500 broke long-standing records for leaders and lead changes, as 22 drivers changed the lead 74 times. It {{also saw a}} first time winner, rookie Trevor Bayne, go to victory lane. But {{the story of the}} new car was a phenomenon of lock-bumper superdrafts - two cars would literally lock together and push into a clear lead, with speeds up to 10 MPH faster than with a conventional draft (on numerous occasions 2-car superdrafts topped 206 MPH); this phenomenon had debuted at Talladega Superspeedway in the spring of 2008 when Denny Hamlin discovered he could push Kevin Harvick {{all the way around the}} track during practice, resulting in a lap time <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second faster than the rest of the field. Hamlin used the move multiple times in that race to get the lead, and by the next spring the technique was used by the majority of the field throughout the entire race. The phenomenon also led to a new level of [...] "team" [...] racing reminiscent of the team orders ethos common to Formula One; drivers would communicate with each other over radio to coordinate [...] "swaps" [...] instead of actually fighting for position. This was present in the 2011 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, leading to a three-wide finish with three drafting teams contending for the win: Clint Bowyer (pushed by Kevin Harvick), Jeff Gordon (who was being pushed by Mark Martin, but separated before the finish line), and winner Jimmie Johnson (pushed by Dale Earnhardt, Jr.), who won by two-thousandths of a second over Bowyer. A fourth drafting team, consisting of Roush-Fenway teammates Carl Edwards and Greg Biffle (Biffle was pushing), squeezed in between the Bowyer/Harvick tandem and the wall, but only finishing 6th (Edwards) and 7th (Biffle).|$|E
