5|$|With {{such a huge}} {{margin of}} victory <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> poor performance, England (and Emburey) were {{strongly}} criticised. After being bowled out for just 93 runs, and a personally very unsuccessful match (no wickets as a bowler, and scoring just 1 and 8 runs as a batsman), Emburey was sacked as England captain and dropped from the team.|$|E
5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, Romania also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in Romania). Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside Romania over the following year, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E

5|$|Important rituals {{such as the}} {{dedication}} of major building projects or the enthronement of a new ruler required a human offering. The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized offering, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the Maya death gods. In AD 738, the vassal king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil of Copán {{and a few days}} later he ritually decapitated him; The decapitation of an enemy king may have been performed as part of a ritual ballgame reenacting the victory of the Maya Hero Twins over the gods of the underworld. Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled. The Hero Twins myth recounted in the Popol Vuh relates how one of each pair of twins was decapitated by their ballgame opponents.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to the reasoning. It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> campaign would have necessitated the involvement of heralds to marshal arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E

5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their joints and several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. There {{is reason to believe}} that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli to that of the Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E

5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new Eisenhower administration in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, saber-toothed cats {{have been}} artistically {{restored}} with external features {{similar to those}} of extant felids, by artists such as Charles R. Knight in collaboration with various paleontologists in the early 20th century. In 1969, paleontologist G.J. Miller instead proposed that Smilodon would have looked very different from a typical cat and similar to a bulldog, with a lower lip line (to allow its mouth to open wide without tearing the facial tissues), a more retracted nose and lower-placed ears. Paleoartist Mauricio Antón and coauthors disputed this in 1998 and maintained that the facial features of Smilodon were overall not very different from those of other cats. Antón noted that modern animals like the hippopotamus are able to achieve a wide gap without tearing tissue by the moderate folding of the orbicularis oris muscle, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> muscle configuration exists in modern large felids. Antón stated that extant phylogenetic bracketing (where the features of the closest extant relatives of a fossil taxon are used as reference) is the most reliable way of restoring the life-appearance of prehistoric animals, and the cat-like Smilodon restorations by Knight are therefore still accurate.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, <b>and</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E
