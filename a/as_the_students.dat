5|$|Details of {{the planned}} {{relationship}} were contained in the agreement signed by the Ashland Board of Education and the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees. By this agreement the university would provide a course of study and administration which would be {{comparable to that of}} the university at Lexington and for which the students would receive the same credit <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> in Lexington. The Ashland Board of Education was to provide the buildings, land, equipment and facilities. All other expenses, including teacher salaries were to be paid by the University of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|The second sit-in {{occurred}} on Thursday, February 18, {{when more than}} 200 students entered Woolworths, S. H. Kress, McClellan, and Grants. The lunch counters were immediately closed. The students remained for {{about half an hour}} and then left, again without incident. The third sit-in {{occurred on}} February 20 when about 350 students entered the previous four stores and the downtown Walgreens drugstore. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several of the stores. Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred. The students remained for nearly three hours until adjourning to a mass meeting at the First Baptist Church.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} was founded as a statutory corporation (Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts) {{and was not}} directly subjected to the state, as it was controlled by a supervisory board consisting of six representatives {{of the state of}} Berlin, three representatives of the university and students.

25|$|An {{example of}} LGBT-inclusive {{curriculum}} is {{introduced by the}} National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative.

He had a troubled relationship with Bowen and many others at AMES. At {{the opening of the}} war, the entire AMES establishment was moved from Bawdsey to a pre-arranged location at Dundee. The choice of Dundee was largely due to the University being Watt's alma matter. He had made little effort to prepare the university for use by AMES and the rector was surprised when they arrived one day out of the blue. Almost no room was available <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and professors had returned from summer holidays. The AI team was sent to a small airfield at Perth that was miles away and quite small. Both locations were totally unsuitable for the work and the teams constantly complained.|$|E

At 4:00 am, the lights on the Square abruptly shut, signalling the end of the army's patience.
