40|$|Key words: teaching, vocabulary, English Young Learner, {{grouping}} <b>and</b> organizing strategy <b>Vocabulary</b> {{is considered}} one of the foundations for the students as young learners of English as a foreign language. To be able to learn English well, a learner should master English skills <b>and</b> components. <b>Vocabulary</b> is also taken into account as underlying basic for learning English skills and other English component, namely pronunciation and grammar. Therefore, teaching vocabulary effectively needed to be considered, and one of the ways in teaching vocabulary is using strategy such as grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary.</b> Accordingly, the researcher uses grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary</b> as strategy to teach vocabulary which is intended to improve the student’s vocabulary achievement. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary?</b> 2) How is the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary?</b> 3) Are there any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary?</b> The objectives of this study are: 1) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught before using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary,</b> 2) To know the student’s vocabulary achievement taught after using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary,</b> 3) To know whether there are any significant different scores taught before and after using grouping <b>and</b> organizing <b>vocabulary.</b> The research design of this study is experimental design with quantitative approach.

Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs.

By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar <b>and</b> <b>vocabulary</b> upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
