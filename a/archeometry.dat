40|$|Statistical techniques, {{when applied}} to data {{obtained}} by chemical investigations on ancient artworks, are usually expected to recognize groups of objects to classify the archeological finds, to attribute the provenance of items compared with earlier investigated ones, or to determine whether an archaelogical attribution is possible or not. The statistical technique most frequently used in <b>archeometry</b> is the principal component analysis (PCA), because of its simplicity in theory and implementation. However, the application of PCA to archeometric data showed severe limitations because of its linear feature. Indeed, PCA is inadequate to classify data whose behavior describe a curve or a curved subspace of the original data space. As a consequence of it, an amount of information is lost because the multi-dimensional data space is compressed into a lower-dimensional subspace including principal components. The aim of this work is then to test a novel statistical technique for <b>archeometry.</b> We propose a nonlinear PCA method to extract maximum chemical information by plotting data on the smallest number of principal components and to answer archeological questions. The higher accuracy and effectiveness of nonlinear PCA approach with respect to standard PCA {{for the analysis of}} archeometric data are shown through the study of Apulian red figured pottery (fifth–fourth century BC) coming from some of the most relevant archeological sites of ancient Apulia (Monte Sannace (Gioia del Colle), Egnatia (Fasano), Canosa, Altamura, Conversano, and Arpi(Foggia)).

40|$|Ion beam induced {{luminescence}} (IBIL) {{has been}} exploited {{for the first time}} in the analysis of inorganic painting pigments. The elemental constituents of the different compounds have been determined by particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE). The acquisition time of each spectrum ranges from 100 ms to a few seconds, depending on the luminescence intensity. The luminescence features are fingerprints of the different compounds, thus identifying the provenience of pigments of the same nominal composition. Organic varnish layers do not affect the IBIL features, allowing the identification of pigments, like lapis-lazuli, whose identification with PIXE is hindered by the varnish. IBIL proved to be a technique complementary to PIXE in the <b>archeometry</b> and cultural heritage analysis fields...|$|E
40|$|The {{polycrystalline}} and nanocrystalline states play {{an increasingly}} important role in exploiting the properties of materials, encompassing applications as diverse as pharmaceuticals, catalysts, solar cells and energy storage. A knowledge of the three-dimensional atomic and molecular structure of materials is essential for understanding and controlling their properties, yet traditional single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods lose their power when only polycrystalline and nanocrystalline samples are available. It is here that powder diffraction and single-crystal electron diffraction techniques take over, substantially extending the range of applicability of the crystallographic principles of structure determination.   This volume, a collection of teaching contributions presented at the Crystallographic Course in Erice in 2011, clearly describes the fundamentals and the state-of-the-art of powder diffraction and electron diffraction methods in materials characterisation, encompassing a diverse range of disciplines and materials stretching from <b>archeometry</b> to zeolites.    As such, it is a comprehensive and valuable resource for those wishing to {{gain an understanding of}} the broad applicability of these two rapidly developing fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{progress}} of medicine {{resulted in an}} increased number of metallic implants {{in the human body}}. During radiation diagnostics and therapeutical irradiations arises an unequilibrium of the radiation-caused secondary electrons in the border region due to the different atomic numbers of the tissue and the implant. This results in a dose enhancement in the human tissue at the border dependent on the atomic number of the implant. A tissue equivalent phantom was built to simulate different thicknesses of tissue and cavities existing in the human body and to introduce implants of different materials. Using TLD – 700 powder, we measured the absorbed dose in layers between 6 and 10 µm thickness according to the “Fine Grain Method“, which is well known in <b>archeometry.</b> The dose enhancement at the border region to Al, Cu, Fe, Sn, Ta and Pb compared to the dose without any implant was measured in dependence of the voltage of the incident X – rays (20, 40, 60 and 250 kV). The maximum dose enhancement factor for lead was between 3 and 23 depending on the tube voltage. ...|$|E
40|$|In <b>archeometry,</b> the {{non-destructive}} {{characteristic of}} an analytical method is always very attractive. For most of techniques, besides {{the need of}} sampling, difficulties can originate from the shape {{and the size of}} the silver artifacts to be analyzed. The external PIXE method should be an answer to this problem but several questions are arising from the implementation of the technique to such a material. The aim of this paper is to specify the experimental procedure as to take into account several parameters, which could induce dramatic errors. Among them it can be pointed out the superficial enrichment in silver, arising from the dissolution of copper and copper oxide, the surface roughness effects, the great importance of the stability of the geometric conditions. The accuracy and the precision of the method are considered within the scope of the results obtained in ancient times by the cupellation with ashbone cupels. In addition. the process involved to obtain silver alloys has been studied in order to define its influence on the real fineness of the objects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|To {{preserve}} and restore our cultural heritage {{more and more}} modern technologies have been applied. In Germany {{there are a lot}} of institution dedicating to the development of these technologies. First part of the paper is a listing of some outstanding institutions and their research focuses. In the second part tendences in <b>archeometry</b> and non-destructive testing methods are pointed out. The third part is dedicated to the application of geophysical methods in the field of preservation of monuments and archeology. The most useful methods, geomagnetics, geoelectrics and GPR are outlined. To illustrate the power of geophysical investigation methods some examples, above all the complex prospection at the Terme Stabiane in Pompei are presented. 2. General In Germany the protection of monuments is organized on a regional level. All 12 countries, the two free cities of Hamburg and Bremen and the capital Berlin have their own monument authorities. Number and conditions of the monuments vary from country to country. Especially in the former East Germany there is a lot of unique monuments but in bad conditions. Outstanding examples are the medieval town centres of Görlitz, Quedlinburg and Wismar, the castles and park...|$|E
40|$|Boron {{isotopes}} in teeth {{has been}} a new proxy for dietary reconstructions and its resistance to diagenetic alteration. In this study a method using inductively coupled plasma source mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the measurement of boron isotope ratio in human dental enamel has been developed. Human dental enamel were digested with HNO 3 -H 2 O 2 in a microwave system. Boron in solution was separated from the matrix components using Amberlite IRA- 743 resin. The factors that may affect precision and accuracy in isotope ratio determination by ICP-MS, including memory effects, mass bias drift, and concentration effects, were investigated to obtain optimum conditions. Then, the 10 B/ 11 B ratios in teeth were measured. The results showed that 2 % of HNO 3 + 2 % of NH 3 &# 8226;H 2 O, selected as the diluent/rinse solution could be effective in the elimination of boron memory effect. There was no concentration effect on boron isotope ratios when the ratio of samples B concentration to standard B concentration (refers to Csample/Cstd) varied from 0. 5 to 2. The result of 10 B/ 11 B ratios in tooth enamel by sex and age fluctuated over a broad range, ranged from 0. 2007 to 0. 2574. This method {{is expected to be}} used for boron isotope ratio analyses in <b>archeometry,</b> forensic identification, paleoecology, and other disciplines in the future...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, the Évora Geophysics Centre (CGE) celebrates 20 {{years of}} activity. In these two decades, the {{national}} scientific system underwent a profound transformation, new organizational structures appeared, {{and participation in}} structures and international networks, and scientific integration reached very high levels. The national scientific environment is now more qualified and competitive; however the available funding per researcher became scarcer. Currently the CGE team includes 67 full members, and is organized in two main Lines of Research: (1) Atmosphere and Hydrosphere, (ii) Solid Earth. The first one comprises the centers of activity: Meteorology & Climate, Water, Environment, & Surface Processes, and Energy & Flow Structures, while the latter is composed of the centers of activity: Active Tectonics & Risks, Lithosphere, Mantle & Geological Resources, and Heritage & <b>Archeometry.</b> The time of maturity has come for GCE as a research unit, with a growth trajectory that was not always linear; however it has been progressive with respect to scientific quality, organizational structure, and the scientific and training outputs that were {{made available to the}} community. It is also the time to reflect on the past and to define future strategies. This debate is carried out within the evolving framework in which the CGE develops its activity. Actually, CGE faces new challenges on the times ahead. At the national level new rules of public funding have been announced, which are expected to increase competition for national funding, together with a strong pressure to make networking among the teams {{for the use of the}} available facilities. At the international level, CGE is challenged to collaborate with national and international teams to get access to the new European funding program HORIZON 2020. The workshop “Two Decades of Earth Science Research” was held at the University of Évora, on 23 November 2012, as the closure of the Program of Celebrations, which spanned over the year of 2012. For this workshop we invited national and international key figures as "keynote speakers", and other colleagues, which with us will reflect on the evolution of Earth Sciences, Atmosphere and Hydrosphere, and the national and European science on these two decades. With this initiative we will also make our contribution to the community for the analysis of this framework and define new directions for the scientific activity...|$|E
