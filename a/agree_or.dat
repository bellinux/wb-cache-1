Sometimes the judges cannot <b>agree,</b> <b>or</b> cannot decide, or a crowd vocally {{disagrees with the}} judge's decision. In such cases more passes may be run until a winner is produced. Sometimes {{mechanical}} failure determines the battle's outcome, either during or preceding a heat. If a car cannot enter a tandem battle, the remaining entrant (who automatically advances) will give a solo demonstration pass. In the event of apparently close or tied runs, crowds often demonstrate their desire for another run with chants of 'one more time'.|$|E
25|$|Critics of neo-Lamarckism {{pointed out}} {{that no one had}} ever {{produced}} solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The experimental work of the German biologist August Weismann resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of acquired characteristics was impossible, since the Weismann barrier would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. This effectively polarised the argument between the Darwinians and the neo-Lamarckians, as it forced people to choose whether to <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> disagree with Weismann and hence with evolution by natural selection. Despite Weismann's criticism, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection {{at the end of the}} 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E

Analyses such as this interpret the governmental propositions for Internet users and promote democracy by allowing all the opportunity to <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> disagree with the proposition prior to its ruling. This analysis is posted publicly on the Internet, in compliance with the mission of CDT, and addresses each section of the Data Protection Regulation and the potential pitfalls of each article.

30|$|Of major {{importance}} is the collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> customary weekly working hours of employees. It is the reference point for all working time agreements beyond full-time employment. In 2004, the collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> customary weekly working hours for full-time employees reached {{its lowest level}} with 37.9  h on average, and increased slightly since then. Due to reductions during the financial and economic crisis (cf. Bogedan et al. 2009), however, the collectively <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> customary weekly working hours declined temporarily.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} factor was women’s desire to maintain social networks. About 84 % {{of the respondents}} either strongly <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>agreed</b> that they started business for networking.

About 50 % of the respondents either strongly <b>agreed</b> <b>or</b> <b>agreed</b> that they engaged in entrepreneurship to earn respect in society.

25|$|Under {{this form}} of government, called the Westminster system, the Sovereign is head of state and titular head of Her Majesty's Government. She selects as her Prime Minister {{the person who is}} able to command a working {{majority}} in the House of Commons, and invites him or her to form a government. As the actual Head of Government, the Prime Minister selects his Cabinet, choosing its members from among those in Parliament who <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> generally agree with his intended policies. He then recommends them to the Sovereign who confirms his selections by formally appointing them to their offices. Led by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for whatever the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with members privately about policy, nor attend Cabinet meetings. With respect to actual governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn. In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the Prime Minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him or her regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional logic {{generally}} {{means the}} textbook tradition {{that begins with}} Antoine Arnauld's and Pierre Nicole's Logic, or the Art of Thinking, {{better known as the}} Port-Royal Logic. Published in 1662, it was the most influential work on logic after Aristotle until the nineteenth century. The book presents a loosely Cartesian doctrine (that the proposition is a combining of ideas rather than terms, for example) within a framework that is broadly derived from Aristotelian and medieval term logic. Between 1664 and 1700, there were eight editions, and the book had considerable influence after that. [...] The Port-Royal introduces the concepts of extension and intension. The account of propositions that Locke gives in the Essay is essentially that of the Port-Royal: [...] "Verbal propositions, which are words, [...] the signs of our ideas, put together or separated in affirmative or negative sentences. So that proposition consists in the putting together or separating these signs, according as the things which they stand for <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> disagree." ...|$|E
