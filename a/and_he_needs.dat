5|$|Realizing that Brian {{had never}} gotten over {{the end of}} his {{relationship}} with Jillian, Lauren encourages him to let her know about his still-strong feelings for her. Brian uses Jillian's wedding as this opportunity, interrupting the ceremony to passionately profess his love for her. Jillian, however, tells Brian (gently) that he had his chance and blew it, as she decided to move on <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to as well. Brian is now a miserable, single dog, unable even to go back to Lauren, who has dumped him because he gave her worms.|$|E
5|$|When Tracy {{causes a}} stir {{at a public}} event, Jack assures him that as a movie star, he can do {{anything}} he wants, except for dog fighting. Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> {{to stay away from}} them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.|$|E
5|$|Ezri Dax (Nicole de Boer), the station's counselor, has {{concerns}} with Nog {{living in a}} fictional world and speaks to Fontaine, who explains {{that he has a}} plan to rectify the situation. Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram. Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E

5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to marry an American citizen.

It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. I reckon he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E

Kylie ends up getting hooked on to these drugs as the stress that Max is placing on her pushes her to the edge.

At that time everyone thought that Levrone's career was over. He had two surgeries, the first one lasted 8 hours.

500|$|Jack {{is shown}} {{identifying}} his father's corpse in a morgue, where the coroner (Geoff Heise) tells Jack {{that the death}} was possibly caused by an alcohol-induced heart attack. Jack later argues with Oceanic Airlines ticket agent Chrissy (Meilinda Soerjoko), who says the documentation to board Christian's coffin aboard Flight 815 is incomplete. Jack, frustrated, explains that all the arrangements are set for the funeral once he arrives at LAX, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to bury his father, because he needs it [...] "to be over".|$|E
500|$|Mulder then wakes, unharmed, to {{find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to pay his landlord for water damage. To do so, he is forced {{to go to the}} bank, instead of going to the meeting with his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and various other FBI officials. When he arrives, the same gunman, named Bernard, arrives and nervously attempts to rob the bank, shooting Mulder in the process. [...] The teller sets off the bank's silent alarm and police cars come rushing to the scene. Scully arrives and once again attempts to help her partner as he lies dying, but events go the same way - the police rush the building, Bernard detonates the bomb, and everybody dies.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his {{waterbed}} has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to pay his landlord for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying {{to prevent them from}} entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as she refers to having had Mulder ask her the same question over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they all die.|$|E

500|$|Blaine's cornea {{was deeply}} {{scratched}} {{in the incident}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> surgery. The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it will get better and says it should be better now, and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about {{the composition of the}} damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song [...] "Smooth Criminal". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one. Santana secretly recorded the encounter, and plays her evidence to New Directions, who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium, show them that they [...] "get" [...] Jackson better by performing [...] "Black or White", and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his sophomore}} season, he was {{considered}} more raw, but more athletic than Okafor, according to the Chicago Sun-Times basketball reporter Joe Henricksen. At that stage in head-to-head competition, Alexander was overmatched by Okafor. Following his sophomore season, Reggie Rose (Derrick Rose's brother) noted that Alexander was more suited toward a fast break offense while Okafor {{would be more likely}} to excel in a half-court set. He is also compared to Anthony Bennett, although Alexander needs to improve his outside shooting to make the comparison valid <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to improve his low post mastery for a valid comparison to Jared Sullinger. Alexander feels he is most often compared to Amar'e Stoudemire, which he is comfortable with because he views Stoudemire as someone who [...] "...can shoot the 15-footer, put it on the floor, post moves, sets good screens." [...] NBADraft.net compares Alexander to Thomas Robinson, while Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller compared him to Robinson and Julius Randle, noting despite his phenomenal physicality, he is undersized to play center and lacking the midrange jump shot necessary to play power forward.|$|E

Jamie spends time with her mother, Lorna, while Dylan discusses it with Annie over the phone. His sister informs him that their father will be flying to Newark <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to be picked up at the airport. While at the airport, his father, in a moment of Alzheimer's-induced confusion, incorrectly recognizes a passer-by as a woman from his past. Dylan asks him about the woman. After regaining his lucidity, his father says that she was a woman he met in the Navy and [...] "the love of my life". He also states that he regrets decisions he made in his youth to let her go.

He leaves her with an Angeal clone that seems to be protecting her, and then travels with Sephiroth and Cloud to investigate a Mako reactor near Nibelheim. While checking the reactor, Sephiroth learns from Genesis that he was an experiment, implanted with cells of Jenova before he was born. Genesis explains that his body is degrading, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> Sephiroth's cells to survive, but Sephiroth refuses. Overcome with the recent revelations regarding his past, Sephiroth locks himself in Nibelheim Mansion, and a week later, sets Nibelheim ablaze and goes to the Mako reactor to take Jenova's body. When Zack fails to stop him, Cloud throws him into the Lifestream below the reactor. Zack awakes to find that Shinra has covered-up the Nibelheim incident and he and Cloud have become part of Professor Hojo's experiments on Jenova cells and Mako exposure. However, Zack is able to escape, taking the catatonic Cloud with him. They immediately become high priority targets for Shinra. While fleeing, Zack learns that Genesis and Hollander are still trying to stabilize Genesis' [...] mutation, and they now plan to use Cloud's cells, as he is the only one with Sephiroth's genes.|$|E
