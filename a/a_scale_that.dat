However they are used by other organizations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An example of such scale is the Integrated Kinetic Energy index, which {{measures}} the destructive potential of the storm surge; it works on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> ranges from one to six, with six having the highest destructive potential.|$|E

(If a destination station is full, riders can use the kiosk to get 15 more free minutes to return the bike to another location.) Longer trips incur fees for each additional half-hour on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> rises from $1.50 to $8.00. These prices are designed to encourage short trips {{from place to place}} instead of longer leisure rides.|$|E

Fusion power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, {{commonly referred to as}} the Pauling scale (χr), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 (hydrogen= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in Pauling units.|$|E

25|$|The murder {{campaign}} {{became so}} brazen {{in parts of}} rural East Java, that Moslem bands placed the heads of victims on poles and paraded them through villages. The killings have been on such <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> the disposal of the corpses has created a serious sanitation problem in East Java and Northern Sumatra where the humid air bears the reek of decaying flesh.

25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} and devastation was unprecedented: treasures, art collections, scrolls from the imperial library and human lives were lost on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese {{had never seen}} before. Due to the heavy damage to the country's economy and military, {{and the loss of}} talented manpower, the Southern Song dynasty did not recover the lost territories, despite constant fighting between the Song and Jin, the territory was ruled by non-Han Chinese emperors. It would take another 200 years, until the Ming dynasty, to claim back all the territories that the Song dynasty lost.|$|E
25|$|The 99th as a whole, outnumbered five to one, inflicted {{casualties}} at a {{ratio of}} eighteen to one. They devastated the attacking Volksgrenadier formations. The 99th lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot. German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included deaths on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> routed the attacking infantry, and included the destruction of many tanks and assault guns. This performance prevented the Sixth Panzer Army from outflanking Elsenborn Ridge, and resulted in many commendations and unit citations for the 99th.|$|E

25|$|Wind power {{offers a}} {{reliability}} benefit in that its generation (though not its transmission) is highly decentralized. Sabotage and industrial accidents can be potential {{threats to the}} large, centrally located, power plants that provide most of Texas’ electricity. Should one of these plants be damaged, repairs could {{take more than a}} year, possibly creating power shortages on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> Texans have never experienced before. Coal trains and gas pipelines are also vulnerable to disruption. However, wind power plants are quickly installed and repaired. The modular structure of a wind farm also means that if one turbine is damaged, the overall output of the plant is not significantly affected.|$|E

About 100,000 people were affected by this change, half of whom were receiving Supplementary Benefit under the social security scheme. The Act also made improvements to the Widow's Pension scheme by introducing <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> started at 30 shillings a week for women widowed at the age of 40 and rose to the full rate of £5 at the age of 50.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} Badri began {{investing}} {{much of the}} vast wealth that he had accumulated in Russia into his native country. He had become personally wealthier than the entire state budget and so was able to invest in business ventures and charitable projects in <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> had been previously unimaginable to the impoverished country. He bought the Tbilisi city football team, Dinamo Tbilisi, the Kulevi oil terminal and financed a new shopping centre in the capital and a holiday resort on the Black Sea. He also became {{the head of the}} federation of Georgian businessmen and head of the Georgian National Olympic Committee, subsidized social programs and cultural activities, and on two occasions paid debts for the gas and electricity consumed by Tbilisi residents. He funded several charity projects including schools, amusement parks - even a monastery. In return for these paternal gifts, the then president Eduard Shevardnadze agreed to allow Badri the state's protection from charges against him in Russia.|$|E

25|$|Egg {{collecting}} {{for food}} {{on a massive}} scale was frequent in the past but is now outlawed. It is to be noted that the sooty terns for example could sustain occasional collection of effectively all of a season's eggs (over 10 million), if given sufficient time to recover and if cats are absent. Even egg collecting on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> significantly decreases costly food imports thus in theory could be possible, but not until the cat and rat populations have been brought under control. Poaching remains a concern; with the population rising and spreading out on Kiritimati, formerly remote bird colonies became more accessible and especially the red-tailed tropicbirds and the Sula are strongly affected by hunting and disturbance. Tropicbirds are mainly poached for their feathers which are used in local arts and handicraft; it would certainly be possible to obtain them from living birds as it was routinely done {{at the height of the}} Polynesian civilization.|$|E
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, {{too full of}} flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and written on <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) {{was brought in to}} for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such <b>a</b> <b>scale</b> <b>that</b> it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E
