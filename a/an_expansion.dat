40|$|We analyze {{inclusive}} τ decay using {{a modified}} version of the <b>a</b> <b>expansion,</b> <b>a</b> non-perturbative technique in which the effective coupling is analytic in the infrared region. The modification involves renormalization group improvement of the integrand in a spectral representation for the D-function prior to implementing the <b>a</b> <b>expansion.</b> The advantage of this approach is that it enables us to monitor the structure of the induced power corrections and to ensure that these are consistent with the operator product expansion. Numerically the method agrees well with experiment: the comparison is made with the physical quantity R_Z using R_τ as input. Comment: 9 pages, LaTeX, 1 postscript figur...|$|R
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to <b>an</b> <b>expansion</b> of commercial and agrarian resources, and to <b>an</b> <b>expansion</b> of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E

40|$|The 'tanh-coth {{expansion}} method' {{for finding}} solitary travelling-wave solutions to nonlinear evolution equations {{has been used}} extensively in the literature. It is a natural extension to the basic tanh-function expansion method which {{was developed in the}} 1990 s. It usually delivers three types of solution, namely <b>a</b> tanh-function <b>expansion,</b> <b>a</b> coth-function <b>expansion,</b> and <b>a</b> tanh-coth <b>expansion.</b> It is known that, for every tanh-function expansion solution, there is <b>a</b> corresponding coth-function <b>expansion</b> solution. It is shown that there is <b>a</b> tanh-coth <b>expansion</b> solution that is merely a disguised version of the coth solution. In many papers, such tanh-coth solutions are erroneously claimed to be 'new'. However, other tanh-coth solutions may be delivered that are genuinely new {{in the sense that they}} would not be delivered via the basic tanh-function method. Similar remarks apply to tan, cot and tan-cot expansion solutions...|$|R
