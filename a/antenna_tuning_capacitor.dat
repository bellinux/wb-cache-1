40|$|Unfortunately, {{there are}} two obvious difficulties. Firstly, since δω << ω the phase shift is very small – a second-order effect. Secondly, the phase will be {{distorted}} considerably {{by the use of}} a tuned antenna; {{not only because of the}} tuning itself, but also due to the temperature-dependent properties of the <b>antenna’s</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The very small phase shift is not, in itself, an insurmountable problem because phase is maintained during demodulation, effectively expanding it in time. However, because of these difficulties I also investigated the possibility of measuring the relative amplitude of the sidebands. Whereas the phase measurement involves a second-order term, the amplitude measurement is a first-order expression – it is larger in magnitude and does not depend on dispersion. It could therefore be conjectured that, in a practical system, it could be responsive to different geological conditions. In fact, it is known with existing techniques that certain anomalies cause phase discrepancies whereas others caus...|$|R
40|$|Printed {{electronics}} promise {{various kinds}} of sensor circuit labels, for applications in distributed sensing and monitoring, which can be manufactured using traditional printing tools at very low cost. Elevated humidity levels or water leakages cause tremendous costs in our society, such as in construction industries and in transportations. Distributed monitoring and remote sensing of the humidity level inside walls of buildings and packages is therefore desired and urgently needed. Here, we report a wireless humidity sensor label that is manufactured using screen-printing and dry-phase patterning. The sensor label includes a planar <b>antenna,</b> a <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor</b> and a printed sensor-capacitor head. Through electromagnetic coupling between a reader and the printed sensor label, changes in humidity level were remotely detected and read-out as a shift of the resonant frequency. The manufacturing process of the humidity sensor label is fully compatible with inexpensive, reel-to-reel processing technologies, thus enabling low cost production.

40|$|Abstract—Fully-passive {{wireless}} and disposable body-sensors {{are promising}} for unobtrusive monitoring of phys-iological signals at natural settings. We present {{a new type}} of wireless analog passive sensor (WAPS) based on resistive damping, which can be used for biopotential sensing. The resistive WAPS operates by modulating the amplitudes of the incident RF signal, and composes of a loop <b>antenna,</b> a <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and a MOSFET (an additional biasing resistance is used in one variation). The scanner transmits carrier RF signal at 13. 34 MHz and the load modulated signal is captured with the signal analyzer. The envelope of the modulated signal correlates with the biopotential being sensed. Both enhancement and depletion MOSFETs are demonstrated, where the earlier demonstrated superior performance. The sensitivity can be as low as 10 mV, suitable for ECG and EMG physiological signal capture. The transmission power were 0 dBm while the co-axial separation between antennas were 21. 5 mm. The results show that the proposed WAPS can be used to develop disposable biopotential sensor suitable for body-worn physiological signal monitoring system. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Fully-passive {{wireless}} body-sensors pose viable {{solutions for}} unobtrusive monitoring of physiological signals at natural settings. While fully-passive capacitive analog passive wireless sensors has been reported, we present an alternative solution with resistive based transducers. The passive sensor {{is composed of}} a loop <b>antenna,</b> a <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and a resistive transducer suitable {{for the type of}} physiological signals to be measured. The scanner transmits carrier RF signal at 13. 75 MHz whose amplitude is modulated based on the resistive loading by the transducer. The load modulation is captured with the signal analyzer. The system was characterized for various resistive loads of 1. 2 Ω to 82 KΩ and open at 5, 10, 20, and 40 mm co-axial distances between the transmitter and the receiver antennas. We demonstrate the practicality of the system by measuring several physiological signals like heart rate, temperature, and pulse oximetry. The wireless power used for remote sensing is very low (− 20 dBm, except pulse oximetry requires 0 dBm). The results show the potential of developing a new set of body-worn fully-passive sensors for physiological signal monitoring. I...|$|R

40|$|Mutual {{coupling}} is {{an important}} issue in RF coil array design for MRI. In this study, the dependence of mutual coupling behavior among RF coil array elements on the <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor</b> placement is specially investigated at different field strengths. For phased arrays with different <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor</b> configurations, the degree of mutual coupling is estimated by measuring parameters S 11 and S 12 using Advanced Design System (ADS) simulation and bench measurements. The simulation agrees well with experiment results and shows that the mutual coupling behavior of different configurations varies notably with the resonant frequency. Specifically, at frequencies lower than 64 MHz, the placement of one or two concentrated capacitors suffers less mutual coupling than that of four evenly distributed capacitors around the coil loop; whereas at frequencies higher than 128 MHz, the opposite is observed. This interesting phenomenon provides guidance on minimizing the mutual coupling for coil array design. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
