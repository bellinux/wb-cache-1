The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E

5|$|Blokumannaland is <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> {{mentioned}} in Snorri Sturluson's Heimskringla ("The Circle of the World") from the 13th century. The book narrates how the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, {{referred to by}} the name Kirjalax, invaded Blokumannaland where he fought against pagan tribes. Since these pagans have not been identified, there is disagreement as to the actual date of the Byzantine invasion. For instance, Spinei identifies the events prescribed in the Heimskringla with the Battle of Levounion of 1091 AD, which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Pechenegs by the Byzantines. He argues that Blokumannaland refers to <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> inhabited by Vlachs south of the Lower Danube. On the other hand, Sandaaker proposes that the battle took place in 1040 AD, while the latest date of 1122 AD was proposed by Ellis Davidson and Blöndal. Alexandru Madgearu says that Sturluson anachronistically mentioned the lands south of the Danube as Blokummanaland, because the latter term referred to the Second Bulgarian Empire in Sturluson's time. In the modern Icelandic language, the term Blokumannaland may refer to either Wallachia or Africa.|$|E

5|$|Larger rodents tend to live {{in family}} units where parents and their {{offspring}} live together until the young disperse. Beavers live in extended family units typically {{with a pair of}} adults, this year's kits, the previous year's offspring, and sometimes older young. Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending <b>a</b> <b>territory</b> around the burrow. At high population densities, this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges. Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse. The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond. Outside the breeding season, prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies. A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated, after which time he defends <b>a</b> <b>territory,</b> a female, and a nest against other males. The pair huddles together, grooms one another, and shares nesting and pup-raising responsibilities.|$|E
