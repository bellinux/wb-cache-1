500|$|The club {{returned}} to Serie A after gaining promotion in the 1999–2000 season, though after a closely contested relegation battle, they were relegated immediately {{back down the}} following season. They failed to gain promotion following this and slipped further down. The failed 2001–02 Serie B campaign was costly, the cost of production was €70,895,838, just about €10million fewer than in 2000–01 Serie A, heavily due to the high amortisation of the player asset (€33,437,075). However, value of production was just €21,183736 (excluding player profit) and the net loss was €28,856,093 that season. Net asset on 30 June 2002 was €2,166,997, already including about €20million recapitalisation. The club once quoted the law [...] "21 February 2003 No.27" [...] to lower the amortisation expense by extending the amortisation period beyond the contract length of players to 10-year (UEFA ruled the Italian special law was not lawful and all club should use IFRS standards, thus causing a re-capitalization crisis in 2006), which some players contract (with a total residual <b>accounting</b> <b>value</b> of €46,601,225) was amortise in special way for €4,660,123 only and the rest for €1,659,088 in 2002–03, however the cost of production was still exceed the value of production for €19,071,218 in 2002–03. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt with debts estimated up to €70million. To secure football in the city, film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis refounded the club under the name Napoli Soccer, as they {{were not allowed to}} use their old name. FIGC placed Napoli in Serie C1, where they missed out on promotion after losing 2–1 in play-offs to local rivals Avellino in 2004–05 Serie C1.|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation creates, validates {{and uses a}} quantification of country-level <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> based on Gray’s (1988) framework. This dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay reports the theoretical foundation and method for the quantification of the <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> The quantification results in reported scores for each of Gray’s (1988) four accounting values—Professionalism versus Statutory Control, Uniformity versus Flexibility, Conservatism versus Optimism, and Secrecy versus Transparency. <b>Accounting</b> <b>values</b> scores are reported for 58 countries. The second essay reports the method and results of validation testing preformed on the <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> scores. The primary validation method, Multi-Trait Multi-Method Analysis, failed to provide empirical validation to the <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> scores. A secondary validation method, an ad-hoc research study replication, provided limited empirical validation to the <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> scores. The third essay uses the <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> scores as a primary variable in the explanation of differing levels of a country’s adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards. The essay reports empirical evidence {{of the effect of}} <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> on a country’s level of adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards; however, this effect seems to be disappearing as more countries adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards. ...|$|R
40|$|Research {{revealed}} that inconsistent accounting practices are often attributable to environmental factors of which cultural differences {{appear to be}} the most significant. Prior research considered cultural dimensions in classifying and evaluating cultural differences, which has also been extended into <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> This enabled researchers to consider and identify relevant <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> pertaining to specific accounting scenarios and environments. Recent research considered <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> pertaining to the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards. The purpose of the study is to identify the relevant <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> when a global set of accounting standards is implemented by the SME sector.

5000|$|Paper {{wealth is}} {{fundamentally}} an accounting matter - one's net worth is the <b>accounting</b> <b>value</b> of one's assets minus the <b>accounting</b> <b>value</b> of one's liabilities. There are various accounting methods for different assets and liabilities, and they yield different notions of net worth; some methods {{are more or}} less volatile than others. For example, one may value ("hold", [...] "mark") assets at book value, meaning the price for which they were purchased; in this case paper wealth does not change when the potential sale price of an asset changes, but does change if the asset is sold, as the asset is replaced by the sale proceeds. Conversely, one may mark assets at market value (mark to market accounting), in which case paper wealth changes as the market varies.|$|E

40|$|This study {{concentrated}} {{on the issues of}} financial accounting disclosure behaviour from a cultural perspective. The main objective was to find out whether held national cultural values do have an impact on disclosure behaviour. To get a justified answer, two sub-questions were made. Firstly, is there a match between <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> and societal values, which are assumed to reflect national culture? Secondly, how these possible culture specific <b>accounting</b> <b>values</b> are presented in financial accounting disclosures? The impact of culture is acknowledged in most international accounting studies. Its role in it has been the question mark, whether it has a direct or indirect effect on accounting. In 1960 s - 1980 s a Dutchman Geert Hofstede carried out a cross-cultural study about differences in national culture. He collected and analysed data from 72 countries from over 110, 000 individuals to reveal structural elements of culture and especially those, which were strongly affecting known behaviour in work situations. Based on his results he formed five dimensions to explain differences in cultural behaviour. His study is known as 5 D-model. In the study I used two example countries, Australia and Singapore, and two multinational companies from both countries. I had one airline and one telecom company from both countries. Based on Hofstede’s 5 D-model, I formed assumptions about country specific accounting systems and <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> I compared them to countries’ current accounting systems and corporate governance, which I assumed to reflect held <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> Based on results, I further studied companies’ disclosures to find out whether received results were present in their written information. I found out that the culture specific values were visible despite strong industry specific values in disclosed information. A combining element was the corporate governance, which actually reflected both legal requirements and held cultural values. I concluded that cultural values indirectly affect country specific accounting systems. More importantly, cultural values seemed to affect directly both management and <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> That is, cultural values do have an impact on financial accounting disclosure behaviour.

50|$|As the tax value, or tax base, {{is lower}} than the <b>accounting</b> <b>value,</b> or book value, in years 1 and 2, the company should {{recognize}} a deferred tax liability.

30|$|The {{case of the}} Polish {{labour market}} {{analysed}} in this paper gives additional future research possibility. The pension system introduced in 1999 has not only recently started to register individual <b>account</b> <b>values</b> but also started to transform the <b>account</b> <b>values</b> into benefits, which takes into account individual age of retirement. This means workers not only know but directly feel: the later the retirement the higher the benefit. The increase in benefits with postponed retirement is actuarial. Consequently, a new relatively strong factor enters the model. We see the need to extend the analysis in order to directly account {{for the impact of}} old-age benefits on workers’ intentions and preferences concerning labour market participation.|$|R

The effect of the substitutability between goods in utility is studied by postulating, in turn, neoclassical diminishing marginal substitutability, perfect substitutability and perfect complementarity. The degree of substitutability has strong effects on the maximin solution, affecting the regularity or non-regularity of the program, and on the <b>accounting</b> <b>values.</b> This has important consequences for the computation of genuine savings and the sustainability prospects of future generations...|$|R

This paper intends to clarify some of the underlying arguments by presenting a brief overview of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting,</b> and the main advantages and disadvantages of using fair value regime.

The two main arguments against fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting</b> – exacerbated procyclicality and increased volatility of the financial statements – are amply counterbalanced by arguments in favour of fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting.</b> The latter includes the significance of limitations associated with historical cost accounting, increased relevance of information presented to investors and lower expected likelihood of earnings management under fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting.</b> fair <b>value</b> <b>accounting,</b> accounting, accounting standards...|$|R
