5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations.

Furthermore, this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thought.|$|E
5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} of representing the electorate again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement.

On 7 January 1860, Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times, inviting electors to {{a meeting at the}} Mechanics' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday, 13 January.|$|E

5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions were carefully modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E

Initially, Brabham and Tauranac each held 50percent of the shares. Tauranac was responsible for design and running the business, while Brabham was the test driver and arranged corporate deals like the Repco engine supply {{and the use of}} the MIRA wind tunnel. He also contributed ideas to the design process and often machined parts and helped build the cars.|$|E
5|$|By law, a valid unexpired Lebanese {{passport}} or Identity card (Arabic: بطاقة الهوية (transl. Bitakat Al Hawiya); French: Carte D'identité) is conclusive (<b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> prima facie) {{proof of}} Lebanese citizenship, {{and has the}} same force and effect as proof of Lebanese citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship, if issued to a Lebanese citizen for the full period allowed by law. The Lebanese law does not prohibit Lebanese citizens from holding passports of other countries, though {{they are required to}} use their Lebanese passport to enter and leave the country. An expired Lebanese passport can still be used to return to the Republic of Lebanon at any port and port personnel are obliged by law to allow the passage of the bearer without any delay or hindrance. Lebanese passports are property of the Republic of Lebanon and must be returned to the Lebanese Government upon demand.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> in response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed {{the last part of}} his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|In 1729 {{there was}} an attempt to found a school of {{painting}} in Edinburgh as the Academy of St. Luke, named after the Renaissance Accademia di San Luca in Rome. Its sponsors were the elder Norie, the poet Allan Ramsay and William Adam. Its president was George Marshall, a painter of still lives and portraits, and its treasurer was the engraver Richard Cooper. Other members included Cooper's student Robert Strange, the two younger Nories, the portrait painters John Alexander (c. 1690-c. 1733) and Allan Ramsay, son of the poet (1713–84). The success of the group was limited by its associations with Jacobitism, with Strange printing bank notes for the rebels. The Foulis Academy was founded in Glasgow in 1754 by the printmaking brothers Robert and Andrew Foulis, and in Edinburgh the Board of Trustees for Fisheries, Manufactures and Improvements in Scotland established the Trustees Drawing Academy in 1760, indicating that art was now part of civic life <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> aristocratic patronage.|$|E
5|$|Modern Syria {{was first}} {{established}} in 1920 as the Arab Kingdom of Syria under King Faisal. This state was {{planned to be}} a new Arab kingdom, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> Syrian, and the state espoused Arab nationalism and pan-Islamic policies. However the British, who had helped establish the state after World War I, made a secret agreement with France and established the French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon. The area thereby functioned as one of France's colonies, and the newly established state was viewed unfavorably by most Syrians, with many of them regarding it as a vessel of European imperialism. At this stage, some movements tried to establish a Syrian identity, most notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party, or became advocates of communism and Islamism. The majority of Syrians continued to see themselves as Arabs rather than Syrians.|$|E

He was thought to be dead after that but writers help bring him back from the 1990s and he returned to plague Spider-Man once more in the comic books (such as being involved of the killing of Aunt May) and other heroes (such as the Avengers). He is also an enemy of Spider-Man sometimes just as himself <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> only as his Goblin persona.|$|E

5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E
5|$|The edition {{published}} by Faulkner includes over 500 corrections {{to the original}} text, surpassing any other editions. Faulkner's version also contains over 50 passages that either not present in the original or expanded on from the original text. This has suggested to some critics that the Faulkner edition was a later rework of Gulliver's Travels <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> a correction to printing related mistakes. The inclusion of these many additions was later seen by critics as part of Swift's disapproval of Motte's versions, but others see Motte's version as being more true to the anti-government spirit of Swift's work, which confuses Swift's motivation in allowing Faulkner to reprint the work.|$|E
5|$|What this {{effectively}} did was {{shift the}} bombing campaign southwestward to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The interdiction {{campaign against the}} enemy logistics corridor was massively expanded due to the increased number of U.S. aircraft (approximately 500 planes) made available by the closure of Rolling Thunder. By November 1968 bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed by 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November. By {{the end of the}} conflict, U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft would drop over three million tons of ordnance on Laos, three times the total tonnage dropped on North Vietnam. The new campaign against the trail was unprecedented, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> due to the numbers sorties flown or munitions expended. The U.S. was going to field its latest technology in its attempt to prevent the North Vietnamese from toppling the South Vietnamese government.|$|E
