5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how accurately the iconography of classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E

5|$|A Vision for Frome 2008–2028 {{has been}} {{developed}} following a consultation with local people {{in the spring of}} 2008 which received over 3,000 responses. Mendip District Council and Mendip Strategic Partnership have consulted on a Community Strategy and Local Development Framework for the period to 2026 which includes building 2,500–2,600 new homes, providing more employment and office space, developing a new secondary school and two new primary schools, remodelling the town centre and encouraging <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> retailers and leisure providers into the town.|$|E

5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are {{extremely}} rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate {{at the end of}} Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> habitats.|$|E
5|$|Experiments into behavior, to {{understand}} how organisms detect and {{interact with each other}} and their environment, in which fruit flies, worms, mice, and rats are all widely used. Studies of brain function, such as memory and social behavior, often use rats and birds. For some species, behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> activities.|$|E

5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. He felt the Chase Promenade might have served as a better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> pieces.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{is almost}} never {{fermented}} or aged in new oak (although large old oak barrels {{are often used}} to store and stabilize Riesling based wines in Germany and Alsace). This means that Riesling tends to be lighter weight and therefore suitable to <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> foods. The sharp acidity/sweetness in Rieslings {{can serve as a}} good balance to foods that have a high salt content. In Germany, cabbage is sometimes cooked with riesling to reduce the vegetable's smell.|$|E
5|$|Social rodents have <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> vocalizations than do solitary species. Fifteen {{different}} call-types {{have been}} recognized in adult Kataba mole rats and four in juveniles. Similarly, the common degu, another social, burrowing rodent, exhibits {{a wide array of}} communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound. Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other.|$|E

5|$|The {{black stork}} has <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> calls {{than the white}} stork, its main call being a chee leee, which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce {{a long series of}} wheezy raptor-like {{squealing}} calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.|$|E

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but that investigation of <b>a</b> <b>wider</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E
