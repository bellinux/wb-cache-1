5|$|Her {{story is}} <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{universal}} denigration of a group, {{based on the}} behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven {{by the light of}} knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also liked the fact that the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E

25|$|The first {{narrative}} section begins. John baptizes Jesus, and the Holy Spirit descends upon him. Jesus prays and meditates in {{the wilderness}} for forty days, and is tempted by Satan. His early ministry by word and deed in Galilee meets with much success, and leads to the Sermon on the Mount, {{the first of the}} discourses. The sermon presents the ethics of the kingdom of God, introduced by the Beatitudes ("Blessed are..."). It concludes with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> response to the kingdom will have eternal consequences, and the crowd's amazed response leads into the next narrative block.|$|E
25|$|Royal Holloway's {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of the Royal Holloway shield and its surrounding elements. There are three crescents shown on the coat of arms, which are taken from Thomas Holloway's own coat of arms. Taken from the Bedford coat of arms, the field is coloured black and gold in a chequered design, {{with the addition of}} ermine spots (feather-like symbols representing ermine tails) from the Royal Holloway coat. Placed between two black lozenges, there is a lamp of learning. Traditionally, the lozenge is worn on the arm of unmarried women or widows, which places significance on the coat of arms' lozenges as it acts as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> colleges were founded for women. Below, the motto is displayed which is taken from the arms of Bedford College, and reads esse quam videri.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted {{unanimously}} to erect a memorial for the ‘comfort women’ of World War II. The memorial itself would stand as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> event did in fact happen, despite repeated denials by the Japanese government, {{and it would be}} a reminder never to let another atrocity like it happen again. However some Japanese members of the community showed concerns over the memorial, believing that it would promote hatred and anti-Japanese sentiment throughout the community. One of these critics was Toru Hashimoto, the mayor of Osaka, a large city in Japan. Hashimoto claims in his letter written to the Board of Supervisors that the memorial should be “broadened to memorialize all the women who have been sexually assaulted and abused by soldiers of countries in the world”. Japanese residents of the area have also shown concerns over the memorial as many believe that it projects hatred towards the Japanese and focuses solely on an event in committed by the Japanese during wartime instead of promoting awareness and future prevention.|$|E
500|$|All {{that exists}} in the scene is a {{procession}} of individuals, and the narrator conjectures on the rest. The altar and town exist as part of a world outside art, and the poem challenges the limitations of art through describing their possible existence. The questions are unanswered because there is no one who can ever know the true answers, as the locations are not real. The final stanza begins with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> urn is a piece of eternal artwork: ...|$|E

500|$|Crossland's {{delivery}} was {{the cause}} for much discussion throughout his most successful year of 1882, but despite a commonly held view that he threw the ball, umpires never called a no ball against him for throwing in first-class matches. His bowling action during the match against Surrey at the Oval {{was the subject of}} significant complaints from the crowd, who accused him of throwing. During his bowling spell, he was heckled by the crowd, with shouts of [...] "well-thrown" [...] and [...] "take him off", and he was later surrounded by Surrey supporters {{when he returned to the}} changing rooms. The Times addressed the issue in their match report, with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> umpires are the [...] "judges of fair or unfair play", while the gossip columnist in [...] suggested that it was [...] "very obvious and frequent infringement of the laws defining bowling", and that it was clear that umpires lacked the expertise and the bravery to no ball a bowler.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> show should be enjoyed for what it was. Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E

An editorial in The Nation also mentioned that [...] "the narrative will soon turn towards blaming the 'foreign hand' that feed terrorists in Pakistan, {{it must be remembered}} that many of our terrorist groups are entities that are very much based in Pakistan". The editorial in Dawn also echoed that [...] "the country's civil and military leaderships will unite to condemn the attacks and bemoan them as an attempt to sabotage CPEC by outside forces. While there may be some truth to those allegations, the twin attacks in Mastung and Gwadar almost certainly have very local roots".|$|E

The Headmaster and the senior staff now have their offices, appropriately enough, in the Abbot's house, rather grandly refashioned, like the Abbey itself, in the 15th century; the library was, perhaps, the Abbot's [...] "Guest Hall" [...] (13th–15th century); the Chapel occupies another monastic refectory (12th–15th century, but much rebuilt and extended in the 19th century). Go just beyond the Headmaster’s block and face the Abbey and you can see quite clearly on the walls to your right the outlines of the monastic cloister with its curious first floor Abbot’s Chapel; the conduit, where the monks wash, was removed by the Victorians and rebuilt outside Bow House.|$|E
2500|$|David Gates {{responded in}} Newsweek by {{reminding}} readers that a romantic vision of Lennon {{is just as}} much of a myth as Goldman's portrayal. Editor Jann Wenner is quoted as saying that the book [...] "offended him at every level", suggesting that he as a personal friend of the Lennons had good reason to want to preserve an idealistic version of Lennon's life. However, by stating a number of easily researched facts, the article also exposes a number of Goldman's inaccuracies and concludes with <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best way to know Lennon is through his recordings. [...] Gates noted in the article that Goldman presents no evidence for his claim that Lennon patronized male prostitutes in Thailand or that Lennon killed a sailor in Hamburg, and only secondhand hearsay for the tale of Lennon blaming himself for Stuart Sutcliffe's death.|$|E
2500|$|The gallows were {{an icon of}} the 17th and 18th {{century and}} could be readily found {{throughout}} the Atlantic world. The gallows were particular visible in port cities that routinely featured an execution dock such as [...] "Hope Point" [...] the famous execution dock on the river Thames in Wapping, England. For many pirates {{this would be the}} place that their career was put to an end. For some, however, their body would serve one more function, as a reminder. Hundreds of pirates were hanged and their bodies left to dangle in port cities around the world as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maritime state would not tolerate a challenge from below. Examples of this barbarous practice can be seen throughout pirate history, including those of William Fly, whose body was hung in chains at the entrance of Boston Harbor to rot, and Calico Jack, whose body was hung {{at the mouth of the}} harbor of Port Royal, Jamaica.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for Variety, Robert Koehler commented {{the film}} [...] "may {{not match the}} groovy {{business}} {{of many of the}} studio's other kidpix, but it will be remembered as the film that established a new attitude in the halls of Disney's animation unit". Roger Ebert, writing his review for Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film 3 (out of 4) stars distinguishing the film as [...] "a goofy slapstick cartoon, with the attention span of Donald Duck" [...] that is separate from what's known as animated features. Ebert would later add that [...] "it doesn't have the technical polish of a film like Tarzan, but is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classic cartoon look is a beloved style of its own." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Lisa Schwarzbaum graded the film a B+, describing it as a [...] "hip, funny, mostly nonmusical, decidedly non-epic family picture, which turns out to be less of a hero's journey than a meeting of sitcom minds".|$|E
2500|$|The Recommendation clause {{imposes a}} duty, but its {{performance}} rests solely with the President. Congress possesses {{no power to}} compel the President to recommend, as he alone is the [...] "judge" [...] of what is [...] "necessary and expedient." [...] Unlike the Necessary and Proper Clause of Article I, which limits Congress's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers, the phrase [...] "necessary and expedient" [...] implies {{a wider range of}} discretion for the President. Because this is a political question, there has been little judicial involvement with the President's actions under the clause as long as Presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers. In Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), the Supreme Court noted that the Recommendations Clause serves as <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President cannot make law by himself: [...] "The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President, serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the Congress to legislate." [...] The Court made a similar point in striking down the line-item veto in Clinton v. City of New York (1998). When President Bill Clinton attempted to shield the records of the President's Task Force on Health Care Reform as essential to his functions under the Recommendations Clause, a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in Ass'n of American Physicians & Surgeons v. Clinton (1993): [...] "he Recommendation Clause is less an obligation than a right. The President has the undisputed authority to recommend legislation, but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or, for that matter, any subject." ...|$|E

50|$|Tara's {{relatively}} easy acceptance of Buffy's relationship with Spike is <b>a</b> <b>reminder</b> <b>that,</b> unlike <b>the</b> other Scoobies, Tara met Spike {{only after the}} Initiative had rendered him harmless to humans, and her interactions with him have mostly ranged from neutral to positive.
