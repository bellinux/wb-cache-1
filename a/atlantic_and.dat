5|$|Barham had seriously miscalculated the {{strength}} of the Brest fleet, which had been uninvolved in the campaign of 1805 and was therefore at full strength. He also underestimated Napoleon, who had observed that Villeneuve's brief stay in the Caribbean had acted as a major threat to British trade, delaying convoys and causing panic among the West Indian merchants. The French naval authorities were also inspired by the effect of a raiding squadron under Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand, which had escaped from Rochefort on 17 July 1805, caused significant disruption to British trade in the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>and</b> remained at sea off the North African coast. Seeking to repeat these effects, Napoleon sent orders to the commander at Brest, Vice Admiral Honoré Ganteaume, in November 1805 for two strong squadrons to be prepared for service in the Atlantic. These were to leave Brest under cover of darkness on 13 December, with orders to strike deep into the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>and</b> intercept any merchant convoys that they encountered. Subsequently, the squadrons were to separate, one to the South <b>Atlantic</b> <b>and</b> the other to the Caribbean, there to cause as much disruption to British intercontinental trade as possible. The orders encouraged the admirals not to engage any Royal Navy force of equivalent size or larger and thus avoid the risk of being captured or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s rising shore costs, dock workers strikes, {{restrictive}} practices {{on both sides}} of the <b>Atlantic,</b> <b>and</b> subsidised competition from American shipping lines, persuaded Manchester Liners to switch its future fleet to container ships only.

5|$|Due to Allied {{victories}} in France and Eastern Europe, Germany's surface shipping was largely {{confined to the}} lower Baltic and Norwegian waters by late 1944.
