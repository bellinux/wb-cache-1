The basic processes involve substrate preparation, ex-situ cleaning, in-situ surface oxide removal and SEG/ELO growth. Substrate preparation involves fabrication of the necessary "seed-windows" in, e. g. oxide or nitride layers down to the single crystal substrate : this is usually achieved using a reactive ion etch (RIE) process followed by the growth and subsequent etching of a sacrificial oxide (SO) for surface damage removal. Ex-situ cleaning usually consists of a wet chemical treatment, e. g.

40|$|The {{development}} of a process for the low temperature (3 ̆c 600 ° C) growth of epitaxial silicon is an important technological issue. Conventional growth processes involve temperatures in excess of 1000 ° C. At these temperatures <b>autodoping</b> and impurity redistribution limit the feature size achievable in VLSI fabrication. As the typical feature sizes move into the submicron region, new processes for epitaxial silicon deposition will be needed. Another application for a low temperature growth process is the fabrication of solar cells on inexpensive metallurgical grade silicon wafers. Impurity diffusion from the wafer during conventional epitaxial silicon growth limits {{the quality of the}} solar cells if expensive high purity wafers are not used. We have used electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma deposition to grow high quality epitaxial silicon films on silicon wafers. This growth technique relies on the deposition of silicon from a highly energetic hydrogen and silane plasma. The presence of the hydrogen in the plasma provides reactive etching of the silicon surface during growth. This reduces the oxygen and carbon contamination in the film as well as increasing the number of available growth sites on the surface by displacing the adsorbed hydrogen. By optimizing the growth pressure, substrate temperature, microwave power, substrate bias and silane to hydrogen ratio we have developed a process which provides enhanced growth rates and good uniformity at temperatures (425 - 575 ° C) significantly below those used in conventional processes.

The improvement is attr ibuted to the rel ief {{of stress in}} the structure, which prevents further flawing (in-duced after the oxidation and thermal cycling). The poly 1 to poly 2 breakdewn dependence on poly 1 doping was also studied and part it ioned into three regions: "heavi ly doped, ' [...] transition, " and "l ightly doped. " The breakdown results {{in each of these}} regions are dependent not only on the poly 1 doping concentra-tion, but also on the second-gate oxidation temperature, the poly 1 undercut pr ior to the oxidation, and the post gate 2 anneal step. In the "heavi ly doped " region (for an 800 ~ wet gate 2), the poly 1 undergoes evere deformation and the encapsulating oxide approaches critical stress levels on convex corners. The 1000 ~ post gate 2 anneal can remove the stresses; however, poly 1 protrusions and oxide thin spots wil l remain as artifacts. In the "tran-sition " region, these artifacts lessen in magnitude. When annealed, the "transit ion " region samples are superior in integrity to the "heavi ly doped " region samples. In the "l ightly doped " region, both stress and the artifacts are of a noncrit ical nature and the post gate 2 anneal adds l itt le benefit. The undercutt ing of the poly 1 land was found to have the most deleterious effect when the poly 1 is heavi ly doped. This holds true even for annea!ed sam-ples (since the poly 1 protrusions and oxide thin spots are not removed by the post gate 2 anneal). There is significant improvement on "heavi ly doped " unannealed samples if the poly 1 land is not undercut (by aniso-tropic removal of the gate 1 oxide). Oxidizing the second gate at higher temperatures (e. g., 900 ~ re-duces the concentrat ion-dependent oxidation rate and therefore decreases the stress bui ld-up due to the dis-placement of oxide generated.

40|$|Ultrashallow {{junctions}} {{are essential}} for the achievement of superior transistor performance, both in MOSFET and bipolar transistors. The stringent demands require state-of-the-art fabrication techniques. At the same time, in a different context, the accurate fabrication of various n type doping profiles by low-temperature Si epitaxy is a challenge due to <b>autodoping.</b> In this thesis, these two, apparently unrelated, problems are both addressed as the layer of CVD surface-deposited dopant atoms {{is used as a}} doping source. It is demonstrated that a layer of dopants deposited on the Si surface {{can be used as a}} doping source by either thermal or laser drive-in for the fabrication of both deep and ultrashallow defect-free junctions. In low-temperature CVD epitaxy, <b>autodoping</b> is a consequence of dopant surface segregation and doping from the surface layer. This process has been characterized, and consequently excellent controllability is achieved. In addition, new results related to the CVD of dopants itself are obtained, and two theoretical achievements are made: the analytical model of arbitrarily shallow junctions is derived, and a new C-V profiling technique suitable for the characterization of ultrashallow junctions is developed. The analytical model of arbitrarily shallow junctions, presented in Chapter 2, is derived based on the basic transport mechanisms, with the junction depth as a free parameter, allowing the junction to be fully depleted or disappear. In this way, a closed-form model is obtained that unifies the standard p-n junction and Schottky junction models. With such a unified description, the characteristics of extremely shallow diodes that lie at the cross-over between the standard p-n and Schottky diodes are for the first time analytically described, and new phenomena are observed: both forward and reverse characteristics exhibit specific nonidealities. In that respect, this model can be used to predict the onset of nonidealities as a function of the doping levels, junction depth and biasing conditions. The process of dopant CVD is central to the experimental work presented in this thesis, and it is described in detail in Chapter 3, together with other experimental techniques. Particular focus is given to the deposition of As, the deposition dynamics of which have been empirically modeled to enable accurate sub-monolayer deposition at 800 °C, and the ability to achieve substantial deposition has been demonstrated down to 300 °C. The high-temperature step prior to deposition was found to be unnecessary if Marangoni drying is used. Also, techniques for the removal of As have been investigated: thermal desorption and different wet cleaning solutions. With dopant CVD and drive-in, there are two high-temperature steps to which windows in SiO 2 to the Si are exposed: first, for surface cleaning before dopant deposition, and second, for dopant drive-in; and both can have detrimental effects on the definition of deposition windows and on the Si surface. The kind and extent of disfiguration that appears in these two processes has been described in Chapter 4. At temperatures above 900 °C, significant lateral widening of deposition windows is observed. At 1100 °C, also micrometer-deep cavities in the Si form. These spikes typically form in the corners or around the edges of deposition windows, and their generation is catalyzed by the presence of dopants. Contrary to the CVD of B, As and P depositions are limited to a maximum of a single monolayer. This is nevertheless a substantial dose, well suited for the ultrashallow junction formation, which has been demonstrated by thermal and laser drive-in, and the results are presented in Chapter 5. Thermal diffusion was characterized in the temperature range from 700 °C to 900 °C. Due to the high concentration gradient, low diffusivity and SiO 2 encapsulation, nanometer-shallow junctions are formed, while no defects are introduced. The diffused dose, however, is only a fraction of a monolayer, and the junctions can even be fully depleted, exhibiting characteristics predicted by the model of arbitrarily shallow junctions. Nevertheless, they can be very effective in modulating the effective Schottky barrier height. With laser annealing, at laser energy densities above the Si melt limit, successful drive-in of the complete monolayer is achieved. Thereby, junctions 10 nm to 15 nm deep, with 3 nm/dec or better vertical abruptness, doped above 3 x 10 ^ 20 cm- 3, with sheet resistance around 300 ohm/sq indicative of 100 % activation are formed in an essentially room-temperature process. Such exceptionally good results are enabled by the fact that the defect-inducing ion implantation is not used, thus no defect annealing steps are needed. While the doping profiles satisfy the ITRS requirements, the low defect density and low processing temperature make this, in combination with As deposition at 300 °C, a promising solution for junction formation after metallization and for backside junction formation in the SOG substrate-transfer technology. For the low-temperature RPCVD Si epitaxy, an empirical model of As surface segregation, adsorption, and incorporation from the surface layer has been developed, and is presented in Chapter 6. Together with the pure As deposition and As wet chemical removal, this model enables very accurate fabrication of doping profiles of nearly arbitrary shape, the most important restriction being that the profiles can be both continuously or discretely increasing in the growth direction, but only discretely decreasing using ex-situ As cleaning. Based on this model, profiles inversely proportional to the square of the doping depth are fabricated for the novel varactor diodes with state-of-the-art linearity. For the purpose of characterization of ultrashallow junctions, beyond the limitations of SIMS resolution, a new C-V profiling technique has been developed and is presented in Chapter 7. It relies on fabricating and measuring two diodes, one Schottky and one p-n diode, both with the same background doping profile, in order to obtain first the background and then the ultrashallow doping profile. It has been demonstrated that this can be achieved if the background profile contains abrupt changes in doping, e. g. in the form of steps, even if it is considerably less abrupt and less highly doped. Using an epitaxially grown step-like background profile, the ultrashallow B profile formed only by pure B CVD has been measured to have the junction depth of 7 nm, and the slope of around 2. 5 nm/dec.
