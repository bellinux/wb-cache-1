5|$|From 1972 through 1974, {{the war was}} {{conducted}} along FANK's lines of communications {{north and south of}} the capital. Limited offensives were launched to maintain contact with the rice-growing regions of the northwest and along the Mekong River and Route 5, the Republic's overland connections to South Vietnam. The strategy of the Khmer Rouge was to gradually cut those lines of communication <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> Phnom Penh. As a result, FANK forces became fragmented, isolated, and unable to lend one another mutual support.|$|E

The match ended when America's Most Wanted performed their finishing maneuver the Death Sentence, which saw Storm wrap his arms around Hoyt <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> tightly while Harris jumped off the top turnbuckle and performed a legdrop across his neck and head. America's Most Wanted followed by covering Hoyt to retain the World Tag Team Championship.|$|E
40|$|After {{beginning}} with a short historical review {{of the concept of}} displaced (coherent) <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states, we discuss previous (often forgotten) work on displaced <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> number states. Next, we obtain the most general displaced <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> number states. We do this in both the functional and operator (Fock) formalisms, thereby demonstrating the necessary equivalence. We then obtain the time-dependent expectation values, uncertainties, wave-functions, and probability densities. In conclusion, there is a discussion on the possibility of experimentally observing these states. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the behavior of coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states undergoing time evolution. We calculate time dependence of expectation values of position and momentum in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states (which can be interpreted as quantum trajectories in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states) <b>and</b> examine how coherence <b>and</b> <b>squeezing</b> is affected during time development, calculating time dependence of position and momentum uncertainty. We focus our investigations on two quantum systems. First we consider quantum linear system with Hamiltonian quadratic in $q$ and $p$ variables. As the second system we consider the simplest quantum nonlinear system with Hamiltonian quartic in $q$ and $p$ variables. We calculate the explicit formulas for the time development of expectation values and uncertainties of position and momentum in an initial coherent state. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> out any seeds on a branch before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often undercranked or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{uncertainty}} relations, {{as well as}} coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states, are structural properties of stochastic processes with Fokker-Planck dynamics.

25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E
25|$|The {{prolapse}} may be obvious, or it {{may require}} straining and squatting to produce it. The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> pressures. Sometimes {{it is necessary to}} observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet). A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.|$|E
25|$|In a {{two-point}} system, if one detonator fires, one entire hemisphere {{of the pit}} will implode as designed. The high-explosive charge {{surrounding the}} other hemisphere will explode progressively, from the equator toward the opposite pole. Ideally, this will pinch the equator <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> the second hemisphere away from the first, like toothpaste in a tube. By the time the explosion envelops it, its implosion will be separated both {{in time and space}} from the implosion of the first hemisphere. The resulting dumbbell shape, with each end reaching maximum density at a different time, may not become critical.|$|E
40|$|Using {{coherent}} <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> state formalisms {{of quantum}} optics for a minimally coupled non-classical inflaton in the FRW mertic is studied, in semiclassical theory of gravity. The leading order {{solution for the}} semiclassical Einstein equations in the coherent, <b>squeezed</b> <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> vacuum states are obtained perturbatively and are exhibit powerlaw expansion behaviour. The validity of the semiclassical theory is examined in the squeezed vacuum state in the oscillatory phase of the inflaton. The semiclassical theory in the oscillatory phase of the non-classical inflaton holds only if the associated squeezing parameter is much less compared to unity. Quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is also examined in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> state formalisms. ...|$|R

25|$|Female fig wasps arrive {{carrying}} pollen {{from their}} natal tree <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> {{their way through}} the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. The syncomium bears 500–600 female flowers arranged in multiple layers - those that are closer to the outer wall of the fig have short pedicels and long styles, while those that are located closer to the interior of the chamber have long pedicels and short styles. Female wasps generally lay their eggs in the short-styled flowers, while longer-styled flowers {{were more likely to be}} pollinated. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. Pollinated flowers which have not been parasitised give rise to seeds.|$|E
25|$|Both the 30-minute and 15-minute {{programs}} were performed and broadcast live. If a line was flubbed or an accident happened, the actors recovered {{as quickly as}} possible and soldiered on. The pressure of memorizing lines for a new live 15-minute show every day (Monday through Friday) was onerous enough, but became even more burdensome when the 30-minute weekly Saturday show was added beginning Dec. 30, 1950. Around this time, Moser began sharing the writing chores with Norman Jolley. The actors' tasks were increasingly difficult because they faced the complexity of coordinating their on-camera movements with intricate special effects, which also had to be created live and in real-time. For example, pistols that shot invisible rays necessitated pre-positioning small electrically wired explosive charges on the surface they were supposed to strike. An actor would aim the prop ray gun at that location <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> the trigger, whereupon a special effects worker off-scene would throw the detonation switch.|$|E
25|$|An {{official}} list {{began to develop}} with Greco-Roman astronomer Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria (c. 100 – c. 170), whose list of 48 constellations was accepted as standard in Europe for 1,800 years. As constellations {{were considered to be}} composed only of the stars that constituted the figure, it was always possible to use any leftover stars to create <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> in a new grouping among the established constellations. Furthermore, exploration by Europeans {{to other parts of the}} globe exposed them to stars unknown to ancient Mediterraneans. Two astronomers particularly known for expanding on Ptolemy's catalog were Johann Bayer (1572–1625) and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713–1762). Bayer listed a dozen figures that had been suggested since Ptolemy's day; Lacaille created new groups, mostly for the area near the South Celestial Pole. Many of their proposed constellations have been accepted, with the rest remaining as asterisms. In 1930, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) divided the sky into 88 official constellations surrounding recognized asterisms, with precise geometric boundaries that encompass all of the stars within them. Any grouping – whether it has an area of the sky identified by it or not – is an asterism.|$|E

25|$|On September 10, 2012 during Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, {{not long}} after {{defeating}} CM Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against The Prime Time Players. Fellow commentator Michael Cole continued to call that match alone, {{as well as the}} next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary, and updates on Jerry's condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, 2012, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, 2012, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler's hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.|$|E

500|$|Because Scully {{believes}} that the killer {{will return to the}} scenes of his earlier crimes, she and Mulder wait in the parking garage of Usher's office building. There, they catch a man named Eugene Victor Tooms (Doug Hutchison) climbing through the air vents. Tooms is given a polygraph test, which includes questions written by Mulder linking him to murders dating as far back as 1903. Tooms passes most of the test, but crucially fails the two questions written [...] by Mulder placing Tooms at the historical murders. However, Colton dismisses Mulder's queries as being ridiculous and lets Tooms go.

500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the {{contrast}} between lyrical themes and underlying music.

The Guardians Alexis Petridis compared the album's sound to its themes in a three-star review, suggesting that the album [...] " [...] the information overload of 24-hour rolling news so well that it essentially provokes the same reaction: it's often compelling, but you occasionally find yourself gripped by an overwhelming urge to turn it off". The album was among the favourites for the Mercury Prize, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes at one time offering odds of 4/1, but was not among the twelve albums selected for the shortlist. BBC News Online included the album on their list of [...] "ten albums they missed".|$|E
500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around <b>and</b> <b>squeeze</b> his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at the house for a few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
