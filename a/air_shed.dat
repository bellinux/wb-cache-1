5000|$|Paekakariki's close {{association}} with the railway began in 1886 when the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company's line from Wellington to Longburn opened. Paekakariki Railway Station was a large station despite the settlement's small size, as it was ideally located as a locomotive changeover point - powerful engines were required to tackle the difficult grades between Wellington and Paekakariki, while lighter and more nimble ones were better suited to the gentle grades and straight track through the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua to Manawatu. The New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) took over the Wellington and Manawatu Railway in December 1908, but Paekakariki's status as an important depot remained unchanged. In 1940, the line from Wellington to Paekakariki was electrified and Paekakariki's depot was altered: it became the changeover point from electric to steam motive power, or electric to diesel from the 1950s onwards. Paekakariki also was an important goods transfer point between the Railways and its [...] "Rail Air" [...] service that operated out of Paraparaumu across Cook Strait, before the Rail ferries. A large goods shed was constructed at Paekakariki by U.S. Marines stationed {{in the area for}} use with the Rail Air service during World War II. In the late 1960s with steam power coming to an end, the locomotive depot in Paekakariki was closed and the diesel locomotives which replaced steam were based out of Wellington instead. The main engine shed was demolished along with a number of other buildings, but the Rail <b>Air</b> <b>Shed,</b> two signal boxes, amenities building and a turntable remained when Steam Incorporated acquired the site. New sheds were constructed to replace those demolished, and the Rail <b>Air</b> <b>Shed</b> & amenities buildings were acquired when it became available. While initially leasing a portion of the site, Steam Incorporated now owns the whole former depot site including the 70ft turntable however the railways retain a right of access to the turntable.|$|E

40|$|The {{biogenic}} {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs) in the ambient air of the Hobart <b>Air</b> <b>Shed</b> and in the emissions from selected Tasmanian native trees and understorey shrubs were measured. The emission rates were then related to the plants' essential oils content, which had been extracted by hydro-distillation. The VOCs in the ambient air of native forests have not previously been studied in Australia. This study used multi-adsorbent cartridge adsorption/thermal desorption and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The type, quantity, source and variation of the VOCs were investigated. The concentration of VOCs in the atmosphere surrounding vegetation in the Hobart <b>Air</b> <b>Shed</b> was determined. In all, 129 compounds of eight classes were detected. Ofthese, 11 compounds were National Pollutant Inventory substances and 32 were considered biogenic; however, this estimate is conservative. The concentration of total VOCs in these ambient air measurements varied between 4. 43 x 10 - 10 g L- 1 and 3. 04 x 10 - 9 g L- 1 depending on the site sampled and meteorological conditions. The relative standard deviation ranged between 3. 50 / 0 and 51. 8 % in the dual air samples. The emission rates of VOCs were determined for 14 plant species within the Hobart <b>Air</b> <b>Shed,</b> using an enclosure bottle technique. In all, 284 compounds of 10 classes were detected. Emission rates varied between 1. 98 x 10 - 8 and 5. 43 x 10 - 6 g g-l (wet weight) h- 1 depending on the species sampled and prevailing conditions. The relative standard deviation {{was estimated to be}} 31. 1 %. The VOC emission rate for the entire eucalypt forest in Tasmania was estimated as 8200 kg h- 1 and for the Hobart <b>Air</b> <b>Shed</b> 59 kg h- 1. The error could be as large as a factor of three. The essential oil compositions of the species examined were identified. Linear relationships between VOC oil concentration and emission rates were found in 10 of the 13 analyses...|$|E

The purpose was to predict the air quality effects from off-grid diesel power generators operated by a textile factory in Lagos, Nigeria on its host airshed. Emissions from 22 point sources in 5 sections of the factory were considered with 6 different scenarios. 4 years of hourly meteorological observations were used for the investigation of dispersion. The model output showed the highest value of maximum ground level concentration at 90 m south east of the factory. The predicted impact using the worst case scenario showed that the ambient HC of the host <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> will change by 0. 01 - 0. 05 % of Nigeriaâ€™s Federal Ministry of Environment (FMENV) standard.

40|$|Air quality {{prediction}} {{plays an}} important role in the management of our envi-ronment. Computational power and eciencies have advanced to the point where chemical transport models can predict pollution in an urban <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> with spatial resolution less than a kilometer, and cover the globe with a horizontal resolution of less than 50 km. Predicting air quality remains a challenge due to the complexity of the governing processes and the strong coupling across scales. While air quality pre-diction is closely aligned with weather prediction, there are important dierences, including the role of pollution emissions and their associated large uncertainties. As more atmospheric chemical observations become available chemical data assim-ilation is expected to play an essential role in air quality forecasting. In this paper the current status of air quality forecasting is discussed and illustrated by compar-ison of predictions with observations.

40|$|Spread of air {{pollution}} sources and non-uniform mixing conditions in urban or regional air sheds often result in spatial variation of pollutant concentrations over {{different parts of the}} air sheds. A comprehensive understanding of this variation of concentrations is imperative for informed planning, monitoring and assessment in a range of critical areas including assessment of monitoring network efficiency or assessment of population exposure variation {{as a function of the}} location in the city. The aims of this work were to study the city-wide variability of pollutants as measured by "urban background" type monitoring stations and to interpret the results in relation to the applicability of the data to population exposure assessments and the network efficiency. A comparison between ambient concentrations of NOx, ozone and PM 10 was made for three stations in the Brisbane <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> network. The best correlated between the three stations were ozone concentrations followed by NOx concentration, with the worst correlations observed for PM 10.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} recieves one of {{the prime}} concern in India, primarily due to rapid economic growth, industrialization and urbanization with associated increase in energy demands. Lacks of implementation of environmental regulations are contributing to the bad air quality of most of the Indian cities. Air pollutants produced in any <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> are not completely confined, but at time trespassing all the geographical boundaries, hence donot remain only a problem of urban centres, but spread and affect remote rural areas supporting large productive agricultural land. Air pollutants pose risks on yield of crops depending on the emission pattern, atmospheric transport and leaf uptake and on the plantâ€™s biochemical defense capacity. Recent trends have shown decrease in SO 2 emissions, but increase in NO 2 emission due to more number of automobiles. In past few decades, tropospheric O 3 has been identified as a most important air pollutant of rural areas. Air pollutants produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which adversely affect biochemical processes of plants and reduce their tolerance capacity to other stresses also. Several vital physiological processes such as photosynthetic CO 2 fixation and energy metabolism are also affected negatively by air pollutants. An adverse effect caused by air pollutants depends not only upon its concentration, but also on the duration and combination of air pollutants.

40|$|The {{predominant}} hypothesis {{regarding the}} composition of microbial assemblages in indoor environments is that fungal assemblages are structured by outdoor air with a moderate contribution by surface growth, whereas indoor bacterial assemblages represent a mixture of bacteria entered from outdoor <b>air,</b> <b>shed</b> by building inhabitants, and grown on surfaces. To test the fungal aspect of this hypothesis, we sampled fungi from three surface types likely to support growth and therefore possible contributors of fungi to indoor air: drains in kitchens and bathrooms, sills beneath condensation-prone windows, and skin of human inhabitants. Sampling was done in replicated units of a university-housing complex without reported mold problems, and sequences were analyzed using both QIIME and the new UPARSE approach to OTU-binning, to the same result. Surfaces demonstrated a mycological profile {{similar to that of}} outdoor air from the same locality, and assemblages clustered by surface type. "Weedy" genera typical of indoor air, such as Cladosporium and Cryptococcus, were abundant on sills, as were a diverse set of fungi of likely outdoor origin. Drains supported more depauperate assemblages than the other surfaces and contained thermotolerant genera such as Exophiala, Candida, and Fusarium. Most surprising was the composition detected on residents' foreheads. In addition to harboring Malassezia, a known human commensal, skin also possessed a surprising richness of non-resident fungi, including plant pathogens such as ergot (Claviceps purperea). Overall, fungal richness across indoor surfaces was high, but based on known autecologies, most of these fungi were unlikely to be growing on surfaces. We conclude that while some endogenous fungal growth on typical household surfaces does occur, particularly on drains and skin, all residential surfaces appear - to varying degrees - to be passive collectors of airborne fungi of putative outdoor origin, a view of the origins of the indoor microbiome quite different from bacteria...|$|E

40|$|The {{basis of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the relative environmental impacts of various power generators knowing that all plants are located in totally different environments and that different receptors will experience different impacts. Based on IChemE sustainability metrics paradigm, we calculated potential environmental indicators (P-EI) that represent the environmental burden of masses of potential pollutants discharged into different receiving media. However, a P-EI may not be of significance, as it may not be expressed at all in different conditions, so to try and include some receiver significance we developed a methodology to take into account some specific environmental indicators (S-EI) that refer to the environmental attributes of a specific site. In this context, we acquired site specific environmental data related to the airsheds and water catchment areas in different locations for a limited number of environmental indicators such as human health (carcinogenic) effects, atmospheric acidification, photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication. The S-EI results from this particular analysis show that atmospheric acidification has highest impact value while health risks due to fly ash emissions are considered not to be as significant. This {{is due to the fact}} that many coal power plants in Australia are located in low population density <b>air</b> <b>sheds.</b> The contribution of coal power plants to photochemical (ozone) smog and eutrophication were not significant.

40|$|Objectives: Intestinal {{metabolism}} and transport are now recognized as protective barriers against orally ingested xenobiotics, including drugs. However, {{in vitro studies}} of the expression and function of intestinal proteins are hampered by the limited availability of human intestinal tissues. Because enterocytes are constantly shed in large numbers into the gut lumen, this study investigated whether these cells could be collected with a multilumen perfusion catheter and whether they are functionally active. Methods: In healthy volunteers, a 20 -cm isolated jejunal segment was generated with the perfusion catheter by inflating 2 balloons with <b>air.</b> <b>Shed</b> cells were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis for leukocyte-specific CD 45 and enterocyte-specific villin, {{as well as for}} apoptosis. Homogenates of the cells were used for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cytochrome P 450 enzyme activity was determined with the calcium channel blocker verapamil as a substrate. Results: On average, 4. 83 mg protein and 56. 23 million cells were collected from a 20 -cm segment during 2 hours. A total of 84. 2 % of the cells were positive for enterocyte-specific villin, and only 1. 6 % of the collected cells were positive for CD 45. The majority of cells (65. 3 %) were not in early or late apoptosis or necrosis. In all volunteers, drug-metabolizing enzymes (such as members of the cytochrome P 450 family) could be detected as both messenger ribonucleic acid and proteins. Consistent with expression data, formation of verapamil metabolites catalyzed by CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C was shown. Conclusions: The majority of shed human enterocytes collected with a multilumen perfusion catheter were still functionally active and not apoptotic. Harvesting of spontaneously shed enterocytes provides a new tool for studies on expression and function of intestinal proteins.

Their variations and relationships with relevant variables that characterize the air pollution potential of the urban <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> are also given. The measurements were carried out for one year from May 2006 to May 2007. During this period, particulate matter (PM) was continuously measured at one reference station and alternatively for shorter time periods at six different sites. The values and temporal variations on a daily and seasonal basis were consistent with the ventilation potential of the atmosphere. The cold season, which had the lowest values of the ventilation coefficient, indicated higher probabilities of poor air quality and this was confirmed by the higher concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 measured. At the reference station, the daily EU limit value for PM 10 was exceeded 36 times during one year while the Buenos Aires limit value was exceeded only once. The PM 10 annual mean value was almost 70 % of the Buenos Aires annual limit. The PM 2. 5 annual mean value (15 Î¼g m- 3) was same as the regulated one (15 Î¼g m- 3). The correlation between PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations and frequencies of wind directions showed that the highest concentrations were observed when the wind was from the city (land wind) and lowest concentrations when the wind was from Rio de La Plata (fluvial wind). The concentrations during land wind events exceeded the Buenos Aires PM 2. 5 annual limit value. The ratio of PM 2. 5 to PM 10 was 0. 44, which indicates the coarse particles (> 2. 5 Î¼m) originated from road dust, soil re-suspension and abrasion processes are the dominated fractions of PM. Results of random PM measurements at 60 sites showed that PM 2. 5 was more homogeneously distributed over the city than PM 10...|$|E

Methods Our study had three parts: (1) we developed a predictive statistical model of mean mass (mu g) of particulates 10 mu m or less per cubic metre of air (PM 10) using visibility and other meteorological data in Darwin during the dry seasons of 2000 and 2004; (2) we tested the model and its application to the broader <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> by (a) matching the prediction of this model to PM 10 measurements made in Darwin in 2005, (b) matching the predictions to independent measurements at two locations 20 km {{to the north and}} south of Darwin and (c) matching peaks in PM 10 to known major fire events in the region (2000 - 01 dry seasons); and (3) we used the model to explore changes in air quality over the last 50 years, a period that spans the transition from Aboriginal to European land management. Results We demonstrated that visibility data can be used reliably as a proxy for biomass burning across the largely uncleared tropical savannas inland of Darwin. Validations using independent measurements demonstrated that our predictive model was robust, and geographically and temporally representative of the regional airshed. We used the model to hindcast and found that seasonal air quality has changed since 1955, with a trend to increasing PM 10 concentrations in the early dry season.

The <b>air</b> <b>shed</b> in the Valley is easily trapped by the surrounded mountains and the inversion layer formulated as the cap. The PM 10 concentration was noticeably higher than the standard level (120 Î¼g/m 3) in urban and suburban area of Kathmandu valley for all seasons except monsoon period. The Valley area experiences similar wind patterns (W, WWS, and S) for a year but the Easterly wind prevails only during the monsoon period. There was low and calm wind blows during the winter season. Because of this air flow structure, the air emission from various sources is accumulated within the valley air, high level of air pollution is frequently recorded with other air pollut-ed cities over the world. In this Valley area, brick kilns are recognized as the major air pollution source followed by vehicles. Mostly Bull Trench Kiln (BKT), Hoffman Kiln and Vertical Shaft Brick Kiln (VSBK) are in operation for brick firing in Kathmandu valley where the fuels such as crushed coal, saw dust, and natural gas are used for processing bricks in this study. Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) was used for screening and quantifying the potential impacts of air emission from firing fuels. The total Environmen-tal Performance Score (EPS) was estimated and the EPS of coal was approximately 2. 5 times {{higher than those of}} natural gas and saw dust. It is concluded that the crushed coal has more negative impact to the environment and human health than other fuel sources. Concerning the human health and environ-ment point of view, alternative environment friendly firing fuel need to be used for brick industry in the kiln and the air pollution control devices also need to be applied for minimizing the air emissions from the kilns...|$|E
50|$|Because the new diesel and {{electric}} locomotives {{did not need}} turning, unlike their steam-driven predecessors, the old turntable {{that used to be}} located here was removed. It was replaced by the Orange Coach Shed (Orange Reisezughalle), because it was now possible to carry out the inspection of coaches based at Passau. The shed is connected to the compressed <b>air</b> system in <b>shed</b> I. In shed II the society has its own lifting gear with a carrying capacity of 64 tonnes which is used to swap axles on vehicles.|$|R
25|$|Reflecting the {{reliance}} on horses {{for a variety of}} transport needs in the era, the town features a centrally located stables, situated behind the sweet shop, with its courtyard being accessed from the archway next to the pub. It is presented as a typical jobmaster's yard, with stables and a tack room in the building on its north side. A small, brick built open <b>air,</b> carriage <b>shed</b> is sited {{on the back of the}} printworks building. On the east side of the courtyard is a much larger metal shed (utilising iron roof trusses from Fleetwood), arranged mainly as carriage storage, but with a blacksmith's shop in the corner. The building on the west side of the yard is not part of any display. The interior fittings for the harness room came from Callaly Caste. Many of the horses and horse-drawn vehicles used by the museum are housed in the stables and sheds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Colisepticaemia is a {{frequently}} {{disease of}} poultry caused by Escherichia coli. The researches {{have been performed}} on 128 strains of E. coli isolated from broilers with different ages, from five farms, and from the <b>shed</b> <b>air,</b> only from one farm. The strains have been identified according to their biochemical characters, {{and then we have}} tested their hemolytic activity on agar with 5 % sheep defibrined blood, fixed the Congo Red in agar TSA and the profile of resistance to antibiotics. This study was to confirm the association between Congo Red binding E coli and colisepticaemia in commercial broilers...|$|R
