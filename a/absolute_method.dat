50|$|Black light {{paints and}} inks are {{commonly}} used {{in the production of}} black light posters. Under daylight, the poster {{may or may not be}} vibrant in color, but under black light (with little or no visible light present), the effect produced can be psychedelic. The inks are normally highly sensitive to direct sunlight and other powerful light sources. The fluorescent dyes cause a chemical reaction when exposed to high intensity light sources (HILS) and the visual result is a fading in the colors of the inks. With paper, significant visible change in the color saturation can typically be observed within 45 minutes to one hour of exposure to the HILS. To date, there is no <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> to prevent this phenomenon, although certain laminations, lacquer coatings and glass or plastic protective sheets can effectively slow the fading characteristics of the dyes.|$|E
50|$|Trendelenburg's philosophizing is {{conditioned}} throughout by his loving {{study of}} Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly {{on the broad}} basis of idealism. His own standpoint may be called a modern version of Aristotelianism. While denying {{the possibility of an}} <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by Hegel and others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real. But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine the system of the whole from the part we know, but the process of reconstruction must remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation, it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the permanent results of historic developments.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} contrasted {{two methods}} for calculating the internal work of running. The methods {{are known as}} absolute work (also known as Winter's (1979) W wb calculation) and absolute power. The {{study also examined whether}} or not there were differences in the amounts of internal work done by trained and untrained runners. The absolute work approach was believed to calculate internal work incorrectly. The absolute power approach, on the other hand, correctly computes internal work by taking the absolute power generated or absorbed at each joint and summing them across a movement cycle. Five trained and five untrained female runners were filmed, while running across a laboratory runway, by a cinecamera at 100 fps. Simultaneously, force plate data, for one step, were collected. The results showed absolute work values were three times the absolute power values. Furthermore, the results of the <b>absolute</b> work <b>method</b> were too large compared to the estimated physiological cost of running. Conversely, the <b>absolute</b> power <b>method</b> produced amounts of internal work that were too high but were much closer to the estimated physiological cost. There {{was no significant difference between}} work values of the two groups of runners, for the <b>absolute</b> power <b>method.</b> The correlations for the <b>absolute</b> power <b>method</b> were higher than those of the <b>absolute</b> work <b>method.</b> Based on the results, the <b>absolute</b> power <b>method</b> provided a more accurate estimate of locomotor cost of running...|$|R

50|$|The {{liquid is}} placed on {{horizontal}} plate and a shallow cone placed into it. The angle between {{the surface of the}} cone and the plate is around 1 to 2 degrees but can vary depending on the types of tests being run. Typically the plate is rotated and the torque on the cone measured. A well-known version of this instrument is the Weissenberg Rheogoniometer, in which the movement of the cone is resisted by a thin piece of metal which twists—known as a torsion bar. The known response of the torsion bar and the degree of twist give the shear stress, while the rotational speed and cone dimensions give the shear rate. In principle the Weissenberg Rheogoniometer is an <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> of measurement providing it is accurately set up. Other instruments operating on this principle may be easier to use but require calibration with a known fluid.Cone and plate rheometers can also be operated in an oscillating mode to measure elastic properties, or in combined rotational and oscillating modes.|$|E
50|$|Long {{distance}} {{seed dispersal}} (LDD) {{is a type}} of spatial dispersal that is currently defined by two forms, proportional and actual distance. A plant's fitness and survival may heavily depend on this method of seed dispersal depending on certain environmental factors. The first form of LDD, proportional distance, measures the percentage of seeds (1% out of total number of seeds produced) that travel the farthest distance out of a 99% probability distribution. The proportional definition of LDD is in actuality a descriptor for more extreme dispersal events. An example of LDD would be that of a plant developing a specific dispersal vector or morphology in order to allow for the dispersal of its seeds over a great distance. The actual or <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> identifies LDD as a literal distance. It classifies 1 km as the threshold distance for seed dispersal. Here, threshold means the minimum distance a plant can disperse its seeds and have it still count as LDD. There is a second, unmeasurable, form of LDD besides proportional and actual. This is known as the non-standard form. Non-standard LDD is when seed dispersal occurs completely at random. An example of this would be if the lemur dependent dispersal of seeds from the deciduous trees of Madagascar were to wash ashore the coastline of South Africa via the attachment of mermaid purses laid by a shark or common skate.6 A driving factor for the evolutionary significance of LDD is that it increases plant fitness by decreasing neighboring plant competition for offspring. However, it is still unclear today as to how specific traits, conditions and trade-offs (particularly within short seed dispersal) effect LDD evolution.|$|E

The problem may be {{approached}} in two ways; first, experimental production of a hypertrophic kidney by unilateral nephrectomy, and second, observations of the lesion in congenital anomalies of the urinary tract. The present paper reports the results of experimental investigations in the white rat. In a future paper, observations on congenitally asymmetrical kidneys will be presented. Two methods have been used by other investigators in the enumeration of the glomeruli in the hypertrophic kidney, a relative and an <b>absolute</b> <b>method.</b> The relative method compares the total glomemli in equal areas of standard sections. The <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> consists in a complete enumeration of the glomeruli. Three types of the <b>absolute</b> <b>method</b> have been developed. Kitfleson (1) counted the glomeruli in serial sections and by the ingenious use of carbon paper avoided duplication. This method is applicable to small kidneys, such as the rat and mouse, but is too laborious for larger kidneys. Two students of Bensley have evolved injection methods which are quite accurate, yet are not time consuming.
