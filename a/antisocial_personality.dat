25|$|Given the inhumanity of his crimes, Hitler {{was early}} on linked with “psychopathy”, a severe {{personality}} disorder whose main symptoms {{are a great}} or complete lack of empathy, social responsibility and conscience. The biologically determined concept still {{plays a role in}} the psychiatric forensic science, but it is no longer found in the modern medical classification systems (DSM-IV and ICD-10). Today, corresponding clinical pictures are mostly classified as signs of an <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder. However, the symptomatology is rare, and unlike in popular discourse – where the classification of Hitler as a “psychopath” is commonplace –, psychiatrists have only occasionally endeavored to associate him with psychopathy or <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatric {{medications}} {{may also}} alleviate co-occurring conditions sometimes {{associated with the}} disorder or with symptoms such as aggression or impulsivity, including antipsychotic, antidepressant or mood-stabilizing medications, although none have yet {{been approved by the}} FDA for this purpose. For example, a study found that the antipsychotic clozapine may be effective in reducing various behavioral dysfunctions in a sample of high-security hospital inpatients with <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder and psychopathic traits. However, research into the pharmacological treatment of psychopathy and the related condition <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder is minimal, with much of the knowledge in this area being extrapolations based on what is known about pharmacology in other mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Hervey M. Cleckley, an American psychiatrist, {{influenced}} the initial diagnostic criteria for <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> reaction/disturbance in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), as did American psychologist George E. Partridge. The DSM and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) subsequently introduced the diagnoses of <b>antisocial</b> <b>personality</b> disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder respectively, stating that these diagnoses have {{been referred to}} (or include what is referred to) as psychopathy or sociopathy. The creation of ASPD and DPD was driven {{by the fact that}} many of the classic traits of psychopathy were impossible to measure objectively. Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare later repopularized the construct of psychopathy in criminology with his Psychopathy Checklist.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} compares Internet usernames by known {{offenders}} in cybercrime with ASPD symptoms {{and college students}} {{with the aim of}} finding differences in the usage patterns in the two groups. The results are quite interesting as no significant differences are seen in the length of the username, or in the usage of alphabet, numerical, and special characters in the two groups. However, the most striking difference is that <b>antisocial</b> <b>personalities</b> are seen to take on false identities while creating a username, while only one subject in the control group was found to do so. The study is relevant in understanding the personality of cybercriminals that is a major concern for crime investigating agencies the world over...|$|R

50|$|Although {{both men}} and women suffer from mental issues at {{approximately}} the same rate, they don’t experience the same disorders. Typically women suffer from mood and anxiety disorders, whereas men {{are more likely to have}} issues regarding substance abuse and <b>antisocial</b> <b>personalities.</b> Compared to men, women are significantly more likely to seek professional help for their psychiatric problems, however only one-fourth of them follow through and receive treatment. Currently, there is scarce research on female psychological development and psychological health, as well as the effects of the diagnosis and treatment. This makes it difficult to treat women due to issues such as appropriate doses of drugs. In addition many women have multiple illnesses at once, such as substance abuse, trauma, and mental health issues, making it difficult to diagnose mental health issues alone. Treatment programs seek to provide women with community services that will help them with food, clothing, health care, and educational needs. It is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and tests}} two models of personality: the HEXACO model of personality, which {{is derived from}} the lexical tradition and which is rooted In "normal" psychology, and the 5 DPT model of personality, which is derived from a theoretical approach and which is rooted in clinical psychology. The HEXACO and 5 DPT models are compared In the prediction of <b>antisocial</b> and self-benefiting <b>personality</b> traits in a large-scale community sample study. Relative weight analyses show that HEXACO Honesty-Humility explains most of the variance in SRP-III Psychopathy, Egoism, and IPIP Pretentiousness, Immorality, and Machiavellianism. Additionally, Honesty-Humility is able to Increment the amount of variance explained by the 5 DPT scales in these <b>antisocial</b> and self-benefiting <b>personality</b> scales.

5000|$|Kanda has {{received}} mixed reactions for his appearances in manga, anime, {{and other media}} ever since his introduction. UK Anime Network's Kevin Leathers simply referred to him as [...] "the resident emo", a brooding character who might develop later in the series. Erkael from Manga News compared him with several other characters, such as Vegeta from Dragon Ball and Sasuke Uchiha from Naruto, based on their <b>antisocial</b> <b>personalities.</b> Sheena McNeil from Sequentialtart said that while she found the character's personality to be [...] "cold", she still found his design and his anti-Akuma weapon appealing. Despite finding issues with the anime adaptation of the series, Anime News Network's Casey Brienza commented that Kanda was a [...] "fan favorite" [...] character like Komui Lee, {{both of which have}} traits that appeal to the audience. Animation Insiders Kimberly Morales enjoyed the contrast between Kanda and Allen's different personalities. John Rose from The Fandom Post liked Kanda and Allen's partnership, considering it to be the greatest strength of the manga's second volume. Additionally, Kanda's constant clashes with Allen were praised by Richard Osborn from IGN due to how comical they were, contrasting with the series' dark plot. Similarly, Sandra Scholes from Active Anime found Kanda and Allen to be [...] "not the standard anime variety", comparing them more to characters from fantasy stories. Since his appearance in the manga's second volume, Kanda has made minor appearances in the series. His return in the tenth volume was praised by Erkael, as well as his battle against the antagonist Noah Skin Bolic.|$|R

50|$|In Nazi Germany, {{especially}} during World War II, psychiatrists {{and others in}} programmes such as Action T4 and Action 14f13 systematically deported, sterilised, interned and euthanised (killed) patients and prisoners who could be classed as mentally ill, feebleminded, psychopathic, criminally insane or just asocial. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, therefore, concepts of <b>antisocial</b> psychopathic <b>personalities</b> fell out of favour in Europe to some extent. At the same time, however, in America and other countries the concept became increasingly prominent, used to categorise allied soldiers as fit or unfit for duty or on return to society, or, conversely, in the more specific sinister sense of the term, as a way to explain the actions of Nazis.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{sleep and}} personality disorders consistently demonstrate a relation between personality disorders characterized by behavioral disinhibition and/or emotional dysregulation (traditionally termed cluster B personality disorders) and poor sleep. This finding {{is in line}} with previous studies associating insomnia with impulsive behavior, since this is a core characteristic of both <b>antisocial</b> and borderline <b>personality</b> disorder. The current study investigates a group (n = 112) of forensic psychiatric inpatients with <b>antisocial</b> or borderline <b>personality</b> disorder or traits thereof. Subjective sleep characteristics and impulsivity were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Sleep Diagnosis List, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, respectively. More than half of the patients (53. 6 %) report poor sleep quality and 22. 3 % appears to suffer from severe chronic insomnia. Both poor sleep quality and chronic insomnia are significantly associated with self-reported impulsivity, in particular with attentional impulsiveness. This association was not significantly influenced by comorbid disorders. Actively treating sleep problems in these patients may not only improve sleep quality, mental health, and physical well-being, but may also have impact on impulsivityrelated health risks by increasing self-control...|$|R
