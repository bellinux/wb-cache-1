40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that existing Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques have potential during the production phase {{in addition to}} their <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and for in-flight monitoring. Flaws occur during composite fabrication in industry, due to an imperfect process control and human errors. This decreases production efficiency and increases costs. In this paper, the monitoring of Lamb waves in unidirectional carbon fibre (UD-CFRP) prepreg material is demonstrated using both Fibre Bragg Gratings (FBG) s and piezolectric acoustic sensors, and that these SHM sensors may be used for flaw detection and production monitoring. The detection of Lamb waves in a one ply thick sheet of prepreg UD-CFRP material is demonstrated for an FBG sensor aligned with the carbon fibre orientation and bonded {{to the surface of the}} prepreg, Furthermore, the velocity of Lamb waves in prepreg UD-CFRP in different orientations is investigated.

In the test program such procedures, as a Salt Fog Cabinet ASTM B- 117 and Humidity Chamber ASTM D- 1748 {{were performed to}} evaluate the protection properties of inhibitor A to be applied primarily on airframes, armaments and mechanical parts. Inhibitor A, is a complex mixture of amine salts of aromatic sulfonic acids in the carrier, and volatile carboxylic acid salts as a vapor phase inhibitor. Inhibitor A possessed both contact and vapor phase inhibition properties. Inhibitor B, a polyethylene film extruded with VCI compound was specified in the test program. Inhibitor B {{is a mixture of}} amine carboxylates. This inhibitor was evaluated as a barrier material possessing VCI and desiccant properties. Specially designed climatic tests have been performed to assess protection properties of this inhibitor. Inhibitor C, containing triazoles, amines, carboxylic acids, salts and esters, was tested using the Battelle Flowing Mixed Gas test + ASTM- 1748. The Battelle Flowing Mixed Gas Test and ASTM- 1748 have been applied on the following metals: steel, aluminum, copper, gold, silver, solder, brass in order to simulate the effect of indoor environments on electronic components and materials.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of economic activities and increasing mobility {{of people on}} short, medium and long distance trips {{is an issue that}} requires attention in the transport industry. The need to address this demanding issue in a sustainable and economically efficient way is the core of general capacity challenge in railway industries. This informs the strategic objective of ensuring an efficient and competitive mode of transportation by many infrastructure managers including Swedish Transport Administration. An aspect of railway infrastructure management which is promising for the enhancement of existing infrastructure capacity is the improvement of maintenance process. The frequency of traffic interruption due to infrastructure failure, reduction of functional performance due to infrastructure degradation and length of track possession time are incidences limiting operational availability of railway infrastructure and capacity thereof. Achieving the goal of supporting the inherent capacity of existing railway infrastructure requires implementation of effective & efficient practices for large and small impact maintenance tasks. This research has addressed the above mentioned concerns by studying the opportunities which maintenance presents towards enhancing the capacity of existing railway infrastructure. Outsourcing aspect of maintenance organisation has been studied and a conceptual framework to facilitate the implementation of performance based maintenance contracting is proposed. This will enable the achievement of quantity and quality requirements of traffic performance. Furthermore a risk assessment procedure has been presented to identify bottlenecks restricting the capacity on any line and also for continuous improvement has been suggested. A model for planning and scheduling of tamping action has been presented. This will lead to reduced track possession time and minimum cost of intervention while geometry quality is kept at desirable level. Case studies on the above procedures and model have been presented to demonstrate their <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> improvement. The outcome of this study is development of effective maintenance principles that should serve as basis for maintenance improvement programme to support reliable and inherent capacity of existing railway network. This improvement covers organisational and technical performance, all enhancing the possibility to increase the capacity of railway network.

30|$|Maintenance {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} by industrial management {{as a significant}} influencing factor of plant performance. Effective plant maintenance can be realized by developing a proper maintenance strategy. However, selecting an appropriate maintenance strategy is difficult because maintenance is a non-repetitive task such as production activity. Maintenance also does not leave a consistent traceable record that {{can be referred to}} during the decision-making process. The involvement of tangible and intangible factors in the assessment process further increases the complexity of the decision-making process. The technique of preference order by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) {{is one of the most}} well-known decision-making methods and has been widely used by organizations to conduct effective decisions regarding maintenance issues. TOPSIS has also evolved by integrating different approaches such as the fuzzy concept. Although numerous TOPSIS <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> decision making have been published, the effectiveness of crisp TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS needs to be investigated further. This paper attempts to present a comparison between conventional crisp TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS from a group maintenance decision-making perspective by an empirical illustration. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to demonstrate further the resilience of crisp TOPSIS and fuzzy TOPSIS.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring the {{lifecycle}} of a building, {{much more}} information is used and produced than can be contained inside a Building Information Model (BIM). The information outside the BIM is seldom connected to the BIM or connected across domains. Furthermore, information in BIM is only accessible to people with sufficient CAD or architectural background, and often expensive software is needed to edit and add data. This inefficient information management causes significant costs in practice. Our research contributes {{to the development of}} IFC based web applications in practice and demonstrates a way of linking machine to human readable data thus making the data accessible to non CAD users or architectural experts. In this paper we describe such a platform for the integration of model-based data and non-model based data. We tried to construct a mapping process from IFC properties to a national building element classification system, as a way of structuring the objects and information for use in our web platform. Since both the structure of IFC and most building element classification systems are based on semantic relations of building elements (i. e. holonym, meronym, hypernym), translations by means of a basic reasoning system should be feasible. We elaborate on several uses of this platform in <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintenance</b> and reuse of building materials, buildings and built structures...|$|R
