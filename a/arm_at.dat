5|$|German {{submarine}} U-36 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{which served}} during World War II. She {{was constructed in}} {{the earliest days of}} the U-boat <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> Kiel in 1936, and served in the pre-war Navy in the Baltic Sea and North Sea under Kapitänleutnant (Kptlt.) Klaus Ewerth. Korvettenkapitän (K.Kapt.)Wilhelm Fröhlich took command in October 1938 and continued in the role until the boat was lost.|$|E
5|$|In the manga series Pokémon Adventures, Team Rocket creates Mewtwo, {{but some}} of his DNA is placed inside of the Gym leader Blaine. Because of the DNA that they share, the two are unable to be {{separated}} for very long without becoming ill. Later, another Pokémon, Entei is able to break the bond between the two by removing the DNA in Blaine's <b>arm,</b> <b>at</b> which point Mewtwo leaves. It eventually helps the main character of the series, Red, fight against Team Rocket leader Giovanni and his Deoxys.|$|E
5|$|The French {{efforts to}} hide the frigate's mission and {{departure}} were initially successful: the British ships in the area were unaware of Thétiss intentions before she sailed. They were however prepared for any French movement and were launching regular patrols, in particular two ships {{under the command of}} captains Michael Seymour and Frederick Lewis Maitland, HMS Amethyst and HMS Emerald respectively. Both captains were experienced and veteran officers: Seymour had lost an <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the Glorious First of June 15 years earlier, and they had agreed to hunt together, communicating regularly and with an understanding that all prize money won would be shared equally across both crews. After several weeks sailing in tandem, the frigates separated in early November.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{went back}} to work for the WWF in 1992 and was given a new fan {{favorite}} character of an easygoing surfing Hawaiian who wore bright neon tights and utilized a new two-handed skull vice finisher called the Cranium Crunch. Crush made his televised debut in WWF under his new character on May 9, 1992 episode of Superstars, defeating Kato. Crush made his first pay-per-view appearance under the gimmick with a win over Repo Man at SummerSlam. Crush then engaged in a feud with Doink the Clown, after he was attacked with a loaded prosthetic arm while confronting the clown about his cruel pranks on children at ringside, which caused Crush to miss the 1993 Royal Rumble. The feud culminated at WrestleMania IX, where Crush lost after a second, identical Doink appeared from underneath the ring and struck Crush with the prosthetic <b>arm.</b> <b>At</b> the first King of the Ring pay-per-view, Crush challenged Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship, but lost the match after a distraction by Doink.|$|E
5|$|Nelson was {{a highly}} {{experienced}} officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in Corsica in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish ships of {{the line at the}} Battle of Cape St. Vincent in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at Gibraltar and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, HMS Vanguard, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at San Pietro Island off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.|$|E
5|$|Nor {{was this}} the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the Master of Sempill led the semi-official Sempill Mission to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy {{establish}} an air <b>arm.</b> <b>At</b> the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in {{limiting the number of}} aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the Blackburn Roc, Fairey Fulmar, Fairey Barracuda, Blackburn Skua and Fairey Swordfish. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Tourism {{is a major}} industry, {{estimated}} in 2001 to support around 23,000 people. Attractions include the coastal towns, part of the Exmoor National Park, the West Somerset Railway (a heritage railway), and the museum of the Fleet Air <b>Arm</b> <b>at</b> RNAS Yeovilton. The town of Glastonbury has mythical associations, including legends of a visit by the young Jesus of Nazareth and Joseph of Arimathea, with links to the Holy Grail, King Arthur, and Camelot, identified by some as Cadbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. Glastonbury also gives its name to an annual open-air rock festival held in nearby Pilton. There are show caves open to visitors in the Cheddar Gorge, {{as well as its}} locally produced cheese, although there is now only one remaining cheese maker in the village of Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|England captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had {{reputation}} for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set {{the pattern of the}} series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton {{had to deal with the}} contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.|$|E

25|$|On 31 August 1968, Garfield Sobers {{became the}} first man to hit six sixes off a single six-ball over in {{first-class}} cricket. The over was bowled by Malcolm Nash in Nottinghamshire's first innings against Glamorgan at St Helen's in Swansea. Nash was a seam bowler but decided to try his <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> spin bowling.

Lee, where he was both defeated and wounded in the <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on September 10.|$|E

25|$|The body rotates {{about its}} long axis with every arm stroke {{so that the}} {{shoulder}} of the recovering arm is higher than {{the shoulder of the}} pushing/pulling arm. This makes the recovery much easier and reduces the need to turn the head to breathe. As one shoulder is out of the water, it reduces drag, and as it falls it aids the arm catching the water; as the other shoulder rises it aids the <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> end of the push to leave the water.|$|E

25|$|Muralitharan's doosra was {{the subject}} of an {{official}} report by match referee Chris Broad during Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2004, for illegal bending of the <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the elbow during the bowling action. Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening the bent <b>arm</b> <b>at</b> the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: {{this is one of the}} ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn Mcgrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate were actually transgressing the rules. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the arm up to 15° (which was earlier 9° for spinners and 12° for seamers) and Muralitharan's doosra once again became a legal delivery.|$|E
