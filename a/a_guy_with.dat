500|$|The {{day before}} the All-Star Game, Giants' manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, {{announced}} his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about Kemp, [...] "He's <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> speed, power, a guy that can beat you with a base hit or a long ball. He's {{what you call a}} complete player – tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous." [...] Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.|$|E
500|$|Michael J. Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, Nelson said, [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> a big ugly face...And he is a terribly bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work. Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E
500|$|For Deadpool's scarred appearance, Miller {{wanted him}} to appear [...] "fucking horrible" [...] to justify his anger in the film, while makeup {{designer}} Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics [...] "he’s everything from a rotten corpse to <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> a couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as disfigured but also {{wanted him to}} be [...] "still kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons to Freddy Krueger, and looked to Sin City for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply the full-body makeup to Reynolds. Corso described the makeup {{for the rest of the}} film's characters as [...] "pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded." ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} acclaim from critics. [...] James Montgomery of MTV News {{said of the}} song, [...] "there {{are moments}} on Stairs that stop you dead in your tracks, send shivers up your spine and make you go 'Whoa'... like the first four-and-a-half minutes of 'I Will Possess Your Heart,' a propulsive whirl of stalking bass line, spindly guitars and stabbing piano." [...] Will Hermes noted in Rolling Stone that the sense of menace in the song was [...] "playing against type for <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> one of rock's purest voices—a vibrato-less, bell-clear high tenor whose choirboy quality only throws the darkness here into relief." [...] Blender Jonah Weiner concurred, stating [...] "it's a pleasant surprise to hear Gibbard inhabit such a self-consciously creepy role, rather than play the occasionally errant, essentially good-hearted boyfriend who soft-shoes through {{so many of his}} tales." [...] In 2011, Tyler Kane of Paste included the song in a list of [...] "the 25 creepiest songs about love".|$|E
500|$|... "Boys" [...] is a {{song that}} {{combines}} R with hip hop. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, it {{is set in the}} time signature of common time and has a tempo of 108 beats per minute. While the original Britney version features Spears solely, [...] "The Co-ed Remix" [...] which was released as a single, sees the singer and the song's co-producer, rapper Pharrell Williams trading lines. The remix version of the track contains a slower tempo then that of the original. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Williams and Spears put on a [...] "rap-lite teen-pop tease." [...] The song also includes influences of funk music. During the time of the album's release, her official site stated that the song had aspects of 70's soul music and influences of Prince's music. According to Alex Needham of NME, the track takes influence from Janet Jackson. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said the song was [...] "cut-rate '80s Janet Jackson." [...] Lyrical content sees Spears eying <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> an intent to [...] "get nasty." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Fascinated" [...] {{was released on}} October 25, 2011 via Nettwerk's official YouTube channel. The visual was directed by Schlesinger's close friend Adam Neustadter, who helped in creating a [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "vaguely disorienting clip" [...] for the band. The video begins with Durand peering below a camera as flashing stills of a faceless man playing the keyboards appear. Three dancers, including a mime, a woman with sunglasses, and a ballerina, perform various choreography as the visual gradually zooms {{in and out of}} focus, achieving a 3D effect. As the first verse continues, Chase and Schlesinger are shown playing their respective instruments behind Durand, who sings the song's lyrics into a microphone. A similar process is carried out {{for the rest of the}} clip, and concludes by displaying the faceless individual using the keyboard. Commenting on the project's final result, Schlesinger insisted that it successfully matches the song's [...] "synth-pop vibe" [...] through the use of [...] "robot dancing, some vintage synths, and <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> no face".|$|E
5000|$|On December 21, 2012, Wayne LaPierre, {{executive}} vice president of the National Rifle Association (NRA), expressed the gun-rights group's sympathy for the families of Newtown.

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Bob Ringwood {{turned down}} {{the chance to work}} on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because [...] "the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> average build", he stated. [...] "The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature." [...] Burton commented, [...] "Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage". Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.|$|E
500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> a great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> a penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E
