2500|$|Europeans {{have long}} {{regarded}} kangaroos as strange animals. Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers), stood upright like men, <b>and</b> <b>hopped</b> like frogs. Combined with the two-headed {{appearance of a}} mother kangaroo, this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers' tales for quite some time. The first kangaroo to be exhibited {{in the western world}} was an example shot by John Gore, an officer on Captain Cook's Endeavour in 1770. The animal was shot and its skin and skull transported back to England whereupon it was stuffed (by taxidermists who had never seen the animal before) and displayed to the general public as a curiosity. [...] The first glimpse of a kangaroo for many 18th-century Britons was a painting by George Stubbs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{family moved}} to Hall County in the Texas Panhandle in 1913, and in 1919 they bought a farm between the towns of Lakeview and Turkey. At the age of 16, Wills left the family <b>and</b> <b>hopped</b> a freight train. [...] "Jim Rob", as he became known, drifted for several years, {{traveling}} {{from town to town}} to try to earn a living, at one point almost losing his life when he nearly fell from a moving train, and later being chased by railroad police. In his 20s he attended barber school, got married, and moved first to Roy, New Mexico, then returned to Turkey in Hall County (now considered his home town) to work as a barber at Hamm's Barber Shop. He alternated barbering and fiddling even when he moved to Fort Worth after leaving Hall County in 1929. There he played in minstrel and medicine shows, and, as with other Texas musicians such as Ocie Stockard, continued to earn money as a barber. He wore blackface makeup to appear in comedy routines, something that was common at the time. [...] "He was playing his violin and singing." [...] There were two guitars and a banjo player with him. [...] "Bob was in blackface and was the comic; he cracked jokes, sang, and did an amazing jig dance." [...] Since there was already a [...] "Jim" [...] on the show, the manager began calling him [...] "Bob". However, it was as [...] "Jim Rob Wills", paired with Herman Arnspiger, that he made his first commercial (though unissued) recordings in November 1929 for Brunswick/Vocalion.|$|E

40|$|Electron {{scattering}} by {{a single}} or multiple impurities affects the quantizaton of conductance of a semiconductor nanochannel. The theoretical model of electron transport in a hardwall nanostructure with an impurity requires {{an analysis of the}} electronic transverse energy levels, eigenfunctions <b>and</b> <b>hopping</b> integrals resulting from cross channel or transverse confinement. Theoretical equations for the electronic transverse energy levels, wavefunctions <b>and</b> <b>hopping</b> integrals {{in the case of a}} repulsive, finite strength rectangular barrier arbitrarily positioned in the nanochannel are presented. The effects of size, strength and location of the impurity are discussed. In order to find the electronic transverse energy levels, wavefunctions <b>and</b> <b>hopping</b> integrals, two FORTRAN computer programs were developed. The first, called Program Data Input, writes the computational parameters to a data file. The second, Program Single Impurity, uses this data file in performing the calculations of the electronic transverse energy levels, eigenfunctions <b>and</b> <b>hopping</b> integrals.
