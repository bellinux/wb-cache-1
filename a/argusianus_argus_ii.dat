40|$|PurposeThe <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc, Sylmar, CA) was {{developed}} to restore some vision to patients blind {{as a result of}} retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or outer retinal degeneration. A clinical trial was initiated in 2006 to study the long-term safety and efficacy of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> System in patients with bare or no light perception resulting from end-stage RP. DesignProspective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial. Within-patient controls included the nonimplanted fellow eye and patients' native residual vision compared with their vision with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II.</b> ParticipantsThirty participants in 10 centers in the United States and Europe. MethodsThe worse-seeing eye of blind patients was implanted with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II.</b> Patients wore glasses mounted with a small camera and a video processor that converted images into stimulation patterns sent to the electrode array on the retina. Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measures were safety (the number, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events) and visual function, as measured by 3 computer-based, objective tests. Secondary measures included functional vision performance on objectively scored real-world tasks. ResultsTwenty-four of 30 patients remained implanted with functioning <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Systems at 5 years after implantation. Only 1 additional serious adverse event was experienced after the 3 -year time point. Patients performed significantly better with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> on than off on all visual function tests and functional vision tasks. ConclusionsThe 5 -year results of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> trial support the long-term safety profile and benefit of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> System for patients blind as a result of RP. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> is the first and only retinal implant to have market approval in the European Economic Area, the United States, and Canada...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> {{received}} {{approval for}} commercial {{use in the}} European Union in March 2011. [...] In February 2013, the FDA approved the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> under a humanitarian device exemption, authorizing its use for up to 4,000 people in the US per year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> was {{initially}} available at {{a limited number}} of clinics in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, at an EU market price of US$115,000. When the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> launched in the United States in February 2013, Second Sight announced that it would be priced at around $150,000, excluding the cost of surgery and usage training. In August 2013, Second Sight announced that reimbursement payments had been approved for the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> for blind Medicare recipients in the United States.|$|R

40|$|PurposeRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a {{group of}} {{inherited}} retinal degenerations leading to blindness due to photoreceptor loss. Retinitis pigmentosa is a rare disease, affecting only approximately 100 000 people in the United States. There is no cure and no approved medical therapy to slow or reverse RP. The purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety, reliability, and benefit of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc, Sylmar, CA) in restoring some visual function to subjects completely blind from RP. We report clinical trial results at 1 and 3 years after implantation. DesignThe study is a multicenter, single-arm, prospective clinical trial. ParticipantsThere were 30 subjects in 10 centers in the United States and Europe. Subjects served as their own controls, that is, implanted eye versus fellow eye, and system on versus system off (native residual vision). MethodsThe <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> System was implanted on and in a single eye (typically the worse-seeing eye) of blind subjects. Subjects wore glasses mounted with a small camera and a video processor that converted images into stimulation patterns sent to the electrode array on the retina. Main Outcome MeasuresThe primary outcome measures were safety (the number, seriousness, and relatedness of adverse events) and visual function, as measured by 3 computer-based, objective tests. ResultsA total of 29 of 30 subjects had functioning <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Systems implants 3 years after implantation. Eleven subjects experienced a total of 23 serious device- or surgery-related adverse events. All were treated with standard ophthalmic care. As a group, subjects performed significantly better with the system on than off on all visual function tests and functional vision assessments. ConclusionsThe 3 -year results of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> trial support the long-term safety profile and benefit of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> System for patients blind from RP. Earlier results from this trial were used to gain approval of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> by the Food and Drug Administration and a CE mark in Europe. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> System is the first and only retinal implant to have both approvals...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a coccidian parasite, Cryptosporidium, among {{birds in the}} Kuala Lumpur National Zoo was investigated in this study. A hundred bird fecal samples were taken from various locations of the zoo. Fecal smears prepared using direct smear and formalin ethyl acetate concentration technique were stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Samples positive for Cryptosporidium with Ziehl-Neelsen stain were later confirmed using the immunofluorescence technique and viewed under the epifluorescence microscope. Six species of bird feces were confirmed positive with Cryptosporidium oocysts. They included Wrinkled Hornbill (Aceros corrugatus), Great <b>Argus</b> Pheasant (<b>Argusianus</b> <b>argus),</b> Black Swan (Cygnus atratus), Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Marabou Stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), and Moluccan Cockatoo (Cacatua moluccencis). These birds were located in the aviary and lake, with the Moluccan Cockatoo routinely used as a show bird. Results obtained in this study indicated that animal sanctuaries like zoos and bird parks are important sources of Cryptosporidium infection to humans, especially children and other animals...|$|R

50|$|Argus retinal prosthesis, {{also known}} as a bionic eye, is an {{electronic}} retinal implant manufactured by the American company Second Sight Medical Products. It is used as a visual prosthesis to improve the vision of people with severe cases of retinitis pigmentosa. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> version of the system was approved for marketing in the European Union in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a humanitarian device exemption. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device.|$|R
50|$|Working in {{partnership}} with University Hospitals’ Eye Institute’s Center for Retina and Macular Disease and its director, Suber Huang, MD, the Cleveland Sight Center will help treat patients who receive the first FDA approved retina implant, the <b>Argus</b> <b>II.</b> The implant works like a wireless device to transmit images through glasses to the implant, actually allowing patients to see. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> is only effective with the nearly 100,000 people in the US suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease. Ann Arbor, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Durham, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia and San Francisco are also US cities approved for the device.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} real-life {{experience}} with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> retinal prosthesis system in blind patients with end-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or choroideremia (CHM), focusing on the pivotal role of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in both preoperative and postoperative management. Methods: This hospital-based case series included 3 blind patients who were uneventfully implanted with <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> epiretinal device. These patients (2 with RP and 1 with CHM) were selected during the ArgusTM II Retinal Prosthesis System PostMarket Surveillance Study Protocol. Complete screening procedures had involved 66 eyes of 33 patients afferent to the Center for Retinitis Pigmentosa of the Veneto Region. Results: Preoperative OCT examination resulted in the exclusion of 8 eyes in 4 patients with bilateral posterior staphyloma diagnosing unexpected staphylomatous macular patterns in 2 patients with RP and no sign of pathologic myopia. Postoperative OCT study of <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> proximity to retinal surface indicated a plausible correlation between electrode-retina distance and perceptual threshold in 2 of our 3 patients. In particular, during the first 6 months of follow-up, the patient with the closest contact between device and macula showed a continuous vision-related improvement {{in the performance of}} several real-life tasks. Conclusions: The present findings illustrate the modalities by which each different OCT examination is an essential tool to optimize safety and efficacy profiles during <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> protocol. Optical coherence tomography will be crucial for future investigative approaches on patient selection criteria and next-generation implant design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{position}} paper {{based on the}} collective experiences of <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Retinal Prosthesis System investigators to review strategies to optimize outcomes in patients with retinitis pigmentosa undergoing retinal prosthesis implantation. Methods Retinal surgeons, device programmers, and rehabilitation specialists from Europe, Canada, Middle East, and the United States were convened to the first international <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Investigator Meeting held in Ann Arbor, MI in March 2015. The recommendations from the collective experiences were collected. Factors associated with successful outcomes were determined. Results Factors leading to successful outcomes begin with appropriate patient selection, expectation counseling, and preoperative retinal assessment. Challenges to surgical implantation include presence of staphyloma and inadequate Tenon’s capsule or conjunctiva. Modified surgical technique may reduce risks of complications such as hypotony and conjunctival erosion. Rehabilitation efforts and correlation with validated outcome measures following implantation are critical. Conclusions Bringing together <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> investigators allowed the identification of strategies to optimize patient outcomes. Establishing an on-line collaborative network will foster coordinated research efforts to advance outcome assessment and rehabilitation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{prosthesis}} technologies {{require that}} the visual system downstream of the retinal circuitry be capable of transmitting and elaborating visual signals. We studied the capability of plastic remodeling in late blind subjects implanted with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Retinal Prosthesis with psychophysics and functional MRI (fMRI). After surgery, six out of seven retinitis pigmentosa (RP) blind subjects were able to detect high-contrast stimuli using the prosthetic implant. However, direction discrimination to contrast modulated stimuli remained at chance level in all of them. No subject showed any improvement of contrast sensitivity in either eye when not using the <b>Argus</b> <b>II.</b> Before the implant, the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity in V 1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was very weak or absent. Surprisingly, after prolonged use of <b>Argus</b> <b>II,</b> BOLD responses to visual input were enhanced. This is, to our knowledge, the first study tracking the neural changes of visual areas in patients after retinal implant, revealing a capacity to respond to restored visual input even after years of deprivation...|$|R

There were eight activities of Great Argus Pheasant at their mating ring which divided into individual and pairmate activities. The individual activities of male included clearing, walking, vigilance, feeding, grooming, resting, and calling. While  female activities included resting, grooming, and walking. Activity with pairmate was dancing where male performed dancing only in the present of  female. Male spent 26 times longer than females appeared at the mating ring.

40|$|Many forest Galliformes are secretive and {{difficult}} to survey, so we assessed the potential use of camera traps in the study galliform species at Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Lampung, Indonesia. We used CAM-TRACKER © camera trap data from one intensively surveyed study area and 10 sample plots located throughout the park. Camera traps were able to detect five species of pheasants and one partridge. The Sumatran peacock pheasant Polyplectron chalcurum and Salvadori’s pheasant Lophura inornata were restricted to forests with open understorey at higher elevations in the park, whereas great <b>argus</b> pheasants <b>Argusianus</b> <b>argus</b> were widespread in lowland areas having streams, open understorey and low human disturbance. In the study area, using great argus pheasant as an example, 29 % of the deployed cameras were able to detect the species. The analysis program CAPTURE was used to fit various models including Mh; the detection probability was then estimated. In addition, the data also demonstrated that great argus pheasant reached the peak of activity at approximately one hour after sunrise. The application of camera traps seems promising {{for the study of}} several aspects of the biology of elusive Galliformes...|$|R
50|$|The tragopans (Tragopan), mikado {{pheasant}} (Syrmaticus mikado), and {{several species of}} grouse and ptarmigan are exceptional in their largely vegetarian and arboreal foraging habitats; grouse are especially notable {{for being able to}} feed on plants rich in terpenes and quinones - such as sagebrush or conifers -, which are often avoided by other herbivores. Many species of moderate altitudes—for example the long-tailed pheasants of the genus Syrmaticus—also find a great deal of their daily nutritional requirements in the tree canopies, especially during the snowy and rainy periods when foraging on the ground is dangerous and less than fruitful for a variety of reasons. Although members of the genus Syrmaticus are capable of subsisting almost entirely on vegetarian materials for months at a time, this is not true for many of the subtropical genera. For example, the great <b>argus</b> (<b>Argusianus</b> <b>argus)</b> and crested argus may do most of their foraging during rainy months in the canopy of the jungle, as well. There they are known to forage on slugs, snails, ants, and amphibians to the exclusion of plant material. How they forage in the forest canopy during the rainy months is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Several {{different}} approaches for restoring sight in subjects {{who are blind}} due to outer retinal degeneration are currently under investigation, including stem cell therapy, gene therapy, and visual prostheses. Although {{many different types of}} visual prostheses have shown promise, to date, the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> Epiretinal Prosthesis System, developed in a clinical setting over the course of 10 years, is the world’s first and only retinal prosthesis that has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been given the CE-Mark for sale within the European Economic Area (EEA). The incidence of serious adverse events from <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> implantation decreased over time after minor changes in the implant design and improvements in the surgical steps used for the procedure had been made. In order to further decrease the scleral incision-related complications and enhance the assessment of the tack position and the contact between the array and the inner macular surface, we used an ophthalmic endoscope during the regular course of <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> implantation surgery in 2 patients with late-stage retinitis pigmentosa in an attempt to improve the anatomical and functional outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Human {{adults with}} normal vision can combine visual {{landmark}} and non-visual self-motion cues {{to improve their}} navigational precision. Here we asked whether blind individuals treated with a retinal prosthesis could also benefit from using the resultant new visual signal together with non-visual information when navigating. Four patients (blind for 15 - 52 years) implanted with the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> retinal prosthesis (Second Sight Medical Products Inc. Sylmar, CA), and five age-matched and six younger controls, participated. Participants completed a path reproduction and a triangle completion navigation task, using either an indirect visual landmark and non-visual self-motion cues or non-visual self-motion cues only. Control participants wore goggles that approximated {{the field of view}} and the resolution of the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> prosthesis. In both tasks, control participants showed better precision when navigating with reduced vision, compared to without vision. Patients, however, did not show similar improvements when navigating with the prosthesis in the path reproduction task, but two patients did show improvements in the triangle completion task. Additionally, all patients showed greater precision than controls in both tasks when navigating without vision. These results indicate that the <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> retinal prosthesis may not provide sufficiently reliable visual information to improve the precision of patients on tasks, for which they have learnt to rely on non-visual senses...|$|R

40|$|Retinal prostheses, which restore partial {{vision to}} {{patients}} blinded by outer retinal degen-eration, {{are currently in}} clinical trial. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> retinal prosthesis system was recently awarded CE approval for commercial use in Europe. While retinal prosthesis users have achieved remarkable visual improvement {{to the point of}} reading letters and short sen-tences, the reading process is still fairly cumbersome. This study investigates the possibility of using an epiretinal prosthesis to stimulate visual braille as a sensory substitution for read-ing written letters and words. The <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> retinal prosthesis system, used in this study, includes a 10 × 6 electrode array implanted epiretinally, a tiny video camera mounted on a pair of glasses, and a wearable computer that processes the video and determines the stimulation current of each electrode in real time. In the braille reading system, individual letters are created by a subset of dots from a 3 by 2 array of six dots. For the visual braille experiment, a grid of six electrodes was chosen out of the 10 × 6 <b>Argus</b> <b>II</b> array. Groups of these electrodes were then directly stimulated (bypassing the camera) to create visual per-cepts of individual braille letters. Experiments were performed in a single subject.

40|$|Further {{comparison}} of mitochondrial control-region DNA base sequences of 16 avian species {{belonging to the}} subfamily Phasianinae revealed the following: (i) Generalized perdicine birds (quails and partridges) are of ancient lineages. Even the closest pair, the common quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the Chinese bamboo partridge (Bambusicola thoracica), maintained only 85. 71 % identity. (ii) The 12 species of phasianine birds previously and presently studied belonged to three distinct branches. The first branch was made exclusively {{of members of the}} genus Gallus, while the second branch was made of pheasants of the genera Phasianus, Chrysolophus, and Syrmaticus. Gallopheasants of the genus Lophura were distant cousins to these pheasants. The great <b>argus</b> (<b>Argusianus</b> <b>argus)</b> and peafowls of the genus Pavo constituted the third branch. The position of peacock-pheasants of the genus Polyplectron in the third branch was {{similar to that of the}} genus Lophura in the second branch. Members of the fourth phasianine branch, such as tragopans and monals, were not included in the present study. (iii) The one perdicine species, Bambusicola thoracica, was more closely related to phasianine genera Gallus and Pavo than to members of other perdicine genera. The above might indicate that Bambusicola belong to one-stem perdicine lineage that later splits into two sublineages that yielded phasianine birds, one evolving to Gallus, and the other differentiating toward Pavo and its allies...|$|R

Subjects were tested on the three real-world functional vision tasks: Sock Sorting, Sidewalk Tracking and Walking Direction Discrimination task MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For the Sock Sorting task, percentage correct was computed based on how accurately subjects sorted the piles on a cloth-covered table and on a bare table. In the Sidewalk Tracking task, an 'out of bounds' count was recorded, signifying how often the subject veered away from the test course. During the Walking Direction Discrimination task, subjects were tested on the number of times they correctly identified the direction of testers walking across their field of view. The mean percentage correct OFF versus ON for the Sock Sorting task was found to be significantly different for both testing conditions (t-test, P[*]<[*] 0. 01). On the Sidewalk Tracking task, subjects performed significantly better with the system ON than they did with the system OFF (t-test, P[*]<[*] 0. 05).
