5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building in the middle of <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|The Medico of Painted Springs (also {{known as}} Doctor's Alibi) is a 1941 American western film {{produced}} by Columbia Pictures. Based {{on the novel}} {{of the same name}} by James Lyon Rubel, the film stars Charles Starrett, Terry Walker, Ben Taggart, Wheeler Oakman, and the Simp-Phonies in a cameo appearance. It was directed by Lambert Hillyer and written by Wyndham Gittens and Winston Miller.

5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale which was still blowing.|$|E

5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a beehive, only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
5|$|In León {{near where}} it moved ashore in Nicaragua, {{the passage of}} Alma left the city without power. Several {{buildings}} were destroyed in the city, and some roads were damaged. Much of the departments of León and Chinandega experienced power outages, due to the strong winds. One person died from electrocution, due to a downed high-tension cable, and another person died in a similar manner. Offshore, one person drowned when he rode out the storm in his boat. In Tegucigalpa, TACA Flight 390 skidded off a runway sodden by torrential rain, killing three passengers (plus two more on the ground) and injuring over eighty. One other fatality was reported in Honduras when a young girl was swept away in <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> stream.|$|E

An example of necessity would be a defense against <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only {{if there is no}} other way of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E

With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace.

As it was 25 July, the Festivity of St. James, Patrón de España, Bazán harangued his troops {{by pointing out that}} it was impossible for the Spanish to lose a battle on this particular day.

Charles V {{turned his attention to}} fighting the Ottomans, but could not launch large forces in Hungary due to <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> conflict with the German princes of the Schmalkaldic League.

The journal of Henry Williams provides an extensive account of this expedition, which can be described as an incident in the so-called Musket Wars. In this expedition Mango and Kakaha were successful in fights on the Mercury Islands and Tauranga, with the muru lasted until late July 1832. When Williams sailed back to Paihia from Tauranga the boat was caught in <b>a</b> <b>raging</b> sea. Williams took command {{out of the hands of}} the captain and saved the ship. By 1844 the conversion of Ngāpuhi chiefs to Christianity contributed to a significant reduction in the number of incidents of intertribal warfare in the north.|$|E
