Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. Status updates combine the <b>affordances</b> of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you doing right now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} game's accessibility. Calixto of Kill Screen said that Videoball countered {{a trend in}} games culture that relied on {{learning}} professional strategies online in order to play competitively. He cited the <b>affordances</b> for experimentation in the game's controls and saw Videoball as being primarily concerned with awakening [...] "its own brand of DIY metagaming", hence the reviewer's interest in naming his own techniques. Calixto further praised the game for resisting the standardization of one correct way to play with its variety of game fields. While Rowen (Destructoid) doubted that Videoball would be the future of eSports, he concluded that the game made for good local multiplayer fun, and vastly preferred the experience of local to online multiplayer. He compared the title to Super Bomberman in how quickly the game escalates from a friendly match to cut-throat competition.|$|E

When Gibson's primary area of research, <b>affordances,</b> is referenced, the citations typically refer only to James Gibson.

However, unlike Gibson, researchers have studied <b>affordances</b> in all age groups, including adults. <b>Affordances</b> have been applied {{to a range of}} innovative topics, from automobile driving to text messaging. However, the concept of <b>affordances</b> is usually used in isolation rather than being integrated into Gibson's ecological framework. Some researchers are even attempting to create their own theories of <b>affordances</b> instead of revising Gibson's theory to accommodate new findings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{reaction}} to Norman’s (1999) essay on misuse {{of the term}} <b>affordance</b> in human-computer interaction literature, this article is a concept paper affirming {{the importance of this}} powerful concept, reinforcing Norman’s distinctions of terminology, and expanding on the usefulness of the concepts in terms of their application to interaction design and evaluation. We define and use four complementary types of <b>affordance</b> in the context of interaction design and evaluation: cognitive <b>affordance,</b> physical <b>affordance,</b> sensory <b>affordance,</b> and functional <b>affordance.</b> The terms cognitive <b>affordance</b> (Norman’s perceived <b>affordance)</b> and physical <b>affordance</b> (Norman’s real <b>affordance)</b> refer to parallel and equally important usability concepts for interaction design, to which sensory <b>affordance</b> plays a supporting role. We argue that the concept of physical <b>affordance</b> carries a mandatory component of utility or purposeful action (functional <b>affordance).</b> Finally, we provide guidelines to help designers think about how these four kinds of <b>affordance</b> work together naturally in contextualized HCI design or evaluation. 1...|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{question is the}} relationship between <b>affordances</b> and mental representations as set forth in a more cognitivist perspective. While Greeno (1998) argues that attunements to <b>affordances</b> are superior to constructs such as schemata and mental models, Glenberg & Robertson (1999) suggested that <b>affordances</b> are the building blocks of mental models.|$|E

50|$|According to James J. Gibson, {{a founder}} of {{ecological}} psychology, humans perceive their environment in terms of <b>affordances.</b> Different animals and objects afford different actions. These <b>affordances</b> are context-dependent. For instance, the same trait may afford both costs and benefits depending on the bearer, the social and environmental contexts, and the relative <b>affordances</b> or vulnerabilities of the perceiver. Although <b>affordances</b> are relative, they are invariant given the same context and provide strong selective pressure for adaptations to recognize and functionally respond to both threats and opportunities.

In this work, we build on an iterative approach that learns a convolutional neural network for <b>affordance</b> segmentation from sparse keypoints.

40|$|Abstract: Recent years, Gibson's <b>affordance</b> {{concept has}} drawn many attentions {{in the field}} of human-computer {{interface}} and product design. However, the development of <b>affordance</b> concept in design practice is by far not yet matured, and the differentiation between <b>affordance</b> and symbolic meaning of designed artifacts is not clear. As a result, that wrongly exercising the techniques of “Product Semantics ” while implementation of <b>affordance</b> concept is meant is often found in design field. Such confusion not only can hinder the development of ecological approach in design research, but also limit the potential application of <b>affordance</b> concept as well. In this study, a literature survey was conducted to briefly review the development of <b>affordance</b> concept in design fields; and then a comparison was made to clarify advocacy as well as arguments proclaimed by these two popular concepts in product design, which were originally rooted from different theoretical background. At the end, directions for the application of <b>affordance</b> concept in product design or interface design were also pointed out...|$|R

50|$|His {{research}} on predator-prey interactions between ground squirrels and rattlesnakes {{led to the}} formulation of a new theoretical perspective on communication called assessment/management view of communication. From this perspective, communication {{is dependent on the}} sensory and action systems of the individuals engaged in communication. Information is not sent or received by individuals but rather it is extracted from what others are doing and their context (i.e., Gibsonian <b>affordances).</b> The extracted information is then assessed and acted upon. What <b>affordances</b> an individual extracts and assesses depend on its sensory systems and, more generally, on the nature of its umwelt (i.e., an animal's sensory-actions systems). Because communication requires the extraction of information from <b>affordances</b> presented to individuals, this creates the opportunity to manipulate or manage the behavior of others by controlling the <b>affordances</b> they perceive. For example, ground squirrels have evolved the ability to shunt blood to their tails, which heats their tails up. They can then tail-flag at rattlesnakes, which can perceive their hot tails in the infrared. Communication is thus an inter-individual process of extracting and assessing information from <b>affordances</b> and actively managing the <b>affordances</b> perceived by others and thereby managing their behavior. In this view, communication is self-interested behavior, shaped by natural selection.|$|E

40|$|What does {{a bottle}} on our table {{invites us to}} do? In the last 10 - 15 years within {{cognitive}} science and robotics the study of <b>affordance</b> has {{become more and more}} widespread. The majority of the studies, however, has focused on simple actions elicited by objects, such as reaching and grasping, and has considered only the physical environment in which the objects and the organisms are embedded, without taking into account the social context. Here we intend to focus on two aspects in which social aspects are involved in detection of <b>affordance.</b> First, the <b>affordance</b> are the product of social and conventional relationship. We respond to bottles in a given way because the <b>affordance</b> have a given conventionalized meaning we have acquired living in a given society. Current studies have not sufficiently taken into account this very simple fact, crucial for a comprehensive view of <b>affordance.</b> Second, <b>affordance</b> are modulated by the current social relationship in which the organisms responding to them are involved. The way we grasp objects might differ depending on the presence of other people. In addition, we will discuss how <b>affordance</b> might vary depending on the kind of actions we intend to perform with others, for example offering or receiving something. We foresee the analysis of the way <b>affordance</b> are modulated by social and conventional aspect will represent {{an important part of the}} study on this topic in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Gibson’s {{notion of}} <b>affordance</b> seems to attract roboticists’ attention. On a phenomenological level, it allows functions, which have “somehow ” been implemented, to be {{described}} using a new terminology. However, {{that does not mean}} that the <b>affordance</b> notion is of help for building robots and their controllers. This paper explores viewing an <b>affordance</b> as an abstraction from a robot-environment relation that is of inter-individual use, but requires an individual implementation. Therefore, the notion of <b>affordance</b> helps share environment representations and theories among robots. Examples are given for navigability, as afforded by environments of different types to robots of different undercarriages and sensor configurations. ...|$|R

50|$|The term {{affordance}} {{is first}} used in human-computer interaction in the 1980s by Norman {{with the term}} perceived affordance. Relevant publications were: Gaver‘s seminal articles on technology affordance in 1991, <b>affordances</b> of media spaces in 1992, <b>affordances</b> for interaction, and then Bradner‘s notion of social affordance, where social <b>affordances</b> are action possibilities for social behavior.Social affordance is at first used in Computer Supported Collaboration Learning experiments. Computer support collaboration learning applications and users’ interactions are the major issue in social affordance. Social <b>affordances</b> are properties of Computer Supported Collaboration Learning environments which act as social-contextual facilitators relevant for the learner’s social interactions. This term afterwards applies to other human-computer interactions including human cognition responses, visual perceptions and it also refers to the ecological relationship between human and computers.|$|E
5000|$|Gibson {{argues that}} {{learning}} to perceive an affordance {{is an essential}} part of socialization. The theory of <b>affordances</b> introduces a [...] "value-rich ecological object". <b>Affordances</b> cannot be described within the value-neutral language of physics, but rather introduces notions of benefits and injuries to someone. An affordance captures this beneficial/injurious aspect of objects and relates them to the animal for whom they are well/ill-suited. During childhood development, a child learns to perceive not only the <b>affordances</b> for the self, but also how those same objects furnish similar <b>affordances</b> to another. A child can be introduced to the conventional meaning of an object by manipulating which objects command attention and demonstrating how to use the object through performing its central function By learning how to use an artifact, a child “enters into the shared practices of society” as when they learn to use a toilet or brush their teeth. And so, by learning the <b>affordances,</b> or conventional meaning of an artifact, children learn the artifact's social world and further, become a member of that world.|$|E

3000|$|... “Cognitive, Physical, sensory and Functional Affordances” is {{the title}} of an {{influential}} position paper by Hartson [38], which expands the <b>affordance</b> theories of Gibson, Norman, and Gaver {{for the design of}} human–computer interfaces (HCI). Given the issue of interface is crucial to immersive environments, and that Hartson’s agenda is to clarify the practical utility of the theory, his use of <b>affordance</b> theory would appear useful. Hartson’s adaption for HCI develops four types of affordance—cognitive, physical, functional, and sensory. The first three are reasonably self-evident in terms of the practical requirements of HCI design: clearly the hardware and software interfaces should be physically ergonomic; be as easy to comprehend as possible; and provide functions relevant to the end user. However, the identification of sensory <b>affordance</b> as a distinct type requires some discussion. Hartson clarifies that the use of ‘perception’ is problematic in that it typically requires significant cognition. Hence where previous theories of <b>affordance</b> used perception to describe intuitive engagement with artefacts, Hartson uses the term ‘sensing’. The intent of identifying sensory as a distinct aspect of his <b>affordance</b> model is to remove ambiguity, to locate sensing as a significant contributor to human interaction, where vision, hearing and touch supports cognition and physical <b>affordance</b> to enable appropriate functional responses. We note however that in Hartson’s framework, while sensing has acquired an individual status it is still in a supporting role in relation to cognitive and physical <b>affordance.</b> From a HCI design perspective the articulation of the four <b>affordance</b> types are strategic, to enable clarity for the designer and to enable a comprehensive evaluation of interface development. We suggest the enhanced multi-sensory sensory experience available through immersion in VR, enables a potential shift in Hartson’s hierarchy, to elevate the role of sensing beyond a supporting role. When considering the further development of <b>affordance</b> theory, research into how the sensory <b>affordance</b> of VR can be exploited to advantage for the field of immersive analytics, would appear a significant opportunity.|$|R

The present thesis aimed to better understand the mechanisms underlying this paired-object <b>affordance</b> effect. Chapters 2 and 3 showed that different but interacting parieto-frontal networks contribute to the effects of paired-object <b>affordance</b> in healthy participants. Chapters 4 and 5 explored the effects of paired-object <b>affordance</b> on visual extinction; the data showed that recovery from extinction was sensitive to the familiarity of the object pair and the completeness of the active object rather than the passive object within an interacting pair. Finally, the role of contextual information and task demands on the automatic perception of paired-object <b>affordance</b> effects was directly explored. The results indicate that only explicit but not implicit task demands (searching for an action vs. a colour pair, respectively) had facilitatory effects on performance and that semantic information in a scene also modulates the automatic perception of paired-object <b>affordance.</b> The findings provide novel behavioural and neuroimaging evidence that paired-object <b>affordance</b> is influenced by contextual information and task demands, with the active object (the tool) within a pair modulating the allocation of attention...|$|R
50|$|Gibson {{coined the}} noun {{affordance}}. For Gibson the noun affordance {{pertains to the}} environment providing the opportunity for action. <b>Affordances</b> require a relationship in which {{the environment and the}} animal can work together. An example is that mankind has changed the environment to better suit our needs. When coming across Earth's natural steep slopes, man designed stairs in order to afford walking. In addition, objects in the environment can also afford many different behaviors, such as lifting or grasping. Gibson argued that when we perceive an object we observe the object's <b>affordances</b> and not its particular qualities. He believed that perceiving <b>affordances</b> of an object is easier than perceiving the many different qualities an object may have. <b>Affordances</b> can be related to different areas of the habitat as well. Some areas of the world allow for concealing while some allow for foraging.|$|E

5000|$|In 1988, Donald Norman {{appropriated}} {{the term}} <b>affordances</b> {{in the context}} of human-machine interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor. Through his book The Design of Everyday Things, this interpretation was popularized within the fields of HCI and interaction design. It makes the concept dependent not only on the physical capabilities of an actor, but also on their goals, beliefs, and past experiences. If an actor steps into a room containing an armchair and a softball, Gibson's original definition of <b>affordances</b> allows that the actor may throw the chair and sit on the ball, because this is objectively possible. Norman's definition of (perceived) <b>affordances</b> captures the likelihood that the actor will sit on the armchair and throw the softball. Effectively, Norman's <b>affordances</b> [...] "suggest" [...] how an object may be interacted with. For example, the size, shape and weight of a softball make it perfect for throwing by humans, and it matches their past experience with similar objects. The focus on perceived <b>affordances</b> is much more pertinent to practical design problems , which may explain its widespread adoption.|$|E
