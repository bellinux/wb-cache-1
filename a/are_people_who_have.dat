In May 2014, Ali al-Nimr was sentenced to be publicly beheaded and crucified.|$|E
25|$|Maritime-adapted hunter-gatherers <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{learned to}} harvest the {{resources}} of the sea and for whom marine foods make up the majority of their diets. In the material left by ancient people, archaeologists look for the kinds of food people were eating as well as the tools that they used to collect and process that food. In cultural deposits, if the remains of fish, shellfish, marine mammals and seabirds make up a majority of the faunal assemblage, and tools used to fish, hunt marine mammals and seabirds are found in the same context, the people would be considered to be maritime-adapted. Such is the case for the El Paraiso people.|$|E

500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of {{it is going to be}} light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deceased donors (formerly cadaveric) <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been {{declared}} brain-dead and whose organs are kept viable by ventilators or other mechanical mechanisms {{until they can}} be excised for transplantation. Apart from brain-stem dead donors, who have formed the majority of deceased donors for the last 20 years, there is increasing use of donation-after-circulatory-death-donors (formerly non-heart-beating donors) to increase the potential pool of donors as demand for transplants continues to grow. Prior to the recognition of brain death in the 1980s, all deceased organ donors had died of circulatory death. [...] These organs have inferior outcomes to organs from a brain-dead donor. For instance, patients who underwent liver transplantation using donation-after-circulatory- death (DCD) allografts {{have been shown to}} have significantly lower graft survival than those from donation-after-brain-death (DBD) allografts due to biliary complications and PNF. However, given the scarcity of suitable organs and {{the number of people who}} die waiting, any potentially suitable organ must be considered.|$|E

2500|$|... "The main {{aim of this}} (training) is to dignify {{the work}} of {{domestic}} staff {{in such a way}} that they can do their work with a scientific approach. I say 'with a scientific approach' because housework should be carried out as a true profession. We must not forget that there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> wanted to present this work as something humiliating, but it is not. No doubt, the conditions under which this work used to be done were humiliating and sometimes they still are, even today, when domestic staff are subjected in their work to the whim of an arbitrary employer who does not guarantee their rights, and who gives them low wages and no affection... Any job that is well done is a wonderful service to society, and this is as true of domestic work as it is of the work of a professor or judge. The only work that is not a service is that of a person who works for his own self-interest...I understand that work in the home is especially important because through it so much good or harm can be done to families." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [...] there are no established churches, but in our countries there <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt {{that it was a good}} thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marketers target {{influential}} {{people on}} social media who are recognised as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify {{the impact of their}} message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or [...] "liking" [...] of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that [...] "consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals" [...] who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's <b>are</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) [...] (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.39).|$|E
