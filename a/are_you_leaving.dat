[...] Her subsequent films, such as Wendy and Lucy and Meek's Cutoff, involve similar themes, of people trying to leave a place but frustrated by their lack of resources. [...] Of that theme, Reichardt said [...] "I guess it’s just a good setup for different kinds of searching: question-asking, looking for the next place to go, what are you looking for, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>leaving.</b> All those things are good for grounding it in getting from point A to point B." ...|$|E

So he took them and left Haajar and her child Ismaa’eel in a bleak, isolated place in which there was no water, then he left them and went back to Canaan (Parts of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestinan territories). Haajar said to him, 'For whom <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>leaving</b> us in this forsaken valley?' But Ibrahim went and left her, and she said, 'Has Allah commanded you to do this?” He said, 'Yes.' She said, 'Then Allah will not cause us to be lost.' ...|$|E

5000|$|According to the American Journal of Public Health, youths ages 12 to 17 {{were less}} {{inclined}} to see smoking as harmful and reported an increased likelihood to smoke after they had viewed a television advertisement urging parents to speak to their children about not smoking. In 1999 Philip Morris coined the slogan [...] "Talk. They’ll listen." [...] This phrase was designed to encourage parents to discuss the effects of smoking with their children. The American Journal of Public Health study, though, demonstrated that commercials such as the Philip Morris one actually seemed to have an opposite effect. Researchers analyzed television ratings from 75 U.S. media markets and data from annual national surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders from 1999 to 2002. 8th graders who were likely to have seen advertisements targeted at parents had an increased likelihood of believing that the dangers of smoking had been exaggerated by the advertisement and reported an increased likelihood to smoke. Similarly, older teenagers exhibited a stronger approval of smoking and had an increased chance of having smoked in the past 30 days before the school survey was conducted. In 1999, Philip Morris ran a series of full-page advertisements in news magazines, which were aimed at parents and conveyed the [...] "forbidden fruit" [...] message. They featured a bowl of fruit or {{a glass of milk}} with cookies and then had the questions [...] "What else <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>leaving</b> for your kids?" [...] and [...] "What else is within your kids’ reach?" [...] In 2000, Philip Morris took a different approach and distributed book covers with the phrase [...] "Think. Don’t Smoke." [...] These book covers were distributed to schools in California and had not been authorized previously. These covers, which were meant to make students aware of the potential dangers of smoking {{while at the same time}} enticing them to defy parental authority, failed as a result of the intervention of the California Department of Education and Justice. The California Department of Education and Justice sent out a memorandum warning schools about Philip Morris’ intent and demanding that Philip Morris recall all of its book covers.|$|E
50|$|In Islamic belief, Abraham had {{prayed to}} God for {{a son and}} God heard his prayer. Muslim exegesis states that Sarah asked Abraham to marry her Egyptian handmaiden Hagar because she herself was barren. Hagar soon bore Ishmael, {{who was the first}} son of Abraham. God then {{instructed}} Abraham to take his wife Hagar and their baby Ishmael out in to the desert and to leave them there. He did so taking them to the location of the Kaaba’s foundations (which now was in ruins) and as he turned away from Hagar and started to walk away she called out to him and asked “Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>leaving</b> us here?” to which Abraham didn’t reply the first two times she asked. She then changed her question and asked “Did God command you to do this?” to which Abraham stopped, turned around, looked back and replied “Yes.” and she responded “Then God will provide for us.” Abraham then continued on his return journey back to Sarah. In the desert, the baby Ishmael cried with thirst. His mother placed him in the shade under a bush and went in a frantic search for water, which resulted in her running seven times between the Safa and Marwah hills trying to find a source of water or a passing caravan who she could trade with for water. Hagar, not finding any sources of water and fearing the death of her baby, sat down and cried asking for God’s help. God sent angel Gabriel to her informing her to lift up her baby and when she did, she noticed that his feet had scratched the ground allowing a spring of water to bubble up to the surface. Hagar quickly shifted the ground to form a well around the spring to contain the water forming the Zamzam well. Hagar refilled the bottle with water and gave her baby a drink. This spring became known to caravans that traveled through Arabia and Hagar negotiated deals with them for supplies in exchange for the water. From her actions, the city of Mecca (originally Becca or Baca in Hebrew) grew, and attracted settlers who stayed and provided protection for her and Ishmael as well as being sources of various goods brought in and exchanged with visiting caravans. To commemorate the blessing of the Zamzam well which God gave to Hagar and Ishmael, Muslims run between the Safa and Marwah hills retracing Hagar’s steps on her search for water, during the rites of Hajj.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1126, shortly after Urraca's death and the {{accession}} of Alfonso, Arias led a rebellion in Galicia. Diego Gelmírez and Gómez Núñez of Toroño or perhaps Gutierre Vermúdez were charged per litteras ("by letter") with putting it down. Diego besieged Arias in Lobeiro and, with siege engines, in Tabeirós, forcing him to surrender. Diego's opinion of Arias was such that he said to him: [...] "I fear, therefore, that if such that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> this world, <b>you</b> will lose eternal life and incur the perpetual condemnation of your soul." ...|$|R
