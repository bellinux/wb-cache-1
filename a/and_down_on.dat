5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the Billboard 200 chart for a few weeks, peaking at No. 162 and not coming close {{to the success of}} its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera {{at the bottom of a}} corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron were on {{a training}} flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped in the wreckage. Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E

25|$|Fancher {{states that}} radical hermeneutics, {{which is similar}} to but {{different}} from ontological hermeneutics, may end up being a kind of Trojan horse for psychotherapy because its emphasis on subjective narrative and deconstruction can lend itself to a dangerous relativism.

25|$|In 1976, Masters (still {{using the}} name Robert Walters) founded Nova Studios, distributing films through direct mail as well as adult bookstores. The studio's first {{production}} was Tubtricks. Masters doubled the length of Nova Studios' loops to more than 400 feet, extending each film's running time to nearly 20 minutes. Masters followed up {{with a series of}} long loops: Kept After School, Beached, Tricking, Hot Lunch, Jocks, That Boy Next Door <b>and</b> <b>Down</b> <b>on</b> the Farm.|$|E
25|$|Star Wars: Masters of Teräs Käsi is a {{fighting}} {{game with a}} 3D gameplay element. The player is able to move their character not only forwards and back using the left and right, but can sidestep by using the up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the controller. There are three ways to achieve a win: knocking out the opponent, forcing the opponent out of the ring, or having the most health when time runs out. Rounds are timed, and the player must win two of three rounds to be declared {{the winner of the}} match.|$|E
25|$|Vibrato {{can also}} be used for a fast trill. A trill {{initiated}} from just hammering the finger up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the fingerboard will create a harsher quality than with a vibrato trill. For example, if trilling on the first finger, the second finger is placed very slightly off the string and vibrato is implemented. The second finger will lightly touch the string above the first finger causing the pitch to change. This has a softer quality and many think it is nicer-sounding than a hammered trill. Note: this trill technique only works well for semi-tonal trills, it is far more difficult to vibrato trill for an interval of a tone or more.|$|E

25|$|A Portuguese captain major, {{armed with}} a sword and a shield, strode up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the shore {{encouraging}} his men to continuously press the attack. He ordered them to fire even on the shallops {{to prevent them from}} assisting the Dutch troops. The remaining Dutch troops raised a white flag realizing that they were stranded. At the same time, a cannonball from a shallop hit Mendonça on his head and killed him instantly. Suddenly, Portuguese troops found themselves leaderless and without direction. A sergeant major who was next in command stood irresolute, while the Portuguese attack halted. In panic they abandoned the fight and retired back to the fort in scattered groups. Some of the wounded (Captain Jorge Fernandes the commander of the center, Captain João de Sequeira and four Soldiers) were left behind and they were taken prisoner by the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Pulver battled back in {{the third}} round, {{successfully}} defending Penn's attempts {{to take him to}} the ground, and even scoring defensive takedowns on Penn. Pulver frustrated Penn with nothing more than sheer will power, not only winning the later rounds, but out-grappling the world-renowned Penn. In the fifth round, Penn, frustrated <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> points, chose to stand and trade with Pulver. For the entire five minutes of the fifth round the two stood toe to toe exchanging strikes. With 45 seconds left in the round, a left hand from Pulver staggered Penn, who looked in trouble. However, Penn countered with a right kick straight to the groin, resulting in a 50-second time-out. Although the time-out gave Penn time to recover, when the bout was restarted, Pulver staggered him a second time with 20 seconds remaining. However, the round drew to a conclusion and the fight went into the judges' hands.|$|E

500|$|Viewtiful Joes core {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to a traditional side-scrolling beat 'em up. Taking control of Joe, the player is mostly limited to moving left, right, up, <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a fixed 2D path. The game contains platforming elements such as the ability to jump and double jump. Combat consists of fighting multiple enemies on screen at once, with the enemies appearing from all directions, including the foreground and background. Joe has the ability to punch, kick, and dodge—which he can do by leaping upward or ducking. Dodging enemies' attacks successfully temporarily dazes them, leaving them wide open for attack. The player has certain number of hit points in the form of [...] "Life Marks" [...] located above the VFX Gauge, which decrease whenever Joe takes damage. Health can be restored by picking up hamburgers.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} {{then moved}} on to celebrate British children's literature. J. K. Rowling began by reading from J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The Child Catcher appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: the Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil and Lord Voldemort. [...] Minutes later, 32 women playing Mary Poppins descended on flying umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing. The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from Tubular Bells (with a giant set of tubular bells {{at the rear of the}} stage), Tubular Bells III and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, In Dulci Jubilo. [...] During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped up <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.|$|E
500|$|Tony [...] "le Stéphanois" [...] {{has served}} a five-year prison {{term for a}} jewel heist and is {{out on the street}} <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his luck. His friend Jo {{approaches}} him about a smash-and-grab proposed by mutual friend Mario in which the threesome would cut the glass on a Parisian jeweler's front window in broad daylight and snatch some gems. Tony declines. He then learns that his old girlfriend, Mado, took up in his absence with gangster Parisian nightclub owner Pierre Grutter. Finding Mado working at Grutter's, Tony invites her back to his rundown flat. She is obviously well-kept, and Tony savagely beats her for being so deeply involved with Grutter. Tony changes his mind about the heist; he now accepts on the condition that they rob the jeweler's safe instead of the window. Mario suggests they employ the services of Italian compatriot César, a safecracker. The four devise and rehearse an ingenious plan to break into the store and disarm its sophisticated alarm system.|$|E
