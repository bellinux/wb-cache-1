5|$|The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera, Patience, {{opened at}} the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was <b>another</b> <b>big</b> success, usurping Pinafore's {{position}} as the longest running piece in the series with the second-longest run in musical theatre history. Patience satirised the self-indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and '80s in England. To popularise the opera in America, in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management, the young poet Oscar Wilde, on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about. Carte told an interviewer {{at that time that}} he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe, America and Australia.|$|E

Nevertheless, Pirates was a hit both in New York, again spawning numerous imitators, and then in London, and it {{became one of the most}} frequently performed, translated and parodied Gilbert and Sullivan works, also enjoying successful 1981 Broadway and 1982 West End revivals by Joseph Papp that continue to influence productions of the opera.|$|E

5|$|Juventus have {{significant}} rivalries with two clubs. Their traditional rivals are fellow Turin club Torino and matches {{between the two}} side are known as the Derby della Mole (Turin Derby). The rivalry dates back to 1906 as Torino was founded by break-away Juventus players and staff. Their most high-profile rivalry is with Internazionale, <b>another</b> <b>big</b> Serie A club located in Milan, {{the capital of the}} neighbouring region of Lombardy. Matches between these two clubs are referred to as the Derby d'Italia (Derby of Italy) and the two regularly challenge each other {{at the top of the}} league table, hence the intense rivalry. Until the Calciopoli scandal which saw Juventus forcibly relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. Notably, the two sides are the first and the second most supported clubs in Italy and the rivalry has intensified since the later part of the 1990s; reaching its highest levels ever post-Calciopoli, with the return of Juventus to Serie A. They also have rivalries with Milan, Roma, Fiorentina and Napoli.|$|E
