In some cases with juveniles, bracing has reduced curves significantly, going from a 40 degrees (of the curve, mentioned in length above) out of the brace to 18 degrees in it. Braces are sometimes prescribed for adults to relieve pain related to scoliosis. Bracing involves fitting the patient with a device that covers the torso; in some cases, it extends to the neck. The most commonly used brace is a TLSO, such as a Boston brace, a corset-like appliance that fits from armpits to hips and is custom-made from fiberglass or plastic.

500|$|The {{ability to}} compare {{ammunition}} {{is a direct}} result of the invention of rifling around the turn of the 16th century. [...] By forcing the bullet to spin as it travels down the barrel of the weapon the bullet's accuracy greatly increases. [...] At the same time, the rifling leaves marks on the bullet that are indicative of that particular barrel. [...] Prior to mass production of firearms, each barrel and bullet mold was hand made by gunsmiths making them unique. [...] The first successful documented case of forensic firearm examination occurred in 1835 when a member of the Bow Street Runners in London matched a recovered bullet from a murder victim to a specific mold in a suspect's home confirming that he made the bullet. [...] Further evidence that the bullet maker was the perpetrator was found in his home and he was convicted. [...] As manufacturing and automation replaced hand tools, the ability to compare bullets became impossible due to the standardization of molds within a specific company. [...] However, experts in the field postulated that there were microscopic differences on each barrel left during the manufacturing process. These differences were a result of wear on the machines and since each new weapon caused a tiny <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear,</b> each barrel would be slightly different from every other barrel produced by that company. [...] Also, each bullet fired from a specific barrel would be printed with the same marks, allowing investigators to identify the weapon that fired a specific bullet.|$|E

A traveller wants a portable boat, chiefly as means to cross over to a village for help, or to carry his valuables across a river, while the heavy things are risked at a ford; or for shooting, fishing, or surveying.

60|$|Can {{any light}} be thrown on this {{remarkable}} absence of recent conchiferous deposits on these coasts, on which, at an ancient tertiary epoch, strata abounding with organic remains were extensively accumulated? I think there can, namely, {{by considering the}} conditions necessary {{for the preservation of}} a formation to a distant age. Looking to the enormous amount of denudation which on all sides of us has been effected,--as evidenced by the lofty cliffs cutting off on so many coasts horizontal and once far-extended strata of no great antiquity (as in the case of Patagonia),--as evidenced by the level surface of the ground on both sides of great faults and dislocations,--by inland lines of escarpments, by outliers, and numberless other facts, and by that argument of high generality advanced by Mr. Lyell, namely, that every SEDIMENTARY formation, whatever its thickness may be, and over however many hundred square miles it may extend, is the result and the measure of an equal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and tear of pre-existing formations; considering these facts, we must conclude that, as an ordinary rule, a formation to resist such vast destroying powers, and to last to a distant epoch, must be of wide extent, and either in itself, or together with superincumbent strata, be of great thickness. In this discussion, we are considering only formations containing the remains of marine animals, which, as before mentioned, live, with some exceptions within (most of them much within) depths of 100 fathoms. How, then, can a thick and widely extended formation be accumulated, which shall include such organic remains? First, let us take the case of the bed of the sea long remaining at a stationary level: under these circumstances it is evident that CONCHIFEROUS strata can accumulate only to the same thickness with the depth at which the shells can live; on gently inclined coasts alone can they accumulate to any considerable width; and from the want of superincumbent pressure, it is probable that the sedimentary matter will seldom be much consolidated: such formations have no very good chance, when in the course of time they are upraised, of long resisting the powers of denudation. The chance will be less if the submarine surface, instead of having remained stationary, shall have gone on slowly rising during the deposition of the strata, for in this case their total thickness must be less, and each part, before being consolidated or thickly covered up by superincumbent matter, will have had successively to pass through the ordeal of the beach; and on most coasts, the waves on the beach tend to wear down and disperse every object exposed to their action. Now, both on the south-eastern and western shores of South America, we have had clear proofs that the land has been slowly rising, and in the long lines of lofty cliffs, we have seen that the tendency of the sea is almost everywhere to eat into the land. Considering these facts, it ceases, I think, to be surprising, that extensive recent conchiferous deposits are entirely absent on the southern and western shores of America.|$|E

60|$|Peduncle.--The most {{remarkable}} fact concerning this part, {{is that the}} outer tunic, together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered, is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth. I demonstrated this fact in L. dorsalis and L. truncata, by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath; and as these two species, (I obtained, also, pretty good evidence in L. Nicobarica,) are at the opposite extremes of the genus, no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus. I know of no other instance, amongst Cirripedia, in which calcified valves or scales are moulted. I am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece; though this almost certainly {{is the case with}} the uppermost and lowest portions. The animal's body is partly lodged within the peduncle, which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum, and in the upper part is fully as broad as it. The scales with which it is clothed, extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves. The scales of the upper whorl, or of the two or three upper whorls (Pl. VIII, figs. 1 b´ and 3 d) are larger than those below; and these latter rapidly decrease in size, so as to become low down on the peduncle, almost or quite invisible to the naked eye. The scales in each whorl, are placed alternately with those in the whorls, above and below. All the upper scales are packed rather closely together; those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral; those in the few next succeeding whorls, are triangular, with their basal margins protuberant and arched; the scales, low down on the peduncle, stand some way apart from each other, and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads, of which some of the smallest in L. dorsalis were only 1/400th of an inch in diameter. In the lowest part of the peduncle these scales, after each fresh exuviation, are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity; hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked. This same part, however, is furnished with nail- or rather star-headed little projections of hard, yellow, horny chitine (fig. 3 e). The star on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points; one star which I measured was 7/6000th of an inch in total width, the footstalk being only 2/6000th of an inch in diameter; the whole projected 10/6000ths of an inch above the surface of the peduncle; from the footstalk a fine tubulus runs through the membrane to the underlying corium. These star-headed little points are often much worn down; in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation, there remained, in the lower part, close above the basal calcareous cup, only some hard, smooth, yellow, little discs, on a level with the general surface of the membrane,--these being the intersected or worn down footstalks, with every trace of the calcareous beads gone. But in this same specimen, under the old peduncular membrane, there was a new one, studded with the usual circular calcareous beads, slightly unequal in size, generally about 1/400th of an inch in diameter, and each furnished with a tubulus; but as yet none of the star-headed points of chitine had been formed. I believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads, and, therefore, are formed directly under them. In L. cauta the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in L. dorsalis, giving a frosted appearance to it, and all of them are serrated (fig. 3 d) round their entire margins. Generally only the scales in the uppermost, or in the three or four upper rows are serrated, and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins. The state of the serrated edge varies extremely in the same species, from elongated conical teeth to mere notches, according to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>wear</b> and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation; so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum. Each scale has a fine tubulus passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its bluntly-pointed imbedded fang or base. The membrane is transparent, thin, and tender, to a degree I have not seen equalled in the other Lepadidæ, except, perhaps, in Ibla. It is much wrinkled transversely.|$|E
