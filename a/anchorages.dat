5|$|As {{the islands}} have no {{harbours}} or <b>anchorages,</b> the phosphate ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between <b>anchorages</b> to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States Navy was {{prevented}} from developing fortifications on the Aleutian Islands {{due to the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Navy believed that at some point the United States' treaty obligations would no longer apply, and began to scout the Aleutians for possible naval bases. In 1923, two scouting ships investigated the possibility of establishing <b>anchorages</b> off the Islands, and attempted to claim the United States Army's bases on the Aleutians for the purposes of national security.|$|E

40|$|<b>Anchorage</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} concept in biomechanics of orthodontics. In contemporary orthodontics, bone <b>anchorage</b> is a magic tool, which decreased the indication for extraoral appliances greatly {{and at the same time}} achieving stationary <b>anchorage</b> became possible. However, the indication for bone <b>anchorage</b> has to be clarified carefully. Skeletal open-bite treatment, effective molar distalization, Class III treatment by using chin <b>anchorage,</b> and space closure in severe minimal <b>anchorage</b> cases are some examples for bone <b>anchorage</b> supported orthodontic treatment. Here, we discussed three necessary usages of bone <b>anchorage</b> for different treatment modalities...|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} August Posen and {{the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet had {{returned}} to their <b>anchorages</b> in the North Sea. The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11–12 September, though it ended without any action. Another fleet sortie followed on 23–24 October without encountering any British forces. On 4 March 1916, Posen, Nassau, Westfalen, and Von der Tann steamed out to the Amrumbank to receive the auxiliary cruiser , which was returning from a raiding mission.|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected <b>anchorages</b> may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and <b>anchorages,</b> and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, {{and to protect}} the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be self-contained and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of {{the larger}} Orkney islands, the {{derivation}} of the name 'Shapinsay' is not obvious. The final 'ay' is from the Old Norse for island, but the first two syllables {{are more difficult to}} interpret. Haswell-Smith (2004) suggests the root may be hjalpandis-øy (helpful island) owing to the presence of a good harbour, although <b>anchorages</b> are plentiful in the archipelago. The first written record dates from 1375 in a reference to Scalpandisay, which may suggest a derivation from Judge's island. Another suggestion is Hyalpandi's island, although no one of that name is known to be associated with Shapinsay.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August Westfalen and {{the rest}} of the High Seas Fleet had {{returned}} to their <b>anchorages</b> in the North Sea. The next operation conducted was a sweep into the North Sea on 11–12 September, though it ended without any action. Another sortie followed on 23–24 October during which the German fleet did not encounter any British forces. Another uneventful advance into the North Sea took place on 21–22 April 1916. A bombardment mission followed two days later; Westfalen joined the battleship support for Hipper's battlecruisers while they attacked Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser Seydlitz was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Due to poor visibility, the operation was soon called off, leaving the British fleet no time to intercept the raiders.|$|E
5|$|Fremantle also {{despatched}} several officers, including Hoste, {{to operate}} independently. Hoste in Bacchante returned to Apulia and attacked {{a string of}} ports, castles and <b>anchorages,</b> while Captain George Cadogan in HMS Havannah effectively halted the movement of supplies along the northern Italian coast {{in support of the}} approaching Austrian armies. In June, Fremantle himself led his whole squadron against the important port city of Fiume, seizing or burning 90 vessels from the harbour and huge quantities of naval stores after a sharp battle in the city streets. Three months later, Fremantle attacked the city of Trieste, blockading it from the sea, bombarding its defences and landing marines and cannon to join with the besieging Austrian armies and force the city's surrender.|$|E

The qualitative analysis revealed that minor <b>anchorage</b> loss {{can be associated with}} indirect <b>anchorage,</b> whereas <b>anchorage</b> gain was commonly associated with direct <b>anchorage.</b> Implant failures were comparable for both <b>anchorage</b> modalities (direct 9.9 %, indirect 8.6 %).|$|R
30|$|Data {{synthesis}} {{in comparison}} group 2 showed {{a statistically significant}} difference in the amount of <b>anchorage</b> loss with a standard mean difference of −[*] 2.55  mm. These results show less <b>anchorage</b> loss in the en masse/miniscrew group when compared to the two-step retraction combined with conventional <b>anchorage.</b> This amount of <b>anchorage</b> loss is considered to be clinically significant as 2.5  mm of the extraction space can greatly impact the treatment outcomes. The two-step retraction is claimed to preserve <b>anchorage.</b> This claim is the reason behind combining it with conventional <b>anchorage</b> techniques. Both en masse/miniscrew combination and two-step retraction combined with a conventional <b>anchorage</b> are used in maximum <b>anchorage</b> cases. In a clinical setting, this should not be considered a comparison between two retraction mechanics or <b>anchorage</b> methods; rather, it is between two maximum <b>anchorage</b> protocols. These results suggest that in maximum <b>anchorage</b> extraction cases, the use of two-step/conventional <b>anchorage</b> combination is less effective in preserving <b>anchorage.</b> Keeping in mind the individuality of each case, the clinician should always strive to use the most effective method. The two-step retraction method could still be used where {{there is a need to}} retract the canines first to allow for the alignment of the incisors; however, according to these findings, the use of an en masse/miniscrew protocol is more effective in <b>anchorage</b> preservation in maximum <b>anchorage</b> cases. These findings are consistent with recent meta-analyses which conclude that the use of en masse/miniscrew combination provides better <b>anchorage</b> control than conventional methods of <b>anchorage</b> [29].|$|R
5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor <b>anchorages</b> compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} Tirpitz {{several times}} during 1942 and 1943. When the battleship sortied to intercept Convoy PQ 12 on 6 March 1942 , which formed part of the convoy's escort, attempted to attack her using torpedo bombers. These aircraft launched twenty torpedoes at the battleship but all missed. On several occasions during 1942 and 1943 bombers from the Royal Air Force and Soviet Air Forces attempted to strike Tirpitz in her <b>anchorages</b> without success. On 23 September 1943 two British X-class midget submarines succeeded in penetrating the defences around the battleship at her main anchorage at Kaafjord in northern Norway during Operation Source, and placed explosive charges in the water beneath her. This attack caused extensive damage to Tirpitz, putting her out of service for six months.|$|E
5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained stuck there until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate Indienne, remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure <b>anchorages.</b> During the night the wind blew from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather was so bad that night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} two years, the British raided ports and <b>anchorages</b> on the French islands while the French {{attacked}} trade convoys in the wider ocean. The British were able to slowly reduce the French presence by eliminating their bases through limited invasions, but suffered a major setback at Grand Port in August 1810 and were forced onto the defensive in the autumn. Hamelin was eventually defeated only after being personally captured on his flagship Vénus by Rowley, shortly before substantial reinforcements arrived under Bertie to seize Isle de France. Throughout the campaign Hamelin was unable to secure reinforcement from France—almost all attempts {{to break through the}} British blockade of French ports proved futile and only one frigate successfully reached in the Indian Ocean before the surrender of Isle de France. The final such attempt arrived off Mauritius in May 1811, only to discover that the island was in British hands. On the return journey, the force was attacked by a British squadron off Madagascar and defeated, leaving the British in complete control of the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter <b>anchorages,</b> capturing it intact. The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Hollandia in May 1944. The swampy area with its restricted <b>anchorages</b> proved unsuitable {{for a major}} airbase complex, although fighter strips were constructed, and it was developed as a staging area. MacArthur was compelled to press on with the Wakde-Sarmi project lest his troops become stranded without adequate air cover. A shortage of shipping meant that the operation had {{to be carried out}} by the troops in the Hollandia area, so Krueger nominated the 163rd Regimental Combat Team for Wakde, {{while the rest of the}} 41st Infantry Division captured Sarmi. However, with only days to go, doubts surfaced about the viability of construction in the Sarmi area, and Biak was substituted. In view of the difficulties involved in changing plans, and moving the troops around, MacArthur agreed to postpone both operations, Wakde until 17 May and Biak to 27 May.|$|E

40|$|Molar <b>anchorage</b> loss in {{extraction}} case {{is believed}} {{due to the}} reaction of mechanical force applied to retract anterior teeth.

Hence, for adolescents, molar <b>anchorage</b> loss shall consist of two parts. One is from retraction force - mechanical <b>anchorage</b> loss; another from biologic force - physiologic <b>anchorage</b> loss. Since physiologic <b>anchorage</b> loss is caused by the continuous biologic force, the strategy of physiologic <b>anchorage</b> control (PAC) is different from the strategy of mechanical <b>anchorage</b> control.

5|$|Lützow left Germany on 15 May 1942 for Norway; by 25 May she {{had joined}} Admiral Scheer in Bogen Bay. She was made the {{flagship}} {{of the now}} Vizeadmiral Kummetz, the commander of Kampfgruppe 2. Fuel shortages restricted operations, although Lützow and Admiral Scheer were able to conduct limited battle training exercises. Kampfgruppe 2 was assigned to Operation Rösselsprung, a planned attack on the Allied convoy PQ 17, which was headed to the Soviet Union. On 3 July, the force left their <b>anchorages,</b> and in heavy fog Lützow and three destroyers ran aground and suffered significant damage. The British detected the German departure and ordered the convoy to scatter. Aware that surprise had been lost, the Germans broke off the surface attack and turned the destruction of PQ-17 over to the U-boats and Luftwaffe. Twenty-four of the convoy's thirty-five transports were sunk. Lützow returned to Germany for repairs, which lasted {{until the end of}} October. She began a brief set of trials starting on 30 October. She returned to Norway in early November with a destroyer escort, arriving in Narvik on the 12th.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Duperré's departure, a British {{squadron}} under Captain Henry Lambert {{consisting of}} HMS Magicienne, HMS Iphigenia and HMS Leopard arrived off Isle de France {{to restore the}} blockade. Rowley subsequently increased Lambert's forces, detaching Willoughby in Nereide with instructions to raid coastal <b>anchorages</b> on the island. On 24 April, Willoughby sighted the recently arrived Astrée, and on 30 April attacked the protected anchorage at Jacolet. His target was a large French merchant ship protected by two batteries and a detachment of regular infantry. Landing at night under heavy fire, Willoughby's men seized one battery, drove off a French attack on their beachhead and captured the second battery despite having to advance across a river, under fire, in broad daylight. On returning to their boats, Willoughby's men were attacked by a second French force which they also routed and drove {{more than a mile}} inland. Shortly afterwards however, Willoughby was seriously wounded when a musket he was firing exploded, shattering his jaw. As a result, he was forced to spend several months recovering from his injuries on Rodriguez.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Saint Paul was an {{important}} demonstration of Rowley's ability to strike at the French <b>anchorages</b> directly. Landing men at unwatched beaches, the British soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines of the landing party were able to storm the defences from the landward side and rout the defenders. This allowed Rowley's squadron to enter the harbour and capture Caroline {{and a number of}} smaller ships that were docked there. The attack caused consternation on the island and its commander, Nicolas Des Bruslys, committed suicide rather than order his troops to attack the British positions. Unopposed, Rowley was able to destroy the defences and public works in the town before leaving with large quantities of captured supplies and ships. Colonel Chrysostome Sainte-Suzanne replaced Des Bruslys but was unable to effectively defend the island with the remaining garrison {{in the event of a}} concerted invasion.|$|E
