500|$|The {{plot of the}} adapted Western release (Blaster Master) {{is shown}} at the {{beginning}} in a cinematic slideshow as ominous music plays in the background. The game starts with a person named Jason who has a pet frog named Fred who, one day, decides to leap out of his fish bowl <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Fred then touches a radioactive chest, and he grows to an enormous size; Fred and the chest then fall into {{a hole in the}} earth. Jason chases Fred down the hole, which leads to a large underground cavern. While most sources say that Jason chased Fred down the hole, the game's instruction manual says that Jason fell into the hole while trying to reach for Fred. There, he finds an armored tank named SOPHIA THE3RD – a vehicle designed to battle radioactive mutants that live inside the earth. Jason mounts SOPHIA to find the whereabouts of Fred and to destroy the mutants and their leader – the Plutonium Boss. The opening sequence has been described as [...] "one of the greatest scenes in all of video games".|$|E

60|$|We {{reached the}} city, late that night. Looking {{out of my}} chamber- window, before going to bed, I saw, on the {{opposite}} side of the way, a handsome building of white marble, which had a mournful ghost-like aspect, dreary to behold. I attributed this to the sombre influence of the night, and on rising in the morning looked out again, expecting to see its steps and portico thronged with groups of people passing in <b>and</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> was still tight shut, however; the same cold cheerless air prevailed: and the building looked as if the marble statue of Don Guzman could alone have any business to transact within its gloomy walls. I hastened to inquire its name and purpose, and then my surprise vanished. It was the Tomb of many fortunes; the Great Catacomb of investment; the memorable United States Bank.|$|E

5000|$|McNeely was {{credited}} with being the most flamboyant performer. He wore bright banana- and lime-colored suits, played under blacklights that made his horn glow in the dark, used strobe lights as early as 1952 to create an old-movie effect, and sometimes walked off the stage <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> usually with the club patrons following. At one point, in San Diego, police arrested him {{on the sidewalk and}} took him to jail, while his band kept playing on the bandstand, waiting for him to return. The honking style was fading by the early 1950s, but the honkers themselves found themselves providing rousing solos for doo wop groups; an example was Sam [...] "The Man" [...] Taylor's eight-bar romp on The Chords' 1954 [...] "Sh-Boom." [...] Bill Haley also used honking sax men Joey D'Ambrosio and Rudy Pompilli on his rock and roll records, including [...] "Rock Around the Clock." [...] However, the rise of the electric guitar ended the dominance of the tenor sax in rock and roll by 1956.|$|E

50|$|The range has {{its origins}} in 1936 when Geoffrey Malins started to make engines for Hobbies of Dereham. His engines were loosely based on the Bowman engines that Geoffrey Bowman Jenkins had made for Hobbies until 1935. The main {{difference}} between the Bowman and the Malins was that the latter were smaller, only came on metal bases and all except the SE1 had the chimney attached {{to the top of}} the boiler, known as a locomotive style chimney. From 1937 Malins decided to make his own range of engines as well as those he was producing for Hobbies. With the exception of a few small detail changes - such as lighter shade of paints and a Mamod badge - they were almost identical to the Hobbies range. The difference between Mamod and Hobbies became somewhat blurred; a Mamod badged SE4 could be found in the 'Hobbies colours'. This was the very beginnings of a philosophy which meant that the engines had to be sold <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Unsold engines meant lost profit and nothing was wasted. Any differences between the two ranges had all but disappeared by 1940.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2017, a Detroit-area man, Dan Black, filed a {{harassment}} {{lawsuit against}} Clarke after Milwaukee deputies detained {{the man at}} the Milwaukee airport in January. The man had asked Clarke about his football team preference and shook his head at Clarke. On the tarmac, Clarke sent text messages to one of his captains, Mark Witek, directing sheriffs' deputies to detain Black. Clarke wrote: [...] "Question for him is why he said anything to me. Why didn't he just keep his mouth shut? Follow him to baggage <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> You can escort me to carousel after I point him out." [...] After arriving at the airport, Black was [...] "met by a group of six uniformed deputies and two dogs, all of whom were accompanied by the sheriff" [...] who questioned him before releasing him. Airport surveillance video showed Black telling deputies: [...] "He Clarke thinks because I asked who he is, he can exert that kind of power over me." [...] Local media reported that [...] "at least one of the deputies who was ordered to confront Black didn't believe he had been disruptive." ...|$|E
5000|$|De Ruyter {{was born}} in 1607 in Vlissingen, Netherlands, {{as the son of}} beer porter Adriaen Michielszoon and Aagje Jansdochter Little is known about De Ruyter's early life, but he {{probably}} became a sailor at the age of 11. It is said that once, when he was a child, he climbed up ladders to get to the roof of his home town's church. Not knowing that De Ruyter was there, some workers then removed the ladders. De Ruyter had to smash the tiles on the church roof to get into the church <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In 1622, he fought as a musketeer in the Dutch army under Maurice of Nassau against the Spaniards during the relief of Bergen-op-Zoom. That same year he rejoined the Dutch merchant fleet and steadily worked his way up. According to English sources, he was active in Dublin between 1623 and 1631 as an agent for the Vlissingen-based merchant house of the [...] brothers. Although Dutch sources have no data about his whereabouts in those years, it is known that De Ruyter spoke Irish fluently. He occasionally travelled as supercargo to the Mediterranean or the Barbary Coast. In those years, he usually referred to himself as [...] "Machgyel Adriensoon", his name in the Zealandic dialect he spoke, not having yet adopted the name [...] "De Ruyter". [...] "De Ruyter" [...] most probably was a nickname given to him. An explanation might be found in the meaning of the older Dutch verb ruyten or ruiten, which means [...] "to raid", something De Ruyter was known to do as a privateer with the Lampsins ship Den Graeuwen Heynst.|$|E
