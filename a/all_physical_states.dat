This means that matter fields are not included (with the exception of dilaton fields, which are not regarded as matter fields in our context). Furthermore, I am going to speak about (1 + 1) dimensional theories. As we seemingly live in a (3 + 1) dimensional universe, this might not be precisely what one eventually is interested in. And here is the good news: We can give a comprehensive treatment of the subject, encompassing a large variety of different gravity models.
