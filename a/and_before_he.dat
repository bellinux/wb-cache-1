5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head <b>and,</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested {{to see whether or not}} he will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt {{defeated}} rival Sewanee 16–0. In {{the first}} period, Sewanee had to punt {{from its own}} end zone. The pass to Jenks Gillem went wide, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could recover it he was downed by Enoch Brown for a safety. Gillem had one punt of 58 yards that day. Vanderbilt's game seemed to stagnate until Wilson Collins was hurt and replaced by Tom Shea in the third quarter. Then two touchdowns came in the fourth period, one by Robins and another Turner.

5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E
5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E

5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E

25|$|A L Bruce Estates Ltd made further {{substantial}} {{losses in}} 1948 and 1949, and was virtually insolvent. However, the government’s need for land for re-settlement after the 1949 famine {{caused it to}} restart negotiations with Bruce. Some of the estate was sold to private buyers, but around 75,000 acres was bought {{by the government in}} 1952, much of which was of poor quality. These land sales made good the past deficits, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> died in 1954, Alexander Livingstone Bruce saw the completion of the sale of the estate his father had acquired almost 60 years before. Although Alexander’s daughter, Diana Livingstone Bruce opposed liquidation of the company, and prolonged the process for five years in disputes with other shareholders, the company was wound-up as a solvent entity in 1959.|$|E
25|$|His uncle soon {{discovered}} that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed {{an uncanny ability to}} acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them). At the age of seven he had already made very considerable progress in Hebrew, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>he</b> was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age. These included the classical and modern European languages, and Persian, Arabic, Hindustani, Sanskrit, and even Marathi and Malay. He retained much of his knowledge of languages {{to the end of his}} life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long since stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation.|$|E
