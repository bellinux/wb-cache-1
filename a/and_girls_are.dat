Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E

Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like this because they are only children, not adults.|$|E

Subsequent scenes inter cut {{featuring}} One Direction performing the song at the camp setting in a circle, on an open field, driving a car, and at a lake where {{members of the group}} play in plastic bubbles and boats. As it turns to nighttime, the camp is the main setting; they conduct a football match and afterwards a pool party. The video ends with One Direction looking at the camera, with Malik singing the last line. Throughout the video, teenage boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> showing with the band.|$|E

25|$|Almost all of {{the educated}} populace of the Comoros have {{attended}} Quranic schools {{at some point in}} their lives, often before regular schooling. Here, boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> taught about the Qur'an, and memorise it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Pakistan's {{major cities}} and urban centres {{are home to}} an {{estimated}} 1.2 million street children. This includes beggars and scavengers who are often very young. The law and order problem worsens their condition as boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> fair game to others who would force them into stealing, scavenging and smuggling to survive. A large proportion consumes readily available solvents to starve off hunger, loneliness and fear. Children are vulnerable to contracting STDs such as HIV/AIDS, {{as well as other}} diseases.|$|E

According to the National Committee on Traditional Practices of Ethiopia, such bridal abductions were the base of 69% of marriages in the country as of 2003. UNICEF's Innocenti Research Center estimates that in 1999 female genital mutilation had 100% social support in the region.|$|E
25|$|The present Cathedral Choir {{consists}} of 16 choristers and 6 lay clerks. The choristers were originally educated at the Cathedral's Choir School {{but this was}} closed in 1935 and the boys are drawn from local schools. There is now also of 16 girl choristers, who alternate with the boys in singing three services a week, with Evensong sung daily except Saturday, and Choral Eucharist at 10.30 on Sunday. The boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> aged from 8–13 years and are recruited from local schools. They are selected at voice trials held during the year and receive a thorough musical training. They are awarded an annual bursary and pocket money.|$|E
25|$|Puberty is {{the process}} of {{physical}} changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates {{in the first half of}} puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> the external sex organs.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 the United States State Department {{estimated}} that 50,000 to 100,000 women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> trafficked each year into the United States. In 2003, the State Department report {{estimated that}} {{a total of}} 18,000 to 20,000 individuals were trafficked into the United States for either forced labor or sexual exploitation. The June 2004 report estimated the total trafficked annually at between 14,500 and 17,500. The Bush administration set up 42 Justice Department task forces and spent more than $150 million on attempts to reduce human trafficking. However, in the seven years since the law was passed, the administration has identified only 1,362 victims of human trafficking brought into the United States since 2000, nowhere near the 50,000 or more per year the government had estimated.|$|E
25|$|According {{to modern}} Feminists, women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> {{more prone to}} {{trafficking}} also because of social norms that marginalize their value and status in society. By this perspective females face considerable gender discrimination {{both at home and}} in school. Stereotypes that women belong at home in the private sphere and that women are less valuable because they do not and are not allowed to contribute to formal employment and monetary gains the same way men do further marginalize women's status relative to men. Some religious beliefs also lead people to believe that the birth of girls are a result of bad karma, further cementing the belief that girls are not as valuable as boys. It is generally regarded by feminists that various social norms contribute to women's inferior position and lack of agency and knowledge, thus making them vulnerable to exploitation such as sex trafficking.|$|E

500|$|Blyton's {{depictions of}} boys <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} by many critics to be sexist. In a Guardian article published in 2005 Lucy Mangan proposed that The Famous Five series depicts a power struggle between Julian, Dick and George (Georgina), in which the female characters either act like boys or are talked down to, as when Dick lectures George: [...] "it's really time you gave up thinking you're {{as good as a}} boy".|$|E
500|$|The plan {{states that}} human {{trafficking}} [...] "is {{often described as}} a modern form of slavery," [...] but {{that no one knows}} how prevalent it is in Canada. The NAP-CHT also says that women <b>and</b> <b>girls</b> <b>are</b> the most common victims of human trafficking. Randy Hoback, MP for Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, said that the goals of the action plan included [...] "enhancing the response of law enforcement and the justice system to cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls and supporting culturally appropriate victim's services." [...] The NAP-CHT document states that there had been 25 human-trafficking-specific convictions in Canada prior to April 2012, and that 41 people had been victims of those 25 crimes.|$|E
