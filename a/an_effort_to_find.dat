5|$|Gruban v Booth was a 1917 fraud case in England that {{generated}} significant publicity because the defendant, Frederick Handel Booth, was a Member of Parliament. Gruban was a German-born businessman who ran several factories that made tools for manufacturing munitions for the First World War. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> money {{to expand his}} business he contacted a businessman and Member of Parliament named Frederick Handel Booth, who agreed to provide the necessary money. After stealing money Booth tricked Gruban into handing over the company and then had him interned under war-time regulations to prevent the story coming out.|$|E

5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term {{stay with a}} family in Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim {{that his father had}} died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{worked in the}} {{wreckage}} all day and into the night in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and rescue any children pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene {{in response to the}} pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Trogloraptor spin simple webs {{with only}} a few strands, hung from the roofs of caves. Griswold et al. stated that the claws may have a {{significant}} function in capturing prey. Similar to the Nelson cave spider of New Zealand (Spelungula cavernicola, a gradungulid), Trogloraptor probably dangle upside down from their webs, snatching at passing flying insects with their claws. However their exact prey remains unknown. Captured live specimens were raised in climate-controlled laboratory conditions in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out. These specimens were offered moths, crickets and other spiders as food; but these were declined and the specimens starved after two weeks. This may indicate a preference for very specific prey.|$|E

5|$|Brugge {{needed to}} score again {{to keep the}} tie alive, and pushed their players forward {{in search of an}} equaliser. This forced Liverpool to pull all their players, except Keegan, into {{defensive}} positions to try to preserve their lead. Despite this Liverpool had a chance {{to take the lead in}} the 34th minute. Smith's volley from a Kennedy free-kick went wide of the Brugge goal. Brugge's pressure almost paid off five minutes into the second half. Ulrik le Fevre and Roger van Gool combined to split the Liverpool defence, leaving Lambert with the ball. His subsequent shot beat Liverpool goalkeeper Clemence but hit the post. Brugge kept attacking in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the goal they needed; their best chance came four minutes from the end. Brugge breached the Liverpool defence, but Cools' shot was denied by a diving save from Clemence. No more goals were scored; the final score was 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Coquelin {{then was}} booked for his foul on Oscar, which earned Chelsea a free kick. Oscar's attempt was saved by Čech, who fisted the ball round the post. Chelsea {{continued}} to attack, though Arsenal withstood their pressure. John Terry rose highest from a {{corner in the}} 74th minute and headed the ball in Zouma's direction, which eventually was caught by Čech. Hazard's shot was blocked in the 79th minute and Oscar then spurned a chance, with Falcao unable to create something from it. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an equaliser with ten minutes of normal time remaining, Mourinho brought on Moses in place of Terry and deployed a three-man defence. It nearly presented Arsenal the chance to score their second of the match, but for Cazorla to have his effort blocked and Aaron Ramsey on the rebound shooting wide.|$|E
5|$|In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> answers, Vincent goes to {{the town}} of Nibelheim where Lucrecia studied Omega and Chaos. Whilst at Lucrecia's {{research}} lab, Vincent is ambushed by Rosso the Crimson, who steals the Protomateria but is prevented from killing Vincent by the arrival of Yuffie. As they return to the WRO headquarters, they find that Deepground has launched an assault on the base. However, Deepground member Shelke the Transparent has been captured by the WRO, and reveals that she is synaptically interconnected to Lucrecia's memories, thus allowing the WRO to complete Lucrecia's research on Omega. Shelke's sister, Shalua Rui, a high ranking scientist in the WRO, soon discovers that Omega is a WEAPON, which activates when the Planet senses that it is in mortal danger (like the WEAPONs it activated in the original Final Fantasy VII). Omega's function is to absorb the Lifestream from the Planet and then move to another planet, leaving the inhabitants behind to die. Deepground plans to slaughter a huge number of people at once so as to 'trick' the planet into activating Omega prematurely.|$|E

5|$|In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the {{equalising}} goal, United manager Alex Ferguson moved Giggs {{from the}} centre of midfield to the left in order to restore the width of his team and brought on striker Dwight Yorke for Butt. Yorke would spearhead the attack with Van Nistelrooy, a partnership that worked on the club's pre-season tour of Asia. United had another chance in the 68th minute, but Scholes was unable to beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier made his first substitutions of the match soon after; {{in an attempt to}} regain control of possession, he brought on Igor Bišćan and Patrik Berger to replace Barmby and Murphy. Liverpool's first chance of the half came in the 81st minute, Bišćan and Owen exchanged passes, before Bišćan shot wide of the goal. United went straight on the attack and a goal-bound shot by Keane was saved by Westerveld. Liverpool replaced Riise with defender Jamie Carragher minutes later in order to see out the game. A minute later, referee D'Urso declined to award United a penalty for the second time when Van Nistelrooy's shot appeared to be blocked by the arm of Henchoz. United continued to push forward for an equaliser, but a long-range shot by Irwin, which went wide, was their only notable chance before the match ended. Liverpool won 2–1 to win the Shield for the 14th time.|$|E
