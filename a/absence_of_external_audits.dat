The analysis {{is based on a}} sample of 61 Tunisian firms listed and unlisted on the Tunis Stock Exchange and operating in the industrial and commercial sectors during the period 2007 - 2011. To provide evidence on this topic, we conduct an empirical examination. First, we examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> quality and ownership structure on the discretionary accruals for the whole sample. We find that only auditor reputation has a negative and significant effect on earnings management. Second, this article provides empirical evidence on the cross effect <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> quality variables and capital concentration on earnings management. This test suggests that this combination has a negative and significant effect on earnings management in industrial firms but it has a positive and non significant effect in commercial firms. Finally, the third empirical test concerns the combined effect <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>audit</b> quality and institutional property on earnings management. Wefind that the cross effect of this combined relation is negatively and significantly associated with earnings management of industrial firms but it has no significant effect on the earnings management of commercial firms. As for the cross effect of the auditor seniority and the institutional property, it has a positive and a significant effect in the commercial sectors, while, it is positively and non-significantly associated with earnings management <b>of</b> industrial firms. <b>External</b> <b>audit</b> quality; Ownership structure; Discretionary accruals; Cross effec...|$|R
40|$|The auditor and the insitutionalization of distrust: the professionalization <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden This paper {{addresses}} professionalization with a {{focus on}} trust, rather than on issues of power and competition. It contains a conceptual analysis of trust/confidence, as well as a case study of the professionalization <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden. The conceptual analysis discusses the “time-binding” aspect of trust/confidence, and the significance of social control mechanisms related to “persons”, “roles”, “values” and “programs” for creating and sustaining trust/confidence. The case study focuses on the role of trust/confidence for the organization and professionalization <b>of</b> <b>external</b> <b>auditing</b> in Sweden, and in particular on the ways in which trust in auditors and auditing have been stabilized. The latter issue is dealt with through a discussion attempting to capture a historic displacement in three dimensions: from reliance on the auditor’spersonal reliability, to trust in the professional role; from trust in the individual discretion of certain persons to trust in the regulation of auditing as a standardized program; and finally, from trust in the values represented by individual auditors to trust in the institutionalized professional values.
