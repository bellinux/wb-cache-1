The Museum of Curiosity is presented partly by Bill Bailey and mostly by John Lloyd, producer of QI (<b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> a theme?). Lloyd {{may well be a}} nice chap, but we haven't a clue who he is, and, on the evidence of this, he isn't a big or witty enough character for us to feel desperate to get to know him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stocky, {{grinning}} Capt. Frank Monroe Hawks, famed publicity flyer, {{holder of}} nearly all informal city-to-city speed records in the U.S. and Europe, was not grinning one day last week when attendants at the Worcester, Massachusetts, airport pulled him from beneath his crashed Travel Air [...] "Mystery Plane" [...] Texaco 13. Day before he had hopped from Detroit (in 3 hr. 5 min.). lectured the Worcester Boy Scouts on the necessity of developing foolproof planes, but had delayed his departure until the next morning because of a soggy field. An escort plane had nosed up when it landed just ahead of Capt. Hawks. After attempting to take off from a short dirt road which cut diagonally across the airport, he headed his low-wing monoplane down the field, less than 700 ft. in length. Oozy ground sucked at the wheels, kept him from attaining the 70 m.p.h. required to zoom off. Toward {{the end of the}} runway, going about 50 m.p.h., the ship bounced off a low mound, cut through heavy undergrowth, somersaulted over a stone wall. Hawks cut the motor in time, and saved himself from cremation. Capt. Hawks's nose and jaw were fractured, his face badly battered, several of his big, white teeth knocked out. He lay unconscious in the hospital for hours. Said Harvard Medical School's famed plastic surgeon, Dr. Varaztad Hovhannes Kazanjian: [...] "I do not think his speech will be affected. The operation for restoring his face should leave scarcely a scar." [...] Capt. Hawks's good friend Will Rogers wired: [...] "Sure glad nothing broke but your jaw. That will keep you still for a while. If I broke my jaw, I could still wire gags. What's the matter with you anyhow; <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>getting...</b> brittle?" ...|$|E
