500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly came as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes {{are few and far}} between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode does not make it particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E
2500|$|After {{learning}} of Breitbart's death on March 1, 2012, Sherrod released the following statement: [...] "The news of Mr. Breitbart’s death came as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I was informed {{of it this}} morning. My prayers go out to Mr. Breitbart’s family as they cope during this very difficult time." [...] Andrew Breitbart's widow has taken his place as defendant in the ongoing lawsuit.|$|E

6000|$|... "By George, Honora, you're <b>a</b> continual <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I {{had no idea}} a {{woman would}} take an {{interest}} in these things, or grasp them the way you do." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was engaged}} to be married. An hour back I had {{proposed}} to Cynthia Drassilis. And I can honestly say that it had come as <b>a</b> great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A jury at Southwark Crown Court {{unanimously}} acquitted Sgt White in November 2016. Rigg's sister Marcia said, [...] "The jury's {{verdict was}} <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and my family}} but {{we will continue to}} fight for full accountability for those officers who were on duty at Brixton police station. That a custody sergeant can give false evidence in connection with a death in custody, something he accepts he did, is a shocking state of affairs." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend {{rubbed his}} thin hands {{together}} with an appearance of avidity which was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> who knew his frugal tastes.|$|E
6000|$|... "You haven't learned yet, apparently, {{to answer}} their letters. It's rather <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that you don't {{pretend not to}} have {{received}} mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{this message}} reads at my discretion," [...] said Neale. [...] "It's <b>a</b> plain <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I've no {{intention}} of making you lose your back pay, or of firing you, either." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I met Ronald, he was {{the first}} white peson I'd met who was fluent in Yupik, so it came as <b>a</b> big <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> learn that he was {{actually}} born Outside." ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>a</b> welcome <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> for I was {{at liberty}} of course; {{and the war}} being now on another foot, as I thought, and the king dead, I {{resolved}} to quit the service.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} that. And then he knows things and understands them. It was never <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that Mary {{should have been}} so fond of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss," [...] {{interposed}} Mr. Wilks, {{anxious to}} explain his position. [...] "He called in to see me; quite <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it was. I 'ardly knowed him." ...|$|E

60|$|COKESON. [Confidentially to the jury, {{and as if}} <b>a</b> little <b>surprised</b> {{at being}} asked] He was a nice, pleasant-spoken young man. I'd no fault to find with him--quite the contrary. It was <b>a</b> great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when he did a thing like that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} could n't know, {{and we are all}} mortal. It was natural that you should n't expect--simply on turning your head--to find me lying on the pebbles at Blanquais-les-Galets. You were <b>a</b> great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as well; but I differ from you--I like surprises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my honor," [...] Bellamy replied, [...] "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} information concerning Von Behrling's death beyond what you can read there. It was as great <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I war surprised; in {{course it}} war <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I kicked the dead body; but when I {{come to think}} over all about the Captain, I warn't that much surprised." ...|$|E
6000|$|Slowly {{enumerating}} {{the articles}} {{they came to}} the piano. Averil went up to it, leant fondly against it, and softly touched the keys. 'My own,' she said, 'bought for <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I came home from school! And oh, how he loved it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our little conspiracy," [...] he continued, [...] "is bearing fruit.

His speech last night was wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all," [...] Wolfenden {{answered}} firmly. [...] "I {{came because}} I was sent for. It was <b>a</b> complete <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> meet Mr. Sabin here--at least {{it would have}} been if I had not travelled down with his niece. Their coming was simply a stroke of luck for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know nothing; I can't {{tell what}} has happened. We must be {{prepared}} for surprises.

[...] Deronda {{felt that he was}} too contemptuous.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} a string of {{incoherent}} but sufficiently damaging accusations made against me to-day by a young lady whose very existence, I may say, was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It suited me then to deny them.

6000|$|... "That's what it is," [...] {{said the}} Colonel. [...] "Well!" [...] he added, [...] "I don't see but what we've {{got to have}} another talk about this thing. It's <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I don't see exactly how you're {{going to make it}} pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir, {{there is}} no one in the world to whom I could intrust Marion's {{happiness}} so gladly and heartily. I own that it is <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> as well as to her mother, but we are both delighted at the choice she has made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So!" [...] {{he said at}} length, and it came as <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that fellows {{ever really}} do say [...] "So!"

5000|$|Now, that is {{just one}} of those songs that started with the title. I heard that phrase somewhere and I thought that could be a kind of funny song about {{gorgeous}} girls going out with monsters. It just started from there. It was just a funny song, or supposed to be funny. It was <b>a</b> great <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when some people interpreted it as being angry. Joe Jackson, Songfacts, 2012 ...|$|R
60|$|I {{proposed}} to Ada that morning {{that we should}} go and see Richard. It <b>a</b> little <b>surprised</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> find that she hesitated and was not so radiantly willing as I had expected.|$|R
6000|$|ALICE. 'Deception? Amy, Steve, I {{do believe}} {{he thinks that}} this is as much <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{as it is to}} him! Why, Robert, I have known about it ever since I saw Amy alone this afternoon. She told me at once. Then in came Steve, and he--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your charming {{daughter}} and I {{have been talking}} about Clovelly," [...] he continued. [...] "I have just been spending a little holiday in that delightful place.

6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you," [...] {{he said at}} last fervently, [...] "that if that packet was stolen from Miss Van Teyl by Nikasti, it was done without my instigation.

5000|$|The score uniquely {{requires}} the soloist {{to move about}} the concert hall during the performance. Saariaho described this decision in the score program notes, writing, [...] "It came as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> even <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the work began to come alive in its space, and that the clarinet - itself a unicorn - plays only some of its music in the soloist's position. This appropriation of space became an inherent element of the work at the composition stage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Chairman, I'm not a {{delegate}} to this convention, {{and so it}} isn't my place to speak here; but I {{want to say that}} if I was, I should second this nomination. It's <b>a</b> complete <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have him nominated. If I had known of it before, I would have been working for him all along. I'm pledged in another direction; but if I could honorably withdraw my support from the regular nominee, I would do everything I could to elect my old classmate and esteemed colleague." ...|$|R
