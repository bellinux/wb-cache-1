The influence of initial pH, adding Al 2 (SO 4) 3 dose and <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> sludge on electroosmotic dewatering behavior was investigated.

30|$|Normally, the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of the AC is {{dependent}} on the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of the precursor. The ash is a non-carbon material, which is usually mineral additive that is not attached {{to the surface of the}} carbon. It can influence the adsorptive capacity of the prepared AC as it is linked directly to the pore structure of the AC. In other words, when the value of the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> decreases, the efficiency and adsorptive capacity of the prepared AC increase. Based on the experimental results as shown in Table  1, the impregnated carbon with H 3 PO 4 had more <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> compared to physical AC. The physical AC contained 3.20  % ash and the rest of the chemical AC had an increasing trend of <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> the range of 4 – 6  %. By altering H 3 PO 4 concentration, this could bring about very significant changes <b>in</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of the prepared AC. This is due to some chemical remained in the AC after washing which contributed to the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> the AC [17]. Thus, these entrapped polyphosphates in the AC contribute to high <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> and lower the surface area on the final product as the concentration of H 3 PO 4 increases [18].|$|R

40|$|Triticale {{is a high}} {{yielding}} {{cereal grain}} which performs well as a dual-purpose crop (both mid-season biomass and end-season grain harvests), however, is usually inferior to wheat under the requirements of a high-value milling grain market. There is potential to increase the profitability of dual-purpose triticale by improving grain quality for food products. Currently the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of triticale grain is above acceptable limits and protein content is usually below the requirement for a milling market. This research compared the yield, test weight, <b>ash</b> and protein <b>content</b> of four winter triticale genotypes in replicated grain only and dual-purpose treatments over five year-site environments, based on a previously reported hypothesis that removal of triticale biomass reduces grain <b>ash</b> <b>content.</b> Cutting had a highly variable influence on yield and protein <b>content</b> between genotypes. <b>Ash</b> <b>content</b> was either unaffected or increased by cutting, again depending on the genotype. <b>Ash</b> <b>content</b> was negatively correlated with both stage of plant development when cut (explaining 82 % of the variation) and amount of dry matter removed (explaining 65 % of the variation). The results suggest that <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> dual-purpose triticale grain may be reduced by combining suitable cultivars with later cutting; however, this may also decrease the grain protein content.

40|$|The {{roots and}} {{leaves of the}} {{halophytic}} plant Zygophyllum qatarense Hadidi from saline and non-saline habitats in Bahrain island were analysed for their <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> during four seasons: winter, spring, summer and fall. <b>Ash</b> <b>content</b> of leaves was higher than that in the roots from the two habitats. Statistical analyses of the results showed significant seasonal differences <b>in</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> <b>in</b> both roots and leaves {{in each of the}} two habitats. Comparison between the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of leaves from the two habitats showed {{no significant difference between the}} averages for the leaves in all seasons except in the spring. Root comparisons showed significant differences between the two habitats in all seasons except in the fall. The results demonstrated that the change in soil salinity is reflected, at least in some seasons, <b>in</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of Z. qatarense. The only significant difference <b>in</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> between the leaves of the two habitats was during spring. However, the only nonsignificant difference <b>in</b> the <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> between the roots of the two habitats was during the fall...|$|R
