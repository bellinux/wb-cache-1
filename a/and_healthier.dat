5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better <b>and</b> <b>healthier</b> fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier <b>and</b> <b>healthier</b> without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset and she thinks about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Bart is {{not ready}} for the {{upcoming}} Springfield Elementary science fair. He ends up working with Martin Prince and after Bart {{comes up with a}} general idea—cool robotics—Martin does all the work and constructs an adorable robotic baby seal. However, it is revealed that when the wiring is tampered with, they become violent attackers. The seal wins first prize at the Fair, to Lisa's disdain. When she goes to the Springfield Retirement Castle to whine about the injustice to Grampa, the seniors citizen see the seal visibly cheer up Jasper and the value of the invention becomes clear. All of the senior citizens then get their own seals, and they become happier <b>and</b> <b>healthier,</b> which angers a consortium of local businesses (led by the local funeral home) who want the oldsters to go back to being miserable and more rapidly dying. The group figures out the wiring secret and reworks the seals so their fury returns, even causing the death of Mrs. Glick. Chief Wiggum has all the robots impounded. Bart and Martin enlist the aid of Professor Frink who then gets a larger group of nerds to remotely hack into the robot software and make them nice again. They succeed and as a result, Chief Wiggum releases all the seals, who return to the nursing home.|$|E

The {{objective}} of the research was to examine employees’ perceived barriers and facilitators of physical activity <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices, <b>and</b> managers’ perceptions of how to facilitate physical activity <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices among their team members. Design. A cross-sectional and qualitative design was used. Setting. Participants were employees from a large public sector organisation (N= 121), who were asked about the barriers to and facilitators of maintaining regular exercise <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices. Managers were additionally asked about methods for facilitating physical activity <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices among their team members. Methods. The research used both quantitative and qualitative methodology, with categorical and open ended survey questions. Results. Thematic analysis revealed similar themes for both physical activity <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices, with participants citing working patterns, commuting times, family commitments, job characteristics, and lack of motivation as barriers to exercise <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices. Both employees and managers identified similar facilitators of exercise <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> dietary choices, such as improved information, facilities, and working routines. Conclusion. The results provide an insight into the perceived barriers and facilitators to adopting a healthy lifestyle among a sample of employees with differing shift patterns and job roles.

40|$|The active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing measure {{reported}} here is {{calculated for the}} 28 European Union countries, with a specific focus on {{the current generation of}} older people and by using the latest data from multiple surveys. It covers diverse aspects of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing, by measuring older people’s contribution with respect to not just employment but also their unpaid familial, social and cultural contributions <b>and</b> their independent, <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> secure living. The article presents the first-of-its-kind quantitative measure of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing in the literature on active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing which hitherto has focused largely on concepts, definitions and public policy strategies. In this pursuit, an important contribution of this measure, referred to as the Active Ageing Index (‘AAI’), is that it also captures how countries differ with respect to capacity and enabling environments for active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing. The AAI offers a breakdown not just by four domains of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing but also by gender. Key findings are that Sweden comes {{at the top of the}} country ranking, followed closely by Denmark, the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland. The four southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, Spain and Malta) are middle-ranked countries. Greece and many of the Central European countries are at the bottom, highlighting much greater untapped potentials of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing among older people in these countries and a need for greater policy efforts. Women fare worse than men in most countries, identifying a need for an emphasis on reducing gender disparity in experiences of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing. The AAI tool developed has the potential to identify the social policy mechanisms behind the differential achievements of active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing, for example, what active <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> ageing strategies have driven top performers, and in what respect the bottom-ranked countries have lagged behind...|$|R
