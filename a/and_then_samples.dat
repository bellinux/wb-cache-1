This search is automatic and unconscious, which is how the authors would explain how an answer [...] "pops" [...] into one's head. The items which are eventually recovered, or recalled, are those with the strongest associations to the cue item, here blanket. Once an item has been recovered it is evaluated, here the participant would decide whether blanket - word matches blanket - ocean. If there is a match, or if the participant believes there is a match, the recovered word is output. Otherwise the search starts from the beginning using different cues or weighting cues differently if possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to change}} the duration or pitch of a digital audio clip is to resample it. This is a mathematical operation that effectively rebuilds a continuous waveform from its samples <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>samples</b> that waveform again at a different rate. When the new samples are played at the original sampling frequency, the audio clip sounds faster or slower. Unfortunately, the frequencies in the sample are always scaled {{at the same rate}} as the speed, transposing its perceived pitch up or down in the process. In other words, slowing down the recording lowers the pitch, speeding it up raises the pitch, and using this method the two effects cannot be separated. This is analogous to speeding up or slowing down an analogue recording, like a phonograph record or tape, creating the Chipmunk effect. A drum track containing no pitched instruments could be moderately resampled for tempo without adverse effects, but a pitched track cannot.|$|E

Next, for each instance point in the new positive class, the method first finds its k-nearest neighbors in negative class instances with MapReduce, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>sample</b> instance points along the line between the instance and its k-nearest negative neighbors. The process of oversampling is repeated p times. In the second stage, the algorithm sample instances l times from the negative class with {{the same size as the}} generated positive class instances. Each round of sampling, the method puts positive class and negative class instances together thus obtains l balanced data subsets.|$|R
