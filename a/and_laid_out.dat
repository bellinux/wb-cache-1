5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in houses constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> to maximize the use of available space.|$|E
5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. About the year 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, <b>and</b> <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
