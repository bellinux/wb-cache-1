5000|$|The {{measurement}} of the internal audit function can involve a balanced scorecard approach. Internal audit functions are primarily evaluated based {{on the quality of}} counsel and information provided to the Audit Committee and top management. However, this is primarily qualitative and therefore difficult to measure. [...] "Customer surveys" [...] sent to key managers after each audit engagement or report can be used to measure performance, with an annual survey to the Audit Committee. Scoring on dimensions such as professionalism, quality of counsel, timeliness of work product, utility of meetings, and quality of status updates are typical with such surveys. Understanding the expectations of senior management and the audit committee represent important steps in developing a performance measurement process, as well as how such measures help align the audit function with organizational priorities. Independent peer reviews are part of the quality assurance process for many internal <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> as they are often required by standards. The resulting peer review report is made available to the Audit Committee.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} found that {{auditors}} 2 ̆ 7 fraud detection rates are relatively low (Bernardi 1994; Pincus 1991). The present study examines whether counterexplaining inaccurate judgments will increase fraud detection rates and whether <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> can counterexplain more effectively compared to individual auditors. The possible negative effect of counterexplanation is examined by requiring <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> and individual auditors to counterexplain accurate judgments. The purpose of this 2 ̆ 7 inanipulatiori is to determine whether counterexplaining accurate judgments will lead to negative belief revision, and whether this negative belief revision will be mitigated by the use of <b>audit</b> <b>groups.</b> A 2 x 2 x 2 experiment which examined groups/individuals, initial judgment and explanation/ counterexplanation was carried out. The results support the hypotheses that counterexplaining inaccurate judgments leads to more accurate judgments and counterexplaining accurate judgments leads to less accurate judgments.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{methods have}} been used to {{determine}} the prevalence and treatment of diabetes. Despite the large number of studies, previous estimations of prevalence and treatment have been carried out on relatively small numbers of patients, and then in only a few practices in single geographical regions. AIM: To investigate the feasibility of collating data from multi-practice audits organized by primary care <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in order to estimate the prevalence and treatment of patients with known diabetes, and to discuss the methodological issues and reasons for variation. METHOD: A postal questionnaire survey of all primary care <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in England and Wales that had conducted a multi-practice audit of diabetes between 1993 - 1995. Prevalence rates and patterns of diabetic care were compared with other community-based surveys of known diabetes from 1986 - 1996 identified on MEDLINE. RESULTS: Twenty-five (43 %) <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> supplied data from multi-practice audits of diabetes. Seven (28 %) multi-practice audits involving 259 practices fulfilled the inclusion criteria for prevalence estimation. The overall prevalence of diabetes based on a population of 1, 475, 512 patients was 1. 46 % (range between <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> = 1. 18 % to 1. 66 %; chi 2 = 308; df = 6; P < 0. 0001). Male to female ratio was 1. 15 : 1. Treatment of diabetes could be ascertained for 10 (40 %) <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> comprising 319 practices. Of these, 23. 4 % (range = 16. 5 %- 27. 4 %) were controlled by diet, 48. 5 % (range = 43. 6 %- 55. 8 %) were prescribed oral hypoglycaemic drugs, and 28. 2 % (range = 25. 0 %- 32. 4 %) were treated with insulin. There were significant variations between <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> in treatment pattern (chi 2 = 250; df = 18; P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Prevalence and treatment rates of diabetes and other chronic diseases can be assessed and compared using data from multi-practice audits. Collation of audit data could improve the precision of quantitative estimates of health status in populations. A standard method of data recording and collection may provide a new approach that could considerably improve our ability to monitor disease and its management...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since 1991, all general {{practices}} have {{been encouraged to}} undertake clinical audit. <b>Audit</b> <b>groups</b> report that participation is high, and some local surveys have been undertaken, but no detailed national survey has been reported. AIM: To determine audit activities in general practices and the perceptions of general practitioners (GPs) regarding the future of clinical audit in primary care. METHOD: A questionnaire on audit activities was sent to 707 practices from 18 medical audit advisory group areas. The <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> had been ranked by annual funding from 1992 to 1995. Six groups were selected at random from the top, middle, and lowest thirds of this rank order. RESULTS: A total of 428 (60. 5 %) usable responses were received. Overall, 346 (85 %) responders reported 125. 7 audits {{from the previous year}} with a median of three audits per practice. There was no correlation between the number of audits reported and the funding per GP for the medical audit advisory group. Of 997 audits described in detail, changes were reported as 'not needed' in 220 (22 %), 'not made' in 142 (14 %), 'made' in 439 (44 %), and 'made and remeasured' in 196 (20 %). Thus, 635 (64 %) audits were reported to have led to changes. Some 853 (81 %) of the topics identified were on clinical care. Responders made 242 (42 %) positive comments on the future of clinical audit in primary care, and 152 (26 %) negative views were recorded. CONCLUSION: The level of audit activity in general practice is reasonably high, and most of the audits result in change. The number of audits per practice seems to be independent of the level of funding that the medical audit advisory group has received. Although there is room for improvement in the levels of effective audit activity in general practice, continued support by the professionally led <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> could enable all practices to undertake effective audit that leads to improvement in patient care...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{find out}} {{to what extent}} nurses were {{perceived}} to be participating in audit, to identify factors thought to impede their involvement, and to assess progress towards multidisciplinary audit. RESEARCH DESIGN: Qualitative. METHODS: Focus groups and interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Chairs of <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> and audit support staff in hospital, community and primary health care and audit leads in health authorities in the North West Region. RESULTS: In total 99 audit leads/support staff in the region participated representing 89 % of the primary health care <b>audit</b> <b>groups,</b> 80 % of acute hospitals, 73 % of community health services, and 59 % of purchasers. Many <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> remain medically dominated despite recent changes to their structure and organisation. The quality of interprofessional relations, the leadership style of the audit chair, and nurses' level of seniority, audit knowledge, and experience influenced whether groups reflected a multidisciplinary, rather than a doctor centred approach. Nurses were perceived to be enthusiastic supporters of audit, although their active participation in the process was considered substantially less than for doctors in acute and community health services. Practice nurses were increasingly being seen as the local audit enthusiasts in primary health care. Reported obstacles to nurses' participation in audit included hierarchical nurse and doctor relationships, lack of commitment from senior doctors and managers, poor organisational links between departments of quality and audit, work load pressures and lack of protected time, availability of practical support, and lack of knowledge and skills. Progress towards multidisciplinary audit was highly variable. The undisciplinary approach to audit was still common, particularly in acute services. Multidisciplinary audit was more successfully established in areas already predisposed towards teamworking or where nurses had high involvement in decision making. Audit support staff were viewed as having {{a key role in}} helping teams to adopt a collaborative approach to audit. CONCLUSION: Although nurses were undertaking audit, and some were leading developments in their settings, a range of structural and organisational, interprofessional and intraprofessional factors was still impeding progress. If the ultimate goal of audit is to improve patient care, the obstacles that make it difficult for nurses to contribute actively to the process must be acknowledged and considered...|$|E

Prior research found that auditors 2 ̆ 7 judgments {{were not always}} optimum.

In addition, I hypothesised that the relation between audit experience and responsiveness to training has an inverted-U shaped value function. The results showed {{this to be the}} case.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of three different methods of promoting secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care. DESIGN: Pragmatic, unblinded, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Warwickshire. SUBJECTS: 21 general practices received intervention; outcome measured in 1906 patients aged 55 - 75 years with established coronary heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Audit of notes with summary feedback to primary health care team (audit group); assistance with setting up a disease register and systematic recall of patients to general practitioner (GP recall group); assistance with setting up a disease register and systematic recall of patients to a nurse led clinic (nurse recall group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 18 months' follow up: adequate assessment (defined) of 3 risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status); prescribing of hypotensive agents, lipid lowering drugs, and antiplatelet drugs; blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and plasma cotinine levels. RESULTS: Adequate assessment of all 3 risk factors was much {{more common in the}} nurse and GP recall groups (85 %, 76 %) than the audit group (52 %). The advantage in the nurse recall compared with the audit group was 33 % (95 % confidence interval 19 % to 46 %); in the GP recall group compared with the audit group 23 % (10 % to 36 %), and in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 9 % (- 3 % to 22 %). However, these differences in assessment were not reflected in clinical outcomes. Mean blood pressure (148 / 80, 147 / 81, 148 / 81 mm Hg), total cholesterol (5. 4, 5. 5, 5. 5 mmol/l), and cotinine levels (% probable smokers 17 %, 16 %, 19 %) varied little between the nurse recall, GP recall, and <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> respectively, as did prescribing of hypotensive and lipid lowering agents. Prescribing of antiplatelet drugs was higher in the nurse recall group (85 %) than the GP recall or <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> (80 %, 74 %). After adjustment for baseline levels, the advantage in the nurse recall group compared with the audit group was 10 % (3 % to 17 %), in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 8 % (1 % to 15 %) and in the GP recall group compared with the audit group 2 % (- 6 % to 10 %). CONCLUSIONS: Setting up a register and recall system improved patient assessment at 18 months' follow up but was not consistently better than audit alone in improving treatment or risk factor levels.

This study introduces a structured interacting electronic brainstorming platform into the audit context and examines whether it improves auditors’ fraud brainstorming performance in the fraud hypotheses generation task when compared with the non-structured interacting electronic brainstorming platform which has been investigated in prior literature. In the structured interacting electronic brainstorming platform, idea inputs are shown by categories rather than in chronological sequence on a computer screen.

The aim {{of the study was to}} identify maternal deaths in the five Nordic countries, to classify causes of death based on internationally acknowledged criteria, and to identify areas that would benefit from further teaching, training or research to possibly reduce the number of maternal deaths. We present data for the years 2005 - 2013. National <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> collected data by linkage of registers and direct reporting from hospitals. Each case was then assessed to determine the cause of death, and level of care provided. Potential improvements to care were evaluated. We registered 168 maternal deaths, 90 direct and 78 indirect cases. The maternal mortality ratio was 7. 2 / 100 000 live births ranging from 6. 8 to 8. 1 between the countries. Cardiac disease (n = 29) was the most frequent cause of death, followed by preeclampsia (n = 24), thromboembolism (n = 20) and suicide (n = 20). Improvements to care which could potentially have made a difference to the outcome were identified in one-third of the deaths, i. e. in as many as 60 % of preeclamptic, 45 % of thromboembolic, and 32 % of the deaths from cardiac disease. Direct deaths exceeded indirect maternal deaths in the Nordic countries.

40|$|AIM: To {{develop a}} {{necropsy}} related audit system to record accurate information {{in relation to}} necropsy requests, necropsy rates and coronial referrals. METHODS: A simple audit form was used to record detailed necropsy related data via an integrated questionnaire design and data entry system based on available optical image scanning technology. The system recorded the numbers and locations of deaths, referrals to the coroner, clinical necropsy requests, hospital and medicolegal necropsies, the grade of clinician involved in these processes, and {{the identity of the}} consultant in charge of the case. The overall, hospital and medicolegal necropsy rates were calculated by individual consultant, specialty and for the whole hospital. Necropsy request rates and coronial referral rates were also calculated and these data were related to the grade of clinician. All data were available on a monthly or an accumulative basis. RESULTS: Of 1398 deaths, 534 (38 %) were discussed with the local coroner's office and 167 of these were accepted for further investigation. House officers and senior house officers referred over 80 % of all cases, whereas consultants referred only 2 %. There {{were no significant differences in}} case acceptance rates by grade of clinician. Clinicians made 307 hospital necropsy requests (overall hospital necropsy request rate 22 %). House officers made 65 % of all necropsy requests. Consultant necropsy requests represented 13 % of all requests. There were no significant differences in necropsy request success rates by grade of clinician. CONCLUSIONS: The referral of cases to coroners and clinical necropsy requests are still being inappropriately delegated to the most junior clinicians. This study illustrates the type of useful information which can be produced for individual clinicians, specialty <b>audit</b> <b>groups</b> and pathology departments using a simple necropsy related audit system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and voluntary labour initiatives (codes of conduct and standards) with special reference to banana production in Costa Rica. Costa Rica is the third biggest supplier of bananas to the United Kingdom (UK), but market access {{is determined by the}} major UK supermarket groups, and the terms and conditions dictated by these powerful actors impact the labour conditions on banana plantations. In this regard the banana supply chain is increasingly viewed as 'buyer-driven' and as such, the theoretical framework employed in the research is based on global commodity chain studies (Gereffi 1994, Gereffi et al. 2005). The thesis draws on interviews and focus groups organised with banana workers and their representatives over a two month period in 2006. However, the banana supply chain is not a simple linear model in terms of control and influence there is a high degree of complexity regarding the social relations within it. The chain includes major transnational producers and trade unions, and an international framework agreement (IFA) is in place on some plantations, and there are also other interested parties - <b>audit</b> <b>groups,</b> NGOs and civil society groups [...] -concerned with labour conditions on plantations. Interviews were conducted with these social actors both prior and following the period of fieldwork in Costa Rica. The thesis also reports on the Second International Banana Conference held in April 2005, a forum for the major players to debate the issues and conditions within the industry. The thesis shows that the leading supermarkets have considerable power over suppliers/producers. However, it is argued that the supermarkets' professed desire to act socially responsibly to those workers employed on plantations is contradicted by the downward pressure exerted on the price of bananas and that this contributes to a downward spiral of labour conditions.
