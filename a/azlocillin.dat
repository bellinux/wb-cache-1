40|$|The anti-pseudomonas {{activities}} of <b>azlocillin</b> and mezlocillin {{were compared with}} that of ticarcillin.

We then infused 5 g of each drug into 10 volunteers on three consecutive days and determined the serum levels of the three antibiotics at 1 -h intervals from 1 to 6 h after injection.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>azlocillin</b> {{were studied}} in 10 cystic fibrosis patients, {{ranging in age}} from 11 to 28 years. The patients received a 9 - to 23 -day course of 350 mg of <b>azlocillin</b> per kg in four or six divided daily doses in combination with am aminoglycoside. Blood and urine samples were collected at specified times after the last dose of the course of <b>azlocillin</b> therapy and then assayed for <b>azlocillin</b> content. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analysis. Mean values for serum half-life (1. 74 h), disposition constant (0. 41 h- 1), total body clearance (123 ml/kg per h), and renal clearance (58 ml/kg per h) were determined. All patients exhibited improvement with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters and displayed no adverse reactions.

40|$|<b>Azlocillin</b> was {{relatively}} ineffective against actively growing cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in tests of bacteriolytic and bactericidal {{activity in which}} ticarcillin demonstrated pronounced bactericidal effects {{over a wide range}} of concentrations. Microscopic observation showed that <b>azlocillin</b> generally induced the formation of filamentous cells of P. aeruginosa which lysed only slowly, but ticarcillin caused the production of spheroplasts and subsequent rapid lysis. During the course of the bactericidal tests, <b>azlocillin</b> was inactivated, presumably by the beta-lactamase produced by P. aeruginosa, and the filamentous cells resumed normal cell division and growth. In contrast, there was no loss of ticarcillin activity, and {{there was no evidence of}} resumption of growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of ticarcillin. These results suggest that the different bactericidal effects demonstrated by <b>azlocillin</b> and ticarcillin against P. aeruginosa are related primarily to dose-related differences in inhibition of cell wall synthesis and secondarily to the instability of <b>azlocillin</b> to pseudomonal beta-lactamase...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>azlocillin,</b> a new semisynthetic penicillin, was determined against 582 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>azlocillin,</b> a new wide-spectrum antibiotic of the N-substituted {{group of}} ureidomethyl penicillins, {{was investigated in}} 10 subjects with normal and in 32 subjects with impaired renal functions.

40|$|An {{increase}} before lysis in {{the optical}} density of cultures of Escherichia coli {{has been observed}} with ampicillin or <b>azlocillin</b> when concentrations were higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations.

By destroying the antibiotic activity with a beta-lactamase, after 30 min. one, two, three and four hours of contact, it was shown that the delay for culture regrowth depended on the ampicillin concentration, not on the <b>azlocillin</b> concentration. In conclusion, a relationship was established between the early response of the growth curve of Escherichia coli to various concentrations of ampicillin and <b>azlocillin</b> and the delay of regrowth after enzymatic inactivation of both antibiotics.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{activities}} of <b>azlocillin</b> and ticarcillin against Pseudo-monas aeruginosa were compared by estimating minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) in liquid and solid media, and by constructing killing curves from sequential viable counts.
