40|$|We have {{implemented}} three parallel sorting algorithms on the Con-nection Machine Supercomputer model CM- 2 : B <b>atcher’s</b> bitonic sort, a parallel radix sor ~ and a sample sort similar to Reif and Valiant’s flashsort. We have also evaluated {{the implementation of}} many other sorting algorithms proposed in the literature. Our computational experiments show that the sample sort algo-rithm, which is a theoretically efficient “randomized ” algorithm, is the fastest of the three algorithms on large data sets. On a 64 K-processor CM- 2, our sample sort implementation can sort 32 x 106 64 -bit keys in 5. 1 seconds, which is over 10 {{times faster than the}} CM- 2 library sort. Our implementation of radix sort, although not as fast on large data sets, is deterministic, much simpler to code, stable, faster with small keys, and faster on small data sets (few elements per processor), Our implementation of bitonic sor ~ which is pipelined to use all the hypercube wires simultaneously, is the least efficient of the three on large data sets, but is the most efficient on small data sets, and is considerably more space efficient. This paper analyzes the three algorithms in detail and discusses many practical issues that led us to the particular implementations. ...|$|R
