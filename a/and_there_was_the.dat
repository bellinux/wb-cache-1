5|$|David's time as Prince of the Cumbrians and Earl {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of his life as a great territorial lord. His earldom probably began in 1113, when Henry I arranged David's marriage to Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, who was the heiress to the Huntingdon–Northampton lordship. As her husband, David used the title of earl, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> prospect that David's children by her would inherit all the honours borne by Matilda's father Waltheof. 1113 is the year when David, for the first time, can be found in possession of territory in what is now Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the crash had long-reaching repercussions in the rail industry. In 2015, at the 15th anniversary of the accident, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a new system for handling maintenance introduced by Network Rail was confusing, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> potential for a similar accident to re-occur. The union's general secretary said that Network Rail needed to act on their concerns, otherwise there would be industrial action.|$|E

The inner casing {{contained}} the explosive while the outer contained scrap that was intended to be used as shrapnel. Generally, the No 6 was used in preference to the No 7 as it was lighter <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> possibility of shrapnel from the No 7 hitting friendly soldiers.|$|E

25|$|By 1990, {{some areas}} of the ground were {{becoming}} outdated, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> need for the stadium to become all-seater following the outcome of the Taylor Report in January that year, and the Platt Lane stand was demolished in 1992.

25|$|An {{opening of}} a second front in Europe was {{expected}} by the Germans and islanders. When it came on 6 June 1944 the joy and expectation of a swift liberation were slowly shattered {{when it became clear}} that the islands would be ignored. The isolation of the islands turned to fear, fuel and food supplies had been cut <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> prospect of a long cold winter. German morale went into free fall.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} feared {{that it may}} be {{possible}} for Windows and Windows applications to run natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it. There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an Osborne effect, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the Intel Inside branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take time and money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's {{interest}} in education went still further than school and university classrooms; {{he made a}} great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, {{many of which were}} published afterwards, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly {{to reach out to the}} literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the Westminster Review, the Saturday Review, the Reader, the Pall Mall Gazette, Macmillan's Magazine, the Contemporary Review. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find out what was going on by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.|$|E

25|$|Maurice again {{returned}} to the West Indies in July 1808, joining the fleet at Barbados under Sir Alexander Cochrane. He carried with him a letter of recommendation from the Admiralty, and Cochrane appointed him governor of Marie-Galante, a commission confirmed by the Admiralty on 18 January 1809 with a promotion to post-captain. Marie-Galante had not been long in British possession, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> risk of an uprising. Maurice had only 400 soldiers under his command, {{many of whom were}} seriously ill. A regiment was raised from the black population, but its loyalty was suspect. The issue became moot as the French never attacked the island. When Maurice became ill he resigned his commission to return to Britain.|$|E
500|$|Elements of the comic's story {{carry over}} into the episode, such as his {{confusion}} between a sonic screwdriver and a toothbrush, and the Doctor's aptitude at football. However, Roberts said that the episode was [...] "a completely different situation" [...] from the comic strip, as the Doctor did not know Craig as he did Mickey, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> added enemy of the upstairs apartment. When Roberts began writing for the episode, he knew the series' overarching plot but was not aware who was to be cast as the Eleventh Doctor. Roberts based the Doctor's lines on those written in Moffat's completed scripts and further characterization was added by Matt Smith's reading of the lines.|$|E
500|$|However, Fisher {{was going}} through a divorce, and his {{personal}} situation meant that he was unable to perform the rewrites. This meant that script editor Douglas Adams, aided by Graham Williams, had to perform a complete rewrite of the story {{over the course of a}} weekend. According to Adams, Graham Williams [...] "took me back to his place, locked me in his study and hosed me down with whisky and black coffee for a few days, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> script". The revised script, now titled The Curse of the Sephiroth, was credited to [...] "David Agnew", a standard pseudonym used by the BBC and which had been previously used on Doctor Who for the season fifteen serial The Invasion of Time. The serial was subsequently retitled City of Death on 8 May 1979. Adams would later reuse elements of City of Death, along with the unfinished Doctor Who serial Shada (1979; 2003), in his novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (1987). In Part One, Romana makes a throwaway reference to a great art gallery called the Braxiatel Collection; the Virgin New Adventures novel series would later expand on this, introducing the character Irving Braxiatel, a Time Lord. Braxiatel also appears in the Bernice Summerfield series of novels and audio dramas and in the Gallifrey series of audio dramas.|$|E

500|$|Growing up in New Zealand without {{television}} {{until the}} 1960s, Dale developed {{a love of}} theatre and amateur dramatics. His first performance was for a school concert, {{at the age of}} 13, doing an impression of comedian Shelley Berman. His parents became founding members of an amateur theatre in Auckland called [...] "The Little Dolphin Theatre". Dale often operated the stage equipment used to produce weather effects, and whenever he was on stage he loved the applause. Although a skilled rugby player, Dale opted to move into drama instead because [...] "the acting fraternity didn't like footballers and the footballers didn't like actors. [...] Acting gave me the same buzz <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> chance of a longer career." [...] He gave up rugby at the age of 21 because it was not considered a workable career at the time, and he had to support his family. Acting roles were limited in New Zealand so Dale worked in multiple jobs, including as a male model, a car salesman and a realtor. While working as a milkman he heard the disc jockey at his local radio station resign during a broadcast. Dale went over to the station and told the managers he could do a better job. They gave him a trial and then signed him up for the afternoon show, which led to him landing his first TV role, and at the age of 27 he decided to become a professional actor.|$|E
500|$|Pierce married Gloria McCreadie, who he {{had dated}} since high school, on October 22, 1949, {{and they have}} three children, William Reed (born July 6, 1953), Patricia [...] "Patti" [...] Crowley (born October 4, 1955) and Robert Walter (born July 16, 1958). Pierce told one {{interviewer}} of his wife, [...] "She's not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> day I {{had to go to}} Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – and tell him that he'd better change our bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too." [...] Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side's landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox's death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day's game against the Cleveland Indians, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois on July 31, 2015 at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Alsip.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{plans to}} replace the Kleppestø–Nøstet Ferry with a bridge, which would allow the island of Askøy to have a fixed link, was {{launched}} in the 1960s. Various proposals were made, including placing the bridge further east and closer to Bergen, and building a submerged floating tunnel. In the early 1970s, a toll company was established to finance the bridge, but the planned costs were too high to cover with just tolls <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lack of a motorway to Bergen from the west. [...] Because of this, {{the construction of the}} bridge was postponed. In the early 1980s, there was controversy about whether advanced tolls should be charged on the ferry, but these were ultimately charged from 1984 until the bridge opened. Construction started in 1989 and the bridge opened ahead of schedule on 12 December 1992, along with a new section of the road which included the Stongafjell Tunnel and Olsvik Tunnel. The bridge remained a toll road until 2006.|$|E

U-557 had also suffered her first death; a mechanic sustained fatal head injuries in the after torpedo room. A human chain of sailors was formed, passing buckets of sea water to each other, {{in an attempt to}} shift some of the weight from the stern to the bow. After many hour's toil, the boat pivoted so that the bow hit the bottom. But the sheer weight of water (about 40 tons) prevented U-557 from reaching the surface. The boat, having exhausted its supply of compressed air, stayed on the sea bed. The crew, {{under the direction of the}} Chief Engineer, rocked the boat by moving rapidly from stern to bow and back again. The submarine eventually worked herself free.
