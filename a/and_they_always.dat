5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
25|$|While the new {{paradigm}} is rarely as expansive {{as the old}} paradigm in its initial stages, it must nevertheless have significant promise for future problem-solving. As a result, though {{new paradigm}}s seldom or never possess all the capabilities of their predecessors, they usually preserve {{a great deal of}} the most concrete parts of past achievement <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> permit additional concrete problem-solutions besides.|$|E
25|$|They are {{believed}} to be predators like their larger relatives, feeding on minuscule insects in their habitat. Their mating habits are unknown, except that they lay only a few relatively large eggs at a time.

They can be found on every continent, except in Arctic and Antarctic regions.|$|E

25|$|Modern prisoners {{occupy the}} lowest rungs {{on the social}} class ladder, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a {{collection}} of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.|$|E
500|$|The {{crew of the}} Irish Oak became acutely uneasy {{after her}} engine failed and she was left behind by SC55, dead in the water, {{to wait for a}} tugboat; this, coupled with the {{experiences}} of other Irish ships, especially in OG 71, the [...] "Nightmare Convoy" [...] in August1941, resolved Irish crews and owners to sail as neutrals, out-of-convoy. Thereafter Irish ships were clearly marked and fully lit, usually sailing out-of-convoy on a direct course, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> answered SOS calls for assistance. Irish ships rescued 534 men; yet lost 20% of their seamen.|$|E

Former Montreal Canadiens' coach Claude Ruel commented that the Soviets' {{forwards}} {{were one of the}} most finely honed units he had ever seen. [...] "They are always moving, never standing around, they head-man the puck as well as anyone has ever done — <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> seem to be in the right place." [...] According to Canada's goaltender Ken Dryden: [...] "We didn't play our game at all. After they tied it up, we started playing a panic type of game. Sometimes there were five men going for the puck at once." [...] At the end of the game, Team Canada accidentally snubbed the Soviets by returning to the dressing room directly without shaking hands with the Soviets after the game.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Kunis {{replaced}} Lacey Chabert in {{the role}} of Meg Griffin on the animated sitcom Family Guy, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox. Kunis won the role after auditions and a slight rewrite of the character, in part due to her performance on That '70s Show. When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her. MacFarlane added: [...] "What Mila Kunis brought to it was in a lot of ways, I thought, almost more right for the character. I say that Lacey did a phenomenal job, {{but there was something about}} Mila– something very natural about Mila. She was 15 when she started, so you were listening to a 15-year-old. Oftentimes with animation they'll have adult actors doing the voices of teenagers <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> sound like Saturday morning voices. They sound oftentimes very forced. She had a very natural quality to Meg that really made what we did with that character kind of really work." [...] Kunis was nominated for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production in 2007. She also voiced Meg in the Family Guy Video Game!. Kunis described her character as [...] "the scapegoat." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 'Sissi' means 'guerrilla' or 'partisan' in the Finnish language, it doesn't mean {{paramilitary}} {{or illegal}} troops without a controlling high command and government. The name only points towards the tactics used in historical guerrilla wars (Freedom fighters / Terrorists). This {{is an important}} difference to note as, unlike guerrilla combatants, Finnish sissi don't hide in the local population <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>always</b> carry a belt, cockade, rifle and other signs which makes these units a legal fighting force, by the UN legal definition, alongside regular units.|$|E
