25|$|In {{situations}} where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's lien, the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a secured creditor or any other creditor prior to the <b>assignment</b> <b>process.</b> Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset.

25|$|The {{dividend}} is {{hopefully the}} payout that the assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the <b>assignment</b> <b>process,</b> regardless of past estimates.

This research used participant experiments to explore the effect of information load on assignment quality: participants, motivated by induced value theory, performed the role of decision makersand information load was identified {{by the number of}} personnel requiring assignment and the number of attributes to be considered. Results varied considerably between participants, despite a relatively homogenous group of participants and low information loads compared to what would be experienced in actual military <b>assignment</b> <b>processes.</b> Having analyzed the shortcomings of manual <b>assignment</b> <b>processes,</b> this research examined two-sided matching as the basis for a decision support system. It was demonstrated that two-sided matching could be used to assign personnel to positions in hierarchies. Multi-attribute utility functions were used to generate position preferences based on a variety of attributes, some relevant to the organization and others to its subordinate units. Computational experiments showed that assignments are responsive to the utility function weights, allowing decision makers to quickly examine various assignment sets under different conditions. The effects of preference list indifference on two-sided matching were also examined. Australian Regular Army autho...|$|R

However some universities especially in developing country contexts are struggling to attain minimal educational benefits from its adoption and use. This paper investigates {{the application of a}} peer <b>assignment</b> review <b>process</b> for collaborative e-learning to third year undergraduate students. The study was aimed at evaluating the effect of the peer <b>assignment</b> review <b>process</b> on the student learning process. Data was collected using a survey questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS Version 16. 0. While the student reported positive impact of the peer <b>assignment</b> review <b>process</b> in terms of facilitating students to put more effort and improve their work; quick feedback on their assignments; effective sharing and development of knowledge and information and the need of computer competence to manipulate the peer assignment review system, analysis of the quantitative data indicated that the process had limited effect on the learning process.

2500|$|When {{the protein}} is {{labelled}} with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 {{it is possible}} to record triple resonance experiments that transfer magnetisation over the peptide bond, and thus connect different spin systems through bonds. This is usually done using some of the following experiments, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. All six experiments consist of a 1H-15N plane (similar to a HSQC spectrum) expanded with a carbon dimension. In the HN(CA)CO, each HN plane contains the peaks from the carbonyl carbon from its residue as well the preceding one in the sequence. The HNCO contains the carbonyl carbon chemical shift from only the preceding residue, but is much more sensitive than HN(CA)CO. [...] These experiments allow each 1H-15N peak to be linked to the preceding carbonyl carbon, and sequential assignment can then be undertaken by matching the shifts of each spin system's own and previous carbons. The HNCA and HN(CO)CA works similarly, just with the alpha carbons (Cα) rather than the carbonyls, and the HNCACB and the CBCA(CO)NH contains both the alpha carbon and the beta carbon (Cβ). Usually several of these experiments are required to resolve overlap in the carbon dimension. This procedure is usually less ambiguous than the NOESY-based method, since it is based on through bond transfer. In the NOESY-based methods additional peaks corresponding to atoms that are close in space but that do not belong to sequential residues will appear, confusing the <b>assignment</b> <b>process.</b> Following the initial sequential resonance assignment it is usually possible to extend the assignment from the Cα and Cβ {{to the rest of the}} sidechain using experiments such as HCCH-TOCSY, which is basically a TOCSY experiment resolved in an additional carbon dimension.|$|E
