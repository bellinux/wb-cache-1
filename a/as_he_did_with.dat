5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E
5|$|Representations of the city, countryside, and {{building}} interiors {{are essential to}} Balzac's realism, often serving to paint a naturalistic backdrop before which the characters' lives follow a particular course; this gave him a reputation as an early naturalist. Intricate details about locations sometimes stretch for fifteen or twenty pages. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the people around him, Balzac studied these places in depth, traveling to remote locations and comparing notes {{that he had made}} on previous visits.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} wreaked during the succession wars between Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, Pompey restored {{the independence of}} Azotus, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> all Hellenising coastal cities (Antiquities Book 14, 4:4). A few years later, in 55 BCE, after more fighting, Roman general Gabinius helped rebuild Ashdod and several other cities left without protective walls (Antiquities Book 14, 5:2). In 30 BCE Ashdod came {{under the rule of}} King Herod, who then bequeathed it to his sister Salome (Antiquities Book 17, 8:1). By the time of the First Jewish–Roman War (66-70), {{there must have been a}} large enough Jewish presence in Ashdod for Vespasian to feel compelled to place a garrison in the city.|$|E
5000|$|Morgan and Casey being tied up is a {{callback}} to [...] "Chuck Versus the Undercover Lover" [...] when Chuck and Casey {{are tied}} up and Casey uses Chuck to kick an enemy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Morgan.|$|R
5000|$|In the July 25, 2003 {{issue of}} Lexington Herald Leader, {{a review of}} the album spoke of the song, stating [...] "Singer Robin Zander sounds as {{comfortable}} with the light stroll of Too Much <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the raise-the-dead scream of If I Could." ...|$|R
50|$|The film also follows several subplots, such as, {{the secret}} romance of Turek's wife {{with a young}} vet, the tribulations of an {{accident-prone}} but respected doctor who has almost as much trouble with his pessimistic patients <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> his car, and the desperate deeds of Pávek's teenage son, who has ardent feelings for an attractive local teacher.|$|R

25|$|On these portraits, Češljar {{proved to}} be a master of drawing and also a subtle and {{aesthetic}} colorist <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> icons. The only exception is rather conventional and cold portrait of Jovan Jovanović Šakabenta.|$|E
25|$|Lemieux {{has opened}} his home to young Penguins {{stars such as}} Marc-André Fleury and Sidney Crosby until they settled into the Pittsburgh area, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Jaromír Jágr {{following}} the 1990 NHL Draft when he lived in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Tsonga's serve {{is one of}} his fastest, {{strongest and}} most {{dominant}} shots, mixing both slice and speed, so enabling him to create and win easier points, such as an ace or a one-two-punch. Because of the action of his serve, which is dramatically abbreviated, <b>he</b> <b>does</b> very well to create as much power <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> speeds of up to 147mph (237km/h).|$|R
50|$|Cohen used miniatures, mattes, and stopmotion {{animation}} {{to create}} the monster <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Q.|$|R

25|$|Azéma {{declares}} {{her love}} to Arzace but warns him of Assur, {{who is trying}} to force her to marry him. Assur appears and quarrels with Arzace. He warns Arzace that he will kill him, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Ninus and Ninias.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> his School, White {{made sure}} that the PPA welcomed women {{and that they were}} {{included}} in its governance. Käsebier was the organization's first honorary vice-president, and women were on its executive committee, nomination committee and the Council of Forty, which included representatives from around the country. According to the PPA's first annual report in 1917, women represented 45 percent of the organization's membership.|$|E
25|$|The last {{phase was}} to take place during or shortly after Phase Two, which was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money {{would be used to}} finance a larger plan, to travel north to Canada. Along the way, they would stop in YMCAs and orphanages {{recruiting}} other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Malvo.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tryan has a {{good many}} friends in the town, though, and friends {{that are likely to}} stand by him too,' said Mr. Pilgrim. 'I should say it would be as well to let him and his lectures alone. If he goes on preaching <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>with</b> such a {{constitution}} as his, he'll get a relaxed throat by-and-by, and you'll be rid of him without any trouble.' ...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of the first book, he carries with him, at all times, an unusual artifact, the [...] "Claw," [...] which {{apparently}} has the power to bring the dead back to life, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Dorcas and, later on, a young soldier (before he brings this young man back to life, Severian seems to realize that he almost prefers the company of the dead to the living).|$|R
50|$|Synopses: AJ embarks {{on an open}} {{relationship}} with Saxon, but both find the politics are far more complicated than they’d anticipated when Saxon chooses “trade” over AJ one night. Wounded, AJ pushes Saxon away and then refuses to accept his genuine apology. Saxon finally accuses AJ of sabotaging their relationship, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> everyone. Confronted by this truth, AJ forgives him and the two get back on good footing.|$|R
25|$|No {{evidence}} of divine right: Even if the Christian God exists, {{there is no}} evidence that the Orange-Nassaus have been given a divine right, and even if they did, any God could also one day withdraw his or her grace from them (<b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> several Old Testament kings, or, according to the 1581 Act of Abjuration on which Dutch independence was based, with Philip II of Spain). Also, considering the secularisation of the Dutch population in recent centuries, fewer and fewer people take this argument seriously.|$|E
25|$|Liberace mostly {{bypassed}} radio {{before trying}} a television career, thinking radio unsuitable given his act's dependency on the visual. Despite his enthusiasm {{about the possibilities}} of television, Liberace was disappointed after his early guest appearances on CBS's The Kate Smith Show, and DuMont's Cavalcade of Stars, with Jackie Gleason (later The Jackie Gleason Show on CBS). Liberace was particularly displeased with the frenetic camera work and his short appearance time. He soon wanted his own show where he could control his presentation <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> his club shows.|$|E
25|$|In {{his three}} other {{first-class}} appearances he chipped {{in with the}} occasional wicket {{but was unable to}} take a big haul. He did however take some big wickets, including Justin Langer twice and against Tasmania he dismissed Ricky Ponting hit wicket. As Cricket Australia chief executive, Sutherland would later work alongside the Australian captain, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Steve Waugh whom he also took the wicket of during his career, on his List A debut. He was part of Victoria's 1992/93 Mercantile Mutual Cup campaign and played in the Final which they lost to New South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Thomaso impresses his compatriots {{with his}} {{wardrobe}} and his wit. He carries on a sexual liaison {{with the famous}} courtesan Angellica, and accepts gifts from her; she defends his conduct. Yet Thomaso also can maintain a more normal and morally and socially correct relationship with a woman when <b>he</b> chooses, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> the virtuous (and wealthy) Serulina. (The play never reconciles the two erotic modes.) ...|$|R
50|$|Rankin/Bass veteran writer Romeo Muller adapted and {{expanded}} {{the story for}} television <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.|$|R
50|$|In the New 52 reboot, Lucifer {{is shown}} to possess power over the human soul itself. However, he has no power over animal souls. He can open and close magical portals to Earth from Hell and back again. He can use this power to either summon or banish demons, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Etrigan. <b>He</b> is clairvoyant, {{possessing}} a heightened perception or knowledge of time, even {{to the extent of}} being able to know the future.|$|R
25|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in August 2013, and the development team wanted to carry over elements from the original Dungeon Keeper games by Bullfrog Productions, especially the humour. Richard Ridings provided the voiceovers, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the previous instalments. The game is noted for its monetization of gameplay by relying on in-app purchases, for which it received widespread criticism. The reliance on in-app purchases also caused outcry in the gaming public. In the UK, Electronic Arts' advertising of the game was ruled to have misled customers, which forced them to amend their adverts. Electronic Arts also faced criticism over filtration of user reviews.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasingly}} {{rapid rate}} of historical retelling that occurs {{near the end}} of the work raises the question of whether the work was completed. Some manuscripts include in their prologues an introduction of the text as running ‘from a to z’, and others end book fourteen with the statement, “Here begins the fifteenth book, lacking P”. However, book thirteen includes a line about ending the series with a history of the Roman emperors. It is possible that the last books have been lost over time, though it is also likely that Fulgentius simply lost interest in the work and gave it a hurried anticlimactic finish, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> other works such as the Content of Virgil.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} {{was one of}} the first portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, and Leonardo {{was one of the}} first painters to use aerial perspective. The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains. Winding paths and a distant bridge give only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} if we will take the story simply as it stands we shall see easily enough. For it is all simple and natural enough. Jacob and Esau, we shall see, were men of like passions with ourselves; men as we are, mixed up of good and evil, {{sometimes}} right and sometimes wrong: and God rewarded them when they did right, and punished them when they <b>did</b> wrong, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> us now.|$|R
60|$|In his plots Bulwer has {{generally}} been simple, facile, and successful. The reader never feels <b>with</b> him, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> Wilkie Collins, that it is all plot, or, as with George Eliot, {{that there is no}} plot. The story comes naturally without calling for too much attention, and is thus proof of the completeness of the man's intellect. His language is clear, good, intelligible English, but it is defaced by mannerism. In all that <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> affectation was his fault.|$|R
50|$|Once again, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Chapman and {{probably}} Kelly, Sgt. Badham conveyed the body via the Police ambulance to the Whitechapel mortuary.|$|R
25|$|Phase Three was to {{take place}} very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. It was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money {{would be used to}} finance a larger plan to travel north into Canada, {{stopping}} enroute at YMCAs and orphanages recruiting other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> Lee Boyd Malvo. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and had arrived in Canada, he would begin their training. Malvo described how Muhammad allegedly intended to train the youths with weapons. After their training was complete, Muhammad would send them out across the United States to carry out mass shootings in many different cities, just as he had done in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.|$|E
25|$|The shah had set great {{store on}} an {{alliance}} with Spain, the chief opponent of the Ottomans in Europe. Abbas offered trading rights {{and the chance to}} preach Christianity in Iran in return for help against the Ottomans. But the stumbling block of Hormuz remained, a port that had fallen into Spanish hands when the King of Spain inherited the throne of Portugal in 1580. The Spanish demanded Abbas break off relations with the English East India Company before they would consider relinquishing the town. Abbas was unable to comply. Eventually Abbas became frustrated with Spain, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> the Holy Roman Empire, which wanted him to make his 400,000+ Armenian subjects swear allegiance to the Pope but did not trouble to inform the shah when the Emperor Rudolf signed a peace treaty with the Ottomans. Contacts with the Pope, Poland and Muscovy were no more fruitful.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> {{his father}} he buried his grief in his work. He {{spent time with}} Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz {{spent much of the}} spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E

50|$|The play resolutely avoids {{demonstrations of}} {{physical}} violence; only Richard dies on-stage, {{while the rest}} (Clarence, the two princes, Hastings, Brackenbury, Grey, Vaughan, Rivers, Anne, Buckingham, and King Edward) all meet their ends off-stage. Despite the villainous nature of the title character and the grim storyline, Shakespeare infuses the action <b>with</b> comic material, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>with</b> most of his tragedies. Much of the humour rises from the dichotomy between how Richard's character is known and how Richard tries to appear.|$|R
