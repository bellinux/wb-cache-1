40|$|SO 2 is {{enriched in}} wry-fuel {{combustion}} due to flue-gas recycle, {{and a significant}} higher SO 3 concentration can be expected compared to air-firing. Since SO 3 can cause high and low temperature corrosion, {{it is important to}} measure the SO 3 concentration under oxy-fuel fired conditions. However, measurement of SO 3 is not straightforward, since SO 3 is a highly reactive gas. This paper presents an experimental study in the Chalmers oxy-fuel test unit, comparing different SO 3 measurement techniques applied during oxy-fuel and air combustion. Propane (60 kW(th)) was used as fuel and SO 2 was injected in the oxidizer to generate a controllable amount of SO 3. The SO 3 concentration was measured with four techniques: the controlled condensation method, the salt method, the isopropanol <b>absorption</b> <b>bottle</b> method, and with the Pentol SO 3 monitor (previously: Severn Science analyzer). The controlled condensation method was used as the standard for comparison. Additionally, the acid dew-point temperature was measured with a dew-point meter. The controlled condensation and the salt method gave comparable results, and the repeatability with these methods was good. The SO 3 concentrations measured with the Pentol SO 3 monitor differed in average less than 20 % from the SO 3 concentrations obtained with the controlled condensation method. With the isopropanol <b>absorption</b> <b>bottle</b> method, a large amount of the SO 2 was absorbed in the isopropanol solution, which gives a positive bias if the SO 2 is oxidized to sulfate in the isopropanol solution. This was minimized by reducing the measurement time, bubbling argon through the absorption bottles after the measurement to force the SO 2 out, and analyzing the solution immediately after the measurement. No principal differences between measuring the SO 3 concentration during oxy-fuel combustion and air-firing were obtained. However, a correction factor for the mass flow meter of the Pentol SO 3 monitor has to be used because of the high CO, concentration during oxy-fuel operation...|$|E
40|$|A separation–preconcentration method utilising a mercapto-modified silica {{microcolumn}} {{was developed}} for the determination of trace amounts of Te(IV) and Te(VI) in waters by hydride generation atomic <b>absorption</b> spectrometry. <b>Bottled</b> drinking water, tap water and sea-water samples were spiked with sub-ng ml− 1 concentrations of Te(IV) and the spiked solutions were subjected to the mercapto-modified silica microcolumn separation and enrichment procedure. The spike recovery values varied between 86 and 114 %. In addition to spike recovery experiments, accuracy was also verified via the analysis of a certified reference material. The limit of detection for Te(IV) in sea-water with a preconcentration factor of 50 was 0. 037 ng ml− 1. The capability of the microcolumn enrichment scheme for on-line sample processing via flow manifolds was demonstrated. A detailed interference study was performed.

40|$|Interaction of menthol with {{polyethylene}} terephthalate bottles during storage time was tested at three different temperatures. Menthol is a mint flavor agent added to yogurt drinks in Iran {{and is considered}} as a factor affecting consumer acceptance. Absorption of menthol to packaging material could cause a loss of quality in the final product due to diminished flavor intensity. Tests were done {{on the effects of}} environmental conditions (storage for three months at temperatures of 4, 25, and 45 °C) on flavor stability of yogurt drink samples. Absorbed flavor was extracted from PET bottles after the specified time periods and quantified using gas chromatography coupled with FID detector. Then, the diffusion coefficient of menthol into PET bottles (Dp) was determined using concentrations of absorbed menthol. Results showed different absorption levels under various conditions. After 90 days, the absorption quantities at 4, 25, and 45 °C were 38. 21, 186. 66 and 700. 50 ng g- 1 of PET bottle, respectively. It was concluded that amounts of menthol <b>absorption</b> into PET <b>bottles</b> increased with storage time and higher temperature. Elevation of storage temperature resulted in significant increase in diffusion coefficient of menthol in PET bottle...|$|R
