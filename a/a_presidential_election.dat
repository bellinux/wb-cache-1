5|$|On 12 April 2012, a coup d'état in Guinea-Bissau {{was staged}} by {{elements}} {{of the armed forces}} about two weeks before the second round of <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> between Carlos Gomes Júnior and Kumba Ialá. The coup started in the evening with military personnel and equipment making its way onto the streets, followed by the state-owned media being taken off-air.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 2008, Zimbabwe held <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> {{along with}} a {{parliamentary}} election. The results of this election were withheld for two weeks, after which it was generally acknowledged that the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC-T) had achieved a majority of one seat in the lower house of parliament.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{constitutional}} amendments made in 2016, <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> will {{be reserved for}} a community in Singapore if no one from that community has been President {{for any of the}} five most recent terms of office of the President. The communities are the Chinese community, the Malay community, and the Indian or other minority communities. Candidates are required to satisfy the usual qualification criteria. The 2017 election was the first reserved election, and was reserved for the Malay community.|$|E

5|$|Kouandété {{launched}} another coup against Soglo on December 17, but he {{was forced}} to hand power to Alley two days later. His administration oversaw {{the creation of a new}} constitution and <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election,</b> Dahomey's first since 1964. The results were annulled because of a boycott that prevented almost three-quarters of the country from voting. Alley lost popularity with the suggestion that the military should retreat back to the barracks, and was eventually reduced to a mouthpiece for Kouandété. On July 17, 1968, Alley was forced to hand power to Emile Zinsou, a veteran politician.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{routinely}} {{votes for}} the Democratic Party, with the core concentrations in the Boston metro area, the Cape and Islands, and Western Massachusetts outside Hampden County. Pockets of Republican strength are in the central areas along the I-495 crescent, Hampden County, and communities on the south and north shores, but {{the state as a}} whole has not given its Electoral College votes to a Republican in <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> since Ronald Reagan carried it in 1984. Additionally, Massachusetts provided Reagan with his smallest margins of victory in both the 1980 and 1984 elections.|$|E
5|$|Also in Oregon v. Mitchell, the Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{the constitutionality of}} various other provisions relating to voter qualifications and prerequisites to voting. The Court upheld Section 202, which prohibits any state or local jurisdiction from requiring people to live in their borders for longer than 30 days before allowing them to vote in <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election.</b> Additionally, the Court upheld the provision lowering the minimum voting age to 18 in federal elections, but it held that Congress exceeded its power by lowering the voting age to 18 in state elections; this precipitated the ratification of the Twenty-sixth Amendment the following year, which lowered the voting age in all elections to 18. The Court was deeply divided in Oregon v. Mitchell, {{and a majority of}} justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.|$|E

5|$|In late March, polls {{suggested}} McCarthy {{would likely}} win the Wisconsin Primary. Around this time, Johnson decided {{to drop out}} of the race. When he informed Humphrey of his decision, the Vice President urged Johnson to remain as a candidate. Johnson replied that it was not in the best interest of the nation to mix the partisan politics of <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> with the ongoing Vietnam crisis, and that if elected, he probably would not be able to complete the term since the men in his family usually died in their early sixties. A week prior to the primary, on March 31, the President publicly announced that he would not seek nor accept the Democratic Party nomination, thus setting the stage for a Humphrey presidential run.|$|E
5|$|President dos Santos {{met with}} Savimbi in Lisbon, Portugal and signed the Bicesse Accords, {{the first of}} three major peace agreements, on 31 May 1991, with the {{mediation}} of the Portuguese government. The accords laid out a transition to multi-party democracy {{under the supervision of the}} United Nations' UNAVEM II mission, with <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> to be held within a year. The agreement attempted to demobilize the 152,000 active fighters and integrate the remaining government troops and UNITA rebels into a 50,000-strong Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). The FAA would consist of a national army with 40,000 troops, navy with 6,000, and air force with 4,000. While UNITA largely did not disarm, the FAA complied with the accord and demobilized, leaving the government disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} is elected {{on the basis}} of universal suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of the votes, a runoff election is held in 14 days. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit to a maximum of two terms in office and requires election dates to be determined within 30 to 60days before the expiry of the term of the incumbent president. Any citizen of Croatia of 18 or over may be a candidate in <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election,</b> provided that the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of the parliament.|$|E

5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to wait until after the election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
5|$|At the 1848 Whig National Convention, Taylor {{defeated}} Henry Clay and Winfield Scott {{to receive}} the Whig nomination for President. For his Vice Presidential nominee the convention chose Millard Fillmore, a prominent New York Whig who had chaired the House Ways and Means Committee and had been a contender for Clay's Vice Presidential nominee in the 1844 election. Fillmore's selection was largely an attempt at reconciliation with northern Whigs, who were furious at the nomination of a slaveowning southerner; all factions of the party were dissatisfied with the final ticket. Taylor continued to minimize {{his role in the}} campaign, preferring not to directly meet with voters or correspond regarding his political views. His campaign was skillfully directed by Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, a friend and early political supporter, and bolstered by a late endorsement from Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts. Taylor defeated Lewis Cass, the Democratic candidate, and Martin Van Buren, the Free Soil candidate, taking 163 of the 290 electoral votes. In the popular vote, he took 47.3%, while Cass won 42.5% and Van Buren won 10.1%. Taylor would be the last Whig to be elected president and the last person elected to the U.S. presidency from neither the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, as well as the last Southerner to win <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>election</b> until Woodrow Wilson's election in 1912.|$|E
