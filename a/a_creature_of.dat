5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} Royal Library of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. <b>A</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light and <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|The hoop snake, <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> {{legend in}} the United States and Australia, {{is said to}} grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like a wheel towards its prey. Japanese culture {{includes}} a similar mythical creature, the Tsuchinoko. Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.|$|E

5|$|Most Democratic {{newspapers}} {{refused to}} support Bryan, the major exception being the New York Journal, controlled by William Randolph Hearst, whose fortune {{was based on}} silver mines. In biased reporting and through the sharp cartoons of Homer Davenport, Hanna was viciously characterized as a plutocrat, trampling on labor. McKinley was drawn as a child, easily controlled by big business. Even today, these depictions still color the images of Hanna and McKinley: one as a heartless businessman, the other as <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> Hanna and others of his ilk.|$|E
5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like beings with supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light and Brother Justin <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E
5|$|After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a {{being named}} Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals {{itself to be}} <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> pure anti-magic. As such, the jewels from Ice King's crown are {{stripped}} of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by Tom Kenny). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by Steve Agee), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.|$|E

5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> their own design across {{a number of}} environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million years ago to 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E

50|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline of the Flashpoint event, G.I. Robot replaces Frankenstein and the Creature Commandos {{after they were}} deemed obsolete by Robert Crane's government services. In the modern era, Robert Crane revives G.I. Robot to eliminate Frankenstein and the <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> the Unknown after they escape from the lab facility. During attacks the <b>Creatures</b> <b>of</b> the Unknown in Gotham City forest, G.I.

25|$|By 1947, when Abba Lerner {{wrote his}} article Money as <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> the State, economists had largely {{abandoned}} {{the idea that}} the value of money was closely linked to gold. Lerner argued that responsibility for avoiding inflation and depressions lay with the state because of its ability to create or tax away money.|$|E
25|$|Many spiders of Middle-earth were of {{enormous}} size and cunning intelligence and some possessed {{the power of}} speech.

Her offspring spread throughout Middle-earth and included Shelob and the Spiders of Mirkwood.|$|E

25|$|The 1911 Act made {{important}} changes in copyright law and practice. The 1911 Act abolished common law copyright in unpublished works, hence completing {{the process that}} began with the 1774 House of Lords decision in Donaldson v Beckett, which held that copyright was <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> statute. The scope of the imperial copyright system (by changes in the UK Act) was expanded to include architecture, sound recordings and motion pictures.|$|E
25|$|During Warlock's {{temporary}} {{possession of}} the Gauntlet, he purged good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> logic. His good and evil aspects take on lives as two new physical beings — the evil half becomes a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half is a woman calling herself the Goddess. When they threaten the universe, Warlock defeats them {{with the aid of}} the Watch and other superheroes, absorbing them into the Soul Gem.|$|E
25|$|The antilopine {{kangaroo}} (Macropus antilopinus) is, essentially, the far-northern {{equivalent of}} the eastern and western grey kangaroos. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the antilopine wallaroo, but in behaviour and habitat it is more similar to red and grey kangaroos. Like them, it is <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious. Its name comes from its fur, which is similar in colour and texture to that of antelopes. Characteristically, the noses of males swell behind the nostrils. This enlarges nasal passages and allows them to release more heat in hot and humid climates.|$|E

25|$|While Tianyuraptor {{is larger}} in size {{than all other}} known microraptorines, it also has {{relatively}} elongated lower hindlimbs, like other microraptorines. In this regard, it is different from most other dromaeosaurids, which have relatively short lower legs. For example, Tianyuraptor has a tibiotarsus/femur length ratio of greater than 1.30, while Velociraptor mongoliensis, <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> similar size, exhibits a ratio of less than 1.10. Aside from elongate hind limbs, Tianyuraptor is different from other members of Microraptorinae {{in regards to the}} relative lengths of the forelimb elements. The forelimbs of Tianyuraptor are proportionally much shorter than those of larger dromaeosaurids. For example, a similar-sized Velociraptor specimen shows an arm/leg length ratio of approximately 0.75., while Tianyuraptor has an arm/leg ratio of 0.53.|$|E
25|$|The modern law of {{contract}} is primarily <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> the industrial revolution and the social legislation of the 20th century. However, the foundations of all European contract law are traceable to obligations in Ancient Athenian and Roman law, while the formal development of English law began after the Norman Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror created a common law across England, but throughout the middle ages the court system was minimal. Access to the courts, in what are now considered contractual disputes, was consciously restricted to a privileged few through onerous requirements of pleading, formalities and court fees. In the local and manorial courts, according to English law's first treatise by Ranulf de Glanville in 1188, if people disputed the payment of a debt they, and witnesses, would attend court and swear oaths (called a wager of law). They risked perjury if they lost the case, and so this was strong encouragement to resolve disputes elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Although {{almost every}} Carnivàle episode has a {{distinctive}} {{story with a}} new carnival setting, all episodes {{are part of an}} overarching good-versus-evil story that only culminates and resolves very late in Season 2. The pilot episode begins with a prologue talking of [...] "a creature of light and <b>a</b> <b>creature</b> <b>of</b> darkness" [...] (also known as Avatars) being born [...] "to each generation" [...] preparing for a final battle. Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, and makes the nature of suggested Avatars a central question. Reviewers believed Ben to be <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Light and Brother Justin <b>a</b> <b>Creature</b> <b>of</b> Darkness.|$|E
