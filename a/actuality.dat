5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria.

[...] Where previously, factual films generally consisted of stand-alone <b>actualities</b> intended for individual show, the programme put together by Paul from Henry Short's sequences was his first attempt to gather short <b>actualities</b> into a longer collective work.

5|$|Atari created prototypes for {{location}} testing, but {{the game}} did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II. Atari assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls. Because the new models were met with the same poor reception, production was halted and the focus shifted to Guardians of the 'Hood, a beat 'em up game. An urban legend states that when WMS Industries purchased Time Warner Interactive (the company which Atari Games had since merged into) in 1996, they ran a steamroller over the Marble Madness II boards in order to clear inventory for tax purposes. In <b>actuality,</b> no Marble Madness II boards were made apart from the prototypes, and according to Cerny at most 12 of these exist. These prototypes have since become collector items.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} genetics suggested {{the concept that}} one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical genetics. In <b>actuality</b> they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became {{molecular genetics}} and all the developments that have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein concept has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.|$|E

Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm.

The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E

5|$|For the battle, Rotmistrov {{ordered his}} tanks {{to move forward}} at high speed to engage the German armour in order to nullify the {{advantages}} the Tiger tanks had in the range and firepower of their 88mm guns.

In fact, Soviet intelligence had greatly overestimated the numbers of Ferdinands and Tigers possessed by the II SS-Panzer Corps. In <b>actuality</b> there were no Ferdinands with the 4th Panzer Army or Army Group South, as they were all deployed on the northern side of the Kursk salient with the 9th Army. Soviet tank-crews frequently mistook the versions of Panzer IV tanks that were armed with the KwK 40 anti-tank gun, which also had extra armour added to their turret, for Tigers; therefore Soviet reports tended to overestimate the number of Tigers employed by the German side during the Battle of Kursk.|$|E

Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog.

50|$|The {{desirability}} of longer films, which enabled nickelodeons {{to grow the}} way they did, {{was the result of}} a number of factors. For one, economic competition between film production companies put pressure on them to create more elaborate, and often longer, films, to differentiate one film from another. Also, longer films were more attractive as the price paid by exhibitors depended on a film's length and the longer a film, the more profit there was to be made. Some exhibitors found longer films more desirable since it made programming easier, faster, and possibly cheaper, as they no longer had to organize their own programs by editing together a variety of short films. Directors had a great desire to make longer films because it meant greater artistic innovation as they tried to find new ways to engage audiences. The popularity of longer films also meant an increase in production of fictional films as <b>actualities</b> decreased. One of the possible reasons for this shift is that fiction films were often easier to plan and cheaper to film than <b>actualities</b> which were subject to various location-related difficulties. Fiction films, therefore, quickly became regularized, and the popularity of longer films meant that they outsold <b>actualities,</b> which were usually short.|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} {{the magnitude of}} forced migration on a global scale, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) shows that as of 2013 there were 51. 2 million people forcibly displaced worldwide. This represents {{the highest level of}} people forcibly displaced since the aftermath of World War II. Bearing in mind the contemporary migratory context characterised by mounting worldwide incidents of migration and displacement due to wars, persecution, violence, human rights violations, environmental catastrophes, and economic upheavals, perhaps now more than ever there is a greater need to promote successful resettlement among forced migrants. An important way of supporting forced migrants in a new society lies in building knowledge about the everyday ways working and learning occurs in and though the process of resettlement. This paper focuses on the work and learning experiences of resettling forced migrants in Sydney, Australia. In their own words forced migrants describe their everyday resettlement activities taking up their time and effort as they work to rebuild their lives in Australia. It is argued that the everyday resettlement activities of forced migrants constitute unique and often unrecognised forms of work and learning. Furthermore, this paper will establish that the work and learning <b>actualities</b> of resettling forced migrants, must be acknowledged and supported in order to promote successful resettlement and social cohesion in increasingly multicultural settler societies such as Australia. Using an institutional ethnographic lens (Smith, 1999, 2003, 2005 a, 2006) this paper explores how forced migrants’ everyday resettlement <b>actualities</b> catch them up in deeply embodied forms of work and learning. These hitherto unrecognised forms of work and learning are referred to as ‘resettlement-work’ and ‘resettlement-learning’ to capture the ways in which forced migrants act as both ‘resettlement-workers’ and ‘resettlement-learners’. Viewing forced migrants as resettlement-workers and resettlement-learners requires an ontological shift to apprehend how they are actively involved in embodied, conceptual, labouring, historical and generational acts of migration and resettlement. As forced migrants describe their localised and situated everyday resettlement activities their stories offer insights into how they actively work and learn to resettle by strategically navigating through the ‘institutional regime of migration and resettlement’. The inquiry relies upon narrative accounts to reveal the resettlement <b>actualities</b> of forced migrants who are understood to be experts of their social reality because they possess insights that can only be obtained through direct and intimate experiences with migration and resettlement. Consequently, it is a methodological imperative to become familiar with the experienced <b>actualities</b> of forced migrants through a theorised exploration of their everyday resettlement <b>actualities.</b> By opening discursive spaces in research for forced migrants to speak about their embodied <b>actualities</b> with resettlement, this paper endeavours to draw upon their expertise and to centre their voices in the construction of knowledge about resettlement-work and resettlement-learning...|$|R
