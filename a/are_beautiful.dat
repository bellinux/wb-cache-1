The painted area of God Devnarayan Ki Phad is 170 square feet (i.e. 34' x 5'). Some other Pars are also prevalent in Rajasthan, but being of recent origin, they are not classical in composition. Another famous Par painting is Pabuji Ki Phad. Pabuji Ki Phad is painted on a 15 x 5ft. canvas. Other famous heroes of Phad paintings are Gogaji, Prithviraj Chauhan, Amar Singh Rathore, etc.|$|E

25|$|The Circassian women have, {{from time}} immemorial, communicated the small-pox to their {{children}} when not above six months old by making an incision in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully {{from the body of}} another child.

The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others. There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia; and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations when their harvest has fallen short...

[...] Coval also comments on the rapper's vignettes of inner-city life, which are depicted using elaborate rhyme structures: [...] "All the words, faces and bodies of an abandoned post-industrial, urban dystopia are framed in Nas's tightly packed stanzas.

The 3D accelerated graphics, specifically the tables, the cards and the dealers' hands, are well modeled and lit, and the playing chips <b>are</b> <b>beautiful.</b> The sound effects are accurate, and the voice actors, competent". However, he noted that [...] "some of the 3D effects are not particularly wieldy, the menus flicker, it's often hard to stop the scrolling menus at the right time, and the camera angles switch too fast and frequently {{to be anything but}} distracting. The slot machine wheels are a bit on the small side and difficult to read". Laramee went on to call the game [...] "a competent effort, but is essentially dry and uninspired".
