25|$|Growth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90ft) {{tall and}} {{occasionally}} reaches 37m (120ft), with d.b.h. of 91 to 122cm (36 to 48 in). The bole is often forked. Height and diameter by age <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>in</b> <b>table</b> 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with chestnut oak, white oak, sweet birch (Betula lenta), and American beech is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 {{percent or less}} of the basal area of oak-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).|$|E
500|$|The Netherlands, {{which is}} the most {{important}} source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, gladioli, irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third. About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season 470 cultivars were produced on 1578ha. By far the largest area cultivated is for the miniature [...] "Tête-à-Tête", followed at some distance by [...] "Carlton".

One of the self-fertilised was {{an inch and}} a quarter taller than any one of the crossed plants; but the other two self-fertilised plants were in a very poor condition. I {{therefore}} resolved to leave these plants to struggle together for some years. By the autumn of the same year (1869) the self-fertilised plant which had been victorious was now beaten.

But {{as soon as we}} arrange them the in order of their magnitudes, as in columns 4 and 5, the case is materially altered. We now see, with few exceptions, that the largest plant on the crossed side in each pot exceeds the largest plant on the self-fertilised side, that the second exceeds the second, the third the third, and so on. Out of the fifteen cases in the table, there are only two exceptions to this rule. We may therefore confidently affirm that a crossed series will always be found to exceed a self-fertilised series, within the range of the conditions under which the present experiment has been made." ...|$|E
