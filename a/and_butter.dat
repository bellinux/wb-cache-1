5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's Botany Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast staysail and topsail, but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was able to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|Generally, no {{separate}} food offerings {{are cooked}} for the goddess Vimala. The goddess is described {{to survive on}} the remnants (Ucchishta) of Jagannath's meals. The vegetarian food offerings to Jagannath are offered to Vimala, after which they are sanctified as Mahaprasad (see also prasad). The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd <b>and</b> <b>butter.</b> The Shankaracharya, head of the Govardhana matha, receives a pot of the mahaprasad {{and a plate of}} khichdi that is offered to the goddess, the presiding goddess (Adya-shakti) of the matha {{as well as of the}} temple.|$|E
2500|$|In general use, {{the term}} [...] "butter" [...] {{refers to the}} spread dairy product when {{unqualified}} by other descriptors. The word commonly is used to describe puréed vegetable or seed and nut products such as peanut <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> almond <b>butter.</b> It is often applied to spread fruit products such as apple butter. Fats such as cocoa <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> shea <b>butter</b> that remain solid at room temperature are also known as [...] "butters". In addition to the act of applying butter being called [...] "to butter", non-dairy items that have a dairy butter consistency may use [...] "butter" [...] to call that consistency to mind, including food items such as maple <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> witch's <b>butter</b> <b>and</b> nonfood items such as baby bottom <b>butter,</b> hyena <b>butter,</b> <b>and</b> rock <b>butter.</b>|$|R

5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|In June 1962, {{food prices}} were raised, {{particularly}} on meat <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> (by 25–30%). This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk (Rostov Region) this discontent escalated to a strike and a {{revolt against the}} authorities. The revolt was put down by the military. According to Soviet official accounts, 22 {{people were killed and}} 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.|$|E

Meanwhile, local dairy farmers began to switch to beef <b>and</b> <b>butter,</b> causing a drop in milk transport. From its peak of 20,994tons carried in 1877, goods traffic fell in each of the next four years, dropping to 9,139tons (9,286t) in 1881.|$|E

5|$|One {{adviser to}} Khrushchev was Trofim Lysenko, who promised greatly {{increased}} production with minimal investment. Such schemes were attractive to Khrushchev, who ordered them implemented. Lysenko managed {{to maintain his}} influence under Khrushchev despite repeated failures; as each proposal failed, he advocated another. Lysenko's influence greatly retarded the development of genetic science in the Soviet Union. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in production of milk, meat, <b>and</b> <b>butter.</b> Local officials, with Khrushchev's encouragement, made unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by forcing farmers to slaughter their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling {{it back to the}} government, artificially increasing recorded production.|$|E

5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed whole wheat, a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, <b>and</b> <b>butter.</b> Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

The latter commenced the building of Scalloway Castle, but after his imprisonment in 1609 the Crown annexed Orkney and Shetland again until 1643 when Charles I granted them to William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. These rights were held on and off by the Mortons until 1766, when they were sold by James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton to Laurence Dundas.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil <b>and</b> <b>butter)</b> which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|While Marco {{was still}} {{spinning}} {{in the western}} Caribbean, the Government of Honduras allotted 70million HNL ($5.6million 1996USD) in emergency assistance. Following the storm, several countries contributed cash toward the recovery of Honduras, including: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $438,000. In addition, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant, worth $10,000. Japan donated 40tents, 10water purifiers, 480soaps, and 3emergency health kits in lieu of money. Norway donated almost $71,000 worth of food, medicines, and clothing. Spain also contributed medicine and transportation, costing $156,250. The United States donated plastic sheeting, water containers, and family food bags. The primary contributor of non-government aid was the Red Cross. After the storm, the Red Cross set up temporary shelters in San Pedro Sula, Puerto Cortés, and El Progreso. Additionally, they distributed 3,000pounds of milk, clothing, 500sheets, chlorine boxes, 14,000pounds of rice, 15,000pounds of beans and 9,000pounds of maize, sugar, <b>and</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil <b>and</b> <b>butter.</b> Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a regional trade hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok, the oil mill Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E

5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread <b>and</b> <b>butter</b> of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E
