5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential <b>analyzer,</b> an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential <b>analyzer,</b> a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential <b>analyzer</b> had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential <b>analyzer</b> was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential <b>analyzer,</b> Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of DMA <b>analyzers</b> used currently: forced {{resonance}} <b>analyzers</b> and free resonance <b>analyzers.</b> Free resonance <b>analyzers</b> measure the free oscillations of damping of the sample being tested by suspending and swinging the sample. A restriction to free resonance <b>analyzers</b> {{is that it is}} limited to rod or rectangular shaped samples, but samples that can be woven/braided are also applicable. Forced resonance <b>analyzers</b> are the more common type of <b>analyzers</b> available in instrumentation today. These types of <b>analyzers</b> force the sample to oscillate at a certain frequency and are reliable for performing a temperature sweep.|$|R

He has claimed that his voice can emit five different tones simultaneously, and that mixing engineer Robert Carranza showed him that a recording of his vocals formed a visual pentagram when imported into a phrasal <b>analyzer.</b> Bates has said that the vocals on the album are stripped down in comparison to previous records, which he considered to be overproduced.|$|E

40|$|An {{instrument}} modification for chemiluminescent NO - NOx <b>analyzers</b> {{was developed}} which minimizes the NOx destruction in the NOx to NO converters of NO <b>analyzers</b> {{due to high}} concentrations of CO.

Bro also includes signature detection and allows the import of Snort signatures.|$|R
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he found time to write his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential <b>analyzer,</b> an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The ENA {{operates}} {{an instance}} of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), an archival repository of sequence reads and analyses which are intended for public release. Originally called the Short Read Archive, the name was changed in anticipation of future sequencing technologies being able to produce longer sequence reads. Currently, the archive accepts sequence reads generated by next-generation sequencing platforms such as the Illumina Genome <b>Analyzer</b> and ABI SOLiD {{as well as some}} corresponding analyses and alignments. The SRA operates under the guidance of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and is the fastest-growing repository in the ENA.|$|E

50|$|Stress {{and strain}} {{can be applied}} via {{torsional}} or axial <b>analyzers.</b> Torsional <b>analyzers</b> are mainly used for liquids or melts but can also be implemented for some solid samples since the force is applied in a twisting motion. The instrument can do creep-recovery, stress-relaxation, and stress-strain experiments. Axial <b>analyzers</b> are used for solid or semisolid materials. It can do flexure, tensile, and compression testing (even shear and liquid specimens if desired). These <b>analyzers</b> can test higher modulus materials than torsional <b>analyzers.</b> The instrument can do thermomechanical analysis (TMA) studies {{in addition to the}} experiments that torsional <b>analyzers</b> can do. Figure 4 shows the general difference between the two applications of stress and strain.|$|R
25|$|Starting from a {{sequence}} of characters, the lexical <b>analyzer</b> builds {{a sequence}} of language tokens (such as reserved words, literals, and identifiers) from which the parser builds a syntax tree.

25|$|A tandem mass {{spectrometer}} is one capable of multiple rounds of mass spectrometry, usually separated by {{some form of}} molecule fragmentation. For example, one mass <b>analyzer</b> can isolate one peptide from many entering a {{mass spectrometer}}. A second mass <b>analyzer</b> then stabilizes the peptide ions while they collide with a gas, causing them to fragment by collision-induced dissociation (CID). A third mass <b>analyzer</b> then sorts the fragments produced from the peptides. Tandem MS can also {{be done in a}} single mass <b>analyzer</b> over time, as in a quadrupole ion trap. There are various methods for fragmenting molecules for tandem MS, including collision-induced dissociation (CID), electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD), blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD), electron-detachment dissociation (EDD) and surface-induced dissociation (SID). An important application using tandem mass spectrometry is in protein identification.|$|E

5000|$|From 1929 to {{the late}} 1960s, large {{alternating}} current power systems were modelled and studied on AC network <b>analyzers</b> (also called alternating current network calculators or AC calculating boards) or transient network <b>analyzers.</b> These special-purpose analog computers were {{an outgrowth of the}} DC calculating boards used in the very earliest power system analysis. By the middle of the 1950s, fifty network <b>analyzers</b> were in operation. AC network <b>analyzers</b> were much used for power flow studies, short circuit calculations, and system stability studies, but were ultimately replaced by numerical solutions running on digital computers. While the <b>analyzers</b> could provide real-time simulation of events, with no concerns about numeric stability of algorithms, the <b>analyzers</b> were costly, inflexible, and limited in the number of buses and lines that could be simulated. [...] Eventually powerful digital computers replaced analog network <b>analyzers</b> for practical calculations, but analog physical models for studying electrical transients are still in use.|$|R
25|$|As shown above, sector {{instruments}} {{bend the}} trajectories of the ions {{as they pass}} through the mass <b>analyzer,</b> according to their mass-to-charge ratios, deflecting the more charged and faster-moving, lighter ions more.

25|$|A general {{limitation}} to the spatial {{resolution of this}} method is given by the blurring in the <b>analyzer</b> crystal which arises from dynamical refraction, i.e. the angular deviation of the beam due to the refraction in the sample is amplified about ten thousand times in the crystal, because the beam path within the crystal depends strongly on its incident angle. This effect can be reduced by thinning down the <b>analyzer</b> crystal, e.g. with an <b>analyzer</b> thickness of 40 m a resolution of about 6 m was calculated. Alternatively the Laue crystals can be replaced by Bragg crystals, so the beam doesn´t pass through the crystal but is reflected on the surface.|$|E

25|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} the science {{television}} show MythBusters tested a number of methods that supposedly allow a person to fool a breath <b>analyzer</b> test. The methods tested included breath mints, onions, denture cream, mouthwash, pennies and batteries; all of these methods proved ineffective. The show noted that using these items to cover the smell of alcohol may fool a person, but, since they will not actually reduce a person's BrAC, {{there will be no}} effect on a breath <b>analyzer</b> test regardless of the quantity used, if any, it appeared that using mouthwash only raised the BrAC.
