5000|$|The BMP-1 had {{significant}} shortcomings in its protection scheme, which only became obvious during the Soviet War in Afghanistan. It seats its driver and commander in a tandem layout, {{on the left}} side of the hull front, alongside the diesel engine. When an <b>antitank</b> <b>mine</b> hits the BMP-1's left track, the explosion usually destroyed one to three left side roadwheels, penetrated the bottom, and killed or seriously wounded both the driver and the commander, which caused painful losses of specialist personnel in the Soviet Army. Drivers laid sandbags on the bottom of their compartment in an effort to protect themselves against possible mine attack. The same kind of explosion under the right track was much less dramatic for the driver and the commander, who remained relatively safe. If the vehicle hit a tilt-rod <b>antitank</b> <b>mine,</b> its steeply sloped lower front glacis plate allowed the mine's arming rod to tilt with little resistance until the mine was well under the chassis. When it eventually detonated, the blast was usually sufficient to kill or badly wound the driver and the commander. From 1982, the Soviet 40th Army in Afghanistan began to receive improved BMP-1Ds (the so-called [...] "Afghan" [...] variant), which, among other improvements, included an additional armored plate under the driver's and commander's stations. This situation was addressed in the later BMP-2 design, where the commander shares the two-man turret with the gunner. The driver's and engine compartments could be equipped with additional bottom armor for improved protection against landmines filled with up to 2.5 kg of explosives.|$|E

However, the detonator was not sufficiently modified, and it could therefore be used against people, while it should only have been used against tanks.In respect of an agreement made in 1989, Dynamit Nobel was manufacturing blank cartridge bullets and figure targets in Würgendorf. Dynamit Nobel also agreed to develop the Panzerfaust 3, in order to progressively deliver it to the Bundeswehr and other armies as the priority antitank defence mechanism in the infantry.

At the start of his company's attack on strongly held enemy positions in and around Spaccasassi Creek, near Padiglione, Italy, on the night of 23-April 24, 1944, Pfc. Squires, platoon messenger, participating in his first offensive action, braved intense artillery, mortar, and antitank gun fire in order to investigate the effects of an <b>antitank</b> <b>mine</b> explosion on the leading platoon. Despite shells which burst close to him, Pfc. Squires made his way 50 yards forward to the advance element, noted the situation, reconnoitered a new route of advance and informed his platoon leader of the casualties sustained and the alternate route. Acting without orders, he rounded up stragglers, organized a group of lost men into a squad and led them forward. When the platoon reached Spaccasassi Creek and established an outpost, Pfc. Squires, knowing that almost all of the noncommissioned officers were casualties, placed 8 men in position of his own volition, disregarding enemy machinegun, machine-pistol, and grenade fire which covered the creek draw. When his platoon had been reduced to 14 men, he brought up reinforcements twice. On each trip he went through barbed wire and across an enemy minefield, under intense artillery and mortar fire. Three times in the early morning the outpost was counterattacked. Each time Pfc. Squires ignored withering enemy automatic fire and grenades which struck all around him, and fired hundreds of rounds of rifle, Browning automatic rifle, and captured German Spandau machinegun ammunition at the enemy, inflicting numerous casualties and materially aiding in repulsing the attacks. Following these fights, he moved 50 yards to {{the south end of the}} outpost and engaged 21 German soldiers in individual machinegun duels at point-blank range, forcing all 21 enemy to surrender and capturing 13 more Spandau guns. Learning the function of this weapon by questioning a German officer prisoner, he placed the captured guns in position and instructed other members of his platoon in their operation. The next night when the Germans attacked the outpost again he killed 3 and wounded more Germans with captured potato-masher grenades and fire from his Spandau gun. Pfc. Squires was killed in a subsequent action.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the design}} of a system to detect improvised {{explosive}} devices is considered. The technique utilized is thermal neutron analysis. In this method, thermal neutrons are used to interrogate a volume for the presence of nitrogen, which is used as an indicator of explosive, given its unusual high energy line in the gamma ray spectrum generated by thermal capture reactions on explosive material. The performance of the system is then considered for a number of devices used to represent an improvised explosive device, including a 155 mm shell, an <b>antitank</b> <b>mine,</b> and a air to surface bomb. The system is shown to be capable of detecting IEDs within between 15. 6 and 3800 seconds for HPGe detectors, and within 277 seconds for the best case scenario with NaI while more deeply buried explosives are shown to be undetectable by NaI. ...|$|E
40|$|During January, 1998, {{collaboration}} between LLNL, UCI and Exdet, Ltd. {{arranged for the}} testing and evaluation of a Russian developed <b>antitank</b> <b>mine</b> detection system at the Buried Objects Detection Facility (BODF) located at the Nevada Test Site. BODF is a secured 30 -acre facility with approximately 300 live antitank mines that were buried in 1993 and 1994. The burial depths range from a few cm to 15 cm and the various metal- and plastic-case antitank mines each contain 6 - 12 kg of high explosive. Contractors who have tested their mine detection equipment at BODF include: SAIC, SRI, ERIM, MIT/Lincoln Laboratory and Loral Defense Systems. In addition LLNL researchers have used BODF to test <b>antitank</b> <b>mine</b> detection systems based on: dual-band infrared imaging, hyper-spectral imaging, synthetic aperture impulse radar and micro-impulse radar. In a blind test the Russian operated system obtained the highest score of any technology tested to date at BODF. The system is based on combining information from two separate sensors; one to detect anomalous concentrations of hydrogen {{and the other to}} detect if such anomalies also have the correct nitrogen to carbon ratio for high explosives. The detection sensitivity is set by the geometry and type of neutron moderator and filters surrounding the neutron source and detectors. Detection of hydrogen anomalies is a rapid process based on neutron scattering. The handheld instrument {{on the end of a}} wand could scan a large area at a rate of 4 - 5 square meters per minute. Once the hydrogen anomalies were located a second sensor was used to measure the thermal neutron excited gamma-ray spectrum at each hydrogen anomaly to determine whether that location in addition contained high concentrations of nitrogen. The second process was slower, taking up to 5 minutes for each location. The information from both sensors were then examined by the operator and a declaration was made as to whether or not the anomaly was a buried <b>antitank</b> <b>mine.</b> Although the system worked extremely well on all classes of anti-tank mines, the Russian hardware components were inferior to those that are commercially available in the United States, i. e. the NaI(Tl) crystals had significantly higher background levels and poorer resolution than their U. S. counterparts, the electronics appeared to be decades old and the photomultiplier tubes were noisy and lacked gain stabilization circuitry. During the evaluation of this technology, the question that came to mind was: could state-of-the-art sensors and electronics and improved software algorithms lead to a neutron based system that could reliably detect much smaller buried mines; namely antipersonnel mines containing 30 - 40 grams of high explosive? Our goal in this study was to conduct Monte Carlo simulations to gain better understanding of both phases of the mine detection system and to develop an understanding for the system's overall capabilities and limitations. In addition, we examined possible extensions of this technology to see whether or not state-of-the-art improvements could lead to a reliable anti-personnel mine detection system...|$|E
