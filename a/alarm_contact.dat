40|$|We {{studied the}} {{development}} of infant baboons' (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) responses to conspecific 'barks' in a free-ranging population in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. These barks grade from tonal, harmonically rich calls into calls with a more noisy, harsh structure. Typically, tonal variants are given when the signaller is at risk of losing contact with the group or a particular individual ('contact barks'), whereas harsh variants are given in response to predators ('alarm barks'). We conducted focal observations and playback experiments in which we presented variants of barks recorded from resident adult females. By six months of age, infants reliably discriminated between typical <b>alarm</b> and <b>contact</b> barks and they responded more strongly to intermediate alarm calls than to typical contact barks. Infants of six months and older also recognized their mothers by voice. The ability to discriminate between different call variants developed with increasing age. At {{two and a half}} months of age, infants failed to respond at all, whereas at four months they responded irrespective of the call type that was presented. At six months, infants showed adult-like responses by responding strongly to alarm barks but ignoring contact barks.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of the SHMS-C is to monitor specifically for hydrogen in the waste tank vapor space which may also contain (but not be limited to) unknown quantities of air, nitrous oxide (N{sub 2 }O), ammonia (NH{sub 3 }), water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }), carbon monoxide (CO) and other gaseous constituents. An electronically controlled grab sampler has replaced the manually operated sample system {{that was used in}} the original SHMS enclosure. Samples can now be operator or automatically initiated. Automatic initiation occurs based on the high hydrogen alarm level. Once a sample is obtained it is removed from the sampler and transported to a laboratory for analysis. This system is used to identify other gaseous constituents which are not measured by the hydrogen monitor. The design does not include any remote data acquisition or remote data logging equipment but provides a 4 [...] 20 mA dc process signals, and discrete <b>alarm</b> <b>contacts,</b> that can be utilized for remote data logging and alarming when desired. The SHMS-C arrangement consists of design modifications (piping, valves, filters, supports) to the SHMS-B arrangement necessary for the installation of a dual column gas chromatograph and associated sample and calibration gas lines.

50|$|The song in this clade is {{essentially}} territorial {{in that it}} communicates the identity and whereabouts of an individual to other birds and also signals sexual intentions.

50|$|Contact {{calls are}} {{seemingly}} haphazard sounds made by many social animals (such as a chicken's cluck). Contact calls {{are very different}} from many other types of calls (for example, <b>alarm</b> calls), as <b>contact</b> calls are not a specific signal, designed to communicate some specific information. It is rather a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, foraging). Contact calls are used to maintain audio contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls, without the use of alarm calls.

Are any vocalization changes accompanied by morphological or genetic changes? The chapter also looks into the potential mechanisms and consequences of any adaptations or differences between city and rural birds.

40|$|We studied {{variation}} in the loud barks of free-ranging female chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus ursinus) with respect to context, predator type, and individuality over an 18 -month period in the Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana. To examine acoustic differences in relation to these variables, we extracted a suite of acoustic parameters from digitized calls and applied discriminant function analyses. The barks constitute a graded continuum, ranging from a tonal, harmonically rich call into a call with a more noisy, harsh structure. Tonal barks are typically given when the signaler is at risk of losing contact with the group or when a mother and infant have become separated (contact barks). The harsher variants are given in response to large predators (alarm barks). However, there are also intermediate forms between the two subtypes which may occur in both situations. This finding is not due to an overlap of individuals' distinct distributions but can be replicated within individuals. Within the alarm bark category, there are significant differences between calls given in response to mammalian carnivores and those given in response to crocodiles. Again, there are intermediate variants. Both alarm call types are equally different from contact barks, indicating that the calls vary along different dimensions. Finally, there are consistent, significant differences among different individuals' calls. However, individual identity in one call type cannot directly be inferred from knowledge of the individuals' call characteristics in the other. In sum, the barks of female baboons potentially provide rich information to the recipients of these signals. The extent to which baboons discriminate between <b>alarm</b> and <b>contact</b> barks, and classify calls according to context and/or acoustic similarity will be described in a subsequent paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{underwater}} surveillance {{active sonar}} {{is an important}} technological asset. Compared to passive sonar it features higher detection ranges and enables the detection of silent objects. As a drawback the interaction of sound waves with the seabed and the water surface causes false alarms, named clutter. False alarms usually appear randomly and variable in time and space. To distinguish false <b>alarms</b> from true <b>contacts</b> the Multi-Hypothesis Tracking approach can be used. This approach incorporates the density of sonar contacts to extract possible target tracks. Thus, the assumed clutter density influences, amongst others, the performance of this tracking approach. This paper presents a method for determining the clutter density adaptively. It considers positions of all sonar contacts within one measurement and thereby approximates the actual clutter density precisely. The influence on the tracking results using adaptive clutter density in a multi-hypothesis tracker is shown by applying the algorithm to two multistatic sonar datasets and comparing it to results obtained by tracking using constant clutter density. Tracking performance is quantified by existing tracking performance metrics. ...|$|R
40|$|Vocalisations {{represent}} the primary mode of communication for most birds and vary greatly {{in form and}} function within and between species. Cataloguing the vocal repertoire of a species is a key foundation for behavioural research, as it provides both an objective measure of vocal complexity and a basis for further studies of vocal function. Here we present a descriptive catalogue of the vocal repertoire of the Chestnut-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus ruficeps), a cooperatively breeding passerine endemic to inland south-eastern Australia. Using behavioural observations and simple methods of acoustic classification we identify and suggest functions for 13 main types of vocalisations, and also report five less common vocalisations {{that could not be}} assigned a unique function. Babblers possess no song, {{in the sense of a}} vocalisation primarily used for inter-group or territorial communication. The 13 calls with clear functions can be broadly classified into three <b>alarm</b> calls, five <b>contact</b> calls, and four social-interaction calls, with a final call used in both social and alarm contexts. This study represents the first catalogue of vocal repertoire in pomatostomid babblers, and aims to contribute to future comparative analyses of vocal complexity and inspire further work on the relationship between call structure and function. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{socially}} living {{animals are}} sensitive to a potential predator {{as part of their}} antipredator strategy. Alarm calls function to deter predators and to help other group members detect danger. The left visual field is involved in detection of potential threats or predators in many vertebrates, but it is unclear how alarm calls influence visual detection of a potential predator. Here, we experimentally examined how alarm calls spontaneously influence the search for pictures of a potential predator in captive Japanese macaques. We used an audiovisual preferential-looking paradigm by presenting pictures of a snake and a flower simultaneous with either a recording of <b>alarm</b> calls or <b>contact</b> calls. We found no difference in gaze duration between the 2 picture types when playing back contact calls. Monkeys looked significantly longer at pictures of snakes than at those of flowers when alarm calls were played back if the snake pictures were presented {{on the left side of}} the monkey's visual field, indicating right hemispheric bias during processing of predator representations. This is the first laboratory demonstration of auditory enhancement of visual detection of predators in the left visual field in animals, which will contribute to a better understanding of alarm call studies conducted in the wild...|$|R
500|$|The coyote {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the most vocal of all [...] North American mammals". Its loudness and range of vocalizations was the cause for its binomial name Canis latrans, meaning [...] "barking dog". At least 11 different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes. These sounds are divided into three categories: agonistic and <b>alarm,</b> greeting, and <b>contact.</b> Vocalizations of the first category include woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark howls, yelps, and high-frequency whines. Woofs are used as low-intensity threats or alarms, and are usually heard near den sites, prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows. Growls are used as threats at short distances, but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males. Huffs are high-intensity threat vocalizations produced by rapid expiration of air. Barks can be classed as both long-distance threat vocalizations and as alarm calls. Bark howls may serve similar functions. Yelps are emitted as a sign of submission, while high-frequency whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates. Greeting vocalizations include low-frequency whines, 'wow-oo-wows', and group yip howls. Low-frequency whines are emitted by submissive animals, and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling. The sound known as 'wow-oo-wow' {{has been described}} as a [...] "greeting song". The group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack members reunite, and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony. Contact calls include lone howls and group howls, as well as the previously mentioned group yip howls. The lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote, and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack. Group howls are used as both substitute group yip howls and as responses to either lone howls, group howls, or group yip howls.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Baakline to a Druze family, {{his father}} {{died when he was}} 13, and his mother {{entrusted}} her son to another princely family, probably the Khazens (al-Khazin). In 1608 Fakhr-al-Din forged an alliance with the Italian Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The alliance contained both a public economic section and a secret military one.Fakhr-al-Din's ambitions, popularity and unauthorized foreign <b>contacts</b> <b>alarmed</b> the Ottomans who authorized Hafiz Ahmed Pasha, Muhafiz of Damascus, to mount an attack on Lebanon in 1613 in order to reduce Fakhr-al-Din's growing power. Professor Abu-Husayn has made the Ottoman archives relevant to the emir's career available.Faced with Hafiz's army of 50,000 men, Fakhr-al-Din chose exile in Tuscany, leaving affairs in the hands of his brother Emir Yunis and his son Emir Ali Beg. They succeeded in maintining most of the forts such as Banias (Subayba) and Niha which were a mainstay of Fakhr ad-Din's power. Before leaving, Fakhr ad-Din paid his standing army of soqbans (mercenaries) two years wages in order to secure their loyalty.Hosted in Tuscany by the Medici Family, Fakhr-al-Din was welcomed by the grand duke Cosimo II, who was his host and sponsor for the two years he spent at the court of the Medici. He spent a further three years as guest of the Spanish Viceroy of Sicily and then Naples, the Duke Osuna. Fakhr-al-Din had wished to enlist Tuscan or other European assistance in a [...] "Crusade" [...] to free his homeland from Ottoman domination, but was met with a refusal as Tuscany was unable to afford such an expedition. The prince eventually gave up the idea, realizing that Europe was more interested in trade with the Ottomans than in taking back the Holy Land. His stay nevertheless allowed him to witness Europe's cultural revival in the 17th century, and bring back some Renaissance ideas and architectural features.By 1618, political changes in the Ottoman sultanate had resulted in the removal of many of Fakhr-al-Din's enemies from power, allowing Fahkr-al-Din's return to Lebanon, whereupon he was able quickly to reunite all the lands of Lebanon beyond the boundaries of its mountains; and having revenge from Emir Yusuf Pasha ibn Siyfa, attacking his stronghold in Akkar, destroying his palaces and taking control of his lands, and regaining the territories he had to give up in 1613 in Sidon, Tripoli, Bekaa among others. Under his rule, printing presses were introduced and Jesuit priests and Catholic nuns encouraged to open schools throughout the land.|$|R
40|$|Broadcast {{surveys are}} {{effective}} at detecting northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) during their breeding season. Goshawk surveys are generally conducted using the alarm call during the nestling phase and the juvenile food-begging call during the fledgling-dependency phase (referred to as “standard calls”). However, goshawks are more vocal during their courtship phase {{than at any}} other time of the year. Because the probability of detecting goshawks declines after a nest has failed, a reliable means of surveying goshawks during the courtship phase would be more likely to detect nesting pairs than surveys conducted later in the breeding season. To evaluate the influence of breeding phase, distance, and call type on the probability of detecting goshawks, I estimated goshawk detection rates during the courtship, nestling, and fledgling-dependency stages of the breeding season, using three conspecific calls (adult <b>alarm</b> call, male <b>contact</b> call, and juvenile food-begging call) at distances of 100, 150, 225, and 325 m from active nests in northern Minnesota. Unlike previous studies, broadcasts were conducted at only one distance per trial to better describe the relationship between distance and probability of detection and to estimate effective area surveyed per broadcast station. In 1999, 85 broadcast trials were conducted in 9 active nest areas. Detections occurred during 18. 9 % of broadcast trials and during at least one broadcast trial at 9 of 11 nests. In 2000, 132 broadcast trials were conducted in 16 active nest areas. Detections occurred during 48. 5 % of broadcast trials and during at least one broadcast trial at all 16 nests. When using standard calls during broadcast trials and when pooled over all distances, detection rates were highest during the courtship (70. 4 %) and fledgling-dependency phases (67. 6 %). Detection rates were lowest during the nestling phase (28. 1 %), when there appeared to be higher variation in the likelihood of response among individuals. During the courtship and fledgling-dependency phases, detection rates decreased with distance from goshawk nests, whereas during the nestling phase, detection rates were highest at 225 m from nests. Differences in detection rates among breeding phases highlight the importance of incorporating knowledge about local breeding phenology into survey design. The male contact call did not improve detection rates over the alarm and juvenile food-begging calls. Results from this study will assist iv in designing systematic landscape-level surveys with a known probability of detection in the Western Great Lakes Region (WGLR) and in defining a distance-detection relationship for calibrating results of extensive surveys. I used probability of detection as a function of distance in the courtship and fledgling-dependency phases to calculate the effective area surveyed per broadcast station using the survey techniques recommended in this paper. The effective area surveyed was 39. 8 ha during the courtship phase and 34. 4 ha during the fledgling-dependency phase. These results indicate that in Minnesota broadcast stations may be spaced 712 m and 662 m, respectively, when conducting systematic surveys during these two breeding phases. Calculation of the effective area surveyed could be applied to other regions where the probability of detection as a function of distance is known...|$|R
