Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

40|$|Due {{primarily}} to the shortness {{of the time that}} has elapsed since the death of Sir Edmund Gosse, his biography has not yet been written, nor have his letters been published. In fact, nothing comprehensive in book form has been written at any time <b>about</b> <b>his</b> life,or <b>his</b> <b>works,</b> or any part of them. As a consequence, the present thesis is essentially the result of a study of Sir Edmund Gosse's own works, with particular attention to opinions expressed in books or periodicals which have contained articles <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>works</b> or which have made some reference to them.

5|$|Meanwhile, Peter, {{with help}} from his {{children}} Chris and Meg, decides to create his own animated series about a trio of handicapped ducks entitled Handi-Quacks. All of Meg's reasonable and sometimes rational suggestions are shot down by Peter and Chris in favor of their more unusual and nonsensical ideas. Peter eventually fires Meg. He and Chris then decide on a joke involving a wood stove and a house of cards, and invite Cleveland, Quagmire and Joe to voice the characters. Although {{it is suggested that}} the crudely animated and developed pilot episode will likely fail, CEO Peter Chernin enjoys it and agrees to air the show, but Peter becomes angered when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a plum instead of a tomato. Peter's passion <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>work</b> impresses Chernin into allowing him to air the episode unedited, but he decides not to let the episode be aired at all, which he later regrets.|$|E
