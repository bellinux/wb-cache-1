50|$|Prior to 1926 SR 5 was routed between Vincennes and New Albany. In 1926 SR 5 was {{replaced}} by US 50 and US 150 and the SR 5 designation went unused for a few years. In 1931, SR 5 {{was added to the}} state road system routed from Roll to Akron. The road was rerouted later in 1931 to its current route north of Huntington to Ligonier. In 1933 the southern end moved north to the intersection of SR 3 and SR 118, now SR 218. An <b>authorized</b> <b>route</b> went north from Ligonier to the Michigan state line along modern SR 5 in 1934. The <b>authorized</b> <b>route</b> was added to the state road system between 1937 and 1939. SR 218 was extended east to the Ohio state line, replacing SR 5 south of Warren, between 1965 and 1966. This resulted in the southern terminus of SR 5 being moved to Warren. At this time the entire route of SR 5 was paved. The northern end was moved south to SR 120 from the Michigan state line in either 1970 or 1971. Between 1985 and 1987 the southern end of SR 5 was extended south to Upland, along a former route of SR 221, and concurrent with SR 218. SR 221 was removed from this section of roadway between 1972 and 1975.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOff-road vehicle impacts are {{a common}} and often severe form of {{disturbance}} in arid and semiarid lands around the world. Determining the underlying impetus behind the generation of new routes may allow better management of their impacts. We hypothesized that six variables may have predictive power: distance from slopes greater than 34 % (impassible slopes), distance from unauthorized routes, slope, view from <b>authorized</b> <b>routes</b> (driving to places that cannot be seen), distance from <b>authorized</b> <b>routes,</b> and elevation. Route proliferation in the San Cristobal Valley, Arizona, USA, a site with border enforcement travel but without recreational use, was measured using remotely sensed imagery and 7014 km of unauthorized routes were identified. Two variables were significant (p< 0. 05, R 2 = 0. 57) predictors of route proliferation: distance from slopes greater than 34 % and distance from unauthorized routes. For each kilometer distant from the slope, route density decreased {{by a factor of}} two and, for each 100 m distant from unauthorized routes, route density decreased by a factor of five. Slope, view from <b>authorized</b> <b>routes,</b> distance from <b>authorized</b> <b>routes,</b> and elevation were also tested but were not significant and {{were not included in the}} model. Unauthorized route density appears at least partially predictable and analysis of geographic variables may offer a way to prioritize route management decisions...|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the maximum}} {{permitted}} gross {{weight of a}} semi-trailer truck, {{without the use of}} a Special Type General Order (STGO), is 44 t. In order for a 44 t semi-trailer truck to be permitted on UK roads the tractor and semi-trailer must have three or more axles each. Lower weight semi-trailer trucks can mean some tractors and trailer having fewer axles. In practice, like double decker buses and coaches in the UK, there is no legal height limit for semi-trailer trucks; however, bridges over 5.03 m do not have the height marked on them. Semi-trailer trucks on Continental Europe have a height limit of 4.0 m.Vehicles heavier than 44 t are permitted on UK roads but are indivisible loads, which would be classed as abnormal (or oversize). Such vehicles are required to display an STGO (Special Types General Order) plate {{on the front of the}} tractor unit and, under certain circumstances, are required to travel by an <b>authorized</b> <b>route</b> and have an escort.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1926 SR 14 was routed between Cannelton and St. Croix, {{passing through}} Tell City.

During 1931 or 1932 new sections of SR 14 becomes designated routed between the Illinois state line and SR 53, now US 231, and again from SR 43, now US 421 to Fort Wayne. In this year SR 14 between SR 53 and SR 43 was an authorized state road. In either late 1932 or early 1933 route western end moved to US 41, while a new authorized section of SR 14 was routed between US 41 and SR 43, passing through Fair Oaks and Gifford. During 1933 the new <b>authorized</b> <b>route</b> is dropped from the state road system and the road between SR 13 and South Whitley was rerouted onto its modern route.

50|$|In January 2013, the Land Transportation Office ventured on {{the plate}} {{standardization}} project with modern security features which include holograms and bar codes, and also planned to phase out the old plate format {{which has been in}} use since 1981. In the new format, the LTO will issue LLL-DDDD for four-wheel vehicles and LL-DDDDD for motorcycles. The alphanumeric symbols for private cars will be black on a white background, while those for public utility vehicles (PUVs) would continue on black on yellow with the <b>authorized</b> <b>route</b> also to be indicated. Motorcycle plates would also be black on white, as would those for tricycles used for personal purposes. Tricycles used as PUVs would also continue with the black on yellow scheme. Government plates, meanwhile, would have sport red symbols on a white background, with the name of the agency/office to be indicated. Diplomatic plates would continue carry blue symbols on a white background, while Other Exempt Vehicles (OEV) would have black symbols on a light blue background. The new plate format series and design was originally scheduled for release on September or October 2013. However, it has been delayed several times primarily due to concerns on the release of funds for the license plate project, as well as the increase in purchase of new cars using temporary license plates bearing the conduction sticker number. Eventually, on May 2014, the first batch of new license plates were finally released. By January 2015, vehicle owners are now required to change their old plates into a modern series plate, and pay PhP 450 for a replacement.|$|E

40|$|Problems {{related to}} {{transportation}} and inspection of valuable or sensitive assets such as commercial products and materials, cultural items and works of art, and hazardous materials share similarities {{and can be}} modeled by a core set of abstract entities including a payload, a vehicle, a driver, and an inspector. To make the load handling capabilities of security monitoring and inspection systems more scalable, security can be increased by reducing the variability of transportation routes to a finite set of <b>authorized</b> <b>routes</b> between trip origin and destination locations. Then trip anomalies, which are unexpected trip variations, {{can be used in}} inspection targeting criteria. In addition, the effectiveness of the inspection sampling rate can be increased by always inspecting trips with unjustifiable anomalies and fulfilling the remainder of the sampling rate with other trips. While some anomalies can be automatically detected by vehicle tracking systems, other anomalies can be detected by inspectors based on information provided by drivers. This creates a need for an independent objective verification {{of the quality of the}} information provided by the driver, as this information can be used to detect transportation anomalies and, in some cases, justify the anomalies to avoid costly inspections. This thesis proposes the use of a geographic awareness modeling (GAM) system to determine whether route-following anomalies of monitored vehicles can be justified by driver detection of adverse road conditions. While current GIS applications provide geographically accurate representations of a road network, they do not provide mechanisms or information to corroborate or contradict scenarios describing trip conditions along a given route. This thesis also presents a design and one implementation of a GAM system which can provide independent, reliable verification of route-related information provided by vehicle drivers. A benefit of implementing such a system would be to complement the expertise and the experience of inspectors to increase the effectiveness of inspection targeting policies and sampling rates. ...|$|R

Federal Highway 45 crosses the city, south of downtown. Cinco de Febrero Ave joins them in a north-south route. The three of them form a sort of ring road around downtown. The railway line that connects Mexico City with western Mexico bisects the city.The Libramiento Sur-Poniente is a new ring road under construction, though parts of it already exist. When completed, it will join Bernardo Quintana on its southeastern part, go around the city in its southwestern and western parts, and reach the northern suburb of Santa Rosa Jauregui. Currently, there is work in progress that aims to extend Bernardo Quintana on its northwestern end to this ring road.Another freeway, named after missionary Junípero Serra who founded the Missions of the Sierra Gorda, this road creates another ring road. It goes from northeast Querétaro around the old airport, reaches the northern suburb of Juriquilla and goes southwards down to the Libramiento Sur-Poniente.Querétaro's public transportation consists of private owned bus companies that pick up and drop off over a specific route.

40|$|In {{geography}} of religlon, the pilgrimage {{is one of}} the principal topics. Traditional approaches have dealt with old pilgrimage routes and the spatial structures of pilgrims and pilgrimages. Humanistic geographers have clarified the symbolic meanlngs of sacred places or religious landscapes. In the 1990 s, some geographers, influenced by the “new cultural geography”, have challenged associations between religious phenomena and politics. This paper concerns a Buddhist pilgrimage route identified by sign, Henromichi, on Shikoku Island. While scholars of Henro have undefstood Henromichi's landscape and its religious meaning a priori, I will show that its landscape and meanings were built and obtained through conflict. In 1960 s and 1970 s, the value of the Henro pilgrimage and Henromichi had been recognized as a cultural heritage and tourism resource by authorities. Then, from 1981, Henromichi was re-built for hiking by the Ministry of Construction, emphasizing its cultural value and excluding the religious meanings of the pilgrimage route. On the other hand, a private organization, “Henromichi-hozon-kyoryoku-kai”, also re-built pilgrimage routes from 1988. This group <b>authorized</b> its own <b>route</b> on the historicity and the religious meaning to claim its authenticity and differentiate it from others. In this process, Henromichi was built and obtained religious meanings. Today, every pilgrimage route is built around a conflict between their authenticities and meanings. It is therefore important to clarify the relationships between religious phenomena and politics in Japan...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Serious {{problems}} were encountered with bears during {{construction of the}} 1274 -km-long trans-Alaska oil pipelinebetween Prudhoe Bay and Valdez. This multi-billion-dollar project traversed both black bear (U sus americanus Pallas) and grizzly bear (U. arctos L.) habitat throughout its entire length. Plans for dealing with anticipated problems with bears were often inadequate. Most (71 %) problems occurred north of the Yukon River in a previously roadless Wilderness where inadequate refuse disposal and widespread animal feeding created dangerous situations. Of the 192 officially reported bear {{problems associated with the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) (1971 - 79), about 65 % involved the presence of bears in camps or dumps, 13 % the feeding of bears on garbage or handouts, 10 % property damage or economic loss, 7 % bears under and in buildings, and only 5 % charges by bears. Remarkably, no bear-related injuries were reported, suggesting that bears became accustomed p ople and did not regard them as a threat. Following construction f the TAPS there have been proposals for pipelines to transport natural gas from Prudhoe Bay to southern and Pacific-rim markets. Based on past experience, some animal control measures were developed during the planning phase for the <b>authorized</b> gas pipeline <b>route</b> in Alaska. Fences installed around 100 -person "survey " camps were found to be effective in deterring bears in two traditionally troublesome areas.
