5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. <b>A</b> <b>properly</b> configured stereo pair would generate {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary cause}} of {{vibrations}} in <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> functioning bicycle is the surface over which it rolls. In addition to pneumatic tires and traditional bicycle suspensions, {{a variety of techniques}} have been developed to damp vibrations before they reach the rider. These include materials, such as carbon fiber, either in the whole frame or just key components such as the front fork, seatpost, or handlebars; tube shapes, such as curved seat stays; and special inserts, such as Zertz by Specialized, and Buzzkills by Bontrager.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages and tanks for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E

5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each exhalation and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> designed solar filter.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortification}} of Castle Rising {{was constructed}} in a carefully designed landscape. In front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement {{appears to have been}} laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a similar fashion to that at New Buckenham and Malton Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered essential parts of <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> established castle.|$|E

5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of diamond cut and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E
5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find <b>a</b> <b>properly</b> strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
