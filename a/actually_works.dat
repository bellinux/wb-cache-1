25|$|Later studies, called Phase II and Phase III studies, enroll more people, and {{the goal}} is to {{determine}} whether the treatment <b>actually</b> <b>works.</b> Phase III studies are frequently randomized controlled trials, with the experimental treatment being compared to the current best available treatment rather than to a placebo. In some cases, the Phase III trial provides the best available treatment to all participants, in addition to some of the patients receiving the experimental treatment.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{researchers}} typically use {{a statistical}} hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing {{how well the}} data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific hypothesis about how the phenomenon under study <b>actually</b> <b>works.)</b> Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the null hypothesis that variations result from random fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely usd standard ascribes statistical significance to results which have less than 5% probability of being explained by random variation.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the film}} {{initially}} came to Jonze in the early 2000s when he read an article online that mentioned a website where a user could instant message with an artificial intelligence. [...] "For the first, maybe, 20 seconds of it, it had this real buzz," [...] said Jonze. [...] "I'd say 'Hey, hello,' and it would say 'Hey, how are you?', {{and it was like}} whoa [...] this is trippy. After 20 seconds, it quickly fell apart and you realized how it <b>actually</b> <b>works,</b> and it wasn't that impressive. But it was still, for 20 seconds, really exciting. The more people that talked to it, the smarter it got." [...] Jonze's interest in the project was renewed after directing the short film I'm Here (2010), which shares similar themes. Inspiration also came from Kaufman's writing approach for Synecdoche, New York (2008). Jonze explained, [...] " [...] said he wanted to try to write everything he was thinking about in that moment – all the ideas and feelings at that time – and put it into the script. I was very inspired by that, and tried to do that in [...] And a lot of the feelings you have about relationships or about technology are often contradictory." ...|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It <b>actually</b> <b>works</b> better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "What would Marge {{do on the}} show if she didn’t stage campaigns to tell others what to do? Despite the risk of redundancy, 'Sweets' <b>actually</b> <b>works</b> quite well." [...] He praised Stiller's appearance in the episode, {{as well as the}} [...] "exploration of the records book". He concluded his review by considering it [...] "one of Season 13's stronger programs". Nate Boss of Project-Blu was favorable as well, calling the episode [...] "A funny take on class-action suits (particularly those concerning other consumer products willingly purchased, like tobacco), as well as prohibition." [...] DVD Verdict's Jennifer Malkowski gave the episode a B rating, and wrote that the [...] "library's 'Yes, we have pornography!' banner" [...] was the episode's [...] "highlight". Giving it a more mixed review, Ron Martin of 411Mania called the episode [...] "uneven at best, mediocre at worst". Andre Dellamorte of Collider described it as a [...] "redress" [...] of the season 8 episode [...] "Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment", in which Springfield is faced with prohibition. Giving the episode a negative review, IGN's R.L. Shaffer wrote that [...] "Sweet and Sour Marge", along with [...] "Homer the Moe", [...] "The Frying Game", and [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] "represent some of the worst of The Simpsons".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness <b>actually</b> <b>works</b> now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E
500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety about his or her individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, <b>actually</b> <b>works</b> toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E

2500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics.

Though the show often threatens to falter, it usually succeeds."

2500|$|This implies {{another level}} of masking, because the {{economic}} character masks are then straightforwardly ("vulgarly") equated with authentic behaviour. The effect in this case is, that the theory of [...] "how the economy works" [...] masks how it <b>actually</b> <b>works,</b> by conflating its surface appearance with its real nature. Its generalities seem to explain it, but in reality they do not. The theory is therefore (ultimately) arbitrary. Either things are studied in isolation from the total {{context in which they}} occur, or generalizations are formed which leave essential bits out. Such distortion can certainly be ideologically useful to justify an economic system, position or policy as a good thing, but it can become a hindrance to understanding.|$|E
