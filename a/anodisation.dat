An innovative and rationally designed sinusoidal pulse <b>anodisation</b> (SPA) approach in galvanostatic mode is used {{with the aim of}} engineering the effective medium of NAA in a sinusoidal fashion. A precise control over the different <b>anodisation</b> parameters (i. e. <b>anodisation</b> period, <b>anodisation</b> amplitude, <b>anodisation</b> offset, number of pulses, <b>anodisation</b> temperature and pore widening time) makes it possible to engineer the characteristic reflection peaks and interferometric colours of NAA-RFs, which can be finely tuned across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. The effect of the aforementioned <b>anodisation</b> parameters on the photonic properties of NAA-RFs (i. e. characteristic reflection peaks and interferometric colours) is systematically assessed in order to establish {{for the first time a}} comprehensive rationale towards NAA-RFs with fully controllable photonic properties.

40|$|First {{published}} online 07 Jul 2016 Herein, {{we present}} a rationally designed advanced nanofabrication approach aiming at producing {{a new type of}} optical bandpass filters based on nanoporous anodic alumina photonic crystals. The photonic stop band of nanoporous anodic alumina (NAA) is engineered in depth by means of a pseudo-stepwise pulse <b>anodisation</b> (PSPA) approach consisting of pseudo-stepwise asymmetric current density pulses. This nanofabrication method makes it possible to tune the transmission bands of NAA at specific wavelengths and bandwidths, which can be broadly modified across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum through the <b>anodisation</b> period (i. e. time between consecutive pulses). First, we establish the effect of the <b>anodisation</b> period as a means of tuning the position and width of the transmission bands of NAA across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. To this end, a set of nanoporous anodic alumina bandpass filters (NAA-BPFs) are produced with different <b>anodisation</b> periods, ranging from 500 to 1200 s, and their optical properties (i. e. characteristic transmission bands and interferometric colours) are systematically assessed. Then, we demonstrate that the rational combination of stacked NAA-BPFs consisting of layers of NAA produced with different PSPA periods can be readily used to create a set of unique and highly selective optical bandpass filters with characteristic transmission bands, the position, width and number of which can be precisely engineered by this rational <b>anodisation</b> approach. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that the superposition of stacked NAA-BPFs produced with slight modifications of the <b>anodisation</b> period enables the fabrication of NAA-BPFs with unprecedented broad transmission bands across the UV-visible-NIR spectrum. The results obtained from our study constitute the first comprehensive rationale towards advanced NAA-BPFs with fully controllable photonic properties. These photonic crystal structures could become a promising alternative to traditional optical bandpass filters based on glass and plastic.

40|$|Vacuum microelectronic (VME) {{devices are}} of {{interest}} {{for the development of}} flat-screen displays and microwave devices. In many cases, their operation depends on the field emission of electrons from micron-sized cathodes (semiconductor or metal), into a vacuum. Major challenges to be met before these devices can be fully exploited include obtaining - low operating voltages, high maximum emission currents, uniform emission characteristics, and long-term emission stability. The research in this thesis concerns the production of silicon field emitters and the improvement of their emission properties by the process of <b>anodisation.</b> <b>Anodisation</b> was carried out for short times, in order to form a very thin layer of porous silicon (PS) at the surface of both p and p + -type silicon emitters. The aim in doing this was to form a high density of asperities over the surface of the emitters. It was the intention that these asperities, rather than the "macroscopic" apex of the emitter, would control emission. This was the first work of its kind to be carried out. Transmission electron microscopy was used to characterise the morphology of p and p + -type silicon emitters before and after <b>anodisation.</b> Both the structure and arrangement of the surface fibrils, the thickness of the PS layers at the apex and nature of PS cross-sections were studied. The morphology was correlated to subsequent field emission measurements. Field emission characteristics, before and after <b>anodisation,</b> were obtained using a scanning electron microscope adapted for field emission measurements, and a field emission microscope. Extensive measurements showed that, following <b>anodisation,</b> there was substantial improvement in emission behaviour. After <b>anodisation,</b> the following was found to be true: i) The starting voltage was reduced by up to 50 % (with p +</sup -type PS emitters exhibiting a greater reduction in starting voltage than p-type PS emitters). ii) Number of emitting tips per array was increased. iii) Higher maximum currents (up to 3 times higher) were obtained before tips underwent destruction. iv) The resistive effect of the PS layer at the apex was important in determining the maximum current obtained from a tip. In addition, both field emission and field ion microscopy were used to identify the emission source following <b>anodisation.</b> It was shown that individual fibrils on the emission surface caused an increase in field enhancement over a flat plane, leading to emission at lower voltage.

Regarding the effect of <b>anodisation</b> voltage, GAXRD analysis showed that anatase was the only oxide phase in the samples anodised at voltages from 100 to 200 V (at 10 min for 0. 2 M oxalic acid and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). Data from Raman showed that anatase was present in all films and its intensity increased with increasing voltage.

The attractive in vivo performance of zirconium is mainly due to the presence of a protective oxide layer. In this preliminary study, the surface of pure zirconium modified by <b>anodisation</b> in acidic media at low potentials to enhance its barrier protection given by the oxides and osseointegration. Bare, commercially pure zirconium cylinders were compared to samples anodised at 30  V through electrochemical tests and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For both conditions, in vivo tests were performed in a rat tibial osteotomy model. The histological features and fluorochrome-labelling changes of newly bone formed around the implants were evaluated on the non-decalcified sections  63  days after surgery. Electrochemical tests and SEM images show that the <b>anodisation</b> treatment increases the barrier effect over the material and the in vivo tests show continuous newly formed bone around the implant with a different amount of osteocytes in their lacunae depending on the region.

The influence of <b>anodisation</b> voltage and <b>anodisation</b> time on nanotube wall thickness, diameter and length has been investigated. The results indicate that nanotubes can be formed within a voltage range 10 - 40 V and that the tubular structure is lost when using a higher voltage. The diameter of the nanotubes is voltage dependent, with the widest tubes being obtained at the highest possible applied voltage of 40 V. An initial voltage ramp which increases at 100 mV/s to the <b>anodisation</b> voltage, rather than an instantaneous step, was observed to stabilise the metal-oxide interface. This enabled the growth of anodic films up to 5. 5 jam in length by anodising for approximately 48 h.

The main aim was to control the growth of TiO 2 nanotubes with various morphologies and to investigate potential applications for controlled drug release and for photocatalytic water splitting. The electrochemical <b>anodisation</b> process in fluoride-containing organic electrolytes was employed to prepare vertically aligned TiO 2 nanotubular arrays, with inner diameters of individual nanotubes ranging from 50 to 150 nm. A variety of morphologies was created by precise control of experimental conditions and parameters. The formation of crystal phases in the TiO 2 nanotubes was controlled by the annealing temperature (in air) and monitored by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The fundamental <b>anodisation</b> parameters affecting the morphologies, such as <b>anodisation</b> voltage, electrolyte composition, stirring and the effect of magnetic fields were investigated. Various processing procedures that affect the <b>anodisation</b> process have been studied. The influence of hydroxide islands on the growth mechanism was shown by analysis of <b>anodisation</b> current-time profiles, contact angle measurements and SEM observations. The effect of pre-patterns on the Ti substrate was also studied. The substrate was patterned either mechanically or by Electron Beam Lithography (EBL) with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as a positive photoresist. Instead of circular nanotubes, polygonal TiO 2 nanotubes were formed from the mechanically patterned substrate whereas rectangular and tube-in-tube TiO 2 nanotubes were formed by using EBL.

40|$|An equifield {{strength}} {{model has}} been established to elucidate the formation mechanism for the highly ordered alumina pore arrays and titanium oxide nanotubular arrays prepared via a common electrochemical methodology, <b>anodisation.</b> The fundamentals of the equifield strength model was the equilibrium between the electric field driven oxidation rate of the metal and electric field enhanced dissolution rate of oxide. During the anodic oxidation of metal, pore initiation was believed to generate based on dissolution rate difference caused by inhomogeneity near the metal/oxide interface. The ionic nanoconvection driven by the electric force exerted on the space charge layer {{in the vicinity of}} electrolyte/oxide interface is established to be the main driving force of the pore ordering at the early stage of the <b>anodisation.</b> While the equifield strength requirement governs the following formation of the single pore and the self-ordering of random distributed pore arrays during the <b>anodisation</b> process. Hexagonal patterned Al 2 O 3 nanopore arrays and TiO 2 nanotubular arrays have been achieved by <b>anodisation</b> of corresponding metal substrates in proper electrolytes. The two characteristic microstructural features of anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) and anodic titanium oxide (ATO) were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The observations of the hemispherical electrolyte/oxide and oxide/metal interfaces, uniform thickness of the oxide layer, as well as self-adjustment of the pore size and pore ordering can be well explained by the equifield strength model. Field enhanced dissociation of water is extremely important in determination of the porosity of anodic metal oxide. The porosity of AAO and ATO films was found to be governed by the relative dissociation rate of water which is dependent on <b>anodisation</b> conditions, such as electrolyte, applied voltage, current density and electric field strength. Using an empirical method, the relations between the porosity of the AAO (ATO) films and the <b>anodisation</b> parameters, such as electric field strength, current density and applied voltage, have been established. Besides, the extent that an external electric field can facilitate the heterolytic dissociation of water molecule has been estimated using quantum-chemical model computations combined with the experimental aspect. With these achievements, the fabrication of anodic metal oxide films can be understood and controlled more precisely. Additionally, the impacts of other factors such as the electrolyte type and the temperature effect on the morphology of the anodic products were also investigated.

Two methods were used in the present work: <b>Anodisation</b> and gel oxidation. <b>Anodisation</b> was performed at room temperature in strong mineral acids (sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) and phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4)), an oxidising agent (hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2)), mixed solutions of the preceding three, and a weak organic acid mixture (&# 946;-glycerophosphate + calcium acetate). The parameters used in <b>anodisation</b> were: Concentrations of the electrolytes, applied voltage, current density, and <b>anodisation</b> time. Gel oxidation was carried out by soaking titanium substrates in sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solutions at different concentrations (0. 5 M, 1. 0 M, 5. 0 M, and 10. 0 M) at 60 °C for 24 h, followed by oxidation at 400 °, 600 °, and 800 °C for 1 h. Conceptual models representing changes in the microstructure {{as a function of the}} experimental parameters were developed using the <b>anodisation</b> data. The relevant parameters were: Applied voltage, current density, acid concentration, and <b>anodisation</b> time: 	The model for <b>anodisation</b> using the strong acid (H 2 SO 4) illustrates the growth rate of the film, identification of the threshold for the establishment of a consistent microstructure, and prediction of the properties of the film. 	For the oxidising agent (H 2 O 2), two models were developed: Current-control and voltage-control, the applicability of which depends on the scale of the current density (high or low, respectively). These models are interpreted in terms of the coherency/incoherency of the corrosion gel, arcing, and porosity. 	The model for the strongest acid (H 3 PO 4) is similar to that of H 2 O 2 in current-control mode, although this system showed the greatest intensity of arcing and consequent pore size. 	<b>Anodisation</b> in mixed solutions uses Ohms law to explain four stages of film growth in current-control mode. These stages describe the thickness of the gel, its recrystallisation, and the achievement of a consistent microstructure. 	<b>Anodisation</b> in weaker organic acids allows the most detailed examination of the <b>anodisation</b> process. Both current density and voltage as a function time reveal the nature of the process in six stages: (1) instrumental response, (2 and 3) gel thickening, (4) transformation of the amorphous gel to amorphous titania, (5) recrystallisation of the amorphous titania, and (6) subsurface pore generation upon establishment of a consistent microstructure. Gel oxidation was done at low and high NaOH concentrations followed by oxidation. Three models were developed to represent the gel oxidation process: (1) Low concentration, (0. 5 M and 1. 0 M NaOH), (2) Medium concentration (5. 0 M NaOH), and (3) high concentration (10. 0 M NaOH). For the low concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves: (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase and (2) a dense layer of rutile forms. For the high concentrations with increasing temperature, the model involves: (1) amorphous sodium titanate forms over a layer of amorphous anatase, (2) a dense layer of anatase forms and raises up the existing porous anatase layer, and (3) the dense and porous anatase layers transform to dense and porous rutile layers, respectively. The main difference between the two is the retention of crystalline sodium titanate in the higher NaOH concentration. Anodised and gel oxidised samples subsequently were soaked in simulated body fluid in order to study the precipitation of hydroxyapatite in the absence and presence of long UV irradiation, which has not been investigated before. With the anodised surfaces, the porous and rough titania coating facilitated both the precipitation of hydroxyapatite and the attachment of bone-like cells. UV irradiation showed greatly enhanced hydroxyapatite precipitation, which is attributed to its photocatalytic properties. With the gel oxidised surfaces, the greatest amount of hydroxyapatite precipitation occurred with the presence of both anatase and amorphous sodium titanate. Rutile suppressed precipitation...|$|E
40|$|Oxide {{thin films}} of Pb-Sn alloy {{electrodes}} were synthesised by potentiodynamic <b>anodisation</b> in hot alkaline solution of sodium sulfate. Films were characterised by various analytical techniques: XRD, SEM, Raman spectroscopy and XPS. The XRD and Raman investigations {{reveal that the}} increase in concentration of Sn in the alloy suppresses the formation of the photoactive phase alpha-PbO but it increases the formation of the conducting phase, alpha-PbO 2. XPS results indicate the presence of both divalent and tetravalent Pb as well as tetravalent Sn on these films. It also gives evidence for the decrease in alpha-PbO content upon <b>anodisation</b> of the alloy Pb-Sn electrodes...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{synthesis}} Oxide materials a b s t r a c t The {{formation of}} self-organised titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanotubes array {{was achieved by}} <b>anodisation</b> of pure titanium foil in a standard two-electrode bath consisting of 1 M Na 2 SO 4. Excess NH 4 F (5 wt%) {{was used in this}} work and the pH was kept constant at 3. Control over the dimension of the nanotubes was successfully established in this work by altering the <b>anodisation</b> voltage. Three important observations were made: (i) there is a threshold voltage above which nanotubes will form, (ii) within the range of voltages where nanotubes form, samples made at low voltage consist of nanotubes with small pore size (< 40 nm) and nanotubes diameter increases with voltage until a maximum voltage of 25 V where the nanotubular array started to diminish and (iii) the length of thenanotubes also increaseswith <b>anodisation</b> voltage. Photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) was successfully performed on the titania nanotubes with diameter of 100 nm. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thin film {{semiconducting}} oxides are synthesised by potentiodynamic <b>anodisation</b> of Pb + Sn alloy electrodes {{of various}} Sn content in hot alkaline sodium sulfate solution. The effect of Sn on the photoelectrochemical behaviour in Fe(CN) (6) (4 -/ 3 -) (pH 9. 2, buffer) of lead oxide thin film prepared by {{this method is}} investigated. It has been concluded that the incorporation of tin into Pb + Sn alloy and its subsequent <b>anodisation</b> decreases the growth of photoactive alpha-PbO (tetragonal) phase and introduces a relatively very low photoactive SnO phase. The oxide layer formed after 20 min of <b>anodisation</b> of Pb- 0. 1 wt. %Sn electrode shows the best photoresponse (conversion efficiency 0. 23 %), but it is lower than that obtained with undoped lead oxide (0. 86 %). The reasons for obtaining a low efficiency are discussed. The oxide layer is characterised by various physical and photoelectrochemical techniques. The growth of oxide film {{is found to be}} maximal in the potential range - 1. 25 to + 2. 35 V(vs. SCE) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of anodic films during the <b>anodisation</b> of copper, at different applied potentials E, in aqueous 0. 5 M sulphuric acid containing different amounts of dissolved thiourea was investigated following the corroding electrode profile by on line in situ imaging. For E 0. 07 V, the main reactions are the electro-decomposition of formamidine disulphide and Cu(I) -thiourea complexes yielding a copper sulphide-containing film (film II) and the electrodissolution of copper as aqueous Cu(II) ions through film II. The relative contribution {{of these processes}} depends on thiourea concentration in the solution, the applied electric potential and <b>anodisation</b> time. The growth kinetics of films I and II were determined from {{the evolution of the}} average film height h obtained from in situ imaging. The kinetics of him I fit a parabolic rate law, whereas those of film II approach a linear h versus <b>anodisation</b> time relationship. The rupture of film II assists the localised corrosion of copper. Likely physical mechanisms for the {{formation of}} these anodic films are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|In {{this work}} we report the {{production}} of nanostructured WO 3 photoanodes for solar water splitting produced via <b>anodisation</b> using {{for the first time}} citric acid (CA), a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to fluoride-based electrolytes. Photoelectrochemical solar water splitting has shown potential as a renewable method for hydrogen production, a key ingredient to advance the de-carbonisation of our economy. Many methods to produce WO 3 photoanodes are time-consuming and require high temperatures and/or toxic chemicals, such as fluoride-based electrolytes. Here we report on a systematic investigation of the <b>anodisation</b> of tungsten using CA to establish a relation between (i) <b>anodisation</b> parameters (current, time and electrolyte), (ii) the resulting nanostructured morphology and (iii) its performance as a photoanode for water splitting. Characterisation was carried out by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, linear sweep voltammetry, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. After optimisation, the obtained WO 3 photoanodes produced a photocurrent of 0. 88 mA cm- 2 at 1. 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0. 5 M aqueous H 2 SO 4 under AM 1. 5 solar irradiation. At low applied potentials (below 0. 67 V vs. Ag/AgCl), closer to practical conditions, the photoanodes produced in CA outperformed a conventional counterpart made using a NH 4 F electrolyte. The CA-anodised photoanodes also showed higher stability, retaining 90 % of their activity after 1 h of chopped solar illumination. This work demonstrates the promise of <b>anodisation</b> in citric acid as an efficient and more sustainable method for {{the production of}} WO 3 photoanodes for solar water splitting...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} known that the field {{emission}} performance of single crystal silicon field emitters is improved by the formation of porous silicon on their surface. However, single crystal based displays {{are likely to be}} expensive and difficult to scale up. Displays based on polysilicon would have advantages in both of these respects. We now report the first observation of enhanced field emission from porous silicon on polysilicon emitters. Both wet and dry etching processes were used to produce emitters on n and p type polysilicon. Porous silicon was then formed by <b>anodisation.</b> Field emission characterisation after the <b>anodisation</b> shows a significant starting voltage reduction of 40 - 50 % in each of the samples tested...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWet {{chemical}} anodic oxides {{may represent}} an alternative way of forming passivating dielectric layers for silicon solar cells. In this paper {{we describe the}} requirements to achieve <b>anodisation</b> using a field-induced process which involves forward-biasing a p-n junction to make an n-type silicon wafer surface anodic. Although potentially very large currents can be achieved using this method, it is shown that the <b>anodisation</b> current is practically limited by the resistances in the electrochemical circuit. Furthermore, depletion regions can form at both surfaces when the wafer is under forward-bias. This can be addressed by either ensuring that the surfaces are sufficiently-doped for ohmic contact or by using light to generate a photocurrent in the depletion regions of the wafer...|$|E
