The novel's protagonist is 5ft 7in (170cm), has brown hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b> Cox is 5ft 6in (168cm), has brown hair and green eyes. Both the protagonist and Cox drove a silver Audi TT, illegally acquired Tampa real estate worth $2.7 million, were alumni of the University of South Florida, had an intense fear of Interpol, and formerly worked as insurance seller.|$|E

Since then, Snake Eyes has had extensive plastic surgery to repair the damage, but his vocal cords cannot be repaired.

When out of his uniform, Snake Eyes is shown to be Caucasian with an athletic build, blonde hair, <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ethnic {{origins of}} the Cumanians are uncertain. The Cumans were {{reported}} to have had blond hair, fair skin <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> (which set them apart from other groups and later puzzled historians), although their anthropological characteristics suggest that their geographical origin might be in Inner-Asia, South-Siberia, or (as Istvan Vassary postulates) east of the large bend of the Yellow River in China. Robert Wolff states that it is conjectured that ethnically the Cumans may not originally have been Turkic.|$|E

25|$|By the 1880s {{a number}} of {{linguists}} and anthropologists argued that the Aryans themselves had originated somewhere in northern Europe. Theodor Poesche proposed that the Aryans originated in the vast Rokitno, or Pinsk Marshes, then in the Russian Empire, now covering much of {{the southern part of}} Belarus and the north-west of the Ukraine, but it was Karl Penka who popularised the idea that the Aryans had emerged in Scandinavia and could be identified by the distinctive Nordic characteristics of blond hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

In January 1945, less than a year later, Russian military forces fought door-to-door battles and liberated Hungary from Nazi occupation. However, Lantos, then 17, returned home only to discover that his mother and other family members had all been killed by the Germans, along with 440,000 other Hungarian Jews, during the preceding 10 months of their occupation.|$|E

For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have red hair and green eyes, Kaunian peoples have blond hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have dark hair and eyes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before his}} {{retirement}} from the NFL, Simpson {{embarked on a}} film career with parts in films such as the television mini-series Roots (1977), and the dramatic motion pictures The Klansman (1974), The Towering Inferno (1974), The Cassandra Crossing (1976), Capricorn One (1978), and the comedic Back to the Beach (1987) and The Naked Gun trilogy (1988, 1991, 1994). In 1979, he started his own film production company, Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented Goldie and the Boxer films with Melissa Michaelsen (1979 and 1981), and Cocaine <b>and</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>Eyes</b> (1983), the pilot for a proposed detective series on NBC.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 17th {{century to the}} middle 18th century, European colonists {{reported}} encounters with gray-eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists (although at least one, {{a story of a}} Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language, {{is likely to be a}} hoax). Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> not long after their arrival. As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement, and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora, the likelihood that the origin of those fair-skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high.|$|E

25|$|Alan Ford is {{the central}} {{character}} of the series.

He is a shy, naive person, and very humble, {{but one of the most}} effective agents of the series. He matures during the course of the series and grows to be a tough, smart man. He has a soft side, is rarely angry, and while acknowledging the life under Number One as unfair, he is happy with what he gets. He grew up in an orphanage and was evicted from a slum due to neglecting bills at the start of the series, and he joined TNT on accident. He is one of the most trusted agents of Number One.|$|E
25|$|His last {{hiding place}} {{was in an}} {{apartment}} with his university friend Lion Nordheim, his wife Jeanne, and her sister Trusha van Amerongen. In {{the course of his}} hiding he kept in touch with the scientific community through visits at his hiding place by Hendrik Anthony Kramers and Lambertus Broer. Jeanne and Trusha had blond hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes</b> and ventured out in public as non-Jews, while Lion and Pais hid in the apartment. In March 1945, however, they were betrayed and all four were arrested. The same week the Americans had crossed the Rhine and cut the rail lines, making impossible their transfer to a concentration camp. The women were soon released. After a month of interrogation by the Gestapo, Pais was released several days {{before the end of the}} war. Nordheim was executed ten days before the end of the war.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will start moving independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|E

500|$|Kishimoto was {{satisfied}} with his character having blond hair <b>and</b> <b>blue</b> <b>eyes,</b> something rarely seen in Japanese anime or manga.

In the , Naruto is playable in various stages of the Demon Fox's manifestation, characterized by a red chakra. Kishimoto took inspiration from the games' presentation of these forms, imitating one of them for the manga cover of volume 26.|$|E
