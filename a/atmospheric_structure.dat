25|$|Mars 1 (1962 Beta Nu 1), an {{automatic}} interplanetary spacecraft launched to Mars on November 1, 1962, {{was the first}} probe of the Soviet Mars probe program to achieve interplanetary orbit.

Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two-day intervals and later at 5 day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system.|$|E

40|$|Wind {{speeds and}} wind {{directions}} are measured remotely using an incoherent backscatter lidar system operating at a wavelength of 1. 06 mm {{with a maximum}} repetition rate of 13 Hz. The principle of the measurements is based on following detectable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures,</b> which are transported by the wind (Taylor’s hypothesis). The characteristic size and lifetime of these structures are also inverted from the data. Initially, the lidar was pointed in the horizontal plane parallel to the wind direction to measure the horizontal wind speed from the displacement of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures</b> along the lidar axis. Subsequently, the sensor was expanded with a time synchronous lidar that operated at an azimuth angle of about 15 deg {{with respect to the}} direction of the first lidar. The horizontal wind vector could then be measured over ranges of about 1. 5 km using the geometry of the dual lidar and the transit times of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures</b> between the two lidar axes. Results obtained with this dual lidar are comparable with the in situ measured wind vector. Finally, vertical profiles of the wind vector are measured to altitudes of about 1 km. This is realized by operating one lidar in the triangulation mode using a fast adjustable platform. The results obtained in this mode are in good agreement with in situ measured data from sensors on a 213 -m-high meteorologically instrumented mast and with data provided by an acoustic sounde...|$|R

Suzuka-oroshi {{is said to be}} generated by the Suzuka Mountain range. For this reason, a big wind power plant “Aoyama-kogen Wind Farm” is located {{at the top of the}} Suzuka Mountain range. We took “simultaneous multiple-radiosonde observation” in order to measure horizontal and vertical <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures</b> from a windward side to a leeward side in the central part of Mie Prefecture in March 2010. The observation was conducted in a narrow area with about 35 km horizontal distance between the windward and leeward observatories. The simultaneous multipleradiosonde observation is a new observational method in which we simultaneously launched balloons with GPS radiosondes at four observatories along the prevailing wind from the windward to leeward.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Arctic atmospheric simulations to initial and boundary conditions {{has been investigated}} withthe high horizontal resolution regional climate model HIRHAM driven by observational data analyses at thelateral and lower boundaries. The investigation of the constraint of the synoptic-scale flow in the specificcircumpolar Arctic domain shows {{that even though the}} same domain size is used as in mid-latitude RCMsimulations, a weaker constraint of the synoptic scales and a smaller predictability have been obtained. A simple spectral analysis shows that only scales with wavelengths longer than 1000 km contribute to thehigher root mean square difference. Due to the weaker lateral boundary control a pronounced {{sensitivity of}}the Arctic simulations concerning uncertainties of initial conditions has been found. The changes of the monthlymean <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures</b> due to internal processes are of the same order like those due to inaccuratephysical parameterizations.

40|$|The Vipava {{valley in}} Slovenia {{is well known}} for the {{appearance}} of strong, gusty North-East Bora winds, which occur as a result of air flows over an adjacent orographic barrier. There are three revealing wind directions within the valley which were found to give rise to specific types of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures.</b> These structures were investigated using a Mie scattering lidar operating at 1064 nm, which provided high temporal and spatial resolution backscatter data on aerosols, which were used as tracers for atmospheric flows. Wind properties were monitored {{at the bottom of the}} valley and at the rim of the barrier using two ultrasonic anemometers. Twelve time periods between February and April 2015 were selected when lidar data was available. The periods were classified according to the wind speed and direction and investigated in terms of appearance of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures.</b> In two periods with strong or moderate Bora, periodic <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures</b> in the lidar data were observed at heights above the mountain barrier and are believed to be Kelvin–Helmholtz waves, induced by wind shear. No temporal correlation was found between these structures and wind gusts at the ground level. The influence of the wind on the height of the planetary boundary layer was studied as well. In periods with low wind speeds, the vertical evolution of the planetary boundary layer was found to be governed by solar radiation and clouds. In periods with strong or moderate Bora wind, convection within the planetary boundary layer was found to be much weaker due to strong turbulence close to the ground, which inhibited mixing through the entire layer...|$|R

40|$|Radio {{occultation}} {{experiments have}} been simulated for the Arctic region {{on the basis}} of the regional atmospheric model HIRHAM 4. Irregular structures in the atmosphere produce a violation of the quasi-sphericity in the radio signal propagation and exert a strong influence on the accuracy of atmospheric profiles retrieved by the radio occultation technique. Errors in radio occultation data are spatially localised and associated with gradients in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures.</b> Local errors reach 2 % in retrieved profiles of refractivity corresponding to an error of 6 K in temperature. Therefore mesoscale variations in atmospheric parameter gradients in a specified region must be taken into account when interpreting radio occultation data. We show, that a correction functional can be developed using the refractivity index field calculated from the regional model in order to improve the radio occultation retrieval of atmospheric parameters. This functional is constructed from instantaneous model outputs, as well as from temporally averaged fields of refractivity using data of the HIRHAM 4 model for the Arctic atmosphere. The correction functional derived from monthly averaged data reduced the retrieval errors of refractivity, temperature, and pressure in the troposphere, in particular, temperature retrieval errors are reduced up to 1 K. Application of this kind of functional depends on whether the model used for the construction of the functional is able to simulate the real mesoscale <b>atmospheric</b> <b>structures.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Eclipse depth variability is thus a valuable tool to constrain the circulation regime and global wind speeds in hot Jupiter atmospheres. 1...|$|R
