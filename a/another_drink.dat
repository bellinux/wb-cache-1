5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing <b>another</b> <b>drink</b> in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E

500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument.

2500|$|Although {{the first}} name of 'I' is not stated {{anywhere}} in the film, {{it is widely believed}} that it is 'Peter'. This myth arose {{as a result of a}} line of misheard dialogue.

In his reply, Monty both accepts his offer and says [...] "...you must tell me all the news, I haven't seen you since you finished your last film". [...] While pouring <b>another</b> <b>drink,</b> and downing his own, Withnail replies that he has been [...] "Rather busy uncle. TV and stuff". Then pointing at Marwood he says [...] "He's just had an audition for rep".
