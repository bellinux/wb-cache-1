5|$|To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a Watchman, {{an earlier}} draft of To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued {{to respond to}} her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.|$|E
5|$|In February 2016, it was {{revealed}} that Sorkin will be adapting To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> for the stage, where he will be working alongside Bartlett Sher.|$|E
5|$|But as Hohoff saw it, the {{manuscript}} {{was by no}} means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” During the next couple of years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form and was retitled To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Another novel, Go Set a Watchman, {{was written}} in the mid-1950s and {{published}} in July 2015 as a [...] "sequel", though it was later confirmed to be To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbirds</b> first draft.|$|R

50|$|Surprisingly, Melissa {{began to}} lose her sanity and hums a lullaby: a very spine-chilling lullaby {{resembling}} <b>a</b> <b>mockingbird's</b> song. She begrudgingly warns James to never turn back and pushed him to a shelf of chemicals, severely burning him as Melissa stabs him {{to death with a}} scapel. It was revealed that Melissa was the real culprit.|$|R
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near <b>a</b> <b>mockingbird</b> nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> as adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Rosanne Cash, Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titled Scout, Atticus, and Boo.|$|E
5|$|To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> is a {{novel by}} Harper Lee {{published}} in 1960. It was immediately successful, winning the Pulitzer Prize, {{and has become a}} classic of modern American literature.

5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E

25|$|Nelle Harper Lee (April 28, 1926February 19, 2016), {{better known}} by her pen name Harper Lee, was an American novelist widely known for To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> {{published}} in 1960. Immediately successful, it won the 1961 Pulitzer Prize {{and has become}} a classic of modern American literature.

Additionally, Lee received numerous honorary degrees, though she declined to speak on those occasions. She was also known for assisting her close friend Truman Capote in his research for the book In Cold Blood (1966). Capote was the basis for the character Dill in To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> Lee accompanied Capote to Holcomb, Kansas, {{to assist}} him in researching what they thought would be an article on a small town's response {{to the murder of}} a farmer and his family.

5000|$|In June 1892, Jones {{became the}} first African-American to sing at the Music Hall in New York (renamed Carnegie Hall the {{following}} year). Among the selections in her program were Charles Gounod's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] and Giuseppe Verdi's [...] "Sempre libera" [...] (from La traviata). The New York Echo wrote of her performance at the Music Hall: [...] "If Mme Jones is not the equal of Adelina Patti, she at least can come nearer it than anything the American public has heard. Her notes are as clear as <b>a</b> <b>mockingbird's</b> and her annunciation perfect." [...] On June 8, 1892, her career elevated beyond primary ethnic communities, and was furthered when she received a contract, {{with the possibility of}} a two-year extension, for $150 per week (plus expenses) with Mayor James B. Pond, who had meaningful affiliations to many authors and musicians. The company Troubadours made an important statement about the capabilities of black performers, that besides minstrelsy, there were other areas of genre and style.|$|R
25|$|Capote then {{finds himself}} {{entangled}} {{in a personal}} and professional dilemma. As much as he wants Smith to be {{sentenced to life in}} prison, a death by hanging would provide a far more sensational ending for readers of his book. He begins to unravel psychologically as the legal appeals drag on, unable to complete his book without an ending. Lee, during the interim, writes To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird,</b> which becomes a best-seller.|$|E
25|$|The {{period in}} {{time from the}} end of World War II up until, roughly, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the {{publication}} {{of some of the most}} popular works in American history such as To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> by Harper Lee. The last few of the more realistic modernists along with the wildly Romantic beatniks largely dominated the period, while the direct respondents to America's involvement in World War II contributed in their notable influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{plot and}} {{characters}} of To Kill <b>a</b> <b>Mockingbird</b> are {{loosely based on}} Lee's observations of her family and neighbors, {{as well as an}} event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10years old. The novel deals with the irrationality of adult attitudes towards race and class in the Deep South of the 1930s, as depicted through the eyes of two children. The novel was inspired by racist attitudes in her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama.|$|E

50|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Funky's past except {{that he and his}} sidekick Houseroy (popularly {{considered}} to be a caricature of Roy Thomas) were business associates of <b>a</b> Colonel <b>Mockingbird.</b> After Mockingbird's death, Funky and Houseroy lived on monthly allowances (most likely their inheritance from Mockingbird) that were automatically doled out. Noticing that the monthly allowances were getting smaller, Funky decided that he needed a new source of income.|$|R
25|$|To {{cope with}} a mortal injury she {{sustained}} in <b>a</b> mission, <b>Mockingbird</b> was injected with an experimental serum combining the Super Soldier Serum that gave Captain America his strength and the Infinity Formula that has slowed Nick Fury's aging. The obvious consequence of this was that her injuries were healed, but Fury admitted his uncertainty about the formula's long-term consequences on her biology. Thus far, she has exhibited greatly enhanced physical strength, healing and agility.|$|R

Clint and Mockingbird reconciled after defeating their enemies and thwarting the terrorist plot.|$|R
50|$|According to writer Deborah Davis, Mockingbird {{recruited}} leading American journalists into {{a propaganda}} network and oversaw {{the operations of}} front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed after a 1967 Ramparts magazine article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In the 1970s Congressional investigations and reports also revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups. None of these reports, however, mentions <b>an</b> Operation <b>Mockingbird</b> controlling or supporting these activities.|$|R
40|$|Galapagos Mockingbirds (Mimus parvulus) are {{opportunistic}} feeders {{that have}} been observed engaging {{in a variety of}} unusual predatory behaviors.
