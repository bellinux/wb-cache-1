The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that?</b> There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E

5000|$|In 1994, Knight {{decided to}} branch {{out as a}} live sound {{engineer}} and his first job was with a band called The Whisky Priests. “Two months touring Germany {{was a good way}} to learn your trade”, says Oliver. “I remember the first gig very well, we were {{two and a half hours}} late, the band should have been on at 8:30 and we arrived at 9:00 so it was straight on the stage and go. Live sound is very different to studio work, as I quickly realised. As the house engineer knew the band were bringing their own guy, he had left to get his tea. When he came back, he came running over to me shouting [...] "What the ... <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>that</b> sounds terrible!" [...] So he sorted it out, and by the end of the two months I knew what I was doing. I did another three-month tour with them in Germany, and owe a lot to those guys for the experience.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On 1 November 1915 Townshend led the 6th (Poona) Division from Kut-al-Amara {{and marched}} up {{the course of}} the River Tigris. Ctesiphon, some 25 mi south of Baghdad was reached on 20 November 1915. Here they met an Ottoman force of more than twenty {{thousand}} troops that had issued from Baghdad to oppose their approach to the city, giving them a numerical advantage of 2 to 1 over the 6th (Poona) Division, sited within well-prepared defensive trench fortifications. General Nurreddin Pasha had the command of four divisions, namely the 35th, the 38th, the 45th and 51st which he had dug in at trenches built over the ruins of Ctesiphon. At Ctesiphon, Townshend was obsessed with the Arch of Ctesiphon. Strachan stated:"The centre of the battlefield of Ctesiphon is the Arch, and it figures in all of the photographs of the Army when they reached this high point of the advance. And its immensely powerful for Townshend, the student of military history, because this marks the extremity of the Roman Empire, this marks the point where Belisarius, the famous Roman commander, had got to, coming in the other direction, of course. But for those with a classical education, as of course just about every British officer had received before the First World War, then this is a very powerful image indeed". Townshend had divided his division into four columns. To Column A, he assigned the Dorset regiment, the 104th Rifles and the Thirtieth Composite Brigade to which he attached two Gurkha companies. To Column B, Townshend assigned the Norfolk regiment, the 7th Rajputs and the 110th Mahrattas. To Column C went the Oxfordshire Light Infantry, the Twenty-second Punjabi regiment, the 103rd Mahrattas and 119th Infantry. And finally to Column D went the 7th Lancers, the Sixteenth Cavalry, the Thirty-third Cavalry and S battery of the Royal Horse Artillery. Townshend's plans called the Principle Mass [...] "either to throw the Turks into the Tigris or compel them to a disastrous flight across the Diala river, some six miles behind them". Column C was to attack Nureddin Pasha's right flank to distract him while the [...] "Principle Mass" [...] of Columns A and B were to attack the left flank of the Ottoman lines while Column D was to race around the Ottoman positions to attack from the rear. Townshend was in a notably bad mood before the battle and much to the shock of his servant Boggis savagely beat his dog Spot when he found Spot cuddled up next to Boggis asleep. When Boggis asked: [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> for sir?", he received the reply: [...] "He was sleeping with you! He's my dog and he's got to learn!". Boggis later recalled that Townshend was a [...] "harsh bastard" [...] who treated his men no better than he treated Spot.|$|E

40|$|When heckled, {{professional}} comedians frequently lament that “everyone’s a comedian!”. It’s {{easy to see}} why: professional comedians don’t possess {{different kinds}} of brains from others, or engage in radically different kinds of behaviours from others, and, moreover, {{the success of their}} acts is predicated on others ’ shared ability to understand and reason about comic situations they describe. The difference between comedians and their audience is a matter not of kind, but of degree, a difference that is reflected in the vocational emphasis they place on humour. Researchers in the field of computational creativity find themselves in a similar situation. As a sub-discipline of Artificial Intelligence, computational creativity explores theories and practices that give rise to a phenomenon, creativity, that all intelligent systems, human or machine, can legitimately lay claim to. Who is to say that a given AI system is not creative, insofar as it solves non-trivial problems or generates useful outputs that are not hard-wired into its programming? As with comedians’ being funny, the difference between studying computational creativity and studying artificial intelligence is one of emphasis rather than one of kind: the field of computational creativity, as typified by a long-running series of workshops at AI-related conferences, places a vocational emphasis on creativity, and attempts to draw together the commonalities of what human observers are willing to call “creative ” behaviours. The study of creativity in AI is not new, but it is unusual. When Margaret Boden included a chapter on creativity in her text-book, Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man (Boden, 1977), colleagues asked “Why on earth <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that?</b> ” (Boden, 1999). Sometimes, it seems that creativity is, for AI-believers, that place beyond the pale, where lies intelligence itself for AI-skeptics. Since the mid- 1990 s, interest in creativity from an AI perspective has begun to blossom. Workshops dedicated to computational creativity now occur yearly or more, the foremost being the International Joint Workshop on Computational Creativity (IJWCC). This series grew out of a number o...|$|E
40|$|Selling to the {{processing}} industry Cue: High value spice crops like vanilla and cardamom {{can be a}} tempting option for farmers wanting to earn more money. But growing these crops needs specialist knowledge and attention to detail, and farmers {{must be ready to}} invest in order to get their production started. One way {{to reduce the risk of}} failure is to have a contract with a buyer, such as a spice company, who can support in the production of the crop and be a guaranteed market. Uganda Crop Industry, for example, is a food processing company which contracts farmer groups to grow cardamom, a popular spice in Asian cooking. Ronald Kafeero is the chairman of one of these groups, and he spoke recently to Wambi Michael about how they grow and sell the spice. Before visiting Ronald, however, Wambi first met with Abdul Majidu, an extension worker with {{the processing}} company. He asked Abdul how many farmers supply their cardamom. IN:	?We have around 400 people ? OUT:	? have got that good example. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ronald Kafeero, who grows cardamom for the Uganda Crop Industry. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Majidu	We have around 400 people. The people were just very much in contact. Michael	They finally sell the product to you? Majidu	Indeed. Michael	Now let?s start our motorcycle, we go and see these guys who grow cardamom. We are now going to see some of the farmers who grow cardamom in part of this area. SFX	Motorcycle engine. Michael	We are now in Lugazi. We are meeting one of the farmers here in Lugazi Good afternoon sir. Kafeero	Good afternoon. Michael	How are you? Kafeero	I?m alright, how are you sir? Michael	Fine, how is here? Kafeero	We are ok here. Michael	Now we are talking about the growing of cardamom and I can see we are standing next to this crop. When did you begin growing cardamom? Kafeero	I began growing cardamom in 2004. We have a group which is called Kyosimbonanya. We were trained to grow cardamom so I became a model farmer here and I?m benefiting from cardamom. Michael	And how many are you in the group? Kafeero	We are 18 members. Michael	Ok, how do you market this cardamom after growing? Kafeero	After growing cardamom, after picking it from the garden, we take it straight to the Uganda Crop Industry and get our money just immediately. Michael	Immediately? Because in the past we used to have scenarios where you would grow coffee then they wait for years to get their money. So with cardamom you grow it immediately and get it? Kafeero	Yeah, and get the money. Michael	Ok. Tell us how you market this product? Kafeero	Ok. Us in our group we just gather our cardamom, all of us here, so that we send it and sell it as a group, in Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How good is that? Kafeero	That one is better because it takes a short time, takes a little time. One person can go, a person who we trust can go there, and the rest remain working in their farms, so that we don?t waste time. Michael	Now how do you ensure the quality of cardamom that you send to Uganda Crop Industries? Kafeero	That one, we were trained by some of our instructors. The best quality of cardamom we know and we just collect it, when it is about green. Michael	Now let?s talk again about this group marketing element. How are the farmers who are growing cardamom benefiting from selling of cardamom? Kafeero	We were suffering when we were selling it, this coffee, because we were selling just individually. But now as a group, our people have benefited very much because we gather our crop at my home here and we take it there to Uganda Crop Industry. Michael	How do you share out what you have got in terms of sales? Kafeero	I have a weighing scale here. So every person who has brought his cardamom we have to know the exact kilos which we are just taking. So we gather it together, after getting the kilos of every individual, so that we send it there. Michael	And how good is this? Kafeero	That one is very good because it does not waste time and we are working together. So we are benefiting and we are advising the money which we get from there, we advise our farmers, do this one, do that one. Myself, I?m going to Kituza for more knowledge and I?ll be going to the other institute at Kampala there for more training because I have gathered enough money. Even some boda bodas, the boys are busy making money. Michael	You mean you bought motorcycles that you gave out to people? Kafeero	To people. Michael	<b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> also as a group, like a grouped people? Kafeero	Yes, we are doing it in Kyosimbonanya Farmers? Group, and already about ten of us we have boda bodas which are busy at the Lugazi town, who work there. Michael	In the past we had some farmers when they had the vanilla boom, people used to bring nails and whatever and they put in vanilla. So you as a group, how do you ensure quality of the cardamom? Kafeero	As we have learnt from our people with vanilla, they were spoiling their crop, whereby even there it had no market. So with us we ensure that we do something which is good so that it does not spoil our market, as it spoiled the market of those people with vanilla. We have got that good example.
