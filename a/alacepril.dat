40|$|We {{assessed}} {{blood pressure}} and neurohumoral factors at rest and during exercise in 10 patients with essential hypertension before and after treatment with the new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, <b>alacepril</b> (25 - 50 mg day- 1). <b>Alacepril</b> significantly lowered mean blood pressure at rest {{and at the same}} exercise load as before treatment without affecting heart rate response. The response of plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and plasma adrenaline were not changed by <b>alacepril,</b> but increase of plasma angiotensin II and plasma noradrenaline during exercise were significantly attenuated after <b>alacepril</b> treatment (ANOVA, P = 0. 04, both). The change in mean blood pressure during exercise was positively correlated with the decrease in plasma angiotensin II (r = 0. 65, P < 0. 05). These results demonstrated that <b>alacepril</b> was effective in essential hypertension both at rest and during exercise, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect during exercise might be related to the decrease in pressor hormones, especially in plasma angiotensin II...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{blood pressure}} lowering effects between imidapril of 5 mg and <b>alacepril</b> of 25 mg. The subjects were 11 hypertensive Japanese patients (6 males and 5 females) aged 51 - 87 {{years with the}} mean±standard deviation of 73 ± 10 years, and their blood pressure had been controlled well by anti-hypertensive agents including imidapril of 5 mg. After we changed the administration of imidapril of 5 mg once a day to that of <b>alacepril</b> of 25 mg once a day, without any changes of other anti-hypertensive agents, the systolic blood pressure (mean±standard deviation) in patients significantly increased from 130 ± 7. 5 mmHg to 140 ± 11 mmHg (p< 0. 0005). The present study suggests that imidapril of 5 mg is stronger than <b>alacepril</b> of 25 mg for lowering blood pressure in patients with hypertension...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Plasma {{concentrations}} of A type or {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP) and B type or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are increased in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). OBJECTIVE [...] To examine the haemodynamic and hormonal responses, especially of ANP and BNP, to oral administration of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in patients with CHF and in controls. PATIENTS [...] 12 patients with CHF and 11 controls. METHODS [...] Haemodynamic variables and plasma {{concentrations of}} ANP, BNP, and other hormones were serially measured for 24 hours after <b>alacepril</b> (37. 5 mg) was given by mouth. RESULTS [...] Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly in both groups. The cardiac index increased only in the CHF group. In patients with CHF pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and cardiac index were significantly changed from 1 to 12 hours after <b>alacepril</b> administration. Plasma ANP and BNP decreased significantly after <b>alacepril</b> {{was given to the}} CHF group: neither concentration changed in the control group. In the CHF group plasma ANP was significantly lower between 1 and 6 hours and was highly significantly correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Plasma BNP, however, was significantly lower between 6 and 24 hours after <b>alacepril</b> and was not correlated with pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. CONCLUSIONS [...] The response of plasma BNP after <b>alacepril</b> administration occurred later and lasted longer than the plasma ANP response. This may indicate that the mechanisms of synthesis, secretion, or degradation of the two peptides are different...|$|E
40|$|Enalapril maleate, {{the oldest}} and most widely {{distributed}} ACEI, and <b>alacepril,</b> the newest and antioxidant ACEI, were compared in the point of cardioprotective effect for Dahl salt-sensitive rat. In order to evaluate the correlation between the three factors, cardiac fibrosis and blood pressure/oxidative-stress marker (tissue TBARS), index of correlation was calculated. The results showed a significant difference in cardiac fibrosis between high-dose <b>alacepril</b> (30 [*]mg/kg/day, group H) and enalapril maleate (10 [*]mg/kg/day, group E). There was significant correlation between cardiac fibrosis and oxidative-stress marker, although there was no correlation between cardiac fibrosis and blood pressure. Fibrosis was more influenced by oxidative stress not by blood pressure, we should not select ACEI only by blood pressure-lowering effect and should more consider cardioprotective effects of ACEI...|$|E

40|$|Hypertension is a {{significant}} health problem worldwide, which carries a high risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. It is estimated that about 20 % of the worldwide adult population suffers from this common serious chronic disease. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor {{is one of the}} antihypertensive drugs, such as captopril, <b>alacepril</b> and enalapril. ACE, which {{plays an important role in}} regulating blood pressure, catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin from an inactive decapeptide (angiotensinⅠ) to a potent vasoconstrictor octapeptide (angiotensinⅡ) and inactivates antihypertensive vasodilator bradykinin. Various ACE inhibitory drugs have been shown to result in an antihypertensive effect, but these artificially synthesized ACE inhibitors are believed to have certain side effects, such as cough, angioedema, taste disturbance and skin rashes. Therefore, bioactive peptides with ACE inhibitory activity derived from food proteins are considered to be safer and have no side effects for treatment of hypertension. The blood of deer is used as traditional Chinese medicine for a long time. In this study, a novel peptide with ACE inhibitory was stemmed from red deer plasma. Red deer plasma protein was precipitated by acetone and subsequently digested. The separation was performed with Sephadex G- 25 gel filtration chromatography. The fraction with highest ACE inhibitory activity was analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-MS/MS data and modeling structure information were used to search for ACE inhibitory peptides in red deer database. A novel inhibitory effect peptide with sequence VYNEGLPAP was firstly obtained from red deer plasma. The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC 50) was 3. 1 μM in vitro. Stability study for ACE inhibitory activity showed that this nonapeptide had the good heat and pH stability and strong enzyme-resistant properties against gastrointestinal protease. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that inhibitory kinetic mechanism of this peptide was competitive. These results suggest that the nonapeptide and the hydrolysate from red deer plasma proteins may be potential source with antihypertensive effect.
