60|$|In the Midsummer Night's Dream, again, {{he gives}} us a most amusing picture of the straits to which {{theatrical}} managers of his day were reduced by the want of proper scenery. In fact, {{it is impossible to}} read him without seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two special limitations of the Elizabethan stage--the lack of suitable scenery, and the fashion of men playing women's parts, just as he protests against other difficulties with which managers of theatres have still to contend, such as <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> do not understand their words; <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> miss their cues; <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> overact their parts; <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> mouth; <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> gag; <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> play to the gallery, and amateur actors.|$|R
40|$|Current {{theoretical}} arguments highlight {{a dilemma}} faced by <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> either adopt a weak or strong commitment strategy for managing their alliances and partnerships. <b>Actors</b> <b>who</b> pursue a weak commitment strategy|i. e. immediately abandon current partners when a more pro table alternative is presented|are {{more likely to}} identify the most rewarding alliances. On the other hand, <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> enact a strong commitment approach {{are more likely to}} take advantage of whatever opportunities can be found in existing partnerships. Using agent-based modeling, we show that <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> adopt a moderate commitment strategy overcome this dilemma and outperform <b>actors</b> <b>who</b> adopt either weak or strong commitment approaches. We also show that avoiding this dilemma rests on experiencing a related tradeo : moderately-committed actors sacri ce short-term performance for the superior knowledge and information that allows them to eventually do better...|$|R
