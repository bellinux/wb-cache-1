2500|$|Sucralose is an <b>artificial</b> {{sweetener}} and <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute.</b> The {{majority of}} ingested sucralose is not {{broken down by}} the body, so it is noncaloric. In the European Union, it is also known under the E number E955. Sucralose is about 320 to 1,000 times sweeter than sucrose, three times as sweet as both aspartame and [...] acesulfame potassium, and twice as sweet as sodium saccharin. [...] Evidence of benefit is lacking for long-term weight loss with some data supporting weight gain and heart disease risks.|$|R
40|$|Background: The intense {{sweeteners}} currently authorised in Europe comprise ten compounds {{of various}} chemical natures. Their overall use has sharply risen {{in the last}} 20 years. These compounds are mainly used to formulate reduced-calorie products while maintaining sweetness. [br/] Methods: This extensive analysis of the literature reviews the data currently available on the potential nutritional benefits and risks related to the consumption of products containing intense sweeteners. [br/] Results and Conclusions: Regarding nutritional benefits, the available studies, while numerous, do not provide proof that the consumption of <b>artificial</b> sweeteners as <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> is beneficial in terms of weight management, blood glucose regulation in diabetic subjects or the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Regarding nutritional risks (incidence of type 2 diabetes, habituation to sweetness in adults, cancers, etc.), {{it is not possible}} based on the available data to establish a link between the occurrence of these risks and the consumption of artificial sweeteners. However, some studies underline the need to improve knowledge of the links between intense sweeteners consumption and certain risks...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> on the gut microbiome. Methods: PUBMED was used to find articles that studied the gut microbiome after consumption of a <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> in humans. Both observational and interventional studies were selected for this review. Results: Starting with 31 articles found on PUBMED, 5 articles were included to be reviewed after 26 articles were excluded. Three natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> and four categories of artificial sweeteners were studied. Maltitol, lactitol, and isomalt were the natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes,</b> and aspartame, acesulfame-K, non-caloric artificial sweeteners, and saccharin were the artificial sweeteners. The outcomes for Bifidobacteria, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Lactobacilli, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, and Enterobacteriaceae were addressed. Natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> were seen to increase bacterial populations that are believed to be beneficial to humans while artificial sweeteners established bacterial populations that are considered harmful to health. Conclusions: The studies examined suggest cautious use of artificial sweeteners due to its effects on the gut microbiome while natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> could have potential health benefit...|$|R
40|$|Drinking low-sugar kills {{your brain}} cells and stuff…” Lay conceptions in home {{economics}} The {{objective of the}} study was to investigate how 15 -year-old students understand different aspects of the following main topics: 1) eating habits and the enjoyment of food and 2) health and lifestyle. The two topics are related to everyday lifestyle as well as to the students' work in home economics during their 10 years of compulsory schooling. The study had a phenomenographic design, and was conducted using four focus groups. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the analysis was carried out in an iterative manner on those transcripts. The variation of understanding among the students is characterized in a set of ten categories of description: •	there is a connection between the sugar content and particular properties of the foodstuff •	the marketing on the packaging says something about the sugar content •	the perception of the foodstuff as healthy or unhealthy says something about its <b>sugar</b> content •	<b>artificial</b> sweeteners are <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes,</b> and they therefore have the same effect on the body as <b>sugar</b> •	<b>artificial</b> sweeteners and <b>sugar</b> have different effects on the body •	sugar has an impact on the psyche •	sugar may lead to physical health problems/ illness •	sugar does not affect the energy intake •	fruit and vegetables are necessary for the body •	fruit and vegetables are not harmful to the body There are lay conceptions within all these categories of description. For students to have the best possible starting point for studying home economics, it is important that teachers are aware of their students' lay conceptions. In a social constructivist perspective on learning it is natural to assume that lay conceptions are of significance when students choose foodstuffs, and thus contribute to forming the basis for future lifestyle patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The role of <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> such as xylitol and {{sorbitol}} in {{the prevention}} of dental caries has been investigated in several clinical studies. The purpose of this report is to review the current published evidence regarding the relationship between <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> and dental caries. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE and included studies published from 1966 to 2001. Studies that included human subjects and were published in English were included in this review. A total of fourteen clinical studies were reviewed that evaluated the effect of sorbitol or xylitol or the combination of both <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> on the incidence of dental caries. Most of the reports were of studies conducted with children outside of the United States. These studies demonstrated a consistent decrease in dental caries, ranging from 30 to 60 percent, among subjects using <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> as compared to subjects in a control group. These caries rate reductions were observed in subjects using xylitol or sorbitol as the <b>sugar</b> <b>substitute</b> in chewing gum or toothpaste. The highest caries reductions were observed in subjects using xylitol. These findings suggest that the replacement of sucrose with sorbitol and xylitol may significantly decrease the incidence of dental caries...|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> approved {{for food use}} are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which are found in berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval for food use.|$|R

40|$|Low- and no-calorie sugar subtistutes are {{compounds}} that provide food with its sweet taste. As the term suggests, they have lower or no food energy and usually {{are characterized by}} higher sweetness than sucrose. For that reason, these substances are especially used during the treatment of diabetes mellitus, to reduce the energy content of food or in prevention of dental caries. Natural sweeteners were discovered a long time ago, during the search for sustenance. For example Stevia was used by South American Natives even before the European conquest of the territory. However, the history of artificial sweeteners is not too significant, because it relates to breaking the laboratory rules. That is how saccharin was invented in 1878. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> are added to food on purpose, adjusting the taste or extending the shelf life of foods. In the EU, every approved sweetener has got an E-code, which is displayed on the label. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> can be grouped according to their origin, their nutrition value or their chemical structure. This thesis discusses low- and no-calorie <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> that can be synthetic or natural. Mentioned synthetic sweeteners typically contain less then 21 kJ per portion. These intensive food additives possess many times the sweetness of sucrose. The main representatives of this group are saccharin, cyclamate, acesulfame K, sucralose and aspartame with its derivatives. The group of natural <b>sugar</b> <b>substitutes</b> constits of substances like erythritol, D-tagatose, trehalose, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, stevioside and thaumatin. There are some limitations confirmed by expert studies. For example, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus should mainly use synthetic sweeteners, because of their low nutritional value. Even though in some states certain sweeteners are forbidden, safety studies {{say that there are}} no adverse effects, if the recommended daily intake is respected. <b>Sugar</b> <b>substitutes,</b> therefore, can be considered safe...|$|R
