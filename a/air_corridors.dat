25|$|As a United States airline, Air Berlin {{was able}} to access the West Berlin airline market. During the Cold War, Berlin's special {{political}} status meant that the <b>air</b> <b>corridors</b> {{into and out of}} Tegel Airport could only be used by airlines registered in France, the United Kingdom or the United States.

25|$|West Berlin's special {{legal status}} during the Cold War era (1945–1990) meant that all air traffic through the Allied <b>air</b> <b>corridors</b> linking the exclave with West Germany was {{restricted}} to airlines headquartered in the United States, the United Kingdom or France – {{three of the four}} victorious powers of World War II. In addition, all flightdeck crew flying aircraft into and out of West Berlin were required to hold American, British or French passports. During that period, the majority of Tegel's regular commercial flights served German domestic routes, hub airports in Frankfurt, London, Paris and Amsterdam, points in the United States and popular holiday resorts in the Mediterranean and Canary Islands.|$|E

25|$|After the Marshall Plan, the {{introduction}} of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased Reichsmark and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to Berlin, initiating the Berlin Blockade, which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin. Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited <b>air</b> <b>corridors.</b> A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.|$|E

An inscription on the base records the names and ranks of the 78 people killed in accidents during the Berlin Blockade. Its design, by Eduard Ludwig (who won the contest to design it) features 3 arcs pointing west to symbolise the 3 <b>air</b> <b>corridors</b> that were the city's lifeline, as a result of which Berliners also call it the Hungerkralle (hunger claw) or Hungerharke (hunger rake).

There were no fatalities among the 17 occupants (six crew, eleven passengers) despite the severity of the attack.

Eggemoen was the most expensive of the seven alternatives, in part caused by the high investments needed to ground transport. and also had the smallest surrounding communities around it, complicating the settlement of airport workers.

The airspace within these corridors was used by US, UK and French-registered non-combat aircraft belonging to these countries' armed forces and airlines operated by pilots holding those countries' passports.

40|$|The U. S. Air Force {{currently}} {{is in the}} process of developing an Airborne Network (AN) to provide support to its combat aircrafts on a mission. The reliability needed for continuous operation of an AN is difficult to achieve through completely infrastructure-less mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper we first propose an architecture for an AN where airborne networking platforms (ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. In this architecture, the ANPs can be viewed as mobile base stations and the combat aircrafts on a mission as mobile clients. The combat aircrafts on a mission move through a space called <b>air</b> <b>corridor.</b> The goal of the AN design is to form a backbone network with the ANPs with two properties: (i) the backbone network remains connected at all times, even though the topology of the network changes with the movement of the ANPs, and (ii) the entire 3 D space of the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> is under radio coverage at all times by the continuously moving ANPs. In addition to proposing an architecture for an AN, the contributions of the paper include, development of an algorithm that finds the velocity and transmission range of the ANPs so that the dynamically changing backbone network remains connected at all times, development of a routing algorithm that ensures a connection between the source-destination node pair with the fewest number of path switching, given the dimensions of the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> and the radius of the coverage sphere associated with an ANP, development of an algorithm that finds the fewest number of ANPs required to provide complete coverage of the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> at all times, development of an algorithm that provides connected-coverage to the <b>air</b> <b>corridor</b> at all times, and development of a visualization tool that depicts the movement patterns of the ANPs and the resulting dynamic graph and the coverage volume of the backbone network...|$|R
