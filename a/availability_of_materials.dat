25|$|Many nomadic {{people use}} {{materials}} {{common in the}} local environment to construct temporary dwellings, such as the Punan of Sarawak who use palm fronds, or the Ituri Pygmies who use saplings and mongongo leaves to construct domed huts. Other cultures reuse materials, transporting them with them as they move. Examples of this are the tribes of Mongolia, who carry their gers (yurts) with them, or the black desert tents of the Qashgai in Iran. Notable in each case is the significant impact of the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> {{and the availability of}} pack animals or other forms of transport on the ultimate form of the shelters.|$|E
25|$|Lingnan {{architecture}} (Jyutping: Ling5 naam4 gin3 zuk1; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南建築) is {{the characteristic}} architectural {{style of the}} Lingnan region, mostly associated with Cantonese people. It differs significantly from those found in other Han Chinese regions because of factors such as climates and <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> both of which affected by the geographical features of Lingnan. Overall, classical Lingnan architecture tends to (1) use pale colors such as green and white, (2) avoid circular or cylindrical structures, (3) have many open structures like balconies, (4) be decorated {{with large numbers of}} relief carvings and sculptures, and (5) be built using materials resistant to moulds and moisture. The last point is obviously related to the hot and humid subtropical climate of Lingnan.|$|E

At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colours in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based on the <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: [...] "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that {{is every bit as}} powerful as words". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: [...] "What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking of how to get the tone worked out," [...] and [...] "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood. Colors and pictures can enhance what the situation is on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{views on}} Great Moravian sacral {{architecture}} changed dramatically {{during the second}} half of the 20th century. First researchers assumed only an existence of simple wooden churches like those which are known from the German environment in the 7th-8th century. The wooden churches were suitable for initial missionary activities because of easy <b>availability</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials,</b> quick construction and no need for consecration. [...] This opinion was refined in 1949 after excavations in Staré Město. From 1960s, stone churches are known also from Slovakia. Until 2014, more than 25 sacral buildings have been safely identified in the core territory of Great Moravia (Moravia and Western Slovakia). The remains of the first uncovered churches were only [...] "negatives" [...] (ditches filled with secondary material after removal of original foundations), but later research also uncovered remains of buildings with original foundations. Especially after the discovery of Great Moravian graves near the church in Kopčany, the potential Great Moravian origin of several still standing churches in Slovakia became again an actual question (Kopčany, Nitrianska Blatnica, Kostoľany pod Tribečom). The exact dating is a goal of ongoing research based on radiocarbon analysis and dendrochronology.|$|E
