5|$|At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick {{find the}} crown, but are nearly killed when the diver {{attempts}} to dry them out using a heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving {{their bodies and}} the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> beach. Patrick inadvertently loses the Bag of Winds while attempting to use it, but David Hasselhoff appears and offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea. Hasselhoff opens up his rocket launching pecs to shoot SpongeBob and Patrick back to Bikini Bottom with the crown.|$|E

As they are packing, Kioe Lie's fiancée Gouw Hap Nio visits. She leaves some snacks with their father, the poor farmer Tan Lauw Pe, before going home, promising {{to take care of}} Pe while his sons are away. The brothers finish packing, say goodbye to their father, <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> train station.|$|E
5|$|Set far in {{the future}} when {{humanity}} has left Earth, the plot follows Shion Uzuki, an employee of Vector Industries; and KOS-MOS, a battle android design to fight the hostile alien Gnosis. Forced to escape a Gnosis attack <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> planet of Second Miltia, Shion and KOS-MOS are pulled into a fight between the Galaxy Federation and the hostile U-TIC Organization.

5|$|The Maya at Chaktumal fed false {{information}} to the Spanish, and Montejo {{was unable to find}} d'Avila and link up with him. D'Avila returned overland to Xelha, and transferred the fledgling Spanish colony to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo considered to be a better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as the Ulúa River in Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha. Late in 1528, Montejo left d'Avila to oversee Xamanha and sailed north to loop around the Yucatán Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish colony of New Spain in central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman scouts {{reported}} to Suleiman {{that there were}} untouched villages near Vaslui, and the Ottomans headed for that region. The winter {{made it difficult to}} set camp, which forced the Ottomans to move quickly <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Moldavian capital, Suceava. To reach Vaslui, where the Moldavian army had its main camp, they needed to cross Podul Înalt over the Bârlad River. The bridge was made of wood and not suitable for heavy transportation of troops. Stephen chose that area for the battle – the same location where his father, Bogdan II, had defeated the Poles in 1450; and where he, at an age of 17, had fought side-by-side with Vlad 'the Impaler'. The area was ideal for the defenders: the valley was a semi-oval surrounded on all sides by hills covered by forest. Inside the valley, the terrain was marshy, which restricted troop movement. Suleiman had full confidence in his troops and made few efforts to scout the area.|$|E
5|$|Route 17 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route 7 and County Route 507 (Belleville Turnpike) {{on the border}} of Kearny, Hudson County and North Arlington, Bergen County. It heads north through North Arlington on Ridge Road, a two-lane local street that passes by businesses and the Holy Cross Cemetery {{on the east side of}} the road. It intersects County Route 26 (Jauncey Avenue) and crosses into Lyndhurst at the Lincoln Avenue intersection. In Lyndhurst, Route 17 intersects County Route 28 (Kingsland Avenue). At the intersection of County Route 30 (Rutherford Avenue), which runs along the border of Lyndhurst and Rutherford, the route turns east onto Rutherford Avenue to parallel the Route 3 freeway to the south <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> edge of the New Jersey Meadowlands, widening to a four-lane road at the intersection with Orient Way. Route 17 makes a curve to the south, crossing entirely into Lyndhurst, and makes a hairpin turn to the north, widening to a divided highway. The road then crosses into Rutherford and comes to the Route 3 interchange.|$|E

5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E
25|$|August 5 - 5,000 U.S. Army troops {{under the}} command of Major General John R. Brooke have orders to march west along the {{southern}} coast of Puerto Rico from Arroyo to the nearby town of Guayama, then to Coamo. They are then to turn northeast <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> inland city of Cayey. The U.S. soldiers meet stiff resistance in Guayama, but the August 5 firefight is brief and they invest the town.|$|E
25|$|In Woodbury, Michonne (Danai Gurira) is {{suspicious}} of how The Governor (David Morrissey) recovered supplies {{from a nearby}} National Guard camp, but he refuses to discuss it. She expresses her concerns with Andrea (Laurie Holden), and believes they should leave <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coast. Andrea would rather stay, and provides information on the Greene farmstead to allow Merle (Michael Rooker) to look for his brother Daryl. The Governor tells Meryl he will allow the search once Meryl obtains more concrete information. Andrea begins to become romantically involved with The Governor.|$|E

25|$|After {{his victory}} at Five Forks, Grant ordered an assault {{along the entire}} Confederate line {{beginning}} at dawn on April 2. Parke's IX Corps overran the eastern trenches but were met with stiff resistance. At 5:30a.m. on April 2, Wright's VI Corps made a decisive breakthrough along the Boydton Plank Road line. While riding between the lines to rally his men, A.P. Hill {{was shot and killed}} by two Union soldiers. Wright's initial breakthrough was halted mid-day at Fort Gregg. Gibbon's XXIV Corps overran Fort Gregg after a heroic Confederate defense. This halt in the advance into the city of Petersburg allowed Lee to pull his forces out of Petersburg and Richmond on the night of April 2, <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> west in an attempt to meet up with forces under the command of General Joseph E. Johnston in North Carolina. The resulting Appomattox Campaign led to Lee's surrender on April 9 at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
500|$|On 2 April, as Bounty {{approached}} Cape Horn, {{a strong}} gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which, Bligh wrote, [...] "exceeded what I {{had ever met}} with before... with severe squalls of hail and sleet". The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, she was further north than {{she had been a}} week earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, and that they would turn <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope—"to the great joy of every person on Board", Bligh recorded.|$|E
500|$|The support ship {{eventually}} {{arrived from}} Santo Domingo, and Montejo {{used it to}} sail south along the coast, while he sent his second-in-command Alonso d'Avila via land. Montejo discovered the thriving port city of Chaktumal (modern Chetumal). The Maya at Chaktumal fed false information to the Spanish, and Montejo was unable link up with d'Avila, who returned overland to Xelha. [...] The fledgling Spanish colony was moved to nearby Xamanha, modern Playa del Carmen, which Montejo {{considered to be a}} better port. After waiting for d'Avila without result, Montejo sailed south as far as Honduras before turning around and heading back up the coast to finally meet up with his lieutenant at Xamanha.

500|$|The {{change of}} {{direction}} to south-west provided much better travelling conditions, {{probably because the}} course to Franz Josef Land was broadly parallel to the lines of disturbance in the ice instead of perpendicular to them. Progress was swift: [...] "If this goes on," [...] Nansen recorded on 13 April, [...] "the return journey will be quicker than I thought." [...] However, the same diary entry records a mishap that day: both men's watches had stopped. Although Nansen's journal comment is mild, the incident was potentially disastrous. Without the correct time they could not calculate their longitude and thus maintain the correct course to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches based on Nansen's guesswork that their longitude was 86°E, but the pair were no longer certain where they were. If they were farther west than Nansen's assumption, they might miss Franz Josef Land altogether, <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> open Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, a Japanese company from Watanabe's {{battalion}} infiltrated through {{a gap between}} {{the east side of the}} ridge and Parachute Company C. Deciding that their positions were now untenable, Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123. In the darkness and confusion of the battle, the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized. A few Marines began yelling that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas, scaring other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks. After arriving behind Hill 123, some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield, repeating the word [...] "withdraw" [...] to anyone within earshot. Other Marines began to follow them. Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rear in a rout, Edson, Major Kenneth D. Bailey from Edson's staff, and other Marine officers appeared and, with [...] "vivid" [...] language, herded the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123.|$|E
500|$|On 29November the 2nd Parachute Battalion, now {{commanded}} by John Frost, parachuted onto an [...] airfield at Depienne, [...] south of Tunis. The airfield was deserted so Frost marched the battalion [...] {{to a second}} airfield at Oudna. Due to postponement of their advance, the First Army did not relieve the battalion as planned and instead it became trapped [...] behind the German lines, where Frost was informed by radio {{that they had been}} written off. After ambushing an advancing German formation, the battalion were attacked by a second German unit and surrounded. On 1December the Germans attacked with infantry, armour and artillery, almost wiping out 'C' Company and causing heavy casualties {{in the rest of the}} battalion. Frost ordered the battalion to disperse into company groups <b>and</b> <b>head</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Allied lines. On 3December, the surviving 180 men reached safety at Majaz al Bab. With no more opportunities for parachute operations, the brigade fought in the front line as normal infantry. In February they held the right flank of the Allied line at Bou Arada and on the night of 2/3 February, the 1st Battalion, along with a French Foreign Legion unit, captured the Jebel Mansour heights and were then subjected to constant shelling and infantry attacks. After three days without relief, their almost ammunition expended, and having suffered 200 casualties, they were forced to withdraw.|$|E

On 11 February 1944, Taganak sailed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> South Pacific to resume shuttling inter-island cargo. She put into Auckland, New Zealand, on 6 February 1945 for repairs and then plied {{the waters of the}} South Pacific Ocean carrying cargo until after hostilities with Japan ended.

500|$|On {{the same}} evening, the two VNQDĐ insurrectionary {{attempts}} in the Sơn Dương sector also failed.

Nhu's men traversed the streets and avoided passing the French administrative offices and arrived at the military complex, shouting at the Vietnamese sentries to open the doors and join the revolt. One of the VNQDĐ militants carried a banner saying [...] "Revolutionary Armed Forces: Every Sacrifice for the Liberation of the Fatherland and the Vietnamese People". They had banked on their countrymen joining them, but instead were met with gunfire. The VNQDĐ responded by throwing bombs over the walls and setting fire to a side door. They then forced their way in and focused their attack on the residence of the commanding officer, {{but he managed to}} escape. Three of the men penetrated the officer's compounds to mount a search. The colonial forces were vastly stronger and easily repelled the VNQDĐ group, who retreated and headed towards the river. However, their three comrades were in the compound searching for the commanding officer and did not hear the signal to retreat. Nevertheless, they were able to escape after the colonial troops had already dispersed their VNQDĐ colleagues. The French captured three other men and 17 unused bombs.|$|E
