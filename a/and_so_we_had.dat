500|$|The Hot Lunch {{script was}} sent to Alan Parker {{after the release of}} his {{previous}} film Midnight Express (1978). He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really much more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevenson {{suggested}} an alternative cover. He instructed the Polydor art department to design artwork using four statues from the Guards Memorial, from a photo session the band had recently done {{in front of}} the monument which commemorates the war dead of the First World War. Four of the soldier statues were cut out from the shot of the band. Siouxsie found the sleeve a workable solution, as she was drawn in by the imagery conjured up by the words for [...] "In Flanders Fields", which inspired [...] "Poppy Day". For her, it was the linchpin for the album. The poppy reproduced on the album cover is a symbol of Remembrance Day. The designer, Rob O'Connor, said about the layout: [...] "The wreath of poppies was devised to help add colour and create a graphic device". An embossed sleeve was planned, with the four soldiers inked in the card, but was not used because the band did not receive the proofs in time. Morris and McKay blamed Stevenson, Siouxsie and Severin, although it was Polydor that refused the extra expense at the last minute. Nevertheless, Severin succeeded in pushing for a gatefold cover: [...] "We wanted it all white because you were supposed to do it all black, and you were supposed to have blackmail lettering on it <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> it nice and classic", he stated. Maybury's drawings of the band were used on the inner spread; it was {{the only part of the}} original design that survived.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it was our first album. But import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a gay audience, {{a lot of people}} who were convinced the music was specifically for them.

60|$|Leaving De Wet in the Ficksburg mountains, {{where he}} lurked {{until after the}} opening of the New Year, the story of the {{scattered}} operations in the Transvaal may now be carried down to the same point--a story comprising many skirmishes and one considerable engagement, but so devoid of any central thread {{that it is difficult to}} know how to approach it. From Lichtenburg to Komati, a distance of four hundred miles, there was sporadic warfare everywhere, attacks upon scattered posts, usually beaten off but occasionally successful, attacks upon convoys, attacks upon railway trains, attacks upon anything and everything which could harass the invaders.

60|$|We {{were only}} {{to stay here}} {{a day and a}} night and take in coal; we {{consulted}} the guide-books and were rejoiced to know that there were no sights in Odessa to see; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one good, untrammeled holyday on our hands, with nothing to do but idle about the city and enjoy ourselves. We sauntered through the markets and criticised the fearful and wonderful costumes from the back country; examined the populace as far as eyes could do it; and closed the entertainment with an ice-cream debauch. We do not get ice-cream every where, and so, when we do, we are apt to dissipate to excess. We never cared any thing about ice-cream at home, but we look upon it with a sort of idolatry now that it is so scarce in these red-hot climates of the East.|$|E
60|$|He was in {{appearance}} more friendly towards me now, even {{asking me to}} repeat my last evening's song, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> that performance all over again to everybody's satisfaction. But when morning came he was not inclined {{to go to the}} woods: there was food enough in the house, and the pistol would not be hurt by lying where it had fallen a day longer. Next day the same excuse; still I disguised my impatience and suspicion of him and waited, singing the ballad for the third time that evening. Then I was conducted to a wood about a league and a half away and we hunted for the lost pistol among the bushes, I with little hope of finding it, while he attended to the bird voices and frequently asked me to stand or lie still when a chance of something offered.|$|E

60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had.</b> We {{would spend}} whole {{days on the}} wharves, all bustle and excitement, {{sometimes}} seated on the capstan of the Sprightly Bess or perched in the nettings of the Oriole, of which ship old Stanwix was now captain. He had grown gray in Mr. Carvel's service, and good Mrs. Stanwix was long since dead. Often we would mount together on the little horse Captain Daniel had given me, Dorothy on a pillion behind, to go with my grandfather to inspect the farm. Mr. Starkie, the overseer, would ride beside us, his fowling-piece {{slung over his shoulder}} and his holster on his hip; a kind man and capable, and unlike Mr. Evans, my Uncle Grafton's overseer, was seldom known to use his firearms or the rawhide slung across his saddle. The negroes in their linsey-woolsey jackets and checked trousers would stand among the hills grinning at us children as we passed; and there was not one of them, nor of the white servants for that matter, that I could not call by name.|$|E
6000|$|The {{surveyors}} {{brought back}} more tarantulas with them, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> quite a menagerie arranged along {{the shelves of}} the room. Some of these spiders could straddle over a common saucer with their hairy, muscular legs, and when their feelings were hurt, or their dignity offended, they were the wickedest-looking desperadoes the animal world can furnish. If their glass prison-houses were touched ever so lightly they were up and spoiling for a fight in a minute. Starchy?--proud? Indeed, they would take up a straw and pick their teeth like a member of Congress. There was as usual a furious [...] "zephyr" [...] blowing {{the first night of}} the brigade's return, and about midnight the roof of an adjoining stable blew off, and a corner of it came crashing through the side of our ranch. There was a simultaneous awakening, and a tumultuous muster of the brigade in the dark, and a general tumbling and sprawling over each other in the narrow aisle between the bedrows.

60|$|After {{getting some}} supper and taking our quinine, we turned in and slept {{that night in}} the best way that the heat would let us, rising next morning with the vain hope of getting a bathe. Of all the discomforts we {{experienced}} at Secocoeni's, the scarcity and badness of the water was the worst. Bad water, when you are in a hotbed of fever, is a terrible privation. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to go unwashed, with the exception of having a little water poured over our hands out of gourds. We must have presented a curious sight at breakfast that morning. Before us knelt a sturdy Kafir, holding a stick in each hand, on which were respectively speared a leg and a side of mutton, from which we cut off great hunks with our hunting-knives, and, taking them in our fingers, devoured them like beasts of prey. If we got a bit we did not like, our mode of dispensing of it was simple and effective. We threw it to one of the natives standing round us, among whom was the heir-apparent, who promptly gobbled it up.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that things cannot be otherwise; since {{everything}} was created for a purpose, this purpose must inevitably be the best possible.

60|$|While we rode here, we had {{the most}} violent storm of wind with rain, and with great claps of thunder, that we had yet {{sustained}} since {{we came out of}} England. It was our comfort that the wind came off shore, for it blew at south, and shifting between the south, south-east, and south-west, with such excessive gusts, and so furious, and withal, not only by squalls and sudden flaws, but a settled terrible tempest, that had it been from off sea, as it was off shore, we must have perished, there had been no remedy, and even as it was, we rode in great danger. My boatswain called out twice to me to cut my masts by the board, protesting we should either bring our anchors home, or founder as we rode; and indeed the sea broke over us many times in a terrible manner. As I said before, we had an indifferent good road, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> but not a very good one, for the land was low; and on the east we lay a little open. However, our ground-tackle was good, and our ship very tight, and I told the boatswain I would rather slip the cable and go off to sea than cut the masts. However, in about four hours' time more we found the wind abate, though it blew very hard for three days after.|$|E

"Well," [...] I says, [...] "when I see {{the king}} in that doggery {{yesterday}} I says to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went a-loafing around town {{to put in}} the time and wait.

We didn't have no dog, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to chase him all over the country till we tired him out.

I must tell you that, just as we were going to sleep the night before, a stranger had come and asked for a shakedown, which was given to him in the same room. We had risen before daybreak, and my companion was expatiating to me, in clear and forcible language, on the hypocrisy and scoundrelism of this Boer, when suddenly a sleepy voice out of the darkness murmured thickly, [...] "I say, stranger, guess you shouldn't lose your temper; guess that 'ere Boer is acting after the manner of human natur'."
