5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria. Its production {{was marked by}} an ongoing legal dispute with Waters <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> owned the rights to Pink Floyd's name, an issue resolved several months after the album was released. Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

5|$|Bróðir and Óspak of Man {{were two}} Danish {{brothers}} who {{were active in}} the Isle of Man and Ireland in the 11th century. They are mentioned in the 12th century Irish Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh and the 13th century Icelandic Njal's Saga as key leaders who fought on opposite sides in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The latter account names Bróðir as the killer of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland. Both Boru and Bróðir died in the battle, although accounts differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> killed whom. Óspak fought {{on the side of}} Boru, was injured, and lost his two sons in the battle.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter used {{discretion}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> {{qualified as}} a rookie.

This guideline was later amended to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the previous year. The current standard of 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (excluding time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was adopted in 1971.|$|E

5000|$|In a clear {{example from}} literature, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony's speech after the {{assassination}} of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. [...] "We're left in no doubt <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who's</b> ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".|$|R

5|$|Henry rode to Winchester, {{where an}} {{argument}} ensued <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> now {{had the best}} claim to the throne. William of Breteuil championed the rights of Robert, who was still abroad, returning from the Crusade, and to whom Henry and the barons had given homage in previous years. Henry argued that, unlike Robert, {{he had been born}} to a reigning king and queen, thereby giving him a claim under the right of porphyrogeniture. Tempers flared, but Henry, supported by Henry de Beaumont and Robert of Meulan, held sway and persuaded the barons to follow him. He occupied Winchester Castle and seized the royal treasury.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The failures of the flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E

5|$|In the 730s, Óengus {{fought against}} Dál Riata whose {{traditional}} overlords and protectors in Ireland, the Cenél Conaill, were much weakened at this time. A fleet from Dál Riata fought for Flaithbertach mac Loingsig, {{chief of the}} Cenél Conaill, in his war with Áed Allán of the Cenél nEógan, and suffered heavy losses in 733. Dál Riata was ruled by Eochaid mac Echdach of the Cenél nGabráin who died in 733, and the king lists are unclear <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who,</b> if anyone, succeeded him as overking. The Cenél Loairn of north Argyll were ruled by Dúngal mac Selbaig whom Eochaid had deposed as overking of Dál Riata in the 720s.|$|E
5|$|In the post-election {{speculation}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> {{would be}} given office under McKinley, Hay's name figured prominently, as did that of Whitelaw Reid; both men sought high office in the State Department, either as secretary {{or one of the}} major ambassadorial posts. Reid, in addition to his vice-presidential run, had been Minister to France under Harrison. Reid, an asthmatic, handicapped himself by departing for Arizona Territory for the winter, leading to speculation about his health.|$|E
5|$|Luis Gómez, an El Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> could win.|$|E

5|$|Many metal musicians when {{performing}} live {{engage in}} headbanging, which involves rhythmically beating {{time with the}} head, often emphasized by long hair. The il cornuto, or devil horns, hand gesture was popularized by vocalist Ronnie James Dio while with Black Sabbath and Dio. Although Gene Simmons of Kiss claims {{to have been the}} first to make the gesture on the 1977 Love Gun album cover, there is speculation <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> started the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a lawyer friend of Doggett's named Martin Wells tries {{to clear his name}} of the crime after his wife is murdered. Unfortunately for him, his perception of time regresses backwards, day by day. This leads to confusion, but ultimately an answer <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>who</b> killed Wells' wife.|$|E
