40|$|International audienceBibliometric {{techniques}} study researchers' communication {{activity to}} {{have a better understanding of}} phenomena of construction, dissemination and use of scientific and technical knowledge. In this paper, a bibliometric study was used like an assistance instrument for the strategic positioning of a scientific area. The aim of this bibliometric study was to help the work of an <b>Advisory</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee</b> by offering a global and "objective" view of the position and the evolution of the scientific activity of the Aix-Marseilles area. The methodology employed was strongly inspired by strategic analysis methods carried out in companies. The implemented strategic analysis process involves the definition of strategic scientific units, the selection of competitors (a set of scientific areas), the choice of measuring criterion of the scientific activity, the evaluation of the dynamics over the years and the graphical representation of the scientific portfolio of the Aix-Marseille area. Such a strategic analysis process for analyzing a scientific portfolio allows positioning the strategic scientific fields of the Aix-Marseilles area in relation to the "competition" by taking into account the dynamic history of its activity...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe bibliometric study {{presented}} in this communication {{was carried out in}} 2006 for an <b>Advisory</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee</b> organized by the 3 universities of Aix-Marseilles. This Scientific Committee was made up of scientists coming from other areas of France, from countries of Europe or other parts of the world. To help the Scientific Committee, the steering committee considered that it was necessary to propose a bibliometric study of the three universities' scientific activities. The bibliometric study was not intended to be an instrument for helping in the research assessment of the Aix Marseilles universities, but rather an instrument for helping in the strategic analysis of the three universities' scientific policy. Thus, the methodology employed for this bibliometric study was strongly inspired by strategic analysis methods carried out in companies. The collected data from the WoS were compiled in “scoreboards” showing the evolution of the production of the 13 scientific areas compared in each scientific field for the 6 periods of 4 years. To make the use of such scoreboards easier, relative indicators were computed and translated into graphs in order to offer a global view of the evolution of the Aix-Marseilles area positioning in the chosen scientific fields in relation to the activities of the 12 other scientific areas...|$|E

50|$|After {{reviewing}} its {{handling of}} the BSE crisis, the European Commission restructured its committees, replacing some and creating new committees. All of these committees were then overseen by the <b>Scientific</b> Steering <b>Committee</b> (formerly the Multi-disciplinary <b>Scientific</b> <b>Committee),</b> which also handled some specific issues such as BSE. The responsibility {{for all of the}} <b>advisory</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>committees</b> was also transferred to DG XXIV, which dealt with Consumer Policy and Consumer Health Protection. This transfer was made to preserve the independence of those committees, by separating the tasks of expert advice from the direct policy and legislative parts of the Commission.|$|R
