A recovery experiment was then performed, feeding the deficient fish with a complete diet for the following 4 weeks. Deficient fish showed lower appetite, reduced growth rate and mild anaemia. However, the survival rate was {{not significantly different from}} that of controls. The liver of most fish displayed focal atrophic hepatocytes with dilated sinusoids, multifocal necrosis, perivasculitis and also perichoangitis. In fish with these hepatic lesions, periarteritis was occasionally observed in the submucosa layer of intestine. These changes were clearly reversed at the end of recovery period.

40|$|The Gifu Prefecture, {{undertakings}} of a fishway construction service {{have been}} proceeded in Nagara River by the Fishery Promotion Division of Agriculture Department. Improvement {{and construction of}} fishing grounds and fishways have been conducted. This paper presents an example of fishway at the Kurusu River in Yamato town. The content of this construction was to attach a fishway to an existing dam which has no fishways. An installation for adjusting {{of the volume of}} flowing water is very difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to construct the fishway structure where water can flow stably, even if the water level changes. The fishway which contains three types of structures were constructed. When the water level changes at the dry season, a constant volume of water will be afforded stably through one of three types.

40|$|Gonadotropins (GTHs), FSH and LH, play central {{roles in}} {{vertebrate}} reproduction. Here, we report {{the production of}} biologically-active recombinant FSH (r-mtFSH) and LH (r-mtLH) of an endangered salmon species, Manchurian trout (Brachymystax lenok), by baculovirus in silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae. The biological activities of the recombinant hormones were analyzed using COS- 7 cell line transiently expressing either <b>amago</b> <b>salmon</b> FSH or LH receptor. The steroidogenic potency of the r-mtFSH and r-mtLH was examined by a culture system using rainbow trout follicles in vitro. In vivo, bioactivity was assessed by measuring ovarian weight, oocyte diameter, and plasma steroid hormone levels in female rainbow trout. Moreover, inducing potency of milt production were examined in vivo using goldfish. Our results demonstrated that the r-mtFSH and r-mtLH were successfully produced in the baculovirus-silkworm system and recognized by their cognate receptors specifically in vitro. The production of estradiol- 17 b (E 2) and testosterone (T) was stimulated by the r-mtFSH and r-mtLH respectively, from the full-grown follicles of rainbow trout, whereas both E 2 and T were increased by relatively higher doses of the recombinant hormones from the follicles of the maturing stage. In in vivo assay, injection of the r-mtFSH but not r-mtLH increased ovarian weight, oocyte diameter, and plasma E 2 levels in immature rainbow trout. Injection of both r-mtFSH and r-mtLH induced milt production in male goldfish.

40|$|Induction of {{tetraploid}} <b>amago</b> <b>salmon</b> was attempted {{by treating}} inseminated eggs with hydrostatic pressure shock (650 kg/(cm) ^ 2, 6 min duration) in 1996 and 1997. Based on the apperance of four nucleoli in the epithelial cells of pectoral fins, putative tetraploids were selected among sixmonth-old juveniles developed from pressure-shocked eggs of both year classes. At {{the age of}} twenty three months, the surviving ten females of the 1996 year class were flow-cytometrically determined to be diploid by measuring DNA content of erythrocytes. However, both diploids and triploids were detected in the progeny, when one of these diploid females was crossed with normal diploid males. Other females gave no triploid progeny. Among eleven individuals examined in the one-yearold 1997 year class salmon, a diploid-tetraploid mosaic male was found, but the others were diploid. All the progeny examined were diploid, when the eggs of a normal diploid were fertilized by spermatozoa of this mosaic male. The present results suggest the possible production of tetraploid and other polyploid lines using diploid gametes of fish which developed from the chromosome manipulation to inhibit first cleavage for induction of tetraploids but were determined to be diploid in adult stage by cellular size and DNA content of somatic cells. Such chromosomally-manipulated fish {{are likely to be}} mosaics including tetraploid cells in their germ line, in spite of a large population of diploid cells in soma.

40|$|During {{the past}} 70 or 80 years, salmon have been {{introduced}} to the southern hemisphere {{with a view to}} acclimatising them as sea-run forms. Acclimatisation has proved successful so far only for the king salmon in the South Island of New Zealand. In spite of this limited success the acclimatisation attempt has continued to this day. For example, a large number of Oncorhynchus keta {{have been introduced}} into the west coast waters of Chile every year since 1973, with no avail. We have begun investigations into the causes of successful establishment of the king salmon in New Zealand and earlier reported on the oceanographic conditions considered necessary for the acclimatisation.

40|$|A highly {{specific}} radioimmunoassay (RIA) for {{the measurement}} of prolactin (PRL) in the plasma and pituitary of salmonid fishes was developed using a rabbit antiserum to chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tschawytscha) PRL. The PRLs purified from chinook salmon and chum salmon (O. keta) pituitaries showed exactly the same competitive inhibition curves in the RIA, regardless of iodination of either hormone. The displacement curves for pituitary extracts and plasma from several salmonids, including chum, coho, and <b>amago</b> <b>salmon,</b> rainbow trout, and Japanese charr, were parallel to the salmon PRL standard, whereas those from the eel, goldfish, carp, and tilapia showed negligible cross-reactivity. Negligible cross-reactivity was also seen with plasma from hypophysectomized rainbow trout or coho salmon. None of the mammalian PRL or growth hormone (GH) preparations, bullfrog PRL, or presumptive chum salmon “gonadotropin” and eel “PRL” cross-reacted in the PRL RIA. Presumptive chum salmon GH showed less than 0. 05 % cross-reactivity. The RIA sensitivity was less than 0. 1 ng of the salmon PRL standard per milliliter. The immunoreactive reactive plasma PRL levels in mature chum salmon were below 1 ng/ml in seawater. The plasma PRL in females increased to about 8 ng/ml 1 day after transfer to fresh water, and high levels (2 – 4 ng/ml) were maintained during 3 – 7 days after the transfer. In contrast, when males were transferred to fresh water, an increase in plasma PRL was seen only 1 day after the transfer. A significant decrease in plasma osmolality was observed in {{both males and females}} after transfer to fresh water.

40|$|The {{specificity}} and rapidity of coagglutination {{test for}} the serological typing of IPNV isolated in cell cultures or for the direct detection of IPNV antigen in fish tissues were studied. Coagglutination tests were carried out with cell free virus antigens from selected viruses using Staphylococcus aureus (Cowan I) sensitized with anti-IPNV (Buhl) serum. Positive reactions occured only with cell free IPNV (Buhl) antigen, and no cross reactions were observed. The specificity of coagglutination test for rapid (less than 2 h) serological typing of IPNV was tested using the strains from North America, Japan and Europe. Staphylococci sensitized with anti-VR 299 serum gave positive reactions with the strains from North America and Japan (VR 299 type), but did not combine with the strains from Europe (Sp and Ab type). Although staphylococci sensitized with anti-Sp and Ab sera showed weak cross reactions with the strains from North America and Japan, the agglutination pattern was clearly different. The most important use of the coagglutination test for IPNV would be to detect specific IPNV antigen in the internal organs of infected fish. It was found that IPNV antigen could be detected in extracts of IPNV infected rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and <b>amago</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) tissues at relatively high sensitivity. The results obtained in this study using the coagglutination {{test for the}} diagnosis of IPN indicate that this rapid and simple test, which requires no special apparatus and can be performed in the field, is a valuable addition to the diagnostic methods available for detecting this disease. 特異抗体感作staphylococciを用いたcoagglutination testによる感染細胞培養液および病魚内臓抽出液中に存有するIPNウイルス抗原の検出法について，特に本法位のIPN迅速診断への応用を目的に検品を行ない次の如き結果を得た。抗IPNV(Buhl) 血清感作staphylococciはIPNV(Buhl) と反応陽性を，IHNVやOMVとは陰性を示し，この反応の特異性はブロッキングテストにより確かめられた。血清タイプの異なるIPNV株間での交叉凝集試験では，抗IPNV VR 299 血清感作staphylococciは北米および我国分離株(VR 299 type) とのみ反応陽性を示し，Ab，Sp株を含むヨーロッパ株との反応は陰性であった。一方抗IPNV Ab，Sp血清感作staphylococciはVR 299 type株と弱い交叉凝集反応を示したが，その凝集パターンはAb，Sp株のそれとは明らかに異なり，本法によりこれらの迅速・簡易血清型別が可能となった。ニジマス(Salmo gairdneri) ，ギンマス(Oncorhynchus kisutch) およびアマゴ(Oncorhynchus rhodurus) lPN病魚の内臓抽出液を抗原としたcoagglutination testでは，比較的高希釈（× 2 ^ 4 ）試料においても 90 分間の反応で陽性結果を得，IPNの迅速な診断が可能となった。本法は特殊な実験器具を全く必要とせず，最終結果を得るまでにわずか 2 時間程を要するのみであることから，現場におけるIPNの迅速かつ簡易な診断法であると考える...|$|E
40|$|The maturation-inducing hormone 17 (alpha), 20 (beta) -dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (DHP) {{was first}} {{identified}} in the <b>amago</b> <b>salmon.</b> Although carbonyl reductase-like 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CR/ 20 b-HSD) was reported to convert 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17 OHP) to DHP in rainbow trout, we previously found that CR/ 20 beta-HSD messenger RNA (mRNA) was not upregulated in stimulated granulosa cells from masu salmon, which suggested that DHP is synthesized by a different enzyme. Accordingly, the current study aimed to identify the specific 20 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 beta-HSD) responsible for DHP production by granulosa cells during final oocyte maturation in masu salmon. RNA sequencing was performed on granulosa layers that were isolated from ovarian follicles at 1 month before ovulation and incubated with or without forskolin, which was used to mimic luteinizing hormone, and similar to 12 million reads were obtained, which yielded 71, 062 contigs of > 100 bp. tBlastx analysis identified 1 contig (#f 103496) as similar to 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 12 (hsd 17 beta 12); however, because the full-length #f 103496 sequence was different from hsd 17 beta 12, it was termed hsd 17 beta 12 -like (hsd 17 beta 12 l). We found that mammalian cells transfected with full-length hsd 171 beta 2 l exhibited considerable 20 b-HSD activity, as indicated by efficient conversion of exogenous 17 OHP to DHP. In addition, we found that hsd 17 beta 12 l mRNA levels were consistently low in follicles during vitellogenic growth; however, the levels increased significantly during final oocytematuration. The levels of hsd 17 beta 12 lmRNA were also considerably increased in granulosa layers in which 20 beta-HSD activity was induced by salmon pituitary extract. Therefore, we suggest that hsd 17 beta 12 l, not CR/ 20 beta-HSD, is the 20 beta-HSD responsible for DHP production by granulosa cells in masu salmon during final oocytematuration...|$|E
40|$|Fully grown oocytes of {{vertebrates}} {{are arrested}} at prophase {{of the first}} meiotic division and must progress to the second meiotic metaphase before fertilization is possible. The resumption of meiosis is induced {{by the action of}} maturation-inducing hormone (MIH) which is secreted from ovarian follicles under the influence of a pituitary gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone, GTH II in fishes). Among vertebrates, MIHs have been most extensively investigated in several species of fishes and amphibians. In these animals, the MIH is a steroidal substance, and its major function is known to induce resumption of meiosis (final meiotic maturation). 17 α, 20 β-Dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17 α, 20 β-DP) was identified, {{for the first time in}} any vertebrate, as MIH of <b>amago</b> <b>salmon</b> (Oncorhynchus rhodurus). In the most widely investigated group, the anuran amphibians, MIH is generally considered to be progesterone. The most fundamental insight into hormone action that has emerged from the study of oocyte maturation is the identification of a new type of steroid hormone action that involves a plasma membrane receptor. Unfortunately, efforts to purify and characterize MIH receptors have been difficult and unsuccessful, largely due to relatively low ligand affinities and specificity of 17 α, 20 β-DP and progesterone. A specific 17 α, 20 β-DP binding to plasma membranes prepared from defolliculated oocytes of rainbow trout was identified and charactenzed. Recently, it has been reported that pertussis toxin (PT) -sensitive inhibitory G-proteins (Gi) is involved in the signal transduction of 17 α, 20 β-DP during meiotic maturation of rainbow trout oocytes. However, the details of the receptors and their signaling pathway are poorly understood. Therefore, the present study was designed to further investigate the involvement of G-proteins in the signal transduction pathway during steroid hormone-induced oocyte maturation. To this end, I chose the medaka (Oryzias latipes) as an experimental animal. Medaka, under a photoperiod of 14 hr light and 10 hr dark at 26 ℃, usually spawns daily within 1 hr of the onset of light for a number of consecutive days. By this method, various phases of oocyte maturation can be timed accurately. This orderly spawning allows us to collect oocytes at predictable stages, which makes medaka an ideal model for the study of hormonal regulation of oocyte growth and maturation. 17 α, 20 β-DP was shown to be a major naturally occurring MIH in medaka. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was also used for comparison. In chapter I, I examined changes in Giα subunit protein contents and 17 α, 20 β-DP binding (receptor) activity during naturally occurring oocyte maturation in both rainbow trout and media. The antibody AS/ 7 specific for Giα 1, 2 subunits immunodetected Giα subunit proteins (40 kDa) in medaka and rainbow trout plasma membranes from postvitellogenic oocytes. The α subunit of G-proteins detected in medaka oocyte membranes has properties characteristic of a member of the Gi family. This protein was shown to be a substrate for PT. Time course changes in the amount of the 40 kDa band were examined using media membrane preparations obtained during various periods (every 6 hr from 41 hr prior to spawning to ovulation) of oocyte growth and maturation. Gi protein was maximal in immature oocytes (23 hr prior to spawning), decreased in oocytes undergoing GVBD and was not detected in ovulated eggs. A similar decrease in Gi protein contents also occurs in membrane fractions of oocytes undergoing GVBD and ovulated eggs in rainbow trout. Changes in 17 α, 20 β-DP binding (receptor) activity in oocyte plasrha membranes were examined using medaka oocytes collected in the same time course as that used for Gi protein content measurements. 17 α, 20 β-DP binding activity was barely detectable at 35 hr prior to spawning. The binding activity increased significantly to reach a maximal level at 23 hr prior to spawning, followed by a rapid drop during oocyte maturation and ovulation. The maturational competence was also determined by counting percentage GVBD. The percentage of GVBD was only 5 % at 38 hr prior to spawning, but increased to 48 % at 29 hr prior to spawning, and reached 100 % at 23 hr prior to spawning. At 17 hr prior to spawning, oocytes underwent spontaneous maturation in the absence of 17 α, 20 β-DP. The increases in the percentage of GVBD and 17 α, 20 β-DP binding activity occurred concomitantly. In chapter II I, I focus on the characterization of Giα subunits expressed in medaka postvitellogenic oocytes as candidates of signal transducer of the 17 α, 20 β-DP receptor. Cloning and sequencing of full-length cDNAs encoding medaka Giα subunits were also canted out. In addition, I also investigated the expression of Gs in medaka oocytes. I first used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify α subunits of G-proteins using total RNA from intact ovarian follicles as a template. Five different PCR products were obtained. Sequence analyses indicate that these clones include three subtypes of Giα (Giαa, Giαb and Giαc) and two subtypes of Gsα (Gsαd and Gsαe). Full length cDNA clones for Giαa and Giαc were isolated from a medaka ovarian follicle cDNA library. Predicted amino acid sequences of Giαa and Giαc exhibited significant homology with Giα 1 and Giα 2 of other species, respectively. Both Giαa and Giαc possessed a specific Cys residue in the C-terminal region which was the site for ADP-ribosylation by PT. A method was then developed to extract medaka oocyte RNA without contamination of follicle cell RNA. Using this method, I demonstrated that oocytes expressed both Giαa and Giαc, but not Giαb. Goα, another G-protein which is ADP-ribosylated by PT, was not expressed in oocytes, although it was expressed in brain tissue. The results presented here suggest that the 17 α, 20 β-DP-dependent stimulation of oocyte maturation is mediated through the G-protein α subunits, Giαa and/or Giαc. In chapter III, the coupling of 17 α, 20 β-DP receptors and G-protein α subunits in medaka oocyte plasma membranes was investigated. Three kinds of antisera (A 2, C 4, and M 1) against peptides corresponding to the unique internal sequences of medaka Gia subtypes, Giαa and Giαc, were produced. Antisera A 2 and C 4 recognized Giαa and Giαc, respectively, while antiserum M 1 recognized both subtypes of Giα. Immunoblotting using these antisera showed that medaka oocytes express two Giα, Giαa and Giαc, concomitantly. The results also indicated that Giαa behaved a little larger than Giαc on SDS-PAGE. Giα in medaka oocyte membrane preparations could be ADP-ribosylated with PT after solubilization with CHAPS. This indicates that the solubilization condition used in this study was so mild that Gi retains the heterotrimeric form even after solubilization. As expected, antiserum M 1 successfully precipitated solubilized two Giα, Giαa and Giαc. Furthermore, the p subunit of G-protein was also found in the immunoprecipitates. These results indicate that Gi still retains the heterotrimeric form in the immunoprecipitate, because the β and γ subunits are known to tightly associate each other. Significant amounts of specific 17 α, 20 β-DP bindings (17 α, 20 β-DP receptors) were found in the immunoprecipitates, indicating that the 17 α, 20 β-DP receptor is directly coupled with Gi. This is the first demonstration of direct coupling of the MIH (steroid) receptor and heterotrimeric G-proteins. I have not yet attempted to quantify yield of 17 α, 20 β-DP binding and Giα in the immunoprecipitates. Several technical problems need to be overcome; these include the difficulty of assaying 17 α, 20 β-DP binding in solubilized membrane preparations. In summary, by producing three polyclonal antibodies which recognize Giα, I was able to demonstrate, using immunoprecipitation and ligand binding assays, that the 17 α, 20 β-DP receptor is coupled directly with Gi, and its a subunit is Giαa and/or Giαc. It should be emphasized that evidence for plasma membrane steroid hormone receptors is not limited to the amphibian and fish oocyte system. For example, it is becoming increasingly apparent that some steroid hormones may effect rapid alterations in brain function independently of classical intracellular receptors. Further studies will focus on the identification of the 17 α, 20 β-DP receptor using this new coimmunoprecipitation method developed in this study...|$|E
