6000|$|It {{comes back}} to me, the whole [...] "job," [...] as wonderfully amusing and delightfully {{difficult}} from the first; since amusement deeply abides, I think, in any artistic attempt the basis and groundwork of which are conscious of a particular firmness. On that hard fine floor the element of execution feels it may more or less confidently DANCE; in which case puzzling questions, sharp obstacles, dangers of detail, may come up for it by the dozen without breaking its heart or shaking its nerve. It is the difficulty produced by the loose foundation or the vague scheme that breaks the heart--when a luckless fatuity has over-persuaded an author of the [...] "saving" [...] virtue of treatment. Being [...] "treated" [...] is never, in a workable idea, a mere passive condition, and I hold no subject ever susceptible of help that isn't, like the embarrassed man of our proverbial wisdom, first of all able to help itself. I was thus to have here an envious glimpse, in carrying my design through, of that artistic rage and that artistic felicity which I have ever supposed to be intensest and highest, {{the confidence of the}} dramatist strong in the sense of his postulate. The dramatist has verily to BUILD, is committed to architecture, to construction at any cost; to driving in deep his vertical supports and laying across and firmly fixing his horizontal, his resting pieces--at the risk of no matter what vibration from the tap of his master-hammer. This makes the <b>active</b> <b>value</b> of his basis immense, enabling him, with his flanks protected, to advance undistractedly, even if not at all carelessly, into the comparative fairy-land of the mere minor anxiety. In other words his scheme HOLDS, and as he feels this in spite of noted strains and under repeated tests, so he keeps his face to the day. I rejoiced, by that same token, to feel MY scheme hold, and even a little ruefully watched it give me much more than I had ventured to hope. For I promptly found my conceived arrangement of my material open the door wide to ingenuity. I remember that in sketching my project for the conductors of the periodical I have named I drew on a sheet of paper--and possibly with an effect of the cabalistic, it now comes over me, that even anxious amplification may have but vainly attenuated--the neat figure of a circle consisting of a number of small rounds disposed at equal distance about a central object. The central object was my situation, my subject in itself, to which the thing would owe its title, and the small rounds represented so many distinct lamps, as I liked to call them, the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects. I had divided it, didn't they see? into aspects--uncanny as the little term might sound (though not for a moment did I suggest we should use it for the public), and by that sign we would conquer.|$|E
50|$|Characters {{have a set}} of Attributes, Powers, and Skills. Attributes are {{the nine}} qualities every {{character}} has. Powers and Skills reflect innate ability or training. Attributes are divided into three categories (Physical, Mental, and Spiritual) and three attribute types (Action, Effect, and Resistance). For example, when Superman punches someone, he uses Dexterity to see if he connects, Strength to see how hard he hits, and the opposing character's Body to see how much damage he did. The value of a Power usually serves as both <b>Active</b> <b>Value</b> (AV) and Effect Value (EV) resisted by the target's Resistance Value (RV). All actions taken, even against inanimate objects, use that system. For example, investigators use AV and EV against a RV to determine the quality of information their efforts gather.|$|E

40|$|When {{creating}} highly-interactive, Direct Manipulation interfaces, one of {{the most}} difficult design and implementation tasks is handling the mouse and other input devices. Peridot, a new User Interface Management System, addresses this problem by allowing the user interface designer to demonstrate how the input devices should be handled by giving an example of the interface in action. The designer uses sample values for parameters, and the system automatically infers the general operation and creates the code. After an interaction is specified, it can immediately be executed and edited. This promotes extremely rapid prototyping since it is very easy to design, implement and modify mouse-based interfaces. Peridot also supports additional input devices such as touch tablets, as well as multiple input devices operating in parallel (such as one in each hand) in a natural, easy to specify manner. This is implemented using <b>active</b> <b>values,</b> which are like variables except that the objects that depend on <b>active</b> <b>values</b> are updated immediately whenever they change. <b>Active</b> <b>values</b> are a straightforward and efficient mechanism for implementing dynamic interactions...|$|R

40|$|Value {{creation}} {{is an important}} part of social marketing, which attempts to create value for target audiences to induce behaviour change (Kotler 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2011). Social marketing is often concerned with voluntary behaviour change, and as such, requires a level of active consumer participation within the value creation process. The voluntary nature of many social marketing activities suggests that the experiential value of these behaviours is proactive. Holbrook (1994) distinguishes between passive and <b>active</b> <b>value</b> in commercial marketing, whereby passive value is experienced by consumers reactively in response to the consumption of an object or service, and <b>active</b> <b>value</b> is participative, which requires collaboration between the consumer and organisation.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} value {{robustness}} approach to architect defense systems and Systems of Systems (SoS). A value robust system or SoS {{has the ability}} to provide continued value to stakeholders by performing well to meet the mission intent under a variety of future contexts. The proposed approach encompasses three methods, namely "Needs to Architecture" framework, Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) and Epoch-Era Analysis. The architecting approach will commence with the "Needs to Architecture" framework. Stakeholders' needs are elicited and design concepts will be formulated. MATE is then used to screen, evaluate and select suitable design concepts. Subsequently, Epoch-Era Analysis is used to guide system architects to anticipate changes across foreseeable epochs, which are time periods of fixed needs and context. The tradespace analysis is repeated across all these epochs. Pareto Trace and Filtered Outdegree metrics will be used to identify passive and <b>active</b> <b>value</b> robust designs. The proposed value robustness approach is demonstrated conceptually using an Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) system and an Army SoS case study. The proposed value robustness approach offers a potential methodology to design and evaluate complex defense systems such that they continue to be valuable to stakeholders over time. The method is also complementary to existing architecting methods such as modeling and simulation. The end product of applying this approach is a cost efficient defense system, which might be passively or actively value robust. High switching and modification costs might be avoided even if changes to the <b>active</b> <b>value</b> robust defense system are required. Through the use of the Army SoS case study discussion, the author suggests that a value robust defense SoS architecture is one that encompasses the desired ilities of changeability and interoperability. by Kevin C.

30|$|Under S-D logic, value {{co-creation}} network involves relationships {{not only}} between businesses and customers, but also customers and customers. Consequently, customers {{are not merely}} responders but rather <b>active</b> <b>value</b> co-creators. The customer-to-customer relationships are referred as brand tribes [25] that have been employed by companies to enhance their customers’ loyalty. Brand tribes are different from traditional brand communities in that, the latter are managed by companies in a formal manner, such as membership subscription, and various rewards or incentives are offered to members. Restate, in brand tribes, customers develop loose relationships freely by themselves without any formal subscription, called tribal behavior [25], which fits the spontaneity nature of bicycling VCEs. This study has demonstrated tribal behavior drives the pursuit of benefits that are realized by VCE engagement, and has affected the related participation and citizenship behaviors in turn. For major bicycling VCE tribal behavior, this study has {{recognized the importance of}} social influences toward personal commitment and engagement of bicycling activities and related VCEs.|$|E

In the case of goat milk, the proteinsâ€™ concentration and quality represent basic indices {{for the evaluation of}} the nutritional and biologically <b>active</b> <b>values.</b> The proposal is to comparatively analyse the protein profile of milk. The milk was collected from two different breeds: French Alpine and Romanian Carpathian. During March and April 2016 there were collected samples of raw milk in hygienic and sanitation conditions. There were two lots: first lot has 10 Carpathian goats and the second lot has 10 Alpine goats. The protein composition of goat milk was established with SDS-PAGE, after the evaluation of the total proteinsâ€™ concentration with the Bradford method. The quantitative and percentage data obtained with electrophoresis revealed few differences between those 8 identified protein fractions. Between those two lots, regarding the levels of Î²-CN, k-CN and Î²-lactoglobulines there were significant differences. The other protein fractions have values almost identical. Statistical analysis of obtained data shaped the differences in the protein profile at those two breeds. Based on those differences it is to note the superior potential of the Alpine breed regarding the content in biologically active milk proteins. Regarding the obtained data, this study brings new contributions for the evaluation and analysis of protein profile as a nutritive and biologically active component of goat milk, confirming its character as a functional aliment...|$|R

Furthermore, learning style theory suggests that reflective learning may differ based on students’ learning styles. This study investigates the impact of learning styles on watching (passive value) vs. creating (<b>active</b> <b>value)</b> reflective videos on a university-based video platform called QUTopia TV.

Preliminary {{phytochemical}} investigation of the crude extracts revealed the presence of flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, and terpenoid. The main aim {{of this study was to}} find out the bioactive compounds with potential antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities based on the bioassay-guided fractionation and isolation procedures. Methanol and fractionated extracts (hexane, chloroform and methanol) of D. linearis were investigated for their cytotoxic effects against three cell lines, namely HL 60, HCTl 16 and MCF 7 and one normal cell WRL 68 using the MTT assay. The methanol extract was found to be most effective against HL 60 (ICso 9. 20 ug/ml., respectively). The methanol fraction possessed strong activity against HL 60 with ICsoof 12. 88 ug/ml. and was fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography into eleven fractions (FI, F 2, F 3, F 4, F 5, F 6, F 7, F 8, F 9, FlO and FI 1). Only F 7 showed the <b>active</b> <b>value</b> with ICso 6. 21 ug/ml., Purification of the most bioactive fraction, F 7 with column chromatography, radial chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography resulted in the isolation of four compounds (PCI, PC 2, PC 3 and PC 4). Only PCI and PC 2 showed the <b>active</b> <b>value</b> of cytotoxic activity against HL 60 with IC 50 values of 4. 59 and 3. 87 ug/ml. respectively. The structure of these compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods (lD-NMR, 2 -D-NMR, UV, IR and MS) and compared with published data. PCI and PC 2 were identified as quercitrin and afzelin, respectively. The micro-broth dilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity against S. aureus 25923 (MSSA), S. aureus 33591 (MRSA), B. subtilis 6633, E. coli 35218, P. aeruginosa 27853 and C. albicans 10231. The highest activity was methanol extracts and methanol fraction with the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values 1250 ug/ml, and 625 ug/ml [...] All the fractions Fl until F 7 showed the weak antimicrobial activity with the MIC > 1250 ug/ml., Hence, the separation into single pure compounds was not possible, resulting in a reduced antimicrobial activity.

40|$|Current {{intrusion}} detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such as SNORT. Such an approach {{is prone to}} missing highly targeted and specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices (as {{was the case in}} Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS, SENAMI, for use with Siemens S 7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks at a rate of 99 %, and <b>active</b> <b>value</b> tampering attacks at a rate of 81 - 93 %.
