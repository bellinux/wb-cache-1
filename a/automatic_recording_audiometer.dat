40|$|The {{underwater}} {{ambient noise}} in the coastal waters of Kumano-nada were observed. The apparatuses used were a hydrophone, tape recorder and newly produced <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> system. The ambient {{noise in the}} coastal fishing grounds was recorded with the hydrophone and tape recorder. The diurnal change of the sound pressure levels in the bay were caught with an <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> buoy. Also, the sounds in the water on stormy days were observed with an submerged <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> capsule. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The maximum noise level of the area was 95 dB(re 1 μPa) at frequencies between 200 and 1000 Hz. The minimum level was 45 dB at frequencies above 10 KHz. 2. The prevailing underwater noise levels on stormy days were apparent at frequencies between 500 and 2500 Hz. 3. Ship traffic noise and other artificial noise were always heard in this area. The noise contributed at frequencies below 1 KHz,and the levels were 40 dB above the usual background noise...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> constraint (ARC) {{that can be}} used to model and solve scheduling problems where tasks may not overlap in time and the tasks linearly exhaust some resource. Since achieving generalized arc-consistency for the ARC is NP-hard, we develop a filtering algorithm that achieves approximated consistency only. Numerical results show the benefits of the new constraint on three out of four different types of benchmark sets for the <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> problem. On these instances, run-times can be achieved that are orders of magnitude better than those of the best previous constraint programming approach...|$|R

A groundwater monitoring devices is designed. It is composed to a take-off and landing control circuit by a water level monitor, a comparator IC and 89 C 51 single-chip. The <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> devices combined with dynamic software have achieved a dynamic real-time, accurate, continuous convenient monitoring of the groundwater.

40|$|A {{model for}} {{evaluating}} the effectiveness of automatic record-ing of television programs by digital personal video recorders (PVRs) is presented. The model is {{used to evaluate the}} trade-off between manual management of recording programs to a PVR archive and <b>automatic</b> management of <b>recording.</b> We show that a tradeoff exists between manual management in which the utility of a program is perfectly known but user awareness of available programs is limited versus automatic management in which utility estimates contain error but aware-ness is perfect. Experiments with the model show that the shape of this tradeoff is most governed by the shape of the distribution of user utility. As the percentage of programs with high user utility decreases relative to the average, the more effective <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> is likely to be despite er-rors in utility estimation. The shape of this tradeoff, however, is highly inelastic. Thus, improving utility estimates will not make <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> more effective if user awareness is sufficiently high. 1...|$|R

5000|$|With {{regard to}} records, most double album sets have sides {{one and two}} back to back on the first disc, {{followed}} by sides three and four on the second disc, etc. The record industry term for this practice is [...] "manual sequence." [...] However, some double album LP sets have sides one and four pressed on one disc along with sides two and three on the other. This practice, known as [...] "automatic sequence," [...] began {{in the era of}} 78s and was intended {{to make it easier for}} listeners to play through the entire set in order on <b>automatic</b> <b>record</b> changers. The use of automatic sequence gradually declined during the 1970s as <b>automatic</b> <b>record</b> changers fell out of favor.

40|$|Due to {{extensive}} groundwater {{development in}} the recent past, Pakistan now faces enormous challenges of groundwater management as it struggles to ensure food security for its rapidly growing population. These management challenges require a re-balancing of surface and groundwater monitoring objectives and approaches in the country. This article presents {{the current status of}} the groundwater monitoring and management in Pakistan. A compelling case is presented for optimization of material resources in improving groundwater level and quality data by proposing to use farmer organizations as a source of crowd sourced groundwater information. The authors showcase new methods to collect groundwater data and demonstrate use of <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> instruments for groundwater monitoring in a tertiary canal command area in the Pakistan’s Punjab. The results suggest that the potential for broader impact by engaging farmer organization and expanding monitoring networks is attractive. A common concern about long term deployment of automatic instruments is that the observation wells are not purged before extracting water quality samples. The authors address this concern through a field experiment by utilizing capabilities of <b>automatic</b> <b>recording</b> instruments...|$|R
