40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis covers {{various aspects of the}} epidemiology, diagnosis and management of various respiratory symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> in children frequently encountered in general practice. These respiratory tract symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> can be categorized into symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> of the upper respiratory tract (ENT problems, including cough, earache, sore throat, otitis media, tonsillitis), <b>and</b> symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> of the lower airways (e. g. cough, wheezing, dyspnoea, pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma). The general aim of this work was to provide information for optimizing the care for children with respiratory symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> in general practice. We have provided epidemiological data about respiratory symptoms <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> in children, <b>and</b> examined the general practitioners' (GPs) management with respect to medication prescribing and referring these children to specialist care. The study aims were achieved by examining data from the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice, the Netherlands Information Network of General Practice, the Dutch National Medical Registration, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials...|$|R

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites <b>and</b> <b>disease.</b> They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Yam (Dioscorea spp.) {{production}} in Northern Benin is severely affected by pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> resulting in poor yields and cultivars diversity loss {{in spite of}} the importanceof thiscommodity. In order to develop efficient integrated pestsand diseases management approaches, twenty seven (27) villages of the yam production zone of northern Benin were surveyed using participatory research appraisal to document farmers’indigenous knowledge, and traditional management practices of yam pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results indicated that farmers have good knowledge of the yam pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> that were even reported as the third most important production constraints in the study area. Among the pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> nematodes, termites, mealybugs <b>and</b> wilt <b>diseases</b> were the most signaled. Farmers surveyed have traditional methods for mealybugs but nothing for the other pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> apart from the use of resistant/tolerant cultivars. An undetermined disease locally called Ban was reported as expanding at alarming rate throughout villages and yam fields seriously affecting the food quality of the tubers. Urgent intervention zones were identified with multivariate analysis and recommended to the national protection service. The sensitization of the yam producers of the necessity of treating both soil and tuber seeds before planting, the development and the use of pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> tolerant cultivars were proposed as management strategies.

Bonaparte, conscious of his promises to send reinforcements to the beleaguered army in Egypt, planned a series of expeditions to the region to restore morale and numbers to the expeditionary force, drawn from troops and naval units available on the French Atlantic coast. The largest force consisted of 5,000 soldiers and nine ships under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume and sailed from Brest in January 1801, but this squadron had been preceded by two frigates from Rochefort, Africaine and Régénérée.|$|E
