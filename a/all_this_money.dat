5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money,</b> so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

Of his relationship with his half brother Michael (Steve John Shepherd), he said that Michael [...] "corrupted" [...] Anthony explaining, [...] "Anthony just idolises him, {{the fact of the matter}} is that Michael has his own business and has <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> coming in, without having to worry about all the family politics, so Anthony's in awe of that".|$|E
500|$|At one point, Chabon {{submitted}} a 672-page draft to his agent and editor, who disliked the work. Chabon had problems dropping the novel, though. [...] "It was really scary," [...] he said later. [...] "I'd already {{signed a contract}} and been paid <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money.</b> And then I'd gotten a divorce and half the money was already with my ex-wife.

He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the [...] "most satisfying use of the actor or character". Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people. For instance, the scene of Mulder's exhumation was filmed with a double who wore a mask of Duchovny's face. Head make-up artist Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later said [...] "It was brilliant, because nobody knew that." [...] For the shots of the stunt double as well as Duchovny later in the episode, she used egg whites and a facial mask to give Mulder's skin a [...] "really cool, old, dried-up cracked skin effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Brian Southall {{describes}} [...] "Only a Northern Song" [...] as Harrison's [...] "personal {{denunciation of}} the Beatles' music publishing business". When discussing {{the song in}} two late 1990s interviews with Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White, Harrison commented that the main target of his complaints was Dick James, the managing director of Northern Songs. Having been signed by James in 1963, {{at the age of}} twenty, Harrison said that the publisher had failed to explain that by signing the contract, he was also signing away the ownership of his compositions. Harrison added that he only understood the consequences after the 1965 flotation, when the major shareholders were [...] "making <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> out of this catalog". With reference to the Rutles' 1978 parody of the Beatles' history, All You Need Is Cash, he also told White: [...] "I think [...] was put better in the make-believe TV documentary … where it said, 'Dick Jaws, an out-of-work music publisher of no fixed ability' signed them up {{for the rest of their}} lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{moderate}} Republicans were top-heavy, with {{a surplus}} of high visibility national leaders and a shortage of grass roots workers. Most of all they lack the numbers, the enthusiasm and excitement the conservatives could mobilize—the moderates decided it must be an un-American level of fanaticism that drove their opponents. Doug Bailey, a senior Rockefeller aide recalled, [...] "there was a mentality in [...] campaign staff that, 'Look, we have got <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money.</b> We {{should be able to}} buy the people necessary to get this done. And you buy from the top down'". Bailey discovered that the Rockefeller team never understood that effective political organizations are empowered from the bottom up, not the top down.|$|E

Because this is their first song with profanity, [...] "Shit" [...] and [...] "fucking" [...] are intact, but have been replaced with [...] "it" [...] and [...] "stupid" [...] in the song's clean version. The clean version censors Wiz Khalifa's cursing as well. When Khalifa serves his verse, his rhymes don't speak of his love life, but rather his [...] "haters": [...] "I'll be out spending <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>money</b> while you sittin' 'round wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin' / Made it from the bottom now when you see me I'm stunnin'." ...|$|E
