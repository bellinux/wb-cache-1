5|$|The current {{definitions}} of the kilogram, <b>ampere,</b> kelvin and mole be revised.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the <b>ampere</b> is undergoing a major overhaul—the current definition, which is difficult to realise with high precision in practice, is being replaced by a definition that is more intuitive and that is easier to realise.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by <b>Ampère,</b> who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the <b>ampere.</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} and interprets some conceptual difficulties junior-level physics students experience with <b>Ampère’s</b> law. We present both quantitative data, based on students’ written responses to conceptual questions, and qualitative data, {{based on interviews}} of students solving <b>Ampère’s</b> law problems. We find that some students struggle to connect the current enclosed by an Ampèrian loop to {{the properties of the}} magnetic field while some students do not use information about the magnetic field to help them solve <b>Ampère’s</b> law problems. In this paper, we show how these observations may be interpreted as evidence that some students do not see the integral in <b>Ampère’s</b> law as representing a sum and that some students do not use accessible information about the magnetic field as they attempt to solve <b>Ampère’s</b> law problems. This work extends previous studies into students’ difficulties with <b>Ampère’s</b> law and provides possible guidance for instruction...|$|R
5|$|In 1921, the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to include all physical units, including the <b>ampere</b> and others defined by the Fourth International Conference of Electricians in Chicago in 1893, thereby enabling the CGPM to address inconsistencies {{in the way that}} the metric system had been used.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{absolute}} unit {{of electric}} current, the abampere, had been {{defined in terms}} of the force between two parallel current-carrying wires in 1881. In the 1940s, the International Electrotechnical Commission adopted an MKS variant of this definition for the <b>ampere,</b> which was adopted in 1948 by the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units (Système {{international}} d'unités or SI) is {{the current}} international standard metric system and is also the system most widely used around the world. It {{is an extension of}} Giorgi's MKSA system—its base units are the metre, kilogram, second, <b>ampere,</b> kelvin, candela and mole.|$|E
50|$|Miniature circuit {{breakers}} and fuses may be rated to interrupt {{as little as}} 85 <b>amperes</b> and are intended for supplementary protection of equipment, not the primary protection of a building wiring system. In North American practice, approved general-purpose low-voltage fuses must interrupt at least 10,000 <b>amperes</b> and certain types useful for large commercial and industrial low-voltage distribution systems are rated to safely interrupt 200,000 <b>amperes.</b> The rating of power {{circuit breakers}} varies according to the application voltage; a circuit breaker that interrupts 50,000 <b>amperes</b> at 208 volts might be rated to interrupt only 10,000 <b>amperes</b> at 600 volts, for example. Direct-current systems such as used with batteries are {{more of a problem}} than alternating current systems, because in the latter current regularly stops.|$|R
30|$|Apparently, the {{currents}} {{in the range}} of several <b>amperes</b> to several thousand <b>amperes</b> distributed between all the aerosol particles of the cloud are {{the currents}} of a quiet state of ball lightning.|$|R
50|$|Chargers for car {{batteries}} come {{in varying}} ratings. Chargers that are rated {{up to two}} <b>amperes</b> {{may be used to}} maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few <b>amperes</b> to ten or fifteen <b>amperes</b> for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to fully charge a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of <b>amperes</b> required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.|$|R
5|$|The {{station has}} been on the New Jersey State Historic Preservation Office listings since March 25, 1998, the last of the four {{stations}} from East Orange to Glen Ridge to receive the listing. On September 14, 2005, the entire Montclair Branch was added to the same listings, although <b>Ampere,</b> Bloomfield and Glen Ridge stations have been on the listings since March 17, 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in <b>Ampere,</b> New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One henry is the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one <b>ampere</b> per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
500|$|The Electromagnetic {{system of}} units (EMU) was {{developed}} from André-Marie <b>Ampère's</b> discovery in the 1820s of {{a relationship between the}} force between two current-carrying conductors. This relationship is now known as <b>Ampere's</b> law which can be written ...|$|R
50|$|Contact ratings {{commonly}} {{vary from}} unspecified up to 5 <b>amperes</b> (11 <b>amperes</b> for special high-power versions). Voltage is often unspecified, {{but may be}} up to 48V with 12V typical. The smaller types usually have lower current and voltage ratings.|$|R
25|$|One {{application}} of this is <b>Ampère's</b> force law, which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: <b>Ampère's</b> force law.|$|R
5|$|After the {{takeover}} of service along the former Morris & Essex Lines by New Jersey Transit from Conrail in 1982, the service at the Roseville Avenue station remained minimal. Many trains bypassed the station in favor {{of going to the}} nearby Newark Broad Street Station. Trains continued to serve the Roseville Avenue station throughout 1982 and 1983, and service continued to be condensed during 1984. However, as of the official September 1984 timetables, service was cut from Roseville Avenue in favor of Newark Broad Street to Grove Street, East Orange (on the Morris & Essex) or <b>Ampere</b> (on the Montclair Branch), both of which closed in April 1991. On September 16, 1984, trains began bypassing Roseville Avenue, and the station was closed permanently. Although the station was closed, Roseville Tower, for the interlocking between the Montclair Branch and Morris & Essex Lines, remained in service for almost two more decades. In 2002, during construction of the Montclair Connection, the tower was demolished in favor of expanding the cut in Roseville for a second track of the new Montclair-Boonton Line.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the <b>ampere,</b> which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is somewhat different from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent electro-mechanical system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (<b>ampere,</b> volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the electro-mechanical quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
50|$|The Townsend {{avalanche}} {{can have}} a large range of current densities. In common gas-filled tubes, such as those used as gaseous ionisation detectors, magnitudes of currents flowing during this process can range from about 10&minus;18 <b>amperes</b> to about 10&minus;5 <b>amperes.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{application}} of this is <b>Ampères</b> force law, which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the others magnetic field. For more information, see the article: <b>Ampères</b> force law.|$|R

5|$|In 1868, Janssen and Lockyer {{independently}} {{observed a}} yellow {{line in the}} solar spectrum that did not match {{that of any other}} element. In 1895, in each case at around the same time, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet independently observed helium trapped in cleveite. André-Marie <b>Ampère</b> predicted an element analogous to chlorine obtainable from hydrofluoric acid, and between 1812 and 1886 many researchers tried to obtain it. Fluorine was eventually isolated by Moissan, in 1886. In 1894, Lord Rayleigh and Ramsay discovered argon by comparing the molecular weights of nitrogen prepared by liquefaction from air and nitrogen prepared by chemical means. It was the first noble gas to be isolated. In 1898, within a period of three weeks, Ramsay and Travers successively separated krypton, neon and xenon from liquid argon by their differences in boiling points. In 1898, Dorn discovered a radioactive gas resulting from the radioactive decay of radium; Ramsay and Robert Whytlaw-Gray subsequently isolated radon in 1910.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 1998, {{the station}} at Watsessing Avenue {{was given the}} State Historical Preservation Organization honor that <b>Ampere,</b> Glen Ridge and Bloomfield {{stations}} received just fourteen years prior. The station continued to receive service through the opening of Montclair Connection on September 30, 2002, which ended service as the Montclair Branch and began as the Montclair-Boonton Line, still the first station on the line after Newark Broad Street Station. On September 10, 2007, New Jersey Transit announced the canopies of the old station, then 95 years old, were to be restored and repaired. The service contracted a $1.7 million project to Watertrol Incorporated of Cranford. At that time, the station served an average of 200people daily. Improvements for the station included brand new canopy lighting, repairs to the cantilever canopies, replacement of stairways and fencing, along with changing roof tiles and a new drainage system to replace the 1912 version. When the construction was finished in October 2008, the station now served nearly 450people daily on average. A ceremony to mark its completion was held on October 30, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the IPK is crucial because the kilogram underpins much of the SI system of measurement as it is currently defined and structured. For instance, the newton {{is defined as the}} force necessary to accelerate one kilogram at one metre per second squared. If the mass of the IPK were to change slightly, so too must the newton by a proportional degree. In turn, the pascal, the SI unit of pressure, is defined in terms of the newton. This chain of dependency follows to many other SI units of measure. For instance, the joule, the SI unit of energy, is defined as that expended when a force of one newton acts through one metre. Next to be affected is the SI unit of power, the watt, which is one joule per second. The <b>ampere</b> too is defined relative to the newton, and ultimately, the kilogram.|$|E
50|$|Using these {{expression}}s, {{the regular}} form of <b>Ampère's</b> law and Faraday's law can be derived. Importantly, Weber electrodynamics does not predict an expression like the Biot-Savart law and testing differences between <b>Ampere's</b> {{law and the}} Biot-Savart law {{is one way to}} test Weber electrodynamics.|$|R
50|$|Some devices, when {{plugged into}} {{charging}} ports, draw even more power (10 watts at 2.1 <b>amperes)</b> than the Battery Charging Specification allows — The iPad {{is one such}} device.Barnes & Noble NOOK Color devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9 <b>amperes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{magnetization}} M {{is given}} in SI units of <b>amperes</b> per meter (A/m). In CGS, the unit of M is the oersted (Oe). One A/m equals 10−3 emu/cm3. A good permanent magnet can have a magnetization {{as large as a}} million <b>amperes</b> per meter.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{cessation}} of hostilities, YDG-11 saw little or no active service before being berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She was retained on an inactive, in service, status until the winter of 1946 and 1947, when she was placed out of service, in reserve. On 1 November 1947 she was re-designated ADG-11. The ship remained inactive until July 1951, when she was again placed in service. Assigned to the Far East, ADG-11 was based at Yokosuka, Japan until sometime in 1954. After that, her home port was Sasebo, Japan. On 1 February 1955, she was renamed <b>Ampere.</b> The ship was placed out of service in February 1957. Her equipment was transferred to USS Surfbird, a minesweeping vessel which was redesignated a degaussing ship on 15 June 1957. She remained in reserve in the Far East until the summer of 1961, when {{the decision was made}} to dispose of her. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 July 1961, and she was sold on 21 June 1962, to the Philippine President Lines of Manila. Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
