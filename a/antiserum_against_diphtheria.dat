40|$|The DtxR protein from Corynebacterium diphtheriae is an iron-dependent {{repressor}} {{that regulates}} transcription from the tox, IRP 1, and IRP 2 promoters. A gene from virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv was recently shown to encode a protein, here designated iron-dependent regulator (IdeR), {{that is almost}} 60 % homologous to DtxR from C. diphtheriae. A 750 -bp PCR-derived DNA fragment carrying the M. tuberculosis ideR allele was subcloned to both high- and low-copy-number vectors. In Escherichia coli, transcription from the C. diphtheriae tox, IRP 1, and IRP 2 promoters was strongly repressed by ideR under high-iron conditions, and ideR restored normal iron-dependent expression of the corynebacterial siderophore in the C. diphtheriae dtxR mutant C 7 (beta) hm 723. The M. tuberculosis IdeR protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity by nickel affinity chromatography. Gel mobility shift experiments revealed that IdeR bound to a DNA fragment that carried the C. diphtheriae tox promoter/operator sequence. DNAse I footprint analysis demonstrated that IdeR, {{in the presence of}} Cd 2 +, Co 2 +, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ni 2 +, or Zn 2 +, protected an approximately 30 -bp region on DNA fragments carrying the tox, IRP 1, or IRP 2 promoter/operator sequences. IdeR reacted very weakly in Western blots (immunoblots) with <b>antiserum</b> <b>against</b> the C. <b>diphtheriae</b> DtxR protein, suggesting that the immunodominant epitopes of DtxR may be located in its poorly conserved carboxyl-terminal domain...|$|R

In the present study we have immunized {{a group of young}} adults <b>against</b> tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> to compare the pre- and 28 days post-vaccination immune responses in the young group with results of the same vaccination performed in an elderly group of a previous study. We also studied protection in both groups 5 years after vaccination. We compared antibody titers at all three time points and also analyzed the T cell responses in both age groups 5 years after vaccination. Before vaccination 9 % of the elderly persons were not protected against tetanus, and 48 % did not have protection <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> In the young group all participants were protected against tetanus, but 52 % were also unprotected <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> before vaccination. 28 days after vaccination 100 % of all participants had protective antibody concentrations against tetanus and only a small percentage in each age group (< 10 %) was unprotected <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> 5 years later, 100 % of both cohorts were still protected against tetanus, but 24 % of the young and 54 % of the elderly group were unprotected <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Antibody concentrations <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> measured by ELISA correlated well with their neutralizing capacity. T cell responses to tetanus and diphtheria did not differ between young and old persons. We conclude that booster vaccinations <b>against</b> tetanus and <b>diphtheria</b> according to present recommendations provide long-lasting protection only against tetanus, but not <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> independently of age. In elderly persons, the level of protection is even lower, probably due to intrinsic age-related changes within the immune system and/or insufficient vaccination earlier in life...|$|R

Recent epidemiological studies indicate a low immunity to diphtheria in adults in industrialized countries. In {{the light of}} the epidemic increase of diphtheria in countries such as Russia and the Ukraine, systematic vaccination against this disease is recommended. We analyzed the immunity to diphtheria of 228 hemodialysis patients and the {{efficiency of}} single versus triple vaccination <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> Antibodies <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> toxoid were determined by enzyme immunoassay in sera of 228 adult hemodialysis patients. Fifty-four patients were triple vaccinated <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and were followed for six months; 17 patients were single immunized and antitoxoid titers were determined 1 and 12 months later. The overall protection rate <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> was 22 % and equal in male and female patients. After triple immunization, only 35 % of the patients developed protective antibody concentration (> 0. 1 IE/ml) six months after the third vaccination. A single vaccination caused protective titres twelve months later in 41 % of the patients. There was no difference between responders and non-responders in the duration, intensity or modality of hemodialysis treatment or the response to previous vaccinations against hepatitis-B. We suggest to monitor antibodies <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> toxoid in vaccinated hemodialysis patients at risk for diphtheria since protective titers are often not attained by the standard vaccination protocol...|$|R

40|$|Backgrоund. HIV {{infected}} {{patients are}} at risk for vaccine-preventable infections such as tetanus and diphtheria. It is important to know about the protection of HIV-infected children from these infections, as there is a risk even after complete immunization. The protective immunity after vaccination <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus is measured by the antibodies level against these pathogens. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the persistence of immunity to tetanus and diphtheria toxoid in HIV-infected children. Materials and methods. The protective immunity <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus was studied in children with HIV infection in the Kyiv City AIDS Center. Immunization rate was evaluated in 142 HIV-infected children. Serum samples were obtained in 59 HIV-infected children (study group) vaccinated <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus toxoid during routine check-ups. The results of anti-tetanus and anti-diphtheria antibodies were compared with the data of 17 children without HIV (the control group). The mean age of HIV-infected patients was 9. 2 years old (range from 1. 6 to 15. 5 years old). Most children (38 / 59, 64. 4  %) had mild clinical manifestations of HIV infection (I and II clinical stage of the disease). 89. 8  % (53 / 59) of children of the group received antiretroviral therapy. The level of CD 4 + T-lymphocytes within age norms was in 88. 2  % of children receiving ART. Results. The research revealed lower vaccination coverage of HIV-infected children <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus (63. 3  %) than in the general population. Only 19. 7  % (28 / 142) of HIV-infected children were fully vaccinated according to the National schedule against these bacterial infections. A large proportion of children with HIV infection (79. 3  %) vaccinated against these pathogens does not have protective levels of antibodies <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria.</b> The protective level of antibodies against tetanus was absent in 28. 8  % of vaccinated HIV-positive children. Mean level of tetanus antibodies in serum was significantly lower in HIV-infected children (0. 28 IU/ml) compared to the children not infected with HIV (0. 53 IU/ml), p < 0. 001. The average serum level of antibodies <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> was also significantly lower in HIV-infected children (0. 22 IU/ml) compared to the children not infected with HIV (0. 43  IU/ml), p < 0001. Only 18. 6  % of children in the study group were protected against both pathogens compared with 41. 2  % of children in the control group. HIV-infected children are not immune to diphtheria and tetanus and {{are at risk}} of these infections. Conclusions. The main predictor of immune protection <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus is an early treatment of HIV infection (in the first 2 years of life), higher levels of CD 4 + T-cells at the beginning of ART and ART vaccination after being started on ART. We recommend controlling the level of specific antibodies HIV-infected children who have received vaccination <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and tetanus before the ART beginning.

The serological protection <b>against</b> <b>diphtheria</b> is less favourable than that against tetanus or polio. Against tetanus a sufficient level of immunity has been demonstrated in the study population. The serological protection against polio is type-dependent. A higher protection has been shown against type 1 than against type 2 and 3.
