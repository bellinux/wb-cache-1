5|$|The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B.marginata and B.integrifolia {{are very}} similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa {{subspecies}} resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before <b>anthesis.</b> Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B.oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} flowerhead reaches {{full size}} {{about two weeks}} after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another {{two weeks before the}} flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as florets, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the stigma, style, and anther. The anther is sessile, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma {{at the end of the}} style. The outermost florets open first, with <b>anthesis</b> progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the gynophore, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped nectary lies at the base of the gynophore.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many members}} of the family Proteaceae, Banksia menziesii is largely self-incompatible; that is, inflorescences require pollinators to be fertilised and produce seed. One {{mechanism}} by which the species promotes cross-pollination with other plants is protandry, whereby the male parts release pollen that becomes non-viable before the female parts become receptive on the same flower spike. The individual flowers are uniform, and it is unclear why so few go on to develop follicles. Published in 1988, a field study conducted in banksia woodland near Perth noted that <b>anthesis</b> occurred on an inflorescence at an average rate of 40 to 60 florets opening per day, although this varied widely between different flowerheads. Foraging by honeyeaters would cause the florets to open, but bees would not.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia flowers have {{an unusually}} short life span for Banksia species, {{producing}} nectar {{for only about}} four to twelve days after <b>anthesis.</b> Most nectar is produced during the night and early in the morning, with only small amounts produced during the day. Flowers are produced all through the year, {{but there is a}} strong peak in autumn. Little else flowers within its range at this time, so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals. Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species, including a wide range of insects; many species of bird including Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater), Anthochaera carunculata (red wattlebird), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill) and Trichoglossus haematodus (rainbow lorikeet); and mammals such as Petaurus norfolcensis (squirrel glider), Petaurus breviceps (sugar glider), Acrobates pygmaeus (feathertail glider) and Pteropus poliocephalus (grey-headed flying fox). In some areas such as at Bungawalbin National Park in northern New South Wales, B.integrifolia is the only source of nectar and pollen in the autumn (March–April) and late winter (July). The importance of non-flying mammals to pollination of B.integrifolia was demonstrated in 1989, with a study in Wilsons Promontory National Park showing a reduction of fruit set when measures were taken to exclude them.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at <b>anthesis</b> to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of B.sessilis is an {{important}} component of the diet of a number of species of honeyeater. In one study, B.sessilis was found to be the main source of nectar for all six species studied, namely the tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), brown-headed honeyeater (Melithreptus brevirostris), and black honeyeater (Certhionyx niger). Moreover, B.sessilis played {{an important}} role in their distributions, with species that feed only on nectar occurring only where B.sessilis occurs, and remaining for longest at sites where B.sessilis is most abundant. Other honeyeaters that have been recorded feeding on B.sessilis include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), western wattlebird (A.lunulata), and New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae). Furthermore, a study of bird species diversity in wandoo woodland around Bakers Hill found that honeyeater species and numbers were much reduced in forest that lacked a Banksia sessilis understory; the plant is a key source of nectar and insects during the winter months. A field study in jarrah forest 9km south of Jarrahdale, where B. sessilis grows in scattered clumps, found that western wattlebirds and New Holland honeyeaters sought out groups of plants with the greatest numbers of new inflorescences, particularly those one or two days after <b>anthesis,</b> where nectar yield was highest. The birds likely recognises these by visual clues.|$|E
25|$|Once female <b>anthesis</b> {{is nearing}} its {{end and the}} female flowers have been pollinated, the spathe will be fully open and male <b>anthesis</b> begins. In the {{beginning}} of male <b>anthesis,</b> the fertile male flowers complete the process of producing the pollen and the female flowers become unreceptive to further pollination. Additionally, the spadix moves from its 45° position and presses up flush to the spathe. Towards the end of male <b>anthesis,</b> the spathe begins to close from the bottom, working its way up and forcing the beetles to move up and across the upper region of the spathe, where the fertile male flowers are located. In doing so, the philodendron controls when the beetles come and when they leave and forces them to rub against {{the top of the}} spadix where the pollen is located as they exit, thus ensuring they are well-coated with pollen. One would expect the beetles to stay indefinitely if they could due to the very favorable conditions the inflorescence provides. After male <b>anthesis,</b> the males will go off and find another philodendron undergoing female <b>anthesis,</b> so will pollinate the female flowers with the pollen it had collected from its previous night of mating.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is achieved by}} means of beetles, with many philodendron species requiring {{the presence of a}} specific beetle species to achieve pollination. The reverse is not always the case, as many beetle species will pollinate more than one philodendron species. These same beetles could also pollinate other genera outside of philodendron, as well as outside of the family Araceae. The pollinating beetles are males and members of the subfamily Rutelinae and Dynastinae, and to date the only beetles seen to pollinate the inflorescence are in the genera Cyclocephala or Erioscelis. Other smaller types of beetles in the genus Neelia visit the inflorescences, as well, but they are not believed to be involved in pollinating philodendrons. To attract the beetles, the sterile male flowers give off pheromones to attract the male beetles, usually at dusk. This process, female <b>anthesis,</b> is followed by male <b>anthesis,</b> in which the pollen is produced. Female <b>anthesis</b> typically lasts up to two days, and includes the gradual opening of the spathe to allow the beetles to enter. Some evidence suggest the timing of opening of the spathe is dependent on light levels, where cloudy, darker days result in the spathe opening up earlier than on clear days. During female <b>anthesis,</b> the spadix will project forward at roughly 45° relative to the spathe.|$|E
25|$|As in all Proteaceae, {{individual}} flowers {{consist of}} a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <b>anthesis.</b> In B.acuminata, the perianth is 24–25mm long, pale pink at the base and mauve above, with sticky hairs on the base. The pistil is 29–40mm long, and cream or pink in colour. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing a single winged seed.|$|E
25|$|Flowers {{occur in}} the {{dome-shaped}} head characteristic of B.ser. Dryandra. These occur {{at the end of}} branches or on short laterals, and consist of from 80 to 100 individual densely packed together and surrounded by a short involucre of narrow, tapering bracts. The hairless tips of these bracts are quite prominent; this is a distinctive characteristic of this species. As in all Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals fused with the anthers, and one long wiry pistil. The pistil end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <b>anthesis.</b> In B.fraseri, the perianth is 24–28 millimetres long, and pink to cream in colour; and the style 30–42mm long and cream-coloured. The fruit is a woody follicle firmly embedded in the woody base of the flower head, and usually containing two winged seeds. In this species each head may set an unusually large number of follicles.|$|E
25|$|Wheat {{normally}} needs between 110 and 130 days between sowing and harvest, {{depending upon}} climate, seed type, and soil conditions (winter wheat lies dormant during a winter freeze). Optimal crop management {{requires that the}} farmer have a detailed understanding of each stage of development in the growing plants. In particular, spring fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators are typically applied only at specific stages of plant development. For example, it is currently recommended that the second application of nitrogen is best done when the ear (not visible at this stage) is about 1cm in size (Z31 on Zadoks scale). Knowledge of stages {{is also important to}} identify periods of higher risk from the climate. For example, pollen formation from the mother cell, and the stages between <b>anthesis</b> and maturity are susceptible to high temperatures, and this adverse effect is made worse by water stress. Farmers also benefit from knowing when the 'flag leaf' (last leaf) appears, as this leaf represents about 75% of photosynthesis reactions during the grain filling period, and so should be preserved from disease or insect attacks to ensure a good yield.|$|E
500|$|The inflorescences are {{cream or}} yellow, and occur in domed heads [...] wide, {{situated}} {{at the end of}} a stem. Each head contains from 55 to 125 individual flowers, surrounded at the base by a whorl of short involucral bracts. As with most other Proteaceae, individual flowers consist of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <b>anthesis.</b> In B.sessilis the perianth is straight, [...] long, and pale yellow. The style is slightly shorter, also straight, and cream-coloured. Thus in B.sessilis, unlike many other Banksia species, the release of the style at <b>anthesis</b> does not result in a showy flower colour change. One field study found that <b>anthesis</b> took place over four days, with the outer flowers opening first and moving inwards.|$|E
500|$|Seeds with maximum {{germination}} potential develop (in C.moschata) by 45 {{days after}} <b>anthesis,</b> and seed weight reaches its maximum 70 days after <b>anthesis.</b> Some varieties of C.pepo germinate best with {{eight hours of}} sunlight daily and a planting depth of [...] Seeds planted deeper than [...] {{are not likely to}} germinate. In C.foetidissima, a weedy species, plants younger than 19 days old are not able to sprout from the roots after removing the shoots. In a seed batch with 90 percent germination rate, over 90 percent of the plants had sprouted after 29 days from planting.|$|E
500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} {{dome-shaped}} heads {{from three to}} four cm (1.2–1.6in) in diameter, growing {{at the ends of}} branches. They comprise 55 to 65 individual flowers, enclosed at the base by a whorl of short involucral bracts. As with most other Proteaceae, each flower consists of a perianth comprising four united tepals, and a single pistil, the style of which is initially enclosed within the limb of the perianth, but breaks free at <b>anthesis.</b> In B.cuneata, the perianth is about [...] long, with a limb of about [...] Prior to <b>anthesis,</b> the long thin perianth topped by a prominent limb resembles a matchstick, which explains one common name for this species. At first, the perianth is mostly cream, being pink only near its base; it later becomes pink throughout. The style is initially cream, but turns red; the pollen presenter is green.|$|E
500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} [...] "flower spikes", inflorescences {{made up of}} {{hundreds}} of flower pairs densely packed around a woody axis. Arising from short lateral branchlets off stems older than four years of age, the inflorescence of B.telmatiaea is roughly oval to cylindrical, with a height of 3–5cm (1–2in) and diameter of 4–7cm (1–2in). It contains between 500 and 900 golden brown to pale brown flowers, each of which consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at <b>anthesis.</b> The species generally flowers from April to August, although flowers have been observed as late as November. They take five to six weeks to develop from bud, then reach <b>anthesis</b> {{over a period of}} two weeks. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground.|$|E
500|$|The {{process of}} {{flowering}} takes 9–12 months; the stems begin developing microscopically in spring, with no visible evidence of flower spike development for around {{five months before}} the buds actually appear. Flower spikes are in bloom from May to December or January, peaking between July and October. The distinctive inflorescences arise from the ends of one-year-old branchlets. Squat and roughly cylindrical, they are [...] high and [...] wide. A field study on the southern sandplains revealed an average count of around 286 individual flowers on each spike. The white flower is covered in grey or pale brown fur, {{and there is little}} variation in colour. The style is generally scarlet, but can be dark red, orange or pink. The perianth is [...] long, while the style is [...] long and strongly [...] or looped until they are released at <b>anthesis.</b> <b>Anthesis</b> is acropetal, that is, the flowers open from the base up the spike to the apex.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the Banksia flower, with the style end functioning as a pollen presenter, suggests that autogamous self-fertilisation must be common. In many Banksia species, the risk of this occurring is reduced by protandry: a delay in a flower's receptivity to pollen until after its own pollen has lost its viability. There is dispute, however, over whether this occurs in B.prionotes: one study claimed to have confirmed [...] "protandrous development", yet recorded high levels of stigmatic receptivity immediately after <b>anthesis,</b> and long pollen viability, observations that are not consistent with protandry.|$|E
500|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Australian botanist Alex George placed B.sceptrum in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike shape, in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles, and in B.ser. Banksia because of its robust inflorescence and hairy pistil that is prominently curved before <b>anthesis.</b> He added that its follicles resembled those of Banksia ornata, while the [...] seed body resembled those of B. speciosa and B. baxteri, though its obovate, crinkled cotyledons suggested an affinity with the series Cyrtostylis.|$|E
500|$|Flowering {{takes place}} between September and January. The inflorescences hang {{down from the}} ends of three- to five-year-old branchlets deep within the shrub and measure [...] in length and roughly [...] in diameter. The flowers are cream at the base and deep pink to red in the upper half, and are {{brightest}} before <b>anthesis</b> and then gradually fade with age. The inflorescences eventually turn grey, the old flowers remaining as up to 25 large woody follicles develop. Oval in shape and covered with fine hair, the follicles can reach [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide.|$|E
500|$|Flowers {{occur in}} typical Banksia [...] "flower spikes", inflorescences {{made up of}} {{hundreds}} of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. B.browniis flower spike is a metallic red-brown colour, roughly cylindrical, 6 to 19 centimetres (2–7½in) high and eight to ten centimetres (3–4in) wide. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four united tepals, and one long wiry style. Perianths are cream at the base and grey-brown at the end. Styles are rusty red-brown with a cream tip, and downwardly hooked rather than straight. The style end is initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but breaks free at <b>anthesis.</b>|$|E
500|$|Appearing from October to December (late spring), {{the flowers}} occur in {{dome-shaped}} heads from [...] in diameter, growing {{at the ends}} of branches.

The individual flowers are more openly spaced than those of other banksias, and this is especially evident in late bud. This, coupled with the tall thin shape of the flower spike, makes the species quite distinctive. The flower spikes are pale- to golden brown in bud, and open to a more gold colour after <b>anthesis.</b> Variations are seen, one form having a grey limb in bud, and plants with particularly tall flower spikes have been recorded near Huskisson at Jervis Bay. As with most banksias, in <b>anthesis</b> the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top (...) [...] The process from bud to the finishing of flowering takes six to eight weeks.|$|E
500|$|The tall flower spikes, {{known as}} inflorescences, arise {{at the ends}} of {{vertical}} branches over November to January, and can be striking in appearance. They take 6–7 months to develop—longer than other members of the genus. Between [...] high and [...] wide, they are bright yellow and highly prominent. Flower opening (<b>anthesis)</b> takes place over 1–2 weeks, and proceeds up the flower spike. The ageing flowers turn grey and remain on the spike as the woody oval follicles develop. The infructescence—an old spike bearing follicles—is bulky with a [...] diameter. There are up to 50 follicles on each spike, each [...] long, [...] high and [...] wide. When new they are covered with dense grey fur, which wears off exposed areas.|$|E
500|$|Plants {{flower in}} early May and late June, and they fruit 6 to 10 weeks after flowering.

The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The flower parts are smooth and hairless. The pollen is crimson. After flowering, the [...] long woody seedpod develops. Cylindrical in shape, it splits down one side to release the seeds, which are ripe from February to June. They are arranged in two rows, with at least four seeds in each row. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself.|$|E
500|$|The inflorescences are {{generally}} globular and measure [...] in diameter, although larger forms, such as var. dolichostyla, are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour. They take {{five to eight}} weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. <b>Anthesis</b> takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence. Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce {{so much that it}} drips to the ground. The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike. Up to 60follicles develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring [...] long, [...] high, and [...] wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section. Specimens of var. sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range, Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of Nannup have larger follicles. The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure [...] in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring [...] long by [...] wide.|$|E
