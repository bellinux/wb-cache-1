5|$|Before the 1927 season, Paschal {{returned}} his playing contract unsigned {{because of a}} salary dispute. By that time, the Yankees were forming the nucleus of what became the Murderers' Row teams of the late 1920s. He signed for an estimated $8,000 ($ today), a 13% raise. In the season-opening win against the Athletics, right field starter Babe Ruth struck out twice <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> out, forcing Huggins to replace him with Paschal in the sixth inning. As the last man ever to pinch-hit for Ruth, Paschal singled. In one of his few starts of the 1927 season, Paschal was a single short of hitting for the cycle, and almost had three home runs. Replacing the injured Bob Meusel, Paschal hit two home runs, a triple that was yards shy of a home run, and a double which bounced off the right field stands during an 11–2 rout of the Indians. Paschal did not play in the Yankees' 1927 World Series victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall, he played in 50 games, primarily as a pinch hitter. After the season, Paschal was discussed as a trade for Boston Red Sox pitcher Red Ruffing, but discussions fell apart (Ruffing was later acquired in a proposed trade during the 1930 season).|$|E

Towards {{the end of the}} first half, England stretched their lead further. Lawrence Dallaglio made a break <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> the ball inside to Jonny Wilkinson, who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try.

He landed a nearly clean quadruple loop, nailed a quadruple Salchow-triple toe loop {{combination}} and triple Axel. On the free skating, Hanyu started strong with clean quadruple loop, followed by an equally flawless quadruple Salchow, but then fell on the second quadruple Salchow attempt, had an unsecure landing on a quadruple toe loop, <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> his final triple Lutz into a single. He was only third in the free skating, but his advantage after the short program allowed him to win his fourth straight Grand Prix title.|$|E

On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he did not know why Martin had suspended him.|$|E

500|$|The Cardinals {{were first}} to bat in the game. After {{giving up a}} double to Rogers Hornsby, Shocker got a groundout from Jim Bottomley to end the run-scoring threat. In the Yankees' half of the inning, Mark Koenig {{grounded}} into a double play, and Babe Ruth followed by striking out. The Cardinals threatened again in the second inning, after [...] singles by catcher Bob O'Farrell and shortstop Tommy Thevenow. However, Alexander came to the plate <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> up to Koenig to end the inning. The Yankees scored first {{in the bottom of}} the second inning. Bob Meusel hit a single into center field, and Lou Gehrig followed by hitting a grounder to Alexander, which advanced Meusel to second base. Tony Lazzeri then hit a single to left field that scored Meusel from second. Joe Dugan followed with a single of his own, moving Lazzeri to third base. On the following play, Yankees catcher Hank Severeid struck out, and Lazzeri then attempted to steal home plate. Alexander made an error on his throw to catcher Bob O'Farrell, and Lazzeri was able to slide into home plate for the second Yankees run of the inning. O'Farrell then threw the ball to Thevenow, but the tag was late and Dugan was called safe at second base. The inning ended when Alexander struck out Shocker.|$|E

2500|$|By 1735, {{the revival}} had spread <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> up {{independently}} across the Connecticut River Valley, and perhaps {{as far as}} New Jersey. [...] However, criticism of the revival began, and many New Englanders feared that Edwards had led his flock into fanaticism. Over the summer of 1735, religious fervor took a dark turn. A number of New Englanders were shaken by the revivals but not converted, and became convinced of their inexorable damnation. Edwards wrote that [...] "multitudes" [...] felt urged—presumably by Satan—to take their own lives. At least two people committed suicide {{in the depths of}} their spiritual distress, one from Edwards's own congregation—his uncle [...] Joseph Hawley II. It is not known if any others took their own lives, but the [...] "suicide craze" [...] effectively ended the first wave of revival, except in some parts of Connecticut.|$|E
2500|$|With Washington {{clinging}} to a 4-3 lead, Max Scherzer came in on short rest to pitch {{the top of the}} fifth inning for the Nationals – his first relief appearance since the 2013 American League Division Series, when he was with the Detroit Tigers – and quickly got two outs; Cubs officials in the stands later told the press that they were preparing for Scherzer to pitch three or four lockdown innings and preserve Washington′s lead late into the game. Then the inning took a bizarre turn and descended into disaster for Washington. Scherzer gave up consecutive singles to Willson Contreras and pinch-hitter Ben Zobrist and a bases-clearing double to Addison Russell that gave the Cubs a 5-4 lead. [...] The Nationals intentionally walked Jason Heyward, and then Scherzer struck out [...] second baseman Javier Báez for what should have been the third out. However, the third strike got past Wieters, and Báez ran to first on the passed ball. Rather than hold the ball at home to prevent the Cubs from scoring, Wieters tried to throw out Báez at first, and his throw went into right field, allowing Russell to score, Heyward to advance to third, and Báez to reach second, and giving Chicago a 6-4 lead. Wieters asked the umpires to declare the ball dead and the play a strikeout on the grounds of offensive interference, claiming Báez's bat had hit him {{in the back of the}} head on the backswing – a contention confirmed by video evidence – but the umpires made a controversial ruling that even if the bat had struck Wieters, it did not interfere with the play and did not merit a ruling that the ball was dead, and they let the play stand. Next, Cubs pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella reached first base on a catcher's interference call against Wieters, loading the bases, and Scherzer followed that by hitting Jon Jay in the foot with a pitch, sending him to first and forcing in Heyward from third to increase Chicago′s lead to 7-4. Kris Bryant returned to the plate as the tenth Cubs batter of the inning, <b>and</b> <b>popped</b> out on Scherzer′s 28th pitch to bring the shocking inning to a close. After the game, Cubs manager Joe Maddon described the inning as [...] "bizarro world," [...] and Scherzer said, [...] "I′m sure I′ve been in some crazy stuff before, but nothing like that." [...] It was the first time in recorded MLB history, a total of some 2.73 million half-innings, that an intentional walk, a passed-ball strikeout, catcher′s interference, and a hit batsman had ever occurred in a single half-inning.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Perimenopausal {{women are}} at high risk for pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (<b>POP)</b> <b>and</b> stress urinary incontinence (SUI) diseases. In the present study, the expression of VIP in the vaginal epithelium of 70 perimenopausal women was correlated with the severity of POP with or without SUI. Materials and Methods: Seventy biopsy specimens from the anterior vaginal epithelium were obtained from postmenopausal patients. Immunohistochemical labeling for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and hematoxylin and eosin staining were performed. The VIP innervation was then compared between eight patient groups. Semiquantitative analysis of VIP protein by Western blotting was performed and compared between the eight patient groups. Results: The results of the immunohistochemical study showed that the intensity of VIP-immunoreactivity (VIP-ir) in the eight groups was as follows (in decreasing order) : Control; POPI; POP II; POP II + SUI; POP III; <b>POP</b> IV <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> III + SUI; <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI. The intensity of VIP-ir was obviously weak and similar among the POP IV, <b>POP</b> III + SUI, <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI groups. This result was validated by the Western blotting analysis. The level of the VIP peptide also deceased in <b>POP</b> patients <b>and</b> was as follows (in decreasing order) : Control; POPI; <b>POP</b> II <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> II + SUI; <b>POP</b> III <b>and</b> POP III + SUI; <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV <b>and</b> <b>POP</b> IV + SUI. Conclusion: The present study found that reduced VIP innervation in the vaginal epithelium of the perimenopausal women was correlated with the severity of POP with or without SUI...|$|R
