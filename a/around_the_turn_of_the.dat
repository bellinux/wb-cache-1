5|$|Modern {{scholars}} have not shared {{the confidence of}} their Hellenistic counterparts, and today the Catalogue is {{generally considered to be}} a post-Hesiodic composition. Since Hesiod is supposed to have lived <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh century BCE, the Cyrene-Ehoie alone could guarantee that the poem was not his.|$|E
5|$|After the {{original}} Russian-Mongolian expeditions in the 1940s, Polish-Mongolian joint expeditions to the Gobi Desert began in 1963 and continued until 1971, recovering many new fossils, including new specimens of Tarbosaurus from the Nemegt Formation. Expeditions involving Japanese and Mongolian scientists between 1993 and 1998, {{as well as}} private expeditions hosted by Canadian paleontologist Phil Currie <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, discovered and collected further Tarbosaurus material. More than 30 specimens are known, including more than 15 skulls and several complete postcranial skeletons.|$|E

5|$|Architect Carl Frederik Stanley (1769–1805), {{educated in}} Copenhagen, spent some years in Norway <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. He did minor works for wealthy patrons {{in and around}} Oslo, but his major {{achievement}} was the renovation of the only seat {{of higher education in}} Christiania, the Oslo Katedralskole, completed in 1800. He added a classical portico to the front of an older structure, and a semi-circular auditorium that was sequestered by Parliament in 1814 as a temporary place to assemble, now preserved at Norsk Folkemuseum as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, Newton Heath {{pulled off}} a {{significant}} coup by persuading the Manchester Evening News {{to set up an}} office at Bank Street.

5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) {{presented a}} development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models {{in terms of}} nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail {{that it has been}} argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, after which logical positivism defined {{the field for}} several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Kommandøren {{was one of}} four passenger/cargo steamships {{built for}} Nordre Bergenhus Amts Dampskibe at Norwegian shipyards <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. The four ships were {{constructed}} to supplement four smaller vessels built decades earlier at British shipyards. In addition to Kommandøren, which was seen as the flagship of the company's fleet, Lærdal, Balder and Stavenes were built between 1876 and 1904. The company sailed on cargo/passenger routes in Western Norway. Kommandøren was the largest of the new-builds, and was considered the grandest of the company vessels.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Grosmont's early years, {{but that he was}} born at Grosmont Castle in Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales, and that he was born c. 1310, not <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century as {{previously}} held. According to his own memoirs, he was better at martial arts than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life. In 1330 he was knighted, and represented his father in parliament. The next year he is recorded as participating in a royal tournament at Cheapside.|$|E

50|$|In {{the hope}} of gaining broader support, the union {{affiliated}} to Robert Owen's Grand National Consolidated Trades Union. In 1834, it became {{an integral part of}} the Grand National, renaming itself as the National Building Guild. However, the Grand National soon collapsed, and the guild similarly dissolved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> 1834 and 1835. Despite this, several of the guild's affiliated survived.|$|R
5|$|Rebasing at Khartoum, No. 237 Squadron {{undertook}} regular reconnaissance, dive-bombing and strafing sorties during October and November 1940.

No.237 Squadron was partially re-equipped during January 1941, receiving some Westland Lysander Mk IIs, {{but most of the}} squadron continued operating Hardys.|$|E
5|$|Several {{short-lived}} {{buildings were}} later constructed {{on top of}} the motte. The first of these <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century was a banqueting house constructed by Lord Stafford. In 1808 Marquess of Landsdowne built a mansion in a Gothic style {{on top of the}} motte using some of the stone remains of the old keep; it became known as Landsdowne Castle, providing famous views across the town. Landsdowne Castle was pulled down in either 1815 or 1818, and most of the motte was subsequently flattened.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, Manchester {{has been}} {{regarded}} by {{sections of the}} international press, British public, and government ministers as being the second city of the United Kingdom.

However, it split into local unions in 1893, and ceased to operate nationally. In 1907, the Hull and District Builders' Labourers Union re-established the National Association, with twenty-five local unions joining, giving a membership of 2,866.|$|R

5|$|The city of Napa has {{historically}} not received as many wine country tourists as the cities north of it. A $300 million flood management project <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century {{to widen the}} Napa River and raise bridges prompted building developments. In the early 2000s, a large development was completed in the downtown area, {{as well as several}} hotels. Copia and the nearby Oxbow Public Market were two large developments also constructed around that time to increase tourist and media focus on the city of Napa.|$|E
5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset {{as it is in the}} rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|Although Oklahoma {{was not yet}} a state {{during the}} Civil War, the Tulsa area did see its share of fighting. The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions. In the years after the Civil War and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, the area along the Arkansas River that is now Tulsa was periodically home to or visited by a series of colorful outlaws, including the legendary Wild Bunch, the Dalton Gang, and Little Britches.|$|E

5|$|<b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, {{scholastic}} Greek organizations {{appeared on}} grounds. The university chapter of Phi Beta Kappa {{was founded in}} 1908, promoting scholarship in all fields of study. Different schools had specific honor and professional societies as well: Phi Delta Phi for the law department, Phi Rho Sigma for medicine, Kappa Delta Mu for chemistry, and many others. A chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering society, was founded in 1923, and Trigon Engineering Society was founded in 1924 as a local fraternity for engineering students. Trigon and Theta Tau dominated student government in the Engineering School during this time, often fielding competing candidates for student office. Likewise in the College, the University Party and the Cavalier Party were dominated by Lambda Pi and Skull & Keys, two Greek organizations.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the north}} of Norway to a fairly {{distinguished}} family, he soon became interested in politics and history. Starting his political career in the Liberal Party, he switched to the Labour Party <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century. He represented that party in the Bærum municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of Parliament, but served nonetheless as Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1935 to 1941. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, an action that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to an academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Both sources {{agree that}} Alfano imposed his {{position}} when he defeated the Camorra head, the capintesta Totonno 'o Pappagallo (The Parrot) – so-named for his beak parrot nose – in a zumpata – {{a kind of}} ritual initiation knife duel – {{despite the fact that}} his adversary sent his Mastino dog to attack Alfano. The conflict started when Pappagallo returned from prison and found Alfano in control of his former territory. Other sources mention that after the death of Cappuccio, Giuseppe Chirico, 'o Granatiere (The Grenadier), from the Porta San Gennaro neighbourhood was elected. He was defeated in a zumpata by Totonno 'o Pappagallo, who took over the reign before being defeated by Alfano <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century.|$|E
50|$|The {{union was}} founded <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> 1863 and 1864 by two miners: William Ball, {{and one other}} who died shortly after {{establishing}} the union. The union attracted hostility from mine owners, and members risked victimisation, so it initially operated secretively. Most of its early members had previously {{been part of a}} short-lived union established in 1844, but by 1866, the new union had only 300 members.|$|R
