40|$|Abstract: The {{antenna factor}} of the {{biconical}} antenna {{is a function}} of antenna height above a ground-plane. Variations in the antenna factor of up to 1. 9 dB are observed when the antenna is used in the typical height range of 1 m to 4 m on an open area test site (OATS). The magnitude of this variation depends on the impedance of the <b>antenna</b> <b>balun.</b> From the antenna factor simulations we have derived height correction factors which account for the coupling of biconical antennas above a groundplane. We have demonstrated with antenna calibration measurements what the simulated predictions show. The new method of height correction can be applied to all measurements with biconical antennas, when the balun impedance of the antenna is known. It removes the systematic error caused by the height dependence of the antenna factor. Examples are demonstrated for precision field strength measurements on an OATS, accuracy enhancement for antenna calibration according to the standard site method given in ANSI C 63. 5 and conversion of OATS antenna factors to free space antenna factors and vice-versa. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{wireless}} communication applications increase steadily, {{leading to the}} competition for currently allocated frequency bands. Pressure on authorities {{around the world to}} permit communications in higher and wider frequency ranges to achieve higher wireless capacity than those existed in the past has resulted in several new specifications. The federal communication commission (FCC) in USA has unleashed the band 3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz for ultra-wideband radio (UWB) communications. The release has triggered a worldwide interest for UWB. Other regulatory instances throughout the world have issued use of UWB techniques as well. Capacity issues in form of data rate and latency have always been a bottleneck for broadened wireless-communication usages. New communication systems like UWB require larger bandwidth than what is normally utilized with traditional antenna techniques. The interest for compact consumer electronics is growing in the meantime, creating a demand on efficient and low profile antennas which can be integrated on a printed circuit board. In this thesis, some methods to extend the bandwidth and other antenna parameters associated with wideband usages are studied. Furthermore, methods on how to enhance the performance when one antenna-element is not enough are studied as well. The principle of antenna parallelism is demonstrated using both microstrip patch antennas and inverted-F antennas. Several techniques to combine the antennas in parallel have been evaluated. Firstly, a solution using power-splitters to form sub-arrays that covers one 500 -MHz multi-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) UWB is shown in Paper I. It is then proposed that the sub-bands are selected with a switching network. A more convenient method is to use the later developed frequency multiplexing technique as described in Paper V and VIII. Using the frequency multiplexing technique, selective connection of any number of antennas to a common junction is possible. The characteristic impedance is chosen freely, typically using a 50 -Ω feed-line. Secondly, in Paper VIII a frequency-triplexed inverted-F antenna system is investigated to cover the Mode 1 multi-band UWB bandwidth 3. 1 - 4. 8 GHz. The antenna system is composed of three inverted-F antennas and a frequency triplexer including three 5 th order bandpass filters. In Paper VI a printed circuit board integrated-triplexer for multi-band UWB radio is presented. The triplexer utilizes a microstrip network and three combined broadside- and edge-coupled filters. The triplexer is fully integrated in a four metal-layer printed circuit board with the minimum requirement on process tolerances. Furthermore, the system is built completely with distributed microstrips, i. e., no discrete components. Using the proposed solution an equal performance between the sub-bands is obtained. Finally suitable monopoles and dipoles are discussed and evaluated for UWB. In Paper X circular monopole and dipole antennas for UWB utilizing the flex-rigid concept are proposed. The flex-rigid concept combines flexible polyimide materials with the regular printed circuit board material. The antennas are placed entirely on the flexible part while the antenna ground plane and the dipole <b>antenna</b> <b>balun</b> are placed in the rigid part...|$|E

The feed point of conventional balun structures is fixed {{at the top}} of the integrated balun, which makes it difficult to match to a 50 - feed.

The printed dipole with the hereby presented adjustable integrated balun maintains the broadband performance and exhibits flexibility for the matching to different impedance values, which is extremely important for the design of antenna arrays since the mutual coupling between antenna elements commonly changes the input impedance of each single element.

40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have placed a great {{emphasis on the}} design of broadband antennas as well as antenna miniaturization to cope with the demands of making electronic and handheld communication devices smaller and more efficient. In this thesis, the design and fabrication of a frequency independent antenna and a narrow-band planar microstrip Balun are presented. An analysis of frequency selective surfaces is also introduced in order to demonstrate their capability to miniaturize antenna thickness. Lastly, s-parameters measurements and efficiency characterization are performed to determine the radiation properties of surface mount chip inductors {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of using them as electrically small antennas. Two types of frequency independent antennas are considered due to their planar geometries, the Equiangular and Archimedean spiral antennas. Frequency independent antennas are radiating devices that have frequency independent impedance and pattern properties because their shape is specified only in terms of angles. The Balun is designed to meet the need of a feeding element for the Archimedean spiral <b>antenna.</b> A <b>Balun</b> is a three port device that connects an unbalanced transmission line such as a coaxial line to a balanced feed line such as the one required by two-arm spiral <b>antennas.</b> The <b>Balun</b> discussed in this work is designed to operate at 2. 4 GHz with a 200 MHz bandwidth and to transform the antenna input impedance to a 50 -ohm reference impedance. The main characteristics from this device that distinguish it from commercially available structures are its low cost, planarity, and compact footprint. The balancing capability of this Balun is shown by the close agreement between the measured and simulated results. Antennas can be potentially miniaturized in the z-direction by replacing the PEC ground plane separated from the antenna by a lambda / 4 thick substrate with a frequency selective surface (FSS) structure that allows the ground plane conductor to be in close proximity to the antenna without affecting its radiation performance.

40|$|The {{development}} of compact size reconfigurable harmonic suppressed antenna {{is crucial in}} today’s wireless communication system. One set of Harmonic Suppressed Antenna (HSA) and its reconfigurable configuration {{in the form of}} fractal dipole antenna that is integrated with the stubs and tapered balun has been designed and tested in this study. The Koch dipoles are double-sided structure while the tapered balun is triangular. Initial design is based on a 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole. The Koch dipole antenna has equal arm lengths of 128 mm. These are fabricated on a lossy FR- 4 material. Printed fractal dipole antenna is designed to operate at 670 MHz. This shows that the linear dipole can be miniaturized by employing Koch curve fractals onto the radiating structure. Fifteen bands reconfigurable antenna were designed to operate within 400 MHz to 3. 5 GHz. However, as the frequency of operation is a low microwave band, the antenna physical size is relatively large. Tapered balun thus significantly enlarged the antenna size. In addition, the far field radiation pattern resembles that of a linear dipole. The overall antenna is found to be large and has moderate gain and efficiency. Nevertheless, it can potentially have higher gain and higher efficiency {{with the use of a}} low loss Rogers RT/Duroid material. Thus, the study on the reduction of the tapered balun size is worthwhile. Four sets of wideband tapered baluns with reduced sizes have been designed and tested as a matching circuitry in all the designed <b>antennas.</b> All <b>baluns</b> are found to perform well in terms of scattering parameters and power loss, despite having sizes of 25 %, 50 % and 75 % smaller compared to the original structure. On the other hand, the feeding line method is also investigated. The first design takes into account of 38 � input impedance of the fractal curve while the second design is a direct connection from the 50 � SMA connector to terminal. The latter is then selected as it successfully eliminated the antenna’s higher order modes, while the former is suitable for designing an optimum typical dipole antenna. Both <b>antenna</b> and <b>balun</b> are fabricated on Rogers 4530 B. Four sets of HSA with reduced size have been designed and tested in this study. All sets were based on the 0. 9 GHz linear half-wavelength dipole and have equal arm lengths of 132 mm. These are named as MFDB, MFDB 75, MFDB 50 and MFDB 25. The antennas operate at 691 MHz with low return loss and successfully suppressed their two harmonic frequencies. The MFDB 25 antenna is found to exhibit similar performance in terms of the S-parameters and gain. It is also a compact antenna compared to the corresponding proposed HSA structure while the antenna achieved size reduction close to 19. 7 %, 31. 4 % and 43. 4 %. Hence, four sets of harmonic suppressed reconfigurable antennas named TMFDB, TMDB 75, TMFDB 50 and TMFDB 25 have been designed and simulated. The total numbers of switches are 56, 54, 54, and 50 units respectively. TMFDB 25 antenna is then fabricated and tested. It is found that the antenna has successfully configured 15 frequency bands and simultaneously suppressed higher order modes. The first prototype of an active TMFDB 25 antenna is fabricated to enhance the performance. The suitability of this antenna for space–limited application of future communication system such as cognitive radio has been demonstrated..

40|$|The {{potential}} {{applications such}} as satellite communication systems, critical military communications, radar warning systems and direction finding systems demand for high gain, uniform unidirectional radiation pattern and wideband antenna ranging from 3. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz. An Archimedean spiral antenna is the most potential candidate in the above mentioned applications as the antenna meets most of the above requirements. However, the practical implementation of spiral antenna is challenged by its bidirectional patterns, relatively low gain {{and the need for}} balanced feeding structures. A moveable ground plane is proposed as the backing technique of the spiral antenna by placing it at quarter wavelength behind spiral arms. Despite, the effects of the ground plane on the antenna’s wideband properties, to enable the realization of a conformal antenna without the loss of the antenna’s broadband characteristics, a radian sphere theory is proposed for bandwidth improvement. Microstrip to parallel strip line balun is proposed as the feeding structure of the spiral <b>antenna.</b> This <b>balun</b> has very large bandwidth ranging from 2 GHz to 14 GHz. However, the separation of the ground plane and the spiral arms at quarter wavelength at lower frequencies deteriorate the radiation patterns at middle and higher frequencies.

The optimized frequency selective surface improves the radiation pattern while maintaining the other parameters such as the gain, bandwidth and axial ratio.

Using these numerical solvers, design information such as the design of CPW bridges, aspect ratio of the double-y balun, and stub lengths of the CPW and CPS open and short stubs were studied. A dipole, along with the outer conductor of a coaxial line was modeled in NEC. The model was used to study the currents along the arms and feedline of balanced and unbalanced dipoles. Normalized amplitude patterns were generated along the azimuth and elevation planes for balanced and unbalanced dipoles. These patterns were used later for comparison with measured patterns. Experimental work was conducted to measure {{the performance of a}} double-y balun designed to feed a resistively loaded V-dipole. The performance of the balun was investigated via VSWR, insertion loss, and antenna pattern measurements. Antenna pattern measurements along the azimuth plane were conducted for a 5 cm dipole fed without a balun, a 5 cm dipole fed with the double-y balun, a 5 cm dipole fed with the sleeve balun, a 12 cm dipole fed without a balun, and a 12 cm dipole fed with the double-y balun. The dipoles fed without a balun were fed directly with a 50 W coaxial line. An optical link, consisting of a laser modulator (LM) unit and a laser receiver (LR) unit, was constructed to measure the patterns along the elevation plane of the above dipoles. Resulting patterns agreed closely with patterns generated with NEC models. In addition, the patterns of a resistively loaded V-dipole were measured along the E-plane using the optical link. The measured patterns for the V-dipole were compared with numerical results obtained from literature. The experimental work conducted in this research illustrates the improvement obtained in the patterns of a dipole and a resistively loaded V-dipole {{with the use of the}} double-y balun. Ph. D.
