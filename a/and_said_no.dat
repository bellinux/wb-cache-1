5|$|A committee, {{headed by}} Thorpe, was {{established}} to recruit employees and headquartered itself at Labor Hall. Throughout September and October, many employees began to join the union, but the Terminal and Traction Company responded by firing employees who joined and refused to recognize the union. After the failure of their initial attempt to have the union recognized by the company, the committee petitioned the United States Department of Labor to mediate discussions {{between them and the}} management of the business. On October 27, 1913, the department offered Ethelbert Stewart, head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to mediate. To begin negotiations, the workers' committee submitted a list of grievances to the company and Stewart. The company, however, refused his services, denied there was a labor problem <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> attempt at unionizing was being made. They insisted that only a small minority of workers were behind the troubles and alleged that it was outside influences behind the unionizing effort. In a later report, the Department of Labor claimed that had their offer of mediation been accepted, the subsequent strike and riot could have been averted.|$|E
500|$|Developments in Russia posed {{another set}} of issues for the monarchy. Tsar NicholasII of Russia was King George's first cousin and the two monarchs looked very much alike. When Nicholas was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the liberal Russian Government asked that the tsar and his family be given asylum in Britain. [...] The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion was hostile <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> [...] It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave Russia in any case. He {{remained}} and in 1918 {{he and his family}} were ordered killed by Lenin, the Bolshevik leader.|$|E
500|$|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was {{developed}} by Raven Software, who had developed multiplayer modes for several Call of Duty titles in the past, and executive produced by Infinity Ward. Development of the game began in early 2015, {{as a result of}} an online petition signed by fans of Modern Warfare. After it was brought to their attention, Activision approached Raven Software to remaster the game, to which Raven's studio director David Pellas recalled that [...] "not a single person at Raven turned away <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no.</b> It was a universal, [...] "yeah, we’re there."" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2005 {{the party}} {{confirmed}} {{its intention to}} maintain parliamentary independence from the Liberal Party. In 2007, leader Brendon Grylls stated that the party [...] "took a significant step <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> to a traditional coalition with the Liberal Party and will contest the (next, 2008) election as a stand-alone conservative party". Following the unexpected hung parliament produced by the election, the Nationals found themselves holding {{the balance of power}} in both houses of the Western Australian parliament, opting ultimately to support the Liberals without establishing with them a coalition of one political force.|$|E
2500|$|Some FPA members {{disputed the}} FPA's comments, {{including}} New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren, who wrote [...] "every reporter I've met {{who was in}} Gaza during [...] war says this Israeli/now FPA narrative of Hamas harassment is nonsense." [...] Haaretz interviewed many foreign journalists and found [...] "all {{but a few of}} the journalists deny any such pressure". They said Hamas's intimidation was no worse than what they got from the IDF, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> armed forces would permit reporters to broadcast militarily sensitive information; and that, furthermore, most reporters seldom saw Hamas fighters, because they fought from concealed locations and in places that were too dangerous to approach.|$|E
2500|$|A {{year after}} his trip with Bosanquet to North America, Johnson {{was part of a}} private team that toured New Zealand and Australia under the {{leadership}} of Lord Hawke in the 1902–03 season. Four years later, in the 1906–07 season, he went back to New Zealand with a MCC side composed of amateur players that played 11 first-class matches in a three-month period. These were his only experiences of international cricket, though Foot writes, in his history of Somerset cricket: [...] "It's well known that he was invited to go to Australia with the Warner-Douglas team" [...] of 1911–12. But, he adds, [...] "he thought hard about it, tried in vain to revise his business schedules <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> to likely fame." ...|$|E

2500|$|Texas {{formally}} declared independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2, 1836. The revolt {{was justified}} {{as necessary to}} protect basic rights and because Mexico had annulled the federal pact. The colonists maintained that Mexico had invited them {{to move to the}} country and they were determined [...] "to enjoy 'the republican institutions to which they were accustomed in their native land, the United States of America.'" [...] The declaration did not acknowledge that Mexico had attempted to incorporate some of their demands. The new Texas constitution specifically allowed slavery <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>no</b> free person of African descent could reside in the new country without Congress's consent. Many of the Tejanos left the fight after the declaration of independence as they were disappointed with the growing anti-Mexican rhetoric. Only Seguin's company remained in the Texian Army.|$|E
