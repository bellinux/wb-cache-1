5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as having all the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team can hit long balls up to him. He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E

5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in organic synthesis. For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> X-ray contrast agent.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{source of vitamin}} K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E

From 1980 {{until his death in}} 1995, Naranjo headed Castro's team of advisers. Castro also had a deep friendship with fellow revolutionary Celia Sánchez, who accompanied him almost everywhere during the 1960s, and controlled almost all access to the leader.

5|$|After {{a year of}} courtship, Wallace became {{engaged in}} 1864 to a young woman whom, in his autobiography, he would only {{identify}} as Miss L. Miss L. {{was the daughter of}} Lewis Leslie who played chess with Wallace. However, to Wallace's great dismay, she broke off the engagement. In 1866, Wallace married Annie Mitten. Wallace had been introduced to Mitten through the botanist Richard Spruce, who had befriended Wallace in Brazil and who was <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> friend of Annie Mitten's father, William Mitten, an expert on mosses. In 1872, Wallace built the Dell, a house of concrete, on land he leased in Grays in Essex, where he lived until 1876. The Wallaces had three children: Herbert (1867–1874), Violet (1869–1945), and William (1871–1951).|$|E
5|$|Hooper has all {{the main}} {{attributes}} to play as a striker, he is strong and can hold up the ball well. He is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> finisher, he {{has been described as}} being a 'penalty box striker'. However, he can also pass the ball well and this allows midfielders to play-off him. He has received praise since moving to Scotland. Newspaper The Daily Record described him as being one of the most skilled attackers in the SPL. They also said that he had shown that he could deal with the physical nature of the Scottish game, due to his ability to ride a challenge well.|$|E

5|$|Samaras is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dribbler. This {{is due to}} his skill, quick {{feet and}} agility. He uses this to his {{advantage}} as often goes on runs where he beats several opposition players. However, he can sometimes hold onto the ball for too long and get tackled. As well as his dribbling ability, he is quick which means he can beat players with his pace. He can also use his strength to beat players as well and is also able to use his creativity to set up goals for other players. While he was at Manchester City, Eriksson {{said that he would}} only retain him in the side if he stopped dribbling and running out wide. Eriksson said that he believed Samaras to be a good header of the ball and he had to stop believing he was like Ronaldinho if he was to become a good player.|$|E
5|$|Allan Cunningham sent seed of G.juniperina to England in 1820; it {{was grown}} there the {{following}} year. Baron Charles von Hügel grew the species in Vienna in 1831. It has been grown outdoors in southern England, particularly G. juniperina subspecies sulphurea. Grevillea juniperina adapts easily to cultivation and {{grows in a}} wide range of soils and aspects in locations with good drainage. Long-flowering, it attracts birds such as honeyeaters with its nectar. The prickly dense foliage is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> nesting site and shelter, particularly for smaller birds, such as finches. Many forms and hybrids have been commercially propagated and sold, some having more horticultural appeal than others. Low winter temperatures promote more prolific flowering and pruning promotes dense foliage. Plants are readily propagated by cuttings or seed, although propagation by cuttings is required to ensure the new plants have the same characteristics of the parent. Direct contact with the plant may cause a skin rash.|$|E
5|$|Several local {{politicians}} have proposed re-opening {{the line and}} either making it part of the Jæren Commuter Rail {{or part of the}} planned light rail in Greater Stavanger. Additionally, the Norwegian National Rail Administration has supported a future re-opening of the line. Estimates show that the line has a traffic potential for 600,000 passengers per year. In a proposal from the National Rail Administration, the Ålgård Line is seen as a possible branch of the commuter rail, with stations at Vagle, Figgjo, Kongeparken and Ålgård. Without making any investments to the Sørlandet Line, {{it would be possible to}} extend the two hourly services that terminate at Sandnes to Ålgård. Ålgård is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> location for a park and ride for European Route E39. However, the Ålgård Line would need a full upgrade, including new tracks, electric system and signaling. This would give a travel time from Ganddal to Ålgård of 10 to 12 minutes. The estimated cost of re-opening the line is NOK500 million. The Center Party has proposed converting the line to a bus lane. The borough council of Figgjo has voted to convert the line to a bicycle path, but this has been rejected by the National Rail Administration.|$|E

5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E
