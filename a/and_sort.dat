5|$|A mobile game, Inside Out: Thought Bubbles, was {{released}} on June 18, 2015 by Disney Mobile Games on Apple App Store, Google Play, Amazon Appstore, Windows Store and Windows Phone Store. Playing as Riley's emotions, players have to match <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> memory bubbles through 485 levels (as of May 2016) inspired by the film's locations.|$|E
5|$|Her Story is an {{interactive}} movie video game {{written and directed}} by Sam Barlow. It was released on 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS, and the following year for Android. In the game, players search <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> through a database of video clips from fictional police interviews, and use the clips to solve the case of a missing man. The police interviews focus on the man's wife, Hannah Smith, portrayed by British musician Viva Seifert.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} {{humanitarian response}} was immediate, {{and in some}} cases even overwhelming. Large numbers of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, helmet lights, knee pads, rain gear, and even football helmets were donated. The sheer quantity of such donations caused logistical and inventory control problems until drop-off centers were set up to accept <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> the goods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the city, assisted rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000meals over a ten-day period.|$|E

5|$|When he {{has trouble}} sleeping, Chris gets a {{prescription}} for sleeping pills. Kyle and his grandmother, Sheila (Colette Mann), later find Chris collapsed {{in the garden and}} Karl tells Chris to stop taking the sleeping pills. Chris ignores his advice and starts sleepwalking. Chris also has a series of one-night stands and gets two warnings at work from his new boss, Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). Chris is arrested when he punches Josh Willis, who spoke to a journalist about Chris and Hudson's relationship. Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) drives Chris to the prison, so he can see Hudson <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> things out. Hudson tells Chris that he cut off contact as he needed time to prepare himself for prison. Chris asks Hudson to give their relationship another go and he agrees. Chris keeps Hudson's incarceration a secret from his parents, so he is angered when Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) inadvertently reveals his secret to his mother, Patricia (Katerina Kotsonis). When Patricia is later arrested for theft, Chris learns that she is a gambling addict and Sonya knew.|$|E

30|$|Further {{studies show}} that the {{compaction}} rate of sample VII with finer particle size <b>and</b> poorer <b>sorting</b> is larger than that of sample VI with coarser particle size <b>and</b> better <b>sorting</b> under normal compaction condition, which accords with particle size <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> influencing sandstone mechanical compaction. However, when abnormally high pressure develops, the compaction rate of sample VII with a pressure coefficient of 1.4 is smaller than that of sample VI with a pressure coefficient of 1.2 in the undercompaction condition. Sandstone mechanical compaction is mainly controlled by abnormally high pressure, which does not accord with particle size <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> influencing mechanical compaction. Therefore, the control of abnormally high pressure on mechanical compaction is stronger than that of particle size <b>and</b> <b>sorting.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Scandinavian languages, by contrast, {{treat the}} {{characters}} with diacritics ä, ö and å as new and separate {{letters of the}} alphabet, <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> them after z. Usually ä is sorted as equal to æ (ash) and ö is sorted as equal to ø (o-slash). Also, aa, when used as an alternative spelling to å, is sorted as such. Other letters modified by diacritics are treated as variants of the underlying letter, with the exception that ü is frequently sorted as y.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2006, the Royal Mail {{lost its}} 350-year {{monopoly}} and the British postal market became fully open to competition. Competitors {{were allowed to}} collect <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> mail, and pass it to Royal Mail for delivery, a service known as downstream access. Royal Mail introduced pricing in proportion (PiP) for first and second class inland mail, whereby prices {{are affected by the}} size as well as weight of items. It also introduced an online postage service, allowing customers to pay for postage online.|$|E
25|$|Statistics New Zealand {{develops}} statistical classifications and standards, {{and works}} with the corresponding national statistical offices with such nations as Australia, the United States, and Canada. It conducts ongoing research regarding the viability of these standards. Since the early 2000s, it has begun using the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupation to describe {{a wide variety of}} jobs; for example, the code 111111 describes a chief executive or managing director, while the code 531111 describes a general clerk. By using standardized codes, high speed computers can sift <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> through large databases to produce summary reports.|$|E
50|$|Food grading {{involves}} the inspection, assessment <b>and</b> <b>sorting</b> of various foods regarding quality, freshness, legal conformity and market value. Food grading often occurs by hand, in which foods are assessed <b>and</b> <b>sorted.</b> Machinery {{is also used}} to grade foods, <b>and</b> may involve <b>sorting</b> products by size, shape and quality. For example, machinery can be used to remove spoiled food from fresh product.|$|R

25|$|Coordination {{games have}} been studied in {{laboratory}} experiments. One such experiment by Bortolotti, Devetag, and Ortmann was a weak-link experiment in which groups of individuals were asked to count <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> coins {{in an effort to}} measure the difference between individual and group incentives. Players in this experiment received a payoff based on their individual performance as well as a bonus that was weighted by the number of errors accumulated by their worst performing team member. Players also had the option to purchase more time, the cost of doing so was subtracted from their payoff. While groups initially failed to coordinate, researchers observed about 80% of the groups in the experiment coordinated successfully when the game was repeated.|$|E
25|$|Blavatsky {{had been}} {{diagnosed}} with Bright's disease and hoping the weather to be more conducive to her condition she took up the offer of the Society's Madras Branch to move to their city. However, in November 1882 the Society purchased an estate in Adyar, which became their permanent headquarters; a few rooms were set aside for Blavatsky, who moved into them in December. She continued to tour the subcontinent, claiming that she then spent time in Sikkim and Tibet, where she visited her teacher's ashram for several days. With her health deteriorating, she agreed to accompany Olcott on his trip to Britain, where he was planning to argue the case for Ceylonese Buddhism <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> out problems with the Society's London Lodge.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 2010, the plugin {{framework}} {{and the new}} library system called Alexandria were announced. Both were completely rewritten as a distributed architecture with a REST HTTP/XML API opposed to the old monolithic one, less customizable. These were released with a new Plex version called Plex/Nine on August 30, 2010. The advantages of the new library {{is the ability to}} scan <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> the media even if the websites adding additional metadata and content are down. If the user had a custom filename layout organization, he can write his own parser. Parsers work exactly like Plex plugins using the new plugin framework with XPath parsing and Unicode support. The old Plex/Eight used the old XBMC scrapers which used regex encoded in XML which is considered much harder to program.|$|E

25|$|After {{the crowd}} (perhaps accidentally) toppled {{one of the}} Angels' motorcycles, the Angels became even more aggressive, {{including}} toward the performers. Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane jumped off the stage to try <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> out the problem, only to be punched {{in the head and}} knocked unconscious by an Angel during the band's set, as seen in the documentary film Gimme Shelter. When Jefferson Airplane guitarist Paul Kantner sarcastically thanked the Angels for knocking the singer out, one of the bikers took hold of a microphone and argued with him about it. The Grateful Dead had been scheduled to play between Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the Rolling Stones, but after hearing about the Balin incident from Santana drummer Michael Shrieve, they refused to play and left the venue, citing the quickly degenerating security situation.|$|E
25|$|The same {{as regular}} {{quicksort}} except the pivot {{is replaced by}} a buffer. First, read the M/2 first and last elements into the buffer <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> them. Read the next element from the beginning or end to balance writing. If the next element is less than the least of the buffer, write it to available space at the beginning. If greater than the greatest, write it to the end. Otherwise write the greatest or least of the buffer, and put the next element in the buffer. Keep the maximum lower and minimum upper keys written to avoid resorting middle elements that are in order. When done, write the buffer. Recursively sort the smaller partition, and loop to sort the remaining partition. This is a kind of three-way quicksort in which the middle partition (buffer) represents a sorted subarray of elements that are approximately equal to the pivot.|$|E
25|$|Triage in a multi-scale destruction, disaster, catastrophic, {{casualty}} event, such as {{following a}} tornado or {{an explosion in}} a populated area, first responders follow a similar triage category scale as the US military. The civilian medical industry uses a similar system for triage. Normally medical personnel aren't immediately available on scene. First responders are usually {{the first to arrive}} on scene. They could be police, fire rescue, paramedics, or community individuals with disaster training (CERT certified). They are trained to perform first aid, basic life saving and rescue techniques while performing the greatest good, for the greatest number of people. They will rapidly classify victims <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> them into 4 categories, treating quickly as they go. This system is intended to rapidly identify and classify victims for arriving transport or advanced care medical personnel such as doctors and nurses. The local National Guard and other military units responding would be using the military system of triage rather than civilian.|$|E

25|$|The Romanovs {{were placed}} in the Napolnaya School, on the fringe of the town. The school was small, {{consisting}} of only six rooms, the furniture basic but scanty. Each prisoner received an iron bed. They were allowed to move into the desolate former schoolrooms <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> out their living arrangements on their own. Grand Duke Sergei shared a room with Feodor Remez and Prince Paley. Although the captives were under the strict guard of the Red Army soldiers, they were allowed to walk in town, to talk to people and to go to church on feasts days. Preparing to spend a long time in Alapayevsk, they planted flowers and vegetable gardens near the school and spent many hours working there. On rainy days, the Romanovs read Russian novels to each other. Gradually, the regimen toughened and they were forbidden to take walks. The school was encircled with a barbed-wire fence and small trenches. Two weeks later, they were murdered.|$|E
25|$|During the week-long clashes that {{occurred}} {{at the beginning of}} May 2008 in Beirut and other regions of the country, the army was unable to prevent rival Lebanese groups from fighting each other. This was because the army, along with the government, had thought {{it would have been better}} if rival groups would eventually end the violence <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> out the dispute between them, alone, other than involving the national army which may have led to great divisions between the soldiers, just like in the civil war. It would have also caused an out cry to the soldiers that could have died, leading to even greater divisions and blame to the political forces. However, whenever ceasefire was brought into action in a specific area or district in Beirut or else where in the country, the LAF would straight away enforce peace. On May 13, the national army had announced that if the clashes would not end as soon as possible, it would have to intervene and use force if necessary to stop them.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search <b>and</b> <b>sort</b> through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E
