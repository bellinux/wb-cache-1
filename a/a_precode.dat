40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} space-time block codes (STBCs) to {{broadcast}} the common information omnidirectionally {{in a massive}} MIMO downlink. To reduce {{the burden of the}} downlink channel estimation and achieve partial spatial diversity from base station (BS) transmit antennas, we propose channel-independently precoded low-dimensional STBC. The precoding matrix and the signal constellation in the low-dimensional STBC are jointly designed to guarantee omnidirectional coverage at any instant time and sufficiently utilize the power amplifier capacities of BS transmit antennas, and at the same time, achieve the full diversity of the low-dimensional STBC. Under this framework, several designs are presented. To provide transmit diversity order of two, <b>a</b> <b>precoded</b> Alamouti code is proposed, which has a fast symbol-wise maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding. To provide transmit diversity order of four, three types of STBCs are proposed, being referred to as precoded orthogonal STBC (OSTBC), precoded quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC), and precoded coordinate interleaved orthogonal design (CIOD), respectively.

30|$|For multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{systems with}} {{available}} channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side, techniques based on singular value decomposition (SVD) efficiently exploit spatial diversity[2]. However, the MIMO-SVD approach {{suffers from the}} high complexity of the operations required to compute and proceed the precoding and postcoding matrices at the transmitter and receiver sides. Other precoding schemes have thus been introduced, providing suboptimal but simpler solutions {{to the design of}} MIMO systems using CSI at the transmitter. In 1999, Lo proposed <b>a</b> <b>precoding</b> system referred to as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) that relies on the matched filter applied at the transmitter side[3]. In 2003, a technique called equal gain transmission (EGT) was introduced, allowing transmission with a unitary gain on every link[4]. In this latter case, precoding only consists of a phase rotation and thus avoids any power imbalance between the signals propagated by each antenna.

40|$|Abstract — Multicasting is {{the general}} method of {{conveying}} the same information to multiple users. For multicasting appli-cations over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, it is of great importance {{to ensure that all}} users experience an adequate level of performance while utilizing the transmit diversity available in MIMO channels. One technique, called max-min beamforming, provides a way to increase the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the worst-case user. However, due to its limited degrees of freedom, this method suffers severe performance degradation when the number of users increases. Alternatively, space-time codes can be employed to transmit data simultaneously to all users. By introducing additional degrees of freedom in the time domain, open-loop orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) schemes achieve better performance than max-min beamforming when the number of users is large. In this paper, <b>a</b> <b>precoded</b> OSTBC scheme is proposed that optimizes the performance of the worst-case user.
