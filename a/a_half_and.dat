The ship helped to sink another German submarine before she was transferred to the English Channel to protect convoys during the Normandy landings. Forester assisted in sinking a German submarine before returning to the North Atlantic for a few months. The ship was under repair {{for the first half of}} 1945 and was then reduced to reserve in November before being scrapped in early 1946.|$|E

Although he remained otherwise in good health this was a sign of his increasing age, and the disabilities that came with it began to affect his judgments as well. While speaking at Cumberland Lodge in 1980 he forgot the details of the case, something shocking for a judge noted for his excellent memory.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is based}} on the same {{technology}} that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took almost a year and <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won a number of awards from a variety of gaming publications, and the series has continued with the releases of sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 in 2002, Unreal Tournament 2004 in 2004, and Unreal Tournament 3 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|A {{turning point}} of the game came on the first {{possession}} of the second half. The Giants received the second half kickoff, and led a short drive that stalled at their own 47-yard line. On fourth and 1, the Giants lined up in a punt formation before shifting to a traditional set. Second string quarterback Jeff Rutledge then looked over to Parcells for a signal {{as to whether he}} should try to draw the defense offside or run a play. After a nod of approval from Parcells, he ran a quarterback sneak for a first down. The Giants scored on the drive, and built a 39–13 lead before a late touchdown by the Broncos made the final score 39–20. Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro and Phil McConkey to give him three on the game, and Joe Morris and Ottis Anderson each rushed for one touchdown. The Giants' defense limited the Broncos to only two net yards and 10 offensive plays in the third quarter. The 30 second half points set a Super Bowl-record for points in <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> Simms was named MVP after completing 22 of 25 (88%) of his passes—a Super Bowl record which still stands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1969 Torrijos went to Mexico on holiday. A coup was {{launched}} in his absence, in which Noriega's loyalty allowed Torrijos {{to hang on to}} power, greatly enhancing Torrijos's image. Torrijos promoted Noriega to the position of lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence in August 1970: Noriega had gone from being a captain to a lieutenant colonel in just a year and <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> according to Dinges, had left his undisciplined past behind him. Torrijos retained power as a military ruler until 1981: during this time he negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, which ensured that control over the Panama Canal would pass to Panama in 1999. These treaties, as well as a new labor code that included maternity leave, collective bargaining rights, and bonus pay, made Torrijos popular in Panama despite the absence of democratic elections. Galván writes that Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic; Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary. Noriega would provide intelligence, and carry out covert operations, that were critical to Torrijos successfully negotiating the release of the Panama Canal from the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Mainer's first {{recordings}} came in 1934 and are compiled on Ragged But Right: 30's Country Bands. Mainer {{performed with}} The Mountaineers on tracks such as Maple on the Hill, Seven and <b>a</b> <b>Half</b> <b>and</b> Johnson's Old Grey Mule. Also {{included on the}} compilation are Mainer's later collaboration Short Life and It's Trouble with Zeke Morris, his solo effort Riding on That Train 45 and a sample song Mitchell Blues from his band the Sons of the Mountaineers. Throughout his career, he was noted for his unique and innovative two-finger banjo fingerpicking style, which some view as a precursor to three finger bluegrass banjo styles. Mainer took jobs at local radio stations to increase the visibility of his relative's ensemble, recording classics such as Take Me in the Lifeboat. During this time, he appeared on many regional stations including WBT in Charlotte, WPTF in Raleigh, WNOX in Knoxville and WPAQ in Mount Airy.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August, the Scottish Parliament met {{to settle}} {{religious}} issues. Knox {{and five other}} ministers were called upon {{to draw up a}} new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved. A week later, the Parliament passed three acts in one day: the first abolished the jurisdiction of the Pope in Scotland, the second condemned all doctrine and practice contrary to the reformed faith, and the third forbade the celebration of Mass in Scotland. Before the dissolution of Parliament, Knox and the other ministers were given the task of organising the newly reformed church or the Kirk. They would work for several months on the Book of Discipline, the document describing the organisation of the new church. During this period, in December 1560, Knox's wife, Margery, died, leaving Knox to care for their two sons, aged three and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> two years old. John Calvin, who had lost his own wife in 1549, wrote a letter of condolence.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 1986, {{both women}} entered Alford pleas for the Salmonella attack {{and the other}} charges, and {{received}} sentences ranging from three to twenty years, to be served concurrently.

Both Sheela and Puja were released on parole early for good behavior, after serving twenty-nine months of their sentences in a minimum-security federal prison. Sheela's Green Card was revoked; she moved to Switzerland. She remarried there and went on to run two nursing homes in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Rymdkapsel is a 2013 minimalist {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} by indie developer Grapefrukt, the studio of Martin Jonasson. Players build {{a space station}} using tetromino pieces while managing resources and minions, defending against attacks, and extending the base towards four monoliths {{at the edges of}} the level. The game was built over a year and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> was inspired by the base-building aspects of the Command & Conquer series. It was Jonasson's first full game as an indie developer. Rymdkapsel was released on May 7, 2013 for PlayStation Mobile, and was later ported to iOS, Android, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. Reviewers gave the game generally favorable reviews, where they appreciated its simplicity and challenge, but not its brevity and slow start.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>and</b> 25 who had lived in the colony for at least six months. The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942. Part-time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55, with a small number of exceptions for those in reserved occupations. On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), {{in a manner similar to}} the Article XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E

The rear of the EEF was to be attacked by the Ottoman 16th Division, {{at a point where}} the road from Khan Yunis to Gaza crossed the Wadi Ghuzze, and by the Beersheba Group which was to advance via Shellal, to attack Khan Yunis.|$|E
