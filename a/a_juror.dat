5|$|If {{the trial}} judge erroneously permits the {{striking}} of <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> under Batson, and the error is preserved, the only remedy is automatic reversal. If {{the trial judge}} erroneously prevents the striking of <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> under Batson, and the juror is seated, the Constitution permits a jurisdiction to utilize harmless error analysis. The race of the defendant is irrelevant to a Batson claim. Batson also permits the prosecutor to challenge defense peremptory strikes ("reverse Batson"). And, Batson applies equally to race and gender.|$|E

5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship exposure to forensic crime television has on <b>a</b> potential <b>juror’s</b> willingness {{to find a}} suspect guilty when presented with a case involving only circumstantial and eyewitness evidence. This study also looks at <b>a</b> potential <b>juror’s</b> expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial based upon this exposure. To better understand these relationships, the study utilized social constructionism as the theoretical framework. To collect data, an original survey instrument that included either a violent or non-violent crime scenario was developed. Reponses from 1572 undergraduate students were analyzed to better understand what might influence their willingness to find a suspect guilty and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial. The results indicate that viewership of forensic crime television does not significantly influence <b>a</b> potential <b>juror’s</b> decision to find a suspect guilty or not guilty. After controlling for viewership, {{it appears that the}} number of justice-based classes completed by the potential juror does influence their decision to find the suspect guilty. The analysis also shows that gender and the type of scenario (violent versus non-violent) may influence <b>a</b> <b>juror’s</b> willingness to find a suspect guilty. It does not appear that there is a correlation between <b>a</b> <b>juror’s</b> willingness to find a suspect guilty and their expectation of forensic evidence being presented at trial...|$|R

5|$|On 5 November 2013, TROS {{announced}} that they would publish {{the name of the}} Dutch entrant on 25 November.

Also reported was that Waylon, runner-up in the first series of Holland's Got Talent in 2008, would represent the Netherlands with a song written by DeLange.

5|$|In September 1987, Alan Parker {{was given}} a copy of Gerolmo's script by Orion's {{executive}} vice president and co-founder, Mike Medavoy. When Parker traveled to Tokyo, Japan to act as <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> for the 1987 Tokyo International Film Festival, his colleague Robert F. Colesberry began researching the time period, and compiled books, newspaper articles, live news footage and photographs related to the 1964 murders. Upon returning to the United States, Parker met with Colesberry in New York and spent several months viewing the research. The director also began selecting the creative team; the production of Mississippi Burning reunited Parker with many of his past collaborators, including Colesberry, casting directors Howard Feuer and Juliet Taylor, director of photography Peter Biziou, editor Gerry Hambling, costume designer Aude Bronson-Howard, production designer Geoffrey Kirkland, camera operator Michael Roberts, and music composer Trevor Jones.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E

5|$|In post-trial analyses, {{blame for}} the outcome varied. Mamie Till Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost {{exclusively}} from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a noblesse oblige toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those {{in the eastern part}} of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant, for the fear that such <b>a</b> <b>juror</b> would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this was a mistake, as anyone who had personally known the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, acquiesced and voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. But two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense's case. They said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.|$|E
