50|$|VAMTOX {{systems have}} a system of valves and dampers that direct the methane flow across the ceramic bed. On system start up, the system preheats and raises the {{temperature}} of the heat exchange material in the oxidizer bed to or above the <b>auto-oxidation</b> temperature of methane (1,000 °C or 1,832 °F). Then the preheating system is turned off and mine exhaust air is introduced. When the methane-filled air reaches the preheated bed, it oxidizes and releases heat. This heat is transferred to the bed, thereby maintaining its temperature to support continued operation. The oxidation process is flameless. Once the bed is preheated, the process needs no auxiliary energy so long as adequate inflow methane concentrations are maintained. The VAMTOX system exhaust gases can be used to raise steam, which can provide electrical power through a turbine generator.|$|E

Methane is a greenhouse gas and, when oxidized via thermal combustion, is chemically altered to form CO2 and H2O. CO2 is 25 times less potent than methane when emitted into the atmosphere with regards to global warming. Concentrations of methane in mine ventilation exhaust air of coal and trona mines are very dilute; typically below 1% and often below 0.5%. VAMTOX units have a system of valves and dampers that direct the air flow across one or more ceramic filled bed(s). On start-up, the system preheats by raising {{the temperature of the}} heat exchanging ceramic material in the bed(s) at or above the <b>auto-oxidation</b> temperature of methane , at which time the preheating system is turned off and mine exhaust air is introduced. Then the methane-filled air reaches the preheated bed(s), releasing the heat from combustion.

50|$|Vinblastine may be {{isolated}} from the Madagascar Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus), along with several of its precursors, catharanthine and vindoline. Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding <b>auto-oxidation</b> have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16’S, C14’R stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine. Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20. The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps. In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed {{by a series of}} cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry. The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%. Stereochemistry is controlled through a mixture of chiral agents (Sharpless catalysts), and reaction conditions (temperature, and selected enantiopure starting materials).|$|E

50|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} to {{terminate}} the oxidation reactions taking place due to different weathering conditions and reduce the degradation of organic materials. For example, synthetic polymers react with atmospheric oxygen. Organic materials undergo auto-oxidizations due to free radical chain reaction. Oxidatively sensitive substrates will react with atmospheric oxygen directly and produce free radicals. Free radicals are of different forms, consider organic material RH. This material reacts with oxygen to give free radicals such as R•, RO•, ROO•, HO•1. These free radicals further react with atmospheric oxygen to produce more and more free radicals. For example, R• + O2 → ROO• ROO• + RH → ROOH + R• 1This can be terminated by using antioxidants. Then this reaction comes to,2R• → R - RROO• + R• → ROOR2ROO• → Non-radical products1Weathering of polymers is caused by absorption of UV lights, which results in, radical initiated <b>auto-oxidation.</b> This produces cleavage of hydro peroxides and carbonyl compounds. This {{is because of the}} weak bond in hydro peroxides which is the main source for the free radicals to initiate from. Homolytic decomposition of hydro peroxide increases the rate of free radicals production1. Therefore, it is important factor in determining oxidative stability. The conversion of peroxy and alkyl radicals to non-radical species terminates the chain reaction, thereby decreasing the kinetic chain length.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{difficulties}} with blood substitutes based on hemoglobin (Hb) solutions is the <b>auto-oxidation</b> of the hemes, a problem aggravated by the dimerization of Hb tetramers. We have employed a method to study the oxyHb tetramer-dimer equilibrium based on the rate of <b>auto-oxidation</b> {{as a function of}} protein concentration. The 16 -fold difference in dimer and tetramer <b>auto-oxidation</b> rates (in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7. 0, 37 degrees C) was exploited to determine the fraction dimer. The results show a transition of the <b>auto-oxidation</b> rate from low to high protein concentrations, allowing the determination of the tetramer-dimer dissociation coefficient K 4, 2 = [Dimer] 2 /[Tetramer]. A 14 -fold increase in K 4, 2 was observed for addition of 10 mM of the allosteric effector inositol hexaphosphate (IHP). Recombinant hemoglobins (rHb) were genetically engineered to obtain Hb with a lower oxygen affinity than native Hb (Hb A). The rHb alpha 2 beta 2 [(C 7) F 41 Y/(G 4) N 102 Y] shows a fivefold increase in K 4, 2 at pH 7. 0, 37 degrees C. An atmosphere of pure oxygen is necessary in this case to insure fully oxygenated Hb. When this condition is satisfied, this method provides an efficient technique to characterize both the tetramer-dimer equilibrium and the <b>auto-oxidation</b> rates of various oxyHb. For low oxygen affinity Hb equilibrated under air, the presence of deoxy subunits accelerates the <b>auto-oxidation.</b> Although a full analysis is complicated, the <b>auto-oxidation</b> studies for air equilibrated samples are more relevant {{to the development of a}} blood substitute based on Hb solutions. The double mutants, rHb alpha 2 beta 2 [(C 7) F 41 Y/(G 4) N 102 A] and rHb alpha 2 beta 2 [(C 7) F 41 Y/(E 10) K 66 T], show a lower oxygen affinity and a higher rate of oxidation than Hb A. Simulations of the <b>auto-oxidation</b> rate versus Hb concentration indicate that very high protein concentrations are required to observe the tetramer <b>auto-oxidation</b> rate.

B 5, where 5 represents the percentage of biodiesel present. Biodiesel is composed of varying fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) % and these percentages are dependent on feedstock origin. FAMEs in biodiesel are composed of varying chain length and degrees of unsaturation. FAMEs have a propensity to autooxidise which increases fuel viscosity and introduces new species into the fuel cycle. Chromatography and mass spectrometry have been applied {{to the analysis of}} rapeseed methyl ester (RME) and auto-oxidised RME. The benefits and disadvantages have been discussed, with each technique aiding the analysis. This research has demonstrated the complexity of RME <b>auto-oxidation</b> and the necessity of several techniques for analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has provided information on small chain RME degradation products and FAMEs and supports <b>auto-oxidation</b> via homolytic ?-scission and Russell mechanism <b>auto-oxidation</b> pathways.

C 18 : 0 :methyl cis- 9, 10 epoxystearate has been suggested to be a useful comparison to identify extent of autooxidation. However, further studies are required in RME of known <b>auto-oxidation</b> age, followed by application of RME of unknown autooxidation age and other feedstocks. Also, investigated here is the use of electrochemistry coupled to a TOF-MS to investigate forced oxidation. Using electro chemistry positive ion ESI-MS, oxidation of RME has been shown to closely mimic <b>auto-oxidation</b> observed in natural <b>auto-oxidation</b> and forced oxidation studies. However, does not force oxidation through an epoxide route. Oxidation of RME using electrochemical techniques demonstrates a number of <b>auto-oxidation</b> products identified in natural and forced oxidation, further supporting the presence of autooxidation routes other than the epoxide route. Electrochemical oxidation was completed in minutes compared to forced oxidation (days) and natural <b>auto-oxidation</b> (years), potentially lending itself to be a quick screening technique for oxidation inhibitors. Chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques have also been applied to the analysis of samples of a polyisobutylene (PiB) type dispersant synthesis. The resulting samples and starting reagents were not suitable to be analysed via other techniques due to the insolubility of these PiB type compounds in MeOH, MeCN and DCM. This analysis was completed to investigate the presence of a vinylimidazole graft on a PiB succinimide. The aim of the synthesis was to produce a multiply vinylimidazole grafted PiB succinimide. Analysis completed using positive ion ESI-supercritical fluid chromatography-ultraviolet MS has demonstrated this is not the case.
