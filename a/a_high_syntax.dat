40|$|The {{long-term}} {{outcome of}} percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG) for unprotected left main coronary artery disease (ULMCAD) remains to be investigated. We identified 1, 005 patients with ULMCAD of 15, 939 patients with first coronary revascularization enrolled in the CREDO-Kyoto PCI/CABG Registry Cohort- 2. Cumulative 3 -year incidence of a composite of death/myocardial infarction (MI) /stroke was significantly higher in the PCI group than in the CABG group (22. 7 % vs 14. 8 %, p = 0. 0006, log-rank test). However, the adjusted outcome was not different between the PCI and CABG groups (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 30, 95 % confidence interval [CI 0. 79 to 2. 15, p = 0. 30). Stratified analysis using the SYNTAX score demonstrated that risk for a composite of death/MI/stroke was not different between the 2 treatment groups in patients with low (< 23) and intermediate (23 to 33) SYNTAX scores (adjusted HR 1. 70, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 3. 76, p = 0. 19; adjusted HR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 37 to 1. 99, p = 0. 72, respectively), whereas in patients with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score (≥ 33), it was significantly higher after PCI than after CABG (adjusted HR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 5. 16, p = 0. 006). In conclusion, risk of PCI for serious adverse events seemed to be comparable to that after CABG in patients with ULMCAD with a low or intermediate SYNTAX score, whereas PCI compared with CABG {{was associated with a}} higher risk for serious adverse events in patients with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The SYNTAX {{score was}} {{introduced}} to measure the complexity of coronary artery disease. Although <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score is indicative of a worse long-term outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), it remains unclear whether {{it is also true}} for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: We analyzed 200 consecutive CABG patients who underwent operations in 2002. Demographic and intraoperative data, perioperative outcomes, and 5 -year outcomes were obtained. The SYNTAX score was calculated retrospectively by reviewing the original diagnostic angiograms. After excluding patients who had undergone CABG or PCI treatment within 6 months before surgery, we included 154 patients in the study. Patients were partitioned into tertiles according to the SYNTAX score (low, 18 - 26; high, > 26). Cox regression analysis was used to identify baseline and procedural predictors for the combined end point of 5 -year major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and its components. Cumulative event rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age was 66. 6 +/- 8. 5 years, the mean ejection fraction was 56. 4...|$|E
40|$|Childhood obesity {{coincides with}} {{increased}} numbers of circulating classical CD 14 ++CD 16 - and intermediate CD 14 ++CD 16 + monocytes. Monocytes are {{key players in}} the development and exacerbation of atherosclerosis, which prompts the question as to whether the monocytosis in childhood obesity contributes to atherogenesis over the years. Here, we dissected the monocyte gene expression profile in childhood obesity using an Illumina microarray platform on sorted monocytes of 35 obese children and 16 lean controls. Obese children displayed a distinctive monocyte gene expression profile compared to lean controls. Upon validation with quantitative PCR, we studied the association of the top 5 differentially regulated monocyte genes in childhood obesity with obesity and complexity of coronary atherosclerosis (SYNTAX score) in a cohort of 351 adults at risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease. The downregulation of monocyte IMPDH 2 and TMEM 134 in childhood obesity was also observed in obese adults. Moreover, downregulation of monocyte TMEM 134 was associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> atherosclerosis score in adults.

40|$|Background We {{need new}} {{biomarkers}} that can predict cardiovascular disease to improve both diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. The CIRCULATING CELLS {{study was designed}} to study the role of several cellular mediators of atherosclerosis as biomarkers of coronary artery disease (CAD). An objective and reproducible method for the quantification of CAD extension is required to establish relationships with these potential biomarkers. We sought to analyse the correlation of the SYNTAX score with known CAD risk factors to test it as a valid marker of CAD extension. Methods and results A subgroup of 279 patients (67. 4 % males) were included in our analysis. Main exclusion criteria were a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical revascularisation that prevent an accurate assessment of the SS. Diabetes mellitus, smoking, renal insufficiency, body mass index and a history of CAD and myocardial infarction were all positively and strongly associated with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score after adjustment for the non-modifiable biological factors (age and sex). In the multivariate model, age and male sex, along with smok- ing and renal insufficiency, remain statistical significantly associated with the SYNTAX score. Conclusion In a selected cohort of revascularisation-naive patients with CAD undergoing coronary angiography, non-modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, male sex, as well as smoking and renal failure were independently associated with CAD complexity assessed by the SYNTAX score. The SYNTAX score may be a valid marker of CAD extension to establish relationships with potential novel biomarkers of coronary atherosclerosis...|$|R

Agreement between modalities was <b>high</b> with <b>a</b> kappa of 0. 74. There was {{a positive correlation between}} MSCTA and ICA Syntax scores (r= 0. 73, p= 0. 000). The mean Syntax score was 15. 8 ± 7. 16 for ICA versus 16. 3 ± 7. 6 for MSCTA (Kappa of Cohen 0. 66, p= 0. 000). The Bland–Altman plot revealed that the estimated bias was 1. 9 ± 3. 4 and the most bias occurred with <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>syntax</b> score. Lesions per patient were more identified with MSCTA than ICA (2. 5 ± 1. 4 vs. 1. 9 ± 1. 1, p< 0. 001), with a good level of agreement (kappa= 0. 65). Syntax score per lesion was similar with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> level of agreement (6. 3 ± 5. 8 vs. 6. 0 ± 4. 8, kappa= 0. 74, p< 0. 001).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine predictors of mid term major cardiovascular events in 110 cases of unprotected left main PCI. MethodsClinical and angiographic data were collected retrospectively for all patients with LMS, admitted to the cardiology center of Sfax between 2002 and 2013 and for which urgent or scheduled percutaneous revascularization was performed. The occurrence of cardiovascular events, or MACCE: death, MI, heart failure, angina or stroke recurrence was assessed at 12 months. ResultsDuring the study period, 110 patients underwent an unprotected LM PCI. These patients were predominantly male (72. 7 %). The death rate intra – hospital was 4. 5 % and 12 months mortality was 3. 6 %. 31 patients (28. 2 %) had nonfatal events during follow up. The clinical presentation at admission and diabetes were MACCE predictors at 12 months (p= 0. 04 and 0. 05 successively). The distal LM location with bifurcation involvement, the multivessel disease associated and <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>Syntax</b> score> 32 are predictors of the occurrence of MACCE in the medium term (p= 0, 03; p= 0001; and p= 0001 successively). The type and length of the stent used in the LMS are also predictors of the occurrence of MACCE (49. 1 % for BMS versus 9. 8 % for DES, p< 0. 001).

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} compare midterm {{clinical}} outcomes of 1 -stop hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) {{for the treatment of}} multivessel coronary artery disease. BackgroundOne-stop HCR has emerged to be a feasible and attractive alternative to CABG and PCI in selected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. MethodsFrom June 2007 to December 2010, 141 consecutive patients underwent 1 -stop HCR at Fuwai Hospital. Using propensity score methodology, these patients were matched with 2 separate groups of 141 patients who underwent isolated CABG or PCI during the same period. All patients were stratified by the EuroSCORE (European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Score) and the SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score. Cutoffs for EuroSCORE (low, ≤ 2; medium, > 2 and  24 and < 30; high, ≥ 30) were identified by tertiles. Three groups' cumulative major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) rates in each risk tertile were compared. ResultsOne-stop HCR incurred MACCE rate lower than that with PCI (p < 0. 001), but similar to that with CABG (p = 0. 140). After stratification by EuroSCORE or SYNTAX score, the cumulative MACCE rates were similar among the 3 groups in low and medium tertiles. But in the high EuroSCORE tertile, patients who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a lower MACCE rate than did the groups that underwent CABG (p = 0. 030) and PCI (p = 0. 006). Meanwhile, patients with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score who underwent 1 -stop HCR had a MACCE rate lower than did those who underwent PCI (p = 0. 002), but similar to that of those who underwent CABG (p = 0. 362).

40|$|ObjectiveThe SYNergy between {{percutaneous}} {{intervention with}} TAXus drug eluting stents and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) Score {{is a tool}} for risk stratification of patients according {{to the complexity of}} coronary lesions developed during the SYNTAX trial. We examined the influence of the SYNTAX Score on the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their SYNTAX Score was calculated. The influence of the SYNTAX Score on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis. Balancing score analysis was performed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. ResultsA total of 716 patients were enrolled. Mean SYNTAX Score was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the SYNTAX Score was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively). Balancing score-adjusted analyses demonstrated that the SYNTAX Score was independently associated with early and late major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 65, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 027, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Syntax {{score is}} a lesion-based {{angiographic}} scoring system, originally devised to grade the anatomic complexity of {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) and thereby facilitate consensus {{in the study of}} a diagnostic angiogram between surgeons and interventional cardiologists. Suitable biology marker to predict the severity of CAD and to have a treatment decision for revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or bypass surgery, is still unknown. Which biology marker can be <b>a</b> predictor for <b>higher</b> <b>Syntax</b> score remains unknown as well. METHODS: Severity of 105 patients who underwent coronary angiography, were evaluated with Syntax score. Laboratory tests were conducted for routine blood test, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, kidney function, creatinine and hemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c). RESULTS: Ureum had significant correlation with Syntax score, p= 0. 016 and 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 05 - 0. 55. Result of logistic regression analysis showed that HDL and haematocrit had significant correlation with Syntax score, with cut off point 34 (p= 0. 02, p= 0. 0033, respectively). Based on multi-variate analysis, Syntax score 34 = 16 (HDL ≤ 40 + Ureum ≥ 23) + 10 (Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ≥ 3. 789) + 10 (HbA 1 c ≥ 7) + 13 (monocyte ≥ 9 %).

We investigated {{the relation between the}} SYNTAX score and the occurrence of a periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) according to the historical definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the recently updated universal definition of MI. Methods and results: The SYNTAX score was calculated in 1, 243 patients enrolled in TWENTE, a randomised trial which assessed second-generation drug-eluting stents. PMI was defined by the WHO definition and the third universal definition of MI. Patients were divided into tertiles of the SYNTAX score: ≤ 7 (n= 430); > 7 and < 15 (n= 390); ≥ 15 (n= 423).

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled a total of 3805 consecutive type 2 DM patients aged 60 years and older who underwent their first elective coronary angiography and had their HbA 1 c levels measured at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between December 2005 and December 2012. The complexity of the coronary artery lesions was evaluated using the Syntax score, and the subjects were divided into three groups according to their HbA 1 c levels. Logistic regression and Pearson correlation were used to analyze the association between the measured HbA 1 c levels and Syntax score. RESULTS: The mean age was 72. 3 ± 10. 6 years. The higher HbA 1 c levels were significantly associated with <b>higher</b> <b>Syntax</b> score (p< 0. 001). The unadjusted correlation coefficient of HbA 1 c levels and the Syntax score was 0. 371 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Background: SYNTAX {{score is}} an {{established}} angiographic scoring system for risk stratification {{of a patient}} undergoing coronary revascularization. There was always a theory between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists that a good outcome after {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) operation needs at least one out of two limbs, either good contractility or good targets. If both are jeopardized the outcome will be suboptimal with considerable risky operation. We performed that study to confirm if vessels with poor distal run-off and high complexity of lesions might affect the outcome in those critical cohorts of patients with poor left ventricular function. Methods: This was a prospective observational non-randomized study. The study included 100 patients with jeopardized left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) 32). 30 days post-operative follow- up was done. The primary end point was the composite criteria of death, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Results: The mean SYNTAX score of the studied cases was 32. 03  ±  9. 62. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar among the three groups. The <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score group showed more increase in total cardio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) time and cross-clamp time, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support and postoperative blood transfusion than the other two groups. <b>High</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score showed <b>high</b> positive correlation with the number of grafts.

Methods: A total of 104 patients with non-ST-elevation ACS who underwent invasive coronary angiography for detection of coronary artery disease were recruited prospectively in this study, ECG was done to all patients, which showed f-QRS in 50 patients (f-QRS group) and inverted T wave or depressed ST in 54 patients (non f-QRS group). The significance of f-QRS complexes on 12 -lead ECG for detection of the severity of the CAD (correlated with Syntax score) was assessed in this cohort of patients. Results: Among the patients studied, elderly patients (age ⩾  65 years), males, diabetics, smokers and those with dyslipidemia had <b>a</b> significantly <b>higher</b> frequency of fQRS complexes (with P value =  0. 02, 0. 01, 0. 019, 0. 005, 0. 02 respectively). Also, the present study found <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> frequency of f-QRS {{in patients with}} multi-vessel disease, in those with more severe degree of coronary artery stenosis, in those with positive Troponin I level and in those with <b>high</b> <b>Syntax</b> score (with P value =  0. 009, 0. 000, 0. 000 respectively). Conclusions: The frequency of f-QRS complexes was found to be higher in elderly, diabetic, dyslipidemic, and male patients with NSTE-ACS. The higher frequency of (f-QRS) was correlated with the extent and severity of coronary lesions in patients with NSTE-ACS...|$|R
30|$|Some papers {{showed an}} {{association}} between coexistence of hypertension and diabetes and negative synergistic effect on SYNTAX score. It may be the diabetes and the hypertension {{were in the same}} stage, but there were not the serious symptom. Then the hypertension and diabetes were coexistence. Instead either of hypertension without diabetes or diabetes without hypertension were not associated with <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score. These differences may be caused by: First, as mentioned above, different ethnic groups have different lifestyles, eating habits, geographical and cultural differences and other extrinsic factors. Secondly, CHD is multiple factor disease. In addition to the risk factors, the differences existed in gene in different ethnic. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed that the long-term event-free survival rates between the two groups had no significant difference, indicating that in addition to hypertension, blood glucose and blood lipid levels were also important factors of coronary events and prognosis and that the more-systematic medications of the post-PCI patients might play certain roles in improving the prognosis.|$|R

Present study is designed to find out relationship between ankle brachial index (ABI) and SYNTAX Score. Methods: Total 100 consecutive patients of stable coronary artery disease in whom angiography was indicated were taken for the study. ABI was measured by using 8 MHz vascular Doppler before coronary angiography and SYNTAX SCORE was calculated by using online SYNTAX score calculator. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS 21 software. Results: There was significant correlation in between low ABI and presence of triple vessel disease in comparison to presence of single or double vessel disease {{for which it was}} not significant. (P 32 and low ABI group (P= 0. 005) although this relationship was not seen in case of low and intermediate SYNTAX Score and low ABI.

40|$|Aims. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The objective {{of this study is to}} determine plasma levels of miR- 10 a in CAD and analyze its association with the severity of CAD. Materials and Methods. Plasma miR- 10 a levels in 60 CAD patients including stable angina pectoris (SAP) (n= 29), unstable angina pectoris (UAP) or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI) (NSTEMI) (n= 17), or ST elevation MI (STEMI) (n= 14) and 20 non-CAD subjects were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and associations of miR- 10 a levels with risk factors of CAD and its severity were analyzed. Results. The qRT-PCR results showed that plasma miR- 10 a levels were decreased in CAD patients, and CAD with <b>high</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> scores or STEMI was significantly associated with lower miR- 10 a levels. Conclusions. Lower plasma miR- 10 a levels were negatively associated with the presence as well as severity of CAD, and plasma miR- 10 a can act as a potential biomarker for estimating the presence and severity of CAD...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} case study in the use of proof {{planning}} in the context of <b>higher</b> order <b>syntax.</b> Rippling is a heuristic for guiding rewriting steps in induction that has been used successfully in proof planning inductive proofs using first order representations. Ordinal arithmetic provides a natural set of higher order examples on which transfinite induction may be attempted using rippling. Previously Boyer-Moore style automation could not be applied to such domains. We demonstrate that a higher-order extension of the rippling heuristic is sufficient to plan such proofs automatically. Accordingly, ordinal arithmetic has been implemented in Clam, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> order proof planning system for induction, and standard undergraduate text book problems have been successfully planned. We show the synthesis of a fixpoint for normal ordinal functions which demonstrates how our automation could be extended to produce more interesting results than the textbook examples tried so far...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is highly {{prevalent}} with significant {{morbidity and mortality}} rates among patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX Score) predicts the outcomes of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Our aim was to evaluate the correlation between CKD and severity of coronary artery stenosis by calculating SYNTAX Scores in non diabetic CKD patients. Patients and methods: SYNTAX Score was calculated for 180 non diabetic patients with CKD scheduled for coronary angiography. Serum creatinine, estimated Glomelular Filteration Rate (e-GFR) and 24 -h proteinuria prior to Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA) were assessed in all patients. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups according to their e-GFR, group 1 with e-GFR ⩾ 15 to < 30  ml/min per 1. 73  m 2 and group 2 with e-GFR ⩾ 30 to < 60  ml/min per 1. 73  m 2. Results: Coronary arteries lesions complexity increased progressively with decreasing kidney function as there was significant negative correlation between e-GFR and SYNTAX Score (r = − 0. 5, P =  0. 0004) and significant positive correlation between 24 -h proteinuria and SYNTAX Score (r =  0. 6, p =  0. 0001).

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a major}} problem worldwide. As an endothelium-enriched microRNA (miRNA), miR- 126 has been {{reported}} to serve as a potential biomarker of acute myocardial infarction. However, the relationship between miR- 126 and the severity of CAD remains unknown. This study was designed to test whether circulating miR- 126 levels are associated with the severity of CAD. Methods: The present study enrolled 40 patients who had risk factors for CAD without angiographically significant CAD, and 110 patients presenting with stable angina pectoris, who were validated left main coronary artery disease (LMCA) and/or multi-vessel disease by coronary angiography. The expression levels of plasma miR- 126 - 5 p from all enrolled subjects were estimated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Then, the relationships between plasma miR- 126 - 5 p levels, number of diseased vessels and the corresponding Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) score were analyzed. Results: The expression of circulating miR- 126 - 5 p was affected by some CAD risk factors including aging, dyslipidemia and DM. Furthermore, plasma miR- 126 - 5 p levels were significantly down-regulated in CAD patients with multi-vessel disease, <b>higher</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> score, rather than isolated LMCA and low SYNTAX score. Conclusion: Circulating miR- 126 - 5 p has emerged as a potential biomarker for complexity and severity of CAD in patients with stable angina pectoris...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myocardial {{perfusion}} grade (MPG) is {{an accepted}} method of evaluating myocardial perfusion. However, {{it does not}} take into the account, the extent of the perfusion. We hypothesized that myocardial blush area times MPG (total blush) would be more accurate than simple MPG, and yield better prognostic information. Methods: About 34 patients were recruited after they had consented to both coronary angiography (CAG) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and divided into two groups. A special dedicated computer was employed to calculate the total blush. The CAG was performed as a conventional way. Scintigraphic technetium 99 m methoxyisobutyl-isonitrile rest and stress images were evaluated quantitatively. The comparison was made between stenosis versus chronic total occlusion (CTO), MPG 1, 2 versus MPG 3, percutaneous intervention (PCI) successful versus failure. A correlation was made between ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial perfusion by MPG, total blush, SPECT, and syntax score. Results: The perfusion indices of total blush, summed difference score (SDS) and syntax score were insignificant between the two groups (P > 0. 05). However, the left ventricular end diastolic volume was significantly larger in CTO (P < 0. 05). The patients with stenosis had better MPG than with CTO (P < 0. 05). The increased MPG was associated with increased total blush, <b>higher</b> <b>syntax</b> score, and EF (P < 0. 05). Successful PCI resulted in better perfusion indicated by increased total blush, and MPG (P < 0. 05) but successful PCI did not change syntax score, EF and SDS significantly. Multivariate linear analysis with EF as the dependent factor and syntax score, SDS, total blush, blush area, and MPG as the independent factors showed <b>a</b> significantly <b>higher</b> degree of correlation (R = 0. 87, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: After PCI the total blush and EF improved significantly indicating its potential application in the future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the notion of higher-dimensional syntax, which is a {{hierarchy}} of languages. Each term of a n-dimensional language will be typed by terms of the underlying n — 1 -dimensional language. This is an application of the emerging higher-dimensional category notions. On the lower dimensions live notions of syntax which are already known. So dimension zero corresponds to words, dimension one corresponds to equation-free algebraic theories and dimension two corresponds to algebraic data types available in programming languages like ML and Haskell. In this paper I show that this hierarchy continues for higher dimensions and contributes new notions of syntax. As expected syntax comes with a structural induction principle which allows definition of several operation. The operations of substitution, unification and type inference have been investigated. Further the operation of recursive iteration schemes like generalised map and fold algorithms have been presented [Weh 98]. This paper concentrates on the issue of a categorical characterisation of <b>higher</b> dimensional <b>syntax</b> using notions which are partly folklore (free monoidal object in a monoidal category) partly are new higher-dimensional category notions. I will characterise <b>higher</b> dimensional <b>syntax</b> as <b>a</b> left globular set having structure of a free Lawvere theory at each dimension with a right action and a right coaction of the lower dimension language. The right action is reminiscent to the substitution property in polymorphic type theories. The right coaction is reminiscent to the minimal typing property of a polymorphic type theory...|$|R
