5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 3 storm, before turning {{back towards the}} east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters.

5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|As Danielle tracked westward {{into the}} open Atlantic early on August14, the storm {{encountered}} warmer water southwest of Cape Verde and began to gradually intensify, becoming a moderate tropical storm with 50mph (85km/h) winds that morning. At that point, a bout of rapid intensification began to take place, and the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Danielle that evening as an eye began to form. Over a 24‑hour period ending {{in the morning of}} August15, the pressure fell from 1004 to 978mbar and the winds increased to 90mph (145km/h), making it <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) {{was conducted}} at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. <b>A</b> <b>high-end</b> DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction {{around the edge of}} a strong subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center of Emily passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|Late on 10April, {{the center}} of Olivia passed near Barrow Island at peak intensity.

Within several hours of passing by Varanus Island, Olivia made {{landfall}} near Mardie at peak intensity. Shortly thereafter, the storm began to weaken overland. Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern Australia. It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E

5|$|On July21, {{a vessel}} named Cape Horn relayed {{information}} regarding the storm to the National Weather Bureau, leading to them re-issuing advisories on the storm, upgrading it to a hurricane. The following day, a reconnaissance mission from Oahu, Hawaii located the storm's 40mi (65km) wide eye and recorded sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and gusts up to 115mph (185km/h). Shortly after, the storm likely attained its peak intensity as <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 1 hurricane, with winds of 85mph (140km/h).

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Gwenda {{was tied}} with Cyclone Inigo for the most intense Australian {{tropical}} cyclone on record, with a barometric pressure of 900hPa (mbar) and was the most intense storm worldwide in 1999. Forming out of a tropical disturbance over the Arafura Sea on 2April 1999, the precursor to Gwenda tracked slowly westward and gradually became more organised. On 4April, the system developed into a Category 1 cyclone and was named Gwenda. It began to undergo explosive intensification the following day, and in a 30-hour span ending early on 7April, the storm's maximum 10-minute sustained wind speed increased from 75km/h (45mph) to 225km/h (140mph) and its barometric pressure decreased to 900hPa (mbar). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center reported that the storm had peaked as <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 4 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{declared}} a depression, the JTWC upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical storm, giving it the name Elsie. At the same time, the JMA also upgraded the depression to a tropical storm. By October15, Elsie began to take a slow track to the west-northwest and intensified. Later that day, a short-wave trough passed {{to the north of}} the storm, again enhancing its outflow. This led to a period of rapid intensification, during which Elsie intensified from a tropical storm to the equivalent of <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale in a 24-hour span. The JMA also upgraded Elsie to a typhoon, though they reported a much more gradual rate of intensification. After strengthening further to Category 4 intensity, maximum winds leveled out for most of October17.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{was in an}} unusually low-shear environment for early June as it began tracking northward, which allowed the system to strengthen into Tropical Storm Allison {{on the morning of}} June 3 as it tracked into the Yucatán Channel. Despite the fact that westerly wind shear began to increase, the warm water allowed Allison to gradually strengthen more that afternoon and evening. Late that evening, while between the Yucatán Peninsula and Cuba, Allison developed a circular central dense overcast and became <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> tropical storm. As the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, the warm waters allowed Allison to strengthen further and it was upgraded to a hurricane on the morning of June 4 while travelling almost due north.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil (RSMC Nadi designation: 06F, JTWC designation: 07P) {{was a short}} lived {{storm of}} January 2006 that explosively {{intensified}} to reach its peak intensity as <b>a</b> <b>high-end</b> Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale, just 12hours after being named. Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January14, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly. The intensification {{was a result of}} the main convective banding feature wrapping around the center of circulation. However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center. By January15, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before dissipating. Urmil had only minor effects on land; scattered vegetation damage was reported in Tonga.|$|E
