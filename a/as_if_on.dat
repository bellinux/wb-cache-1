In its manifestation as a water horse the creature is able to gallop across the top of lochs <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> solid ground. During the summer months it is seen infrequently as a large insect, sucking the blood of horses.|$|E
5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> a computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires {{the knowledge of the}} telephone number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by George Kamitani as first a sequel {{and then a}} spiritual successor to the 1997 Sega Saturn title Princess Crown. Development began in 2004 after the official formation of Vanillaware. The story was based around {{the concept of a}} Valkyrie princess. The scenario and world design incorporated Norse mythology, the works of William Shakespeare, fairy tales and early video games. 2D graphics were chosen over 3D graphics as Kamitani felt the style was stagnating, which necessitated presenting cutscenes <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> a stage rather than using traditional cinematography. Leifthrasir began development in 2013 as a means of addressing the issues both players and staff had with the original game while keeping the story intact. The music for both versions was composed by a team from Basiscape, led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto.|$|E

25|$|The Jack Cade {{episode was}} dramatised in William Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 2 (Act 4, Scene 6), first {{performed}} in 1591 or 1592.

25|$|In the Ordovician Period, a land mass, {{which has}} been named Gondwana (present day South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia), straddled {{the space between the}} South Pole and the Equator {{on one side of the}} globe. Off to the west were three other masses: Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica, located <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> the {{vertices}} of a triangle. To the south of them was a large archipelago, the terrane Avalonia, rifted off the north Gondwana margin in early Ordovician.|$|E
25|$|Innovation in milking {{focused on}} mechanizing the milking parlor (known in Australia and New Zealand as a milking shed) to {{maximize}} the number of cows per operator which streamlined the milking process to permit cows to be milked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> an assembly line, and to reduce physical stresses on the farmer by putting the cows on a platform slightly above the person milking the cows to eliminate having to constantly bend over. Many older and smaller farms still have tie-stall or stanchion barns, but worldwide a majority of commercial farms have parlors.|$|E

25|$|In that spirit, Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance and constructive challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E
25|$|Before {{a verdict}} was issued {{in the new}} 1993 Rodney King federal civil rights trial against the four officers, Korean shop owners {{prepared}} for the worst as fear ran throughout the city, gun sales went up, virtually all of them by those of Korean descent, some merchants at flea markets removed their merchandise from their shelves, storefronts were fortified with extra Plexiglas and bars. Throughout the region, merchants readied to defend themselves <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> the eve of a war. College student Elizabeth Hwang spoke of the attacks on her parents' convenience store in 1992 and the fact that if trouble erupted following the 1993 trial, that they were armed with a Glock 17 pistol, a Beretta and a shotgun and they planned to barricade themselves in their store to fight off looters.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{there were}} only open living areas {{at the back of}} the {{farmhouse}} on both sides of the fireplace. Here there were tables, chairs and wall beds and, of course, open contact with the animals. Not until after the Thirty Years War when the demand for living comfort grew, were separate rooms built {{at the back of the}} farmhouse, each the length of a bay (ca. 2.5 m) i.e. the space between the interior posts. This living space was called a Kammerfach from Kammer (room or chamber) and Fach (bay). One subsequent change was the addition of a cellar under the Kammerfach, but it was not very deep. The separate living quarters were raised above the level of the main hall <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> a plinth and in the larger four-post farmhouses (Vierständerhäuser) sometimes formed a sort of gallery.|$|E

25|$|The Erhu {{has some}} unusual features. First {{is that its}} {{characteristic}} sound is produced through the vibration of the python skin by bowing. Second, there is no fingerboard; the player stops the strings by pressing their fingertips onto the strings without the strings touching the neck. Third, the horse hair bow is never separated from the strings (which were formerly of twisted silk but which today are usually made of metal); it passes between them as opposed to over them (the latter being the case with western bowed stringed instruments). Lastly, although there are two strings, they {{are very close to}} each other and the player's left hand in effect plays <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> one string. The inside string (nearest to player) is generally tuned to D4 and the outside string to A4, a fifth higher. The maximum range of the instrument is three and a half octaves, from D4 up to A7, before a stopping finger reaches the part of the string in contact with the bow hair. The usual playing range is {{about two and a half}} octaves.|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} Dutch attack on Fontenoy went in, the main allied {{formation}} moved towards the French {{position on the}} plateau. Cumberland took up his place alongside Ligonier {{at the head of}} 20 battalions, 15 British and 5 Hanoverian to their left, led by the British Guards Brigade, each with their two battalion guns, about 13,000 to 15,000 men, drawn up in two disciplined lines, each six ranks deep. However, the narrowness of the defile through which the attack had to pass forced the Hanoverians back to form a third line behind the British. As the British and Hanoverians advanced the French pushed forward the four small three-pounder battalion guns of the Gardes Françaises Brigade and the four of Aubeterre Brigade, the fire from these was added to the bombardment from the Redoubt d'Eu. Cumberland responded by deploying seven of the Guards Brigade's three-pounder battalion guns to push them back. The Duc de Gramont, of Dettingen infamy, was killed by a shot from these. As the column advanced up a slight rise, the British brought up a battery of twelve six-pounder cannons {{to the front of the}} column at such close range that the Gardes Françaises left their supported defensive position against orders, as they had at Dettingen, and advanced, unsupported, in an attempt to take the guns. Both sides exchanged fire at close range. From the Redoubt of d'Eu and Fontenoy the French cannon poured tremendous flanking fire. Whole allied ranks were swept away, but still they pressed forward in perfect order <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> parade, the better to foster cohesion and the better to overawe their opponents. Saxe had never believed that the allies would conceive or execute such a manoeuvre, and here was the one weak spot of his defence – a third redoubt between Fontenoy and the Redoubt of Eu would have rendered the allied advance impossible.|$|E

500|$|HMS Tiptoe {{was one of}} {{the group}} three of T-class submarines.

500|$|In August, the Who {{performed}} at the Woodstock Festival, despite being reluctant and demanding $13,000 up front. The group were scheduled to appear on Saturday night, 16 August, but the festival ran late {{and they did not}} take to the stage until 5am on Sunday; they played most of Tommy. During their performance, Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman interrupted the set to give a political speech about the arrest of John Sinclair; Townshend kicked him off stage, shouting: [...] "Fuck off my fucking stage!" [...] During [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> cue; Entwistle later said, [...] "God was our lighting man". At the end, Townshend threw his guitar into the audience. The set was professionally recorded and filmed, and portions appear on the Woodstock film, The Old Grey Whistle Test and The Kids Are Alright.|$|E
500|$|The group {{continued}} to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter Frank Barsalona, and generally avoided festivals, but made an important exception with the Woodstock Festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500. The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During [...] "Pinball Wizard", Abbie Hoffman took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of John Sinclair before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during [...] "See Me, Feel Me", the sun rose, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>on</b> cue. Two weeks later, the group played the second Isle of Wight Festival, {{using one of the}} largest live PAs available. Though media attention was on Bob Dylan playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, [...] "We know that the stage act we had, with Tommy in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour." ...|$|E
