[...] Venom singer Conrad [...] "Cronos" [...] Lant responded, saying [...] "Right here—right here in my mouth!" [...] Araya took it almost literally and urinated on his hair. Cronos got up and punched him in the face, the two blamed each other all night, and Araya continued the tour with a black eye. Araya will not discuss the incident other than {{saying that he was}} drunk <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> disrespectful thing to do.|$|E

He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. It was a miracle that that record got made at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place. [...] It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think." ...|$|E
500|$|Following a refit in Portsmouth, Tiptoe {{went to the}} Firth of Clyde {{for working}} up, {{arriving}} on 10 January 1964, when she was ordered not to enter Gareloch due to dense fog. The boat was duly turned around and ran aground on a muddy bank. As the fog cleared it was realised the boat had run aground only [...] opposite that {{of the house of}} the Royal Navy's Captain in Charge for the Clyde area, Captain G. D. Pound. Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, Tiptoe was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two tugboats. The commanding officer at the time was LieutenantCommander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a court-martial where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, [...] "The ship was not worked up <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary. Although he had all the theoretical knowledge, he was short of that tangible instinct of which we are all aware." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Toby Whithouse {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} different episode set in [...] "some sort of labyrinth", but after the idea had been developed for a while executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger {{thought that it was}} too similar to other episodes in the series, and asked him to write something else, while Whithouse's original idea was pushed to the next series (The God Complex). He was asked to write [...] "a big bold romantic episode" [...] which would also serve as a [...] "sort of reboot episode" [...] and a good introduction to Doctor Who. Whithouse was asked to set it [...] "anywhere in the world" [...] that was romantic, and he chose Venice, which he called [...] "one of my favourite places in the world". Whithouse believed that the vampires fit into the setting. Whithouse had a positive experience writing the episode, reflecting that [...] "writing on the show is a delight and a pleasure". As he is executive producer of Being Human, he was pleased he only had to write the episode and not worry about the other aspects of production. The major plot point of [...] "sinking Venice" [...] was conceived as Whithouse needed to use the identity of the location <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> aquatic city, and Venice was [...] "constantly fighting" [...] enemies in its history but this time it proved to be its own worst enemy.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Keir as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Nigel Kneale {{had long}} been highly {{critical}} of Brian Donlevy's interpretation of Quatermass and lobbied for the role to be recast, arguing that enough time had passed that audiences would not resist a change of actor. A number of actors were considered for the part including André Morell who had played Quatermass in the television version of Quatermass and the Pit. However, Morell {{was not interested in}} revisiting a role he had already played. The producers eventually settled on Scottish actor Andrew Keir who had appeared in supporting roles in a number of Hammer productions including The Pirates of Blood River (1962), The Devil-Ship Pirates (1964) and [...] (1966). Keir found the shoot an unhappy experience: he later recalled, “The director – Roy Ward Baker – didn't want me for the role. He wanted Kenneth More... <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> unhappy shoot. [...] Normally I enjoy going to work every day. But for seven and a half weeks it was sheer hell.” Roy Ward Baker denied he had wanted Kenneth More, who he felt would be [...] "too nice" [...] for the role, saying, “I had no idea he [...] was unhappy while we were shooting. His performance was absolutely right in every detail and I was presenting him as the star of the picture. Perhaps I should have interfered more.” Keir went on to appear for Hammer in The Viking Queen (1967) and Blood from the Mummy's Tomb (1971). He reprised the role of Quatermass for BBC Radio 3 in The Quatermass Memoirs (1996), making him the only actor other than Donlevy to play the role more than once.|$|E
