5|$|Eric {{begins to}} worry that his {{relationship}} with his fiancée may be crumbling. He has dinner with Sloan’s father, Terrence, but is shocked when Terrence asks him to sign a prenuptial agreement. Eric gets upset and confronts Sloan about it, telling him that they will talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> he returns home and then agrees. However, upon discovering that Murray has been reporting to Terrence, Eric changes his mind and instantly contacts Scott Lavin, telling him that he'll side with him who's planning on to take over the company resulting Murray to lose his business.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) is {{revealed}} {{to have an}} obsession with soccer, {{and the rest of}} the employees pretend to feel the same way <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E

5|$|While in the USSR, Willkie {{urged the}} opening of a second front against the Germans; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments, the {{president}} responded flippantly by saying that he had read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{replaced}} the wartime Manhattan Project with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. The Act also established the General Advisory Committee (GAC) within the AEC {{to provide it}} with scientific and technical advice. It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC, but the position went to Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory that had designed and developed the first atomic bombs. At the same time, the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) was established to coordinate defense research, and Bush asked Conant to head its atomic energy subcommittee, on which Oppenheimer also served. When the new AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal raised security concerns about Oppenheimer's relationships with communists, including Oppenheimer's brother Frank Oppenheimer, his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend Jean Tatlock, Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had known <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942. With such expressions of support, AEC issued Oppenheimer a Q clearance, granting him access to atomic secrets.|$|E
5|$|While at Princeton, she got {{involved}} with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group that supported minority students, running their day care center, which also included after school tutoring. She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

500|$|Her {{defenders}} {{have called}} criticism sexist. [...] "Powerful {{women in the}} media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts," [...] said The New York Times in a piece about Wintour shortly after The Devil Wears Pradas release. When she took over at Vogue, gossip columnist Liz Smith reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with Si Newhouse. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject {{of one of her}} first staff meetings. She still complained <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> accepting a media award in 2002.|$|E
500|$|Lee Percy {{served as}} editor of the film. He said the final cuts {{provided}} to him already contained the actors' strongest performances, but that he placed a greater focus on Father John's character in an effort to [...] "help the audience get inside him and connect emotionally". Percy was assisted by editor Scott Ferril. Patrick Coyle's father, Jim, followed production of the film closely, making weekly calls to inquire <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> his father's health started to decline, Patrick Coyle [...] "worked like hell" [...] to finish the film quickly so his father could see it before he died. The film was finished in December 2008.|$|E

500|$|Originally in {{the climax}}, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> {{you get to the}} top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the day it}} was shown, [...] "Last Gasp" [...] was {{selected}} as comedy [...] "pick of the day" [...] in the Daily Express, but, the following day, an extremely critical review of the episode by Virginia Blackburn was published in the newspaper. She felt that the episode was disappointing and wasted the talent of the actors, and that the concept was [...] "the sort of idea you can imagine two students coming up with after the sixth pint ... and then feeling slightly embarrassed <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they wake up the next morning". She summed up the episode by saying that it was neither funny nor clever, and [...] "is so utterly, irredeemably, naffly silly that it ends up being incredibly irritating and nothing else".|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even when you play it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E

500|$|Finlay {{had been}} {{appointed}} on the conditions {{that he would not}} claim a pension (it was war-time, and there were already four retired Lord Chancellors claiming £5000 per year pensions) and that he would resign when required. Despite this he was surprised when he was dismissed after the 1919 general election, first hearing <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> it was mentioned in the newspapers. His replacement Lord Birkenhead was appointed on 14 January 1919, and was a controversial choice; he was only 46 when appointed and was unpopular with large sections of the Bar as a result; George V himself wrote to the Prime Minister before Birkenhead was appointed and said that [...] "His Majesty does not feel sure that [...] has established such a reputation in men's minds as to ensure that the country will welcome him to the second highest position which can be occupied by a subject of the Crown". Birkenhead and Schuster established a strong partnership, and Schuster played a part in instituting Birkenhead's legal reforms, particularly those relating to the law of real property.|$|E
500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E
500|$|Rand {{extended}} her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism {{while working in}} Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a [...] "friendly witness" [...] before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal {{of it in the}} 1944 film Song of Russia. Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was. She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as [...] "futile".|$|E

500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] is a dance-pop {{song that}} {{features}} a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff {{that serves as the}} song's instrumentation. Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> you touch me there / Close my eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|The Irish proved {{very tough}} negotiators, {{so much so}} that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera's offers had [...] "presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any {{advantages}} for the UK". With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had [...] "only given up the small things", and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938. The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay £10million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access. The agreements were attacked by Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which Churchill described as the [...] "sentinel towers of the Western Approaches". When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under Irish neutrality. Churchill railed against these treaties in The Gathering Storm, stating that he [...] "never saw the House of Commons more completely misled" [...] and that [...] "members were made to feel very differently <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>when</b> our existence hung in the balance during the Battle of the Atlantic". Chamberlain, however, believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.|$|E
500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the blurb {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the blurb varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the blurb, particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the blurb works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The blurb won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E
