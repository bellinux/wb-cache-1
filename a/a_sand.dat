5|$|The {{small lake}} {{is a local}} {{favorite}} for fishing. Lake Winfield Scott is stocked with rainbow trout and also contains local species of warmwater fish such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Also on the lake are a boat ramp, boat dock and swimming area with <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> beach. The Forest Service allows only man-powered and electric-powered watercraft on the lake.|$|E
50|$|Trouble-free {{locomotive}} running {{requires that}} there is sufficient traction between wheel and rail. Steam engines therefore had sandboxes (usually two, {{on top of the}} boiler). These were filled with the help of sanding equipment. For sanding there was either <b>a</b> <b>sanding</b> system with <b>an</b> elevated bunker or <b>a</b> <b>sanding</b> tower. The special sand was kept in its own store. On <b>a</b> <b>sanding</b> tower <b>a</b> telescopic pipe was hooked up to the sandbox, the lock released and the locomotive sandbox filled as required. All Betriebswerke had to have enough sand for at least 30 days.|$|R

5|$|The {{terrain of}} a barrier island is {{determined}} by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland.

5|$|Apart from American and Soviet {{strategic}} forces, however, camouflage {{continued to}} be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched to night flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, Vietcong MiG-21 fighters were painted by hand in green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> and spinach pattern.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 1960s, the power stations' {{operating}} hours were decreased due {{to the opening of}} the much larger Blyth power station in Northumberland. This meant that less ash was produced by the Stella and Dunston stations; so {{by the end of the}} 1960s, the CEGB sold Hexhamshire Lass and Bobby Shaftoe. The former went to a firm in Fareham, Hampshire, where it worked as <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> dredger until scrapped in 1993; the latter to a French dredging company.|$|E

5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the kinetic energy of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E
5|$|Bodrog {{was sent}} to Reni {{near the mouth of}} the Danube to protect {{withdrawing}} Austro-Hungarian troops, arriving there on 1 October. She then sailed upstream, reaching Rustschuk on 11 October, and Giurgiu two days later. On 14 October, she was deployed at Lom. She was the last Austro-Hungarian monitor to withdraw towards Budapest and {{was the only one that}} failed to reach the city. On 31 October 1918, Bodrog collided with <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> bank while navigating through heavy fog near Vinča. She was later captured by the Serbian Army.|$|E

50|$|Size {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{distinguishing}} <b>a</b> lesser <b>sand</b> plover from <b>a</b> greater <b>sand</b> plover, with the lesser being slightly smaller. However, {{it is not easy to}} rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the lesser generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in <b>a</b> lesser <b>sand</b> plover is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in <b>a</b> greater <b>sand</b> plover it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.|$|R
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers {{are waiting for the}} train to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E
5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including <b>a</b> <b>Sand</b> Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} hold the games at the Shenton Park Annexe of the Royal Perth Hospital but this was abandoned due the need for temporary buildings. The Royal Agricultural Showgrounds in the suburb of Claremont was used as it had an oval and buildings for accommodation and events. A major advantage of the venue was that all facilities were on one level. There was no suitable facility for basketball and after much debate a wooden court was laid on <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> foundation {{in front of the}} main grandstand. Beatty Park was used for swimming events.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>sand</b> sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E
5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted moments in the game, such as triggering <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed. Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E

5|$|At dawn, {{after his}} {{attacked}} failed to overtake any major positions, Zur decided to withdraw, {{for the first}} time in his life. He ordered Harpaz's company, which had the most casualties, to go first, and at 06:00 told Dromi's company to follow. Harpaz's company had five men missing in action, four of whom were picked up by Dromi's people. One of Dromi's platoons remained on top of <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> dune to provide cover fire for the retreat. Meanwhile, the rest of the company made its way under the road and the railway through culverts. On the eastern side, Dromi met Harpaz. They sent the cover platoon home with the injured, and remained in their place to wait for Zur. Their lookout also spotted Kotzer's retreating company and Harpaz requested artillery cover using the only working communication device they had. The Napoleonchiks missed their targets, but deterred the Egyptians, who stopped following Kotzer.|$|E
5|$|By 1926, the Kingsland–St. Marys highway was <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> or dirt road. When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 was under construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a paved road by January 1936. The highway from Folkston to the Charlton–Camden county line was under construction by October 1936. The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110. SR40 between Colerain and the western edge of Kingsland was under construction by July 1939 and paving was completed in January 1941. The gap in Kingsland was placed under construction by April 1941 but was not completed until the beginning of 1943.|$|E
5|$|Endeavour then resumed her course northward and {{parallel}} to the reef, the crew looking for a safe harbour in which to make repairs. On 13 June, the ship came to a broad watercourse that Cook named the Endeavour River. Cook attempted to enter the river mouth, but strong winds and rain prevented Endeavour from crossing the bar until the morning of 17 June. She grounded briefly on <b>a</b> <b>sand</b> spit but was refloated an hour later and warped into the river proper by early afternoon. The ship was promptly beached on the southern bank and careened to make repairs to the hull. Torn sails and rigging were also replaced and the hull scraped free of barnacles.|$|E
