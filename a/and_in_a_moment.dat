25|$|An {{exchange}} of musketry started which lasted half an hour, and caused much loss. Other Prussian battalions now hastened across the village, but all at once, a rumour flew rapidly among them, that the French were {{in possession of}} the Churchyard, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> several muskets were aimed in that direction, and either thoughtlessly or nervously discharged. Those battalions that were in front, at the outlet of the village, became alarmed by this unexpected firing in their rear. At the same time, a discharge of grape, from some guns suddenly brought forward by the French, in their immediate front, augmented their confusion, and they retreated. They were closely pursued by the French, whose skirmishers made a dash at the colour of the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Regiment, which they would have captured but for a very determined defence.|$|E
500|$|In The Divorcee (1930), {{starring}} Norma Shearer, a wife {{discovers that}} her husband (played by Chester Morris), has been cheating on her. In reaction, she decides to have an affair with his best friend [...] (played by Robert Montgomery). When the husband finds out, he decides to leave her. After pleading with him to stay, the wife unleashes her frustrations upon him, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of inspiration reveals her desire to live a fearless, sexually liberated life without him. According {{to at least one}} film historian, [...] this was the motion picture that inspired other films centering upon sophisticated female protagonists, who stayed out late, had affairs, wore revealing gowns, and who basically destroyed the sexual double standard by asserting themselves both within society and in the bedroom. From The Divorcee onward, there developed [...] "a trend toward a sophistication in women's pictures that would continue unabated {{until the end of the}} Pre-Code era in mid-1934.|$|E
500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of characteristic impulse, threw {{them into the}} fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful day of my life... I am looking at the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first}} time in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E

2500|$|Utopia reached Gibraltar in the {{afternoon}} of 17 March. Captain John McKeague steered Utopia to her usual anchorage in the inner harbour, but then {{realized that it was}} occupied by two battleships, HMS Anson and HMS Rodney. McKeague later recalled that he had been temporarily dazzled by Ansons searchlight. When McKeague's eyesight recovered he [...] "suddenly discovered that the inside anchorage was full of ships". [...] McKeague, according to his statement, thought that Anson was [...] "further off than she really was" [...] and attempted to steer Utopia ahead of Ansons bow. Suddenly, a [...] "strong gale combined with current swept the vessel across the bows of the Anson, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> her hull was pierced and cut by the ram of the ironclad". According to third mate Francis Wadsworth, the impact occurred at 6:36 p.m. Ansons ram tore a hole [...] wide below Utopias waterline, and her holds quickly flooded.|$|E
2500|$|In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows it is {{revealed}} that the Grey Lady is Helena Ravenclaw, daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw, making her the only house ghost known {{to be related to}} one of the Hogwarts founders. She informs Harry that she stole the Diadem of Ravenclaw from her mother, in an attempt to become smarter than her, and then went into hiding in Albania. It was a dying Rowena Ravenclaw's wish to see her daughter again and so she sent for the Bloody Baron to look for her, knowing that he would not rest until he brought her back, partly because {{he was in love with}} her. However, she refused to come with him <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of blind rage, he killed her with a single stab wound to the chest. Overcome with remorse, the Bloody Baron killed himself using the same weapon in turn and wears chains as penitence, [...] "as he should", the Grey Lady says. The diadem remained in the hollow of a tree in an Albanian forest until Tom Riddle managed to charm the story out of her ghost, the Grey Lady. Riddle, who had been seeking out historically significant objects to make into Horcruxes, later retrieved the diadem from Albania and hid it in the Room of Requirement at Hogwarts while visiting the castle years later.|$|E
