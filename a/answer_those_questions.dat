He decided to wear No. 3, the number he wore during his college years at Washington. He felt well during {{training}} camp but suffered an injury after a collision during a preseason game on October 26, 2012. He played in five regular season games before needing season-ending surgery on his right knee. He averaged 5.8 points per game, 2.8 rebounds per game, and 4.6 assists per game in 24.4 minutes during the 2012–13 season. Roy was waived by Minnesota on May 10, 2013. Afterwards, he said, [...] "Any time you {{walk away from the}} game, you have 'what-ifs'. I feel like I was able to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> last year by going out there and giving it a try." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "correlatives" [...] are a {{paradigm}} of pro-forms, {{used to ask}} and answer the questions what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, how much, and what kind. They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine wh- questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words kiam (when) and kiu (who, which), with the initial ki- of questions, ask about time and individuals, whereas the words tiam (then) and tiu (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial ti- of demonstratives, <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> and the words neniam (never) and neniu (no-one) deny those questions. Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires {{a paradigm}} of 45 adverbs and pronouns.|$|E

6000|$|That {{the said}} Warren Hastings, in {{affecting}} to doubt whether the information expressly required of {{him by his}} employers was expected or not, has endeavored to justify a criminal delay and evasion in giving it. That, {{considering the importance of}} the subject, and the recent date of the command, it is not possible that it could be lost to his recollection; much less is it possible that he could have understood the specific demand of an answer to specific questions to be intended only as a reprehension for a former offence, viz., the offence of withholding from the Directors that very explanation which he ought to have given in the first instance. That the said Warren Hastings, in his answer to the said questions, cautiously avoids affirming or denying anything in clear, positive terms, and professes to recollect nothing with absolute certainty. That he has not, even now, informed the Directors of the name of any one person from whom any part of the money in question was received, nor what was the motive of any one person for giving the same. That he has, indeed, declared, that his motive for lending to the Company, or depositing in their treasury in his own name, money which he has in other places declared to be their property, was to avoid ostentation, and that lending the money was the least liable to reflection; yet, when he has stated these and other conjectural motives for his own conduct, he declares he will not affirm, though he is firmly persuaded, that those were his sentiments on the occasion. That of one thing only the said Warren Hastings declares he is certain, viz., [...] "that it was his design originally to have concealed the receipt of all the sums, except the second, even from the knowledge of the Court of Directors, but that, when fortune threw a sum in his way of a magnitude which could not be concealed, and the peculiar delicacy of his situation at the time in which he received it made him more circumspect of appearances, he chose to apprise his employers of it." [...] That the said Warren Hastings informs the Directors, that he had indorsed the bonds taken by him for money belonging to the Company, and lent by him to the Company, in order to guard against their becoming a claim on the Company, as part of his estate, in the event of his death; but he has not affirmed, nor does it anywhere appear, that he has surrendered the said bonds, as he ought to have done. That the said Warren Hastings, in affirming that he had not time to answer the questions put to him by the Directors, while he was in Bengal,--in not bringing with him to England the documents necessary to enable him to <b>answer</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> or in pretending that he has not brought them,--in referring the Directors back again to Bengal for those documents, and for any further information on a subject on which he has given them no information,--and particularly in referring them back to a person in Bengal for a paper which he says contained the only account he ever kept of the transaction, while he himself professes to doubt whether that paper be still in being, whether it {{be in the hands of}} that person, or whether that person can recollect anything distinctly concerning it,--has been guilty of gross evasions, and of palpable prevarication and deceit, as well as of contumacy and disobedience to the lawful orders of the Court of Directors, and thereby confirmed all the former evidence of his having constantly used the influence of his station for the most scandalous, illegal, and corrupt purposes.|$|E
