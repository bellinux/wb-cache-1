40|$|Abstract：【Objective】The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to explore the spatial distribution of soil <b>available</b> microelements, <b>and</b> to provide a solid foundation for scientifically formulated fertilizer. 【Method】One thousand and seventy six soil samples were collected from Pinggu District of Beijing and analyzed for concentrations of available Cu, available Zn, <b>available</b> Fe <b>and</b> <b>available</b> Mn in topsoil (0 - 20 cm) and subsoil (20 - 40 cm), respectively. The general statistics and geostatistics methods were used to analyze the data. 【Result】The mean value of topsoil soil available Cu, available Zn, <b>available</b> Fe <b>and</b> <b>available</b> Mn were 1. 96 mg·kg- 1, 2. 51 mg·kg- 1, 17. 32 mg·kg- 1, and 10. 91 mg·kg- 1, respectively, which were at higher level. The topsoil content of soil available microelements was more than that of subsoil. The result of semivariance analysis showed that the topsoil spatial heterogeneity ranges of <b>available</b> Fe <b>and</b> <b>available</b> Mn were 21. 6 km and 45. 3 km, respectively, <b>available</b> Cu <b>and</b> <b>available</b> Zn were 3. 1 km and 2. 9 km...|$|R

5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel <b>available</b> <b>and</b> collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further afield in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are <b>available</b> <b>and</b> burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E

5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies <b>available</b> <b>and</b> metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

The ways of combining Geostatistics with GIS were applied to analyze the spatial variability of soil nutrients, such as Alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, <b>available</b> phosphorus <b>and</b> <b>available</b> potassium. All results shows that Alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, <b>available</b> phosphorus <b>and</b> <b>available</b> potassium in the coefficient of variation were from 9 % to 46 %, and the largest coefficient of variation of available phosphorus was 46 %. By using Semi-variogram function of statistical analysis, Alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen, <b>available</b> phosphorus <b>and</b> <b>available</b> potassium show Moderate spatial dependency. The relevance of space about available phosphorus may be the weakest, which is effected mainly by random factors. So the different management and the level of fertilizer may be done according the spatial variability of different area format...|$|R
