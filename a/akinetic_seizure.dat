40|$|A {{method has}} been {{described}} {{for the study of}} the central effects produced by the intracerebral injection of drugs in the unanaesthetized mouse. The effects observed were in good agreement with those obtained after similar injections in cats, dogs and human beings. After intracerebral injection, drugs of diverse structure produced certain generalized effects: changes in positioning of the tail, stupor, hyperexcitability and tachypnoea. Both acetylcholine and methacholine produced an <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizure</b> and depression, but the latter compound also caused lacrimation and salivation. Atropine produced piloerection, increased sensitivity to sound and touch, clonic convulsions and scratching, whereas hexamethonium caused Parkinsonian-like muscle tremors and peripheral vasodilatation. After adrenaline, hyperexcitability, exophthalmos, stupor and death from pulmonary oedema were observed, but (+) -methylamphetamine produced only piloerection and exaggerated activity in response to sound and touch. Ergotamine caused a decreased sensitivity to sound and touch, micturition, and stupor, while ergometrine caused clonic convulsions, piloerection, defaecation and stupor...|$|E
40|$|The {{cases of}} a disease with {{abnormal}} intracranial vascular network {{have been reported in}} Japan and it is said that the disease occures quite often among Japanese people. The disease has not been determined whether this can be included in one category or a syndrome complex of polygenetical disorders. The disease can be summarized; As clinically : 1) The disease has been found from 1 to 50 -year-old but usually onsets at a very young age, mainly around 10 years. 2) <b>Akinetic</b> <b>seizure,</b> hemiparesis, convultion, loss of consciousness, and aphasia etc. are common and recur episodically. As angiographically : 1) Occlusions and narrowing of arteries are commonly found at the supraclinoid portion of internal carotid artery or the proximal portion of cerebral arteries. 2) Abnormal vascular networks are found at the basal region. 3) The above mentioned changes are mainly seen bilateraly. The malformation theory and the occlusion theory are tried in an attempt to explain the cause of the disease; the authors take the latter. At this time, authors have observed 12 cases of the disease with intracranial abnormal vascular network and would like to discuss the angiographical study of this abnormal vascular network development. The abnormal vascular network will be expressed simply A. V. N...|$|E

50|$|Atonic {{seizures}} (also called drop <b>seizures,</b> <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures</b> or drop attacks), are {{a type of}} seizure that {{consist of}} a brief lapse in muscle tone that are caused by temporary alterations in brain function. The seizures are brief - usually less than fifteen seconds. They begin in childhood and may persist into adulthood. The seizure itself causes no injury, but the loss of muscle control can result in direct injury from falling. Electroencephalography {{can be used to}} confirm diagnosis. It is rare and can be indicative of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (see Henri Gastaut).|$|R
40|$|Com o uso de Nitrazepam notou-se rápida redução de freqüência das crises tônicas axiais. Os melhores resultados foram obtidos em um paciente que apresentava crises tônicas axiais isoladas, estado seqüela de encefalopatia mioclônica infantil com hipsarritmia; essas crises foram controladas após dois meses de tratamento. Em outro paciente, com manifestações críticas próprias das síndrome de Lennox, houve redução da intensidade e da freqüência das demais crises associadas às crises tônicas axiais; o tratamento não impediu, contudo, o aparecimento de novas manifestações epilépticas que completaram o quadro da síndrome de Lennox. A intercorrência de episódios infecciosos piorou o quadro clínico de um dos pacientes. Houve redução rápida e significativa da intensidade e da freqüência das crises acinéticas, desde o primeiro dia de tratamento com Diazepam em 5 dos 10 pacientes. Em mais 4 doentes as crises foram controladas desde o primeiro dia. O intervalo entre o início das crises acinéticas e o início do tratamento e o insucesso de terapêuticas anteriores não foram fatores desfavoráveis quanto aos resultados obtidos com o Diazepam. Recidivas ou agravamento do quadro clínico ocorreram em 5 pacientes. A piora não teve relação definida com afecções intercorrentes. Aumentos ulteriores da dosagem do Diazepam tiveram efeitos inconstantes. The {{clinical}} {{changes of}} 2 patients with axo-tonic seizures and of 10 patients with <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures</b> treated by Nitrazepam were studied. With the treatment there was rapid reduction in {{frequency of the}} axo-tonic seizures, the best result being obtained in one patient with isolated seizures, resulted from an infantile myoclonic encephalopathy with hypsarhythmia, and which were abolished after two months of treatment. The other patient presented Lennox syndrome; there was decrease in intensity and frequency {{of other types of}} seizures which were occurying associated to the axo-tonic seizures but new types of seizures developed during the treatment. The occurrence of infectious processes aggravated the clinical picture of one patient. Among the patients with <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures,</b> 5 presented rapid reduction in frequency and severity of seizures since the first day of treatment; in 4 patients the seizures were abolished {{on the first day of}} treatment. The interval of time between the onset of <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures</b> and the beginning of the treatment, as well as the insuccess of previous treatments, did not influence of results. Relapses or intensification of the clinical picture were observed in 5 patients. The aggravation was not definitely related to infectious processes.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{classified}} {{patients with}} psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) {{according to a}} newly proposed classification system. Then, we investigated the demographic and clinical differences between various classes of the patients. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated all patients with PNESs admitted to the Jefferson Comprehensive Epilepsy Center from 2012 through 2016. We classified the patients into four distinct classes: patients with generalized motor <b>seizures,</b> patients with <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures,</b> patients with focal motor seizures, and patients with seizures with subjective symptoms. All patients were interviewed by a neuropsychologist and were administered psychological assessment measures, including questions about PNES risk factors. For the statistical analyses, we compared patients who had generalized motor seizures with patients who had nonmotor seizures. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were studied. Thirty-five (55. 6 %) patients had generalized motor seizures, 14 (22. 2 %) had seizures with subjective symptoms, 12 (19 %) had <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures,</b> and two (3. 2 %) patients had focal motor seizures. Patients with generalized motor seizures (35 patients) demonstrated a trend for later age at onset (p= 0. 06), more frequently {{had a history of}} substance abuse (p= 0. 001), and more often had loss of responsiveness with their seizures (p= 0. 04) compared with patients who had nonmotor seizures (26 patients). CONCLUSION: The recently proposed PNES classification system is useful and practical. This proposed classification of PNESs may address proper diagnosis and provide standardization across future studies. This may also potentially shed light on the etiologic understanding and management of various classes of patients affected with PNESs...|$|R
40|$|Os autores relatam a evolução clínico-laboratorial do caso de uma criança que, aos 18 meses de idade, apresentou uma síndrome de West de instalação gradativa, evoluindo ulteriormente para uma síndrome de Lennox-Gastaut, causadas por cisticercose cerebral, etiologia ainda não registrada em nenhum dos quadros. The {{case of a}} 6 {{year old}} girl with Lennox-Gastaut's {{syndrome}} caused by cysticercosis of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is reported. The illness began at 18 months of age with right sided convulsions during an upper respiratory tract infection. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed depression of rapid rythm on the left side. There was progressive mental deterioration, right spastic hemiparesis and aphasia. Then the EEG showed progressively worsening of generalized irritative activity, with spikes and sharp waves. At the age of 3 years there appeared flexion myoclonic spasms and EEG showed a hypsarythmic pattern. Both clinical and EEG picture allowed the diagnosis of West's syndrome. In the following months the patient presented <b>akinetic</b> <b>seizures,</b> myoclonic jerks and generalized convulsive seizures with turning of the head to the right. EEG revealed slow spike-waves thus leading, at this time, to the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut's síndrome. Brain cysticercosis was diagnosed on the basis of 8 repeated positive cerebrospinal fluid examinations...|$|R
40|$|Tacrolimus is an {{immunosuppressive}} agent that inhibitscytokine synthesis and blocks T-cell development. It was introduced into clinical {{use at the}} University of Pitts-burgh in 1989 for liver rescue purposes, but has since be-come the standard immunosuppresant for almost all solid organ transplants. Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of tacrolimus therapy can be mild (headache, tremors, night-mares, vertigo, dysesthesiae, photophobia, mood distur-bances) or severe (bilateral optic neuropathy, <b>akinetic</b> mutism, <b>seizures,</b> encephalopathy). 1 However, the exact mechanism of neurotoxicity of this drug remains unclear. Severe neurologic adverse effects {{can be seen in}} 21 – 32 % of patients and can {{have a significant impact on}} the mor-bidity of transplant recipients. 2 Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, frequently severe, and fulminant polyradiculoneuropathy that is au-toimmune in nature. Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a variant of GBS that presents as rapidly evolving ataxia and areflexia of limbs without weakness and ophthalmoplegia, often with pupillary abnormalities. 3 The MFS variant ac-counts for approximately 5 % of all GBS cases. Anti-GQ 1 b immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies are found in> 90 % of patients with MFS, and titers of IgG are highest early in the course. These antibodies are not found in other forms of GBS unless there is extraocular motor nerve involve-ment. The recognition of this syndrome is important as, despite its alarming nature, the course and outcome (after removing the offending cause and with early initiation of treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma-pheresis) are optimistic...|$|R
