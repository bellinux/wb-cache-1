This research embodies ethical standards which place {{a high value on}} a respect for persons. Those standards emphasize that we obtain informed consent from individuals selected to participate in research. The relevant information required for informed consent varies from situation to situation but should take into account the need for participants to make <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> about their involvement. Where community research is involved, there should be consultation with appropriate representatives. In all contemporary medical research, there is an inherent conflict between the ethical requirement that we share information which will help those who are suffering and the need to preserve rights to competitively sensitive information related to product development and academic funding. These various pressures on research emphasize the need for an active and lively appreciation of ethical issues in contemporary biomedical sciences...|$|E

40|$|As an {{empirical}} science, medical research {{is dependent on}} {{the development and implementation of}} novel therapy concepts through clinical trials. Nevertheless, the execution of just any clinical trial is not expedient. For the purpose of making <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision,</b> the development of decision criteria is necessary.

In order to appraise the overall benefit, it is necessary to assess the monetary and non-monetary benefits of a clinical trial. By means of calculating the process costs, this thesis records the overall costs by three exemplifying clinical trials. The estimation of the non-monetary benefits was carried out by means of a questionnaire. Here, for the first time, variables capable of defining the non-monetary benefits of clinical trials have been developed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper aims {{briefly to}} {{illustrate}} some major findings {{of an ongoing}} research project {{on the role of}} global administrative law in Earth system governance. The primary aim is to explore whether administrative-law type mechanisms, such as the right to a hearing, the duties to provide <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> and to disclose relevant information, could enhance the accountability and democratic legitimacy of Earth system governance. The democracy-enhancing potential of such administrative-law type mechanisms- which in the national context have proved to be beneficial in strengthening citizens ’ participation and the acceptance of decisions- can be limited in the global arena, by a number of factors. One of these factors is “legal imperialism”, understood as the grafting onto the global plane of rules and institutions that impose the hegemony of western values. As a matter of fact, administrative-law type mechanisms, being a construct of a certain type of Western, liberal model of State (and its capitalist model of development), could be perceived, in the Southern and Eastern hemispheres of the Earth, as an instrument to reproduce the dominant position of “developed ” countries. The analysis suggests that in order to realize their global democracy-enhancing potential, administrative-law type mechanisms should draw on universal principles and cross-cultural value...|$|E

40|$|Relying on {{the theory}} of planned {{behavior}} (Ajzen, 1991), a longitudinal study investigated the effects of an intervention — introduction of a pre-paid bus ticket — on increased bus use among college students. In this context, {{the logic of the}} proposition that past behavior is the best predictor of later behavior was also examined. The intervention was found to influence attitudes toward bus use, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control and, consistent with the theory, to affect intentions and behavior in the desired direction. Furthermore, the theory afforded accurate prediction of intention and behavior {{both before and after the}} intervention. In contrast, a measure of past behavior improved prediction of travel mode prior to the intervention but lost its predictive utility for behavior following the intervention. In a test of the proposition that the effect of prior on later behavior is due to habit formation, an independent measure of habit failed to mediate the effects of past on later behavior. It is concluded that choice of travel mode is largely <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision,</b> that this decision can be affected by interventions that produce change in attitudes, subjective norms, and perceptions of behavioral control, and that past travel choice contributes to the prediction of later behavior only if circumstances remain relatively stable.

40|$|Objectives: The {{global burden}} of {{low back pain}} is the highest ranked {{condition}} contributing to years of living with disability. Exercise is moderately effective, and adherence to exercise may improve if participants are engaged. Identification of elements that enhance engagement would enable clinicians to prescribe appropriate interventions. The review objective was to identify and synthesize qualitative empirical studies that have explored beliefs about exercise therapy of people with nonspecific chronic low back pain. Methods: Two independent reviewers conducted a structured review and metasynthesis informed by Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration guidelines and the PRISMA statement. Fifteen papers were included for data extraction, method quality assessment, and thematic analysis. Results: Four key themes emerged: (1) perceptions and classification of exercise; (2) role and impact of the health professional; (3) exercise and activity enablers/facilitators; (4) exercise and activity barriers. Participants believed that there were distinctions between general activity, real/fitness exercise, and medical exercise. Levels of acquired skills and capability and participant experience with exercise culture require consideration in program design. People participating in exercise classes and group work may be more comfortable when matched for abilities and experience. When an intervention interferes with everyday life {{and appears to be}} ineffective or too difficult to implement, people make <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> to discontinue.

40|$|In 1990, the Minnesota Legislature {{amended the}} Civil Damage Act {{to allow for}} common law tort claims against persons 21 years old or older who knowingly provide alcohol to a person under 21 years of age. The 1990 {{amendment}} is unique because the legislature in effect appears to be releasing its stranglehold on liquor liability law, permitting the courts to apply common law negligence principles under the defined circumstances, but without providing any guidelines {{as to how the}} common law remedy should be formulated. The interpretive problems the amendment creates will eventually have to be resolved by the courts. The purpose of this Article is to examine those interpretive problems, and proceeds in four parts. Part II provides a backdrop for the examination of common law claims arising out of furnishing or providing alcohol to another and discusses the legislative intent in adopting subdivision 6. Part III analyzes the statutory window the legislature used to open up common law liability. Because common law negligence principles may be imposed only where a person twenty-one years of age or older has knowingly provided or furnished liquor to a person under the age of twenty-one, questions will arise concerning the interpretation of the term “knowingly,” and the meaning of the terms “provided or furnished. ” Part IV focuses on the potential constitutional problems that may be created by the 1990 amendment because it permits the imposition of liability against social hosts according to standards that are different from those that apply to commercial vendors of alcohol. More specifically, the issue is whether the split in standards will give rise to an equal protection claim of the same strength that caused the Minnesota Supreme Court in Wegan v. Village of Lexington to hold that the split standards that were the product of its decision in Trail were unconstitutional, or whether the split is the result of <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> that will withstand a potential constitutional attack. Finally, Part V recaps the analysis of the common law liability and statutory window issue in a brief conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The Cheyenne Bottoms, Barton County, Kansas, {{has long}} been hallowed ground for birders and {{scientists}} as well as hunters. The dikes let one drive slowly through the marshes, scanning the flats for favorite sandpiper species and experiencing first hand {{the isolation of the}} central Kansas prairies. John Zimmerman, professor of biology at Kansas State University, had captured the Cheyenne Bottoms aura in eloquent prose, giving us a taste of wetlands natural history, while bringing to life the political and economic conflicts surrounding Arkansas River, and Walnut Creek, water. In many ways, the Cheyenne Bottoms case is a modern archetypical prairie fight between irrigators and environmentalists. Zimmerman succeeds admirably in his effort to layout, in plain language, the issues, politics, and actions that dictate the fate of this enormous wetland. And if there is any take home message from this book, it {{is to be found in}} the blunt reporting of Jan Garton 2 ̆ 7 s introduction: 2 ̆ 2 Never before in Kansas history had taxpayers 2 ̆ 7 dollars gone for wildlife needs. 2 ̆ 2 Zimmerman has done a superb job of translating biological argot into lay terms, extracting the underlying ecological principles and illustrating them with easily understood examples, interpreting the seemingly neutral numbers, letting us see the natural drama usually reserved for the scientifically literate, and showing us the ultimate link between the microscopic lower levels of a food web and the annual economic impact of bird watchers on Barton County (four times that of pheasant and duck hunters combined). Central to Zimmerman 2 ̆ 7 s success is his skillful use of basic science, especially the ecological studies 2 ̆ 7 of Wayne Hoffman, and the weaving of the Hoffman observations into the narrative.

40|$|This {{research}} studies Adequacy Decisions, the Safe Harbour and the Privacy Shield, under which transfers of personal {{data from the}} European Union to the United States are facilitated. The focus is on ‘redress mechanisms’, thus the mechanisms under which EU citizens can seek redress or compensation against violations of data protection rules. The research assesses the redress mechanisms of the Privacy Shield in the Light of the Court of Justice of the European Union case Schrems. Firstly the Safe Harbour Decision and its redress mechanisms are introduced. Then the Schrems case where the Safe Harbour was invalidated is analysed. Focus is on what the Court says about redress mechanisms, and the criteria that it establishes {{for the assessment of}} Adequacy Decisions. This criteria is then applied to the Privacy Shield redress mechanisms. According to the criteria, an Adequacy Decision must fulfil the requirements set out in Article 47 of the Charter of Funda-mental Rights, thus right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial. The different redress mechanisms of the Privacy Shield are assessed in light of this Article by using case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as European Court of Human Rights. The study finds that all the redress mechanisms are not in line with Article 47. More specifically there are deficiencies in terms of the remedies available under different redress options, also all the procedures cannot be considered ‘fair’ as required by Article 47. More specifically, there is not always an opportunity for inter partes proceedings or <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision.</b> Also the independence and impartiality of some of the dispute resolution bodies is questionable. Moreover, the complexity of the Privacy Shield redress mechanisms may in some situations mean that the time of the proceedings may exceed what would be considered reasonable from the perspective of European law. The redress of mechanisms of the Privacy Shield rely heavily on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). The compatibility with Article 47 of the Charter and ADR is not discussed as such, although the requirement of mandatory ADR before judicial dispute resolution is considered. Instead, the study asks whether the ADR mechanisms of the Privacy Shield could be compatible with Article 47. This study is done from a European perspective, thus focusing on EU fundamental rights. Study of laws of the United States are left outside the scope of the research, although some references are made. Similarly the study of redress mechanisms is limited to those introduced in the Privacy Shield and routes to seek redress in US courts are excluded. The aim of this study is thus to assess whether the Privacy Shield would pass the criteria established by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its Schrems case. The study takes a fundamental right perspective, although it does recognize that European data protection law does have other objectives other than the protection of personal data, such as economic objectives...|$|E
40|$|Ronald Dworkin {{has done}} more than any other {{constitutional}} lawyer, past or present, to impress upon us the importance of integrity to constitutional law, and hence to our shared public life. Far from being merely a private virtue, Dworkin has shown that integrity imposes constraints upon and provides guidance to the work of judges in constitutional cases: Every constitutional case that comes before a court must be decided by recourse to the same moral principles that have dictated results in relevant similar cases in the past. Any group or individual challenging the constitutionality of legislation which adversely affects his or her interests is entitled [...] morally and legally [...] to <b>a</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>decision</b> illustrating why moral principles held constitutionally dispositive in earlier cases regarding similarly situated groups should not be equally dispositive for him or her. When done well, the result of this method is what Dworkin has called an 2 ̆ 2 integrity of principle, 2 ̆ 2 which, in turn, is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition for the moral justification of the constraints of constitutional law in a democratic state. Stated differently, if constitutional law is {{to be a part of}} a morally justified form of democratic self-governance, then the moral principles at its core must be applied even-handedly, and they must be applied even-handedly no matter how difficult, inexpedient, inefficient, or simply politically unpopular it may be, from time to time, to do so. Finally, commitment to such a view defines membership in the 2 ̆ 2 party of principle, 2 ̆ 2 intended as a contrast to the membership of the 2 ̆ 2 party of history, 2 ̆ 2 who defends and locates rights not by reference to general principles even-handedly applied, but rather, by reference to whether the argued right respects distinctions honed and honored by tradition. In these comments, I want first to suggest a non-relativist argument for the necessity of integrity to constitutionalism, intended, frankly, to resolve the above noted tension, and to do so by identifying the grounds for integrity and principle in neither the interpreted constitution nor in liberalism, but in a substantive value that is deeper and broader than both, and hence both informs and constrains both. The constraint of integrity, I will argue, arises not from the 2 ̆ 2 sail 2 ̆ 2 of constitutional precedent itself, which goes wherever the wind blows it, nor from liberalism per se, but from a source external to both, which accordingly constrains the direction which constitutional authority might take. The argument that I will suggest is by no means inconsistent with Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s arguments and indeed is strongly suggested in much of his earlier writing, particularly Law 2 ̆ 7 s Empire. 2 ̆ 2 In the second part of my comments, I will suggest some limitations on this conception of integrity. Finally, I will offer a friendly amendment to Dworkin 2 ̆ 7 s account of integrity...|$|E
