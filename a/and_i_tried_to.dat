But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.|$|E

Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind." [...] Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010, appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian. She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.|$|E
500|$|Made on a {{moderate}} budget, Dear Zindagi {{was produced by}} Gauri Khan of Red Chillies Entertainment, Johar of Dharma Productions and Shinde of Hope Productions. The film was directed by Shinde, her second directorial after the comedy-drama film English Vinglish (2012). When Shinde was asked {{in an interview with}} The Indian Express, whether there is a personal story to Dear Zindagi, she replied, [...] "Dear Zindagi is inspired by life in general. It started with an idea about the connections we make in our lives and how such connections can impact us. That’s something that interested me <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> develop a story around the philosophy." [...] In August 2015, Shinde revealed that she had [...] "almost" [...] completed working on the screenplay.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm going to put my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult." [...] Towelhead was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile another MiG came out of the clouds, turning widely about my ’11 o’clock’ at a {{distance}} of 2,000 yards.

2500|$|Sabine Freudenberger, {{the first}} police officer {{to speak to}} Kampusch after her ordeal, {{said that she was}} {{astonished}} by her [...] "intelligence, her vocabulary". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to Ö1, an ORF station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly had a feeling that she lacked something: [...] "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit for example." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{in federal}} custody in the US, Browder never {{revealed}} {{his status as}} an agent recruiter. He was never prosecuted for espionage. Venona decrypt #588 April 29, 1944, from the KGB New York office states, [...] "for {{more than a year}} Zubilin (station chief) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> get in touch with Victor Perlo and Charles Flato. For some reason Browder did not come to the meeting and just decided to put Bentley in touch with the whole group. All occupy responsible positions in Washington, D.C." [...] Soviet intelligence thought highly of Browder's recruitment work: in a 1946 OGPU memorandum, Browder was personally credited with hiring eighteen intelligence agents for the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Wahlberg as Jack Salmon, Susie's father, {{who becomes}} obsessed with his daughter's murder case. Wahlberg stated that {{his role in}} the film {{encouraged}} him to be a more cautious parent with his three children and to talk to them more about [...] "not talking to strangers." [...] Before Wahlberg's casting, Ryan Gosling was set to play the role but dropped out of the film in October 2007, one month before filming. Gosling had gained weight and grown a beard for the role, but said, [...] "The age of the character versus my real age [...] was always a concern of mine. Peter [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make it work and ultimately it just didn't. I think the film is much better off with Mark Wahlberg in that role." [...] Gosling later admitted that the real reason for his firing was that he had arrived for filming 60lbs. overweight and sporting a beard, without having discussed the physical change with Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparing}} for the recording of episodes, long and acrimonious shouting matches occurred between Milligan and BBC managers {{as he tried to}} get his own way. Was he a diva? [...] "I was in the Goon Show days", he told Dick Lester. [...] "I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were 'a knock on the door and tramps on gravel'– that was it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> transform it." [...] Using techniques already developed by the drama department, he went on to give the show an indelible sense of reality, going {{out of his way to}} achieve maximum believability by the use of FX (live sound effects) and Grams (pre-recorded sound effects), making the show the first comedic production of its kind to try actively to persuade the listeners that the happenings were real, and especially to create alternate realities or surreal audio imagery that would be impossible to realise visually. This approach was echoed on television in Monty Python's Flying Circus which began in 1969, through the surreal animation inserts created by Terry Gilliam.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} test of the series he was {{dismissed}} for 26 again chasing a wide one when looking set also after 4 centuries were scored by England batsmen in the innings at Lord's, he then scored a hundred in the second innings when England were looking to accelerate. Pietersen posted his highest score of 226 in the second Test at Headingley (it was scored in 262 balls, with 24 fours and 2 sixes), surpassing his previous best of 158 which he had achieved three times. With this score, Pietersen moved ahead of Everton Weekes and Viv Richards to be the batsman with the second-highest run-total out of his first 25 Tests (behind Don Bradman). It is also the highest Test score for England since Graham Gooch scored 333 against India in 1990. This innings subjected the West Indies to an innings and 283 runs defeat, their largest against any team. Pietersen, the Man of the Match, said, [...] "I believe the recipe for success is hard work. I've been criticised for throwing my wicket away, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make it count here".|$|E
2500|$|On lap 146, Matt Kenseth {{took the}} lead from Sadler a lap after the action resumed. Almirola was then spun by Kasey Kahne after Almirola made contact with Sam Hornish, Jr. on the backstretch. At this time, rain began to fall on the track under the yellow. On lap 152, the cars came into pit road under the red flag. Some drivers exited their cars while others, {{including}} Kenseth, remained in theirs. During the red flag period, asked what happened with Brian Vickers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. said, [...] "I got a run on him and (Vickers) saw me coming. I had a big old run on him and I went to the inside. I didn't try to make no late move and {{make some kind of}} surprise or anything. I just kind of ease on over and he went to block me and hit me in the fender sending us both off, sent me down into the grass <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> recover my car. I got back into him coming back into the racetrack." [...] When asked what happened was accidental, Earnhardt, Jr. was unrepentant and said, [...] "Yeah, it was accidental. I didn't want to wreck the field." [...] The drivers and fans did not buy Earnhardt Jr.'s excuse and to this day Vickers, the drivers, and fans {{do not believe that the}} crash was accidental. Later that week, Earnhardt Jr. gave a public apology for the incident and decided that he should have thought before he made his move that obviously would have crashed Vickers.|$|E
