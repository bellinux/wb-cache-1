5|$|Lynch {{worked with}} Alan Splet {{to design the}} film's sound. The pair {{arranged}} and fabricated soundproof blanketing to insulate their studio, where they spent almost a year creating and editing the film's sound effects. The soundtrack is densely layered, including as many as fifteen different sounds played simultaneously using multiple reels. Sounds were created {{in a variety of}} ways—for a scene in which a bed slowly dissolves into a pool of liquid, Lynch and Splet inserted a microphone inside a plastic bottle, floated it in a bathtub, and recorded the sound of <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> through the bottle. After being recorded, sounds were further augmented by alterations to their pitch, reverb and frequency.|$|E
25|$|For {{the attack}} of the giant octopus, four live {{octopuses}} were used. The special-effects team was forced to move among the miniature huts by having hot <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> onto them. After the filming of that scene was finished, {{three of the four}} were released. The fourth became special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya's dinner. Along with the live animals, two rubber octopus props were built, with the larger one being covered with plastic wrap to simulate mucous. Some stop-motion tentacles were also created for the scene where the octopus grabs a native and tosses him.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, the English {{steelmakers}} produced blister and crucible steel which required specialized equipment like finery forges and puddling furnaces and cost over £50 per long ton. In the 18th century, innovations like steamboats, railroads, and guns {{increased demand for}} wrought iron and steel. The Mount Savage Iron Works in Maryland was {{the largest in the}} United States in the late 1840s, and the first in the nation to produce heavy rails for the construction of railroads. In the 1850s, American William Kelly and Englishman Henry Bessemer independently discovered that <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> through the molten iron increases its temperature by oxidizing the carbon and separating additional impurities into the slag. The Kelly-Bessemer process, because it reduces the amount of coke needed for blasting and increases the quality of the finished iron, revolutionized the mass production of high-quality steel and facilitated a drastic drop in steel prices and expansion of its availability.|$|E

500|$|Hot Blast was {{the single}} most {{important}} advance in fuel efficiency of the blast furnace {{and was one of the}} most important technologies developed during the Industrial Revolution. [...] Hot blast was patented by James Beaumont Neilson at Wilsontown Ironworks in Scotland in 1828. [...] Within a few years of the introduction, hot blast was developed to the point where fuel consumption was cut by one-third using coke or two-thirds using coal, while furnace capacity was also significantly increased. [...] Within a few decades, the practice was to have a [...] "stove" [...] as large as the furnace next to it into which the waste gas (containing CO) from the furnace was directed and burnt. The resultant heat was used to preheat the <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> into the furnace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed of}} sound is raised by {{humidity}} but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about [...] at standard pressure and temperature, but {{the size of the}} humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> through wind instruments).|$|E

2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of the blast furnace was improved by the change to hot blast, patented by James Beaumont Neilson in Scotland in 1828. [...] This further reduced production costs.

2500|$|More precisely, the {{compressed}} <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> into the furnace reacts with the carbon in the fuel to produce carbon monoxide, which then mixes with the iron oxide, reacting chemically to produce iron and carbon dioxide, which leaks {{out of the}} furnace at the top. In {{the beginning of the}} reaction cycle, the hot blast, also called [...] "wind", containing pre-heated gas from Cowper stoves and air, is blasted into the furnace through tuyeres. The wind will ignite the coke and the Boudouard reaction will take place: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, Andrew Kucher of Ford began {{experimenting with}} the [...] "Levapad" [...] concept, metal disks with {{pressurized}} <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> {{through a hole}} in the center. Levapads do not offer stability on their own. Several must be used together to support a load above them. Lacking a skirt, the pads had to remain very close to the running surface. He initially imagined these being used in place of casters and wheels in factories and warehouses, where the concrete floors offered the smoothness required for operation. By the 1950s, Ford showed a number of toy models of cars using the system, but mainly proposed its use as a replacement for wheels on trains, with the Levapads running close to the surface of existing rails.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the evening}} before this rediscovery, Elam read a chapter {{on the history of}} {{resuscitation}} in which mouth-to-mouth ventilation for newborns was described. He credits this chapter for his [...] "reflex behaviour." [...] Elam’s passion led to his proselytizing about the merits of mouth-to-nose ventilation. He set out to prove that exhaled air was adequate to oxygenate non-breathing persons. In 1951, Elam was on staff in the Department of Anesthesiology at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. As he was about to start his research into CO2 homeostasis, a new department chair was appointed who wanted all research in anesthesiology to be performed using animals, not humans. Elam realized this would not be feasible and moved to Buffalo's Roswell Park Memorial Institute along with his top two collaborators, Elwyn S. Brown, M.D., and Raymond H. Ten Pas, M.D. He obtained permission from his chief of surgery to do studies on postoperative patients before the ether anaesthesia wore off. In this study, he demonstrated that expired <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> into the endotracheal tube maintained normal oxygen saturation.|$|E
60|$|Stephen's visit {{had merely}} awakened perverse desires in him. Strong {{sunlight}} was falling on that little London garden, disclosing its native shadowiness; streaks, and smudges such as Life smears over {{the faces of}} those who live too consciously. Hilary, beneath the acacia-tree not yet in bloom, marked an early butterfly flitting over the geraniums blossoming round an old sundial. Blackbirds were holding evensong; the late perfume of the lilac came stealing forth into air faintly smeeched with chimney smoke. There was brightness, but no glory, in that little garden; scent, but no strong <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> across golden lakes of buttercups, from seas of springing clover, or the wind-silver of young wheat; music, but no full choir of sound, no hum. Like the face and figure of its master, so was this little garden, whose sundial the sun seldom reached-refined, self-conscious, introspective, obviously {{a creature of the}} town. At that moment, however, Hilary was not looking quite himself; his face was flushed, his eyes angry, almost {{as if he had been}} a man of action.|$|E
60|$|With these supernatural {{moonlight}} nights I {{finish the}} story of that dark time, albeit the darkness had not yet gone; to have recalled it and related it briefly as I could once in my life is enough. Let me now {{go back to the}} simile of the lost wretch struggling for life in the mangrove swamp. The first sense of having set my foot on a firmer place in that slough of fetid slime, of a wholesome breath of <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> to me from outside the shadow of the black abhorred forest, was when I began to experience intervals of relief from physical pain, when these grew more and more frequent and would extend to entire days, then to weeks, and for a time I would become oblivious of my precarious state. I was still {{and for a long time}} subject to attacks, when the pain was intolerable and was like steel driven into my heart, always followed by violent palpitations, which would last for hours. But I found that exercise on foot or horseback made me no worse, and I became more and more venturesome, spending most of my time out of doors, although often troubled with the thought that my passion for Nature was a hindrance to me, a turning aside from the difficult way I had been striving to keep.|$|E

60|$|First, They {{unite the}} parts of a fluid to its similar Solid, or keep them {{separate}} from its dissimilar. Hence Quick-silver will (as we noted before) stick to Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, &c. and unite with them: but roul off from Wood, Stone, Glass, &c. if never so little scituated out of its horizontal level; and water that will wet salt and dissolve it, will slip off from Tallow, or the like, without at all adhering; as it may likewise be observed to do upon a dusty superficies. And next they cause {{the parts of}} homogeneal fluid bodies readily to adhere together and mix, and of heterogeneal, to be exceeding averse thereunto. Hence we find, that two small drops of water, on any superficies they can roul on, will, if they chance to touch each other, readily unite and mix into one 3d drop: The like may be observed with two small Bowls of Quick-silver upon a Table or Glass, provided their surfaces be not dusty; and with two drops of Oyl upon fair water, &c. And further, water put unto wine, salt water, vinegar, spirit of wine, or the like, does immediately (especially if they be shaken together) disperse it self all over them. Hence, on the contrary, we also find, that Oyl of Tartar poured upon Quick-silver, and Spirit of Wine on that Oyl, and Oyl of Turpentine on that Spirit, and Air upon that Oyl, though they be stopt closely up into a Bottle, and shaken never so much, they will by no means long suffer any of their bigger parts to be united or included within {{any of the other}} Liquors (by which recited Liquors, may be plainly enough represented the four Peripatetical Elements, and the more subtil Æther above all.) From this property 'tis, that a drop of water does not mingle with, or vanish into Air, but is driven (by that Fluid equally protruding it on every side) and forc't into as little a space as it can possibly be contained in, namely, into a Round Globule. So likewise a little <b>Air</b> <b>blown</b> under the water, is united or thrust into a Bubble by the ambient water. And a parcel of Quick-silver enclosed with Air, Water, or almost any other Liquor, is formed into a round Ball.|$|E
