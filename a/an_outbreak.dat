40|$|In May 2013, Italy {{declared}} <b>a</b> national <b>outbreak</b> {{of hepatitis}} <b>A,</b> which also affected several foreign tourists {{who had recently}} visited the country. Molecular investigations identified some cases as infected with an identical strain of hepatitis A virus subgenotype IA. After additional European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries reported locally acquired and travel-related cases associated with the same <b>outbreak,</b> <b>an</b> international <b>outbreak</b> investigation team was convened, <b>a</b> European <b>outbreak</b> case definition was issued and harmonisation of the national epidemiological and microbiological investigations was encouraged. From January 2013 to August 2014, 1, 589 hepatitis A cases were reported associated with the multistate outbreak; 1, 102 (70 %) of the cases were hospitalised for a median time of six days; two related deaths were reported. Epidemiological and microbiological investigations implicated mixed frozen berries as the vehicle of infection of the outbreak. In order to control {{the spread of the}} outbreak, suspected or contaminated food batches were recalled, the public was recommended to heat-treat berries, and post-exposure prophylaxis of contacts was performed. The outbreak highlighted how large food-borne hepatitis <b>A</b> <b>outbreaks</b> may affect the increasingly susceptible EU/EEA general population and how, with the growing international food trade, frozen berries are a potential high-risk food...|$|R
40|$|Influenza is a {{major cause}} of illness and death in {{residents}} of long term care facilities for the elderly, in part because residents' age and underlying illness increase the risk of serious complications, and in part because institutional living increases the risk of influenza outbreaks. The administration of antiviral medications active against influenza to persons exposed to influenza has been shown to protect them effectively from illness, and mass antiviral prophylaxis of residents is an effective means of terminating influenza <b>A</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in long term care facilities. The only antiviral currently licensed in Canada for influenza prophylaxis is amantadine, a medication active against influenza A but not influenza B. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends that amantadine prophylaxis be offered to residents when influenza <b>A</b> <b>outbreaks</b> occur in long term care facilities. However, there remain a number of unanswered questions about how best to use amantadine for controlling influenza <b>A</b> <b>outbreaks</b> in long term care facilities. In addition, two members of a new class of antivirals called neuraminidase inhibitors have recently been licensed in Canada for the treatment of influenza, and are effective in prophylaxis. Issues in the use of amantadine in the control of <b>outbreaks</b> of influenza <b>A</b> in long term care facilities for the elderly are reviewed, and the potential uses of neuraminidase inhibitors in this setting are discussed...|$|R
