5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of <b>a</b> <b>temple.</b> A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. <b>A</b> <b>temple,</b> on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact <b>a</b> <b>temple.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{failure of}} Vajpayee's {{moderate}} strategy {{led to a}} shift in the ideology of the party toward a policy of more hardline Hindu nationalism. In 1984, Advani was appointed president of the party, and under him it became the political voice of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. In the early 1980s, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) began a campaign for the construction of <b>a</b> <b>temple</b> dedicated to the Hindu deity Rama {{at the site of the}} Babri mosque in Ayodhya. The mosque had been constructed by the Mughal Emperor Babur in 1527. There is a dispute about whether <b>a</b> <b>temple</b> once stood there. The agitation was on the basis of the belief that the site was the birthplace of Rama, and that <b>a</b> <b>temple</b> had been demolished to construct the mosque. The BJP threw its support behind this campaign, and made it a part of their election platform. It won 86 Lok Sabha seats in 1989, a tally which made its support crucial to the National Front government of V. P. Singh.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} was probably built by king Tiridates I {{in the first}} century AD as <b>a</b> <b>temple</b> to the sun god Mihr. After Armenia's conversion to Christianity in the early fourth century, it was converted into a royal summer house of Khosrovidukht, the sister of Tiridates III. According to some scholars it was not <b>a</b> <b>temple</b> but a tomb and thus survived the universal destruction of pagan structures. It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake. Renewed interest in the 19th century led to excavations at the site in early and mid-20th century and its eventual reconstruction between 1969 and 1975. It {{is one of the main}} tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Armenian neopaganism.|$|E
