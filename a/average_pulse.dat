5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an <b>average</b> <b>pulse.</b> Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

50|$|The <b>average</b> <b>pulse</b> is 28-45 {{beats per}} minute (bpm) in a mature horse, but it can reach more than 250 bpm during maximum exertion. Depending on {{cardiovascular}} fitness and the horse's response to exercise, this drops significantly within 15-30 seconds after the horse stops galloping. A two-year-old horse may have a slightly faster pulse, and a 2-4-week-old foal normally has a pulse between 70 and 90 bpm. Heart rate may also increase when the horse is excited, overheated or suffering severe dehydration, has a fever, has an infection or septicemia, has experienced {{a great deal of}} blood loss, has advanced heart or lung disease, or is in shock. In these cases, the resting heart rate may be above 80 in an adult animal. When the heart rate is below 20 bpm, the horse may be hypothermic, or have pressure on the brain, heart disease, or collapsed circulation.|$|E

40|$|Properties of circularly {{polarized}} waves are {{studied in the}} pulsar magnetosphere plasma. It is shown that some observational characteristics of the circular polarization observed in the pulsar radio emission can be qualitatively explained {{in the framework of}} the model based on anomalous Doppler resonance. Performed analysis provides that if the difference between Lorentz factors of electrons and positrons is relatively high, one of the {{circularly polarized}} waves becomes super-luminal and therefore can not be generated by cyclotron instability. We suggest that this case corresponds to the pulsars with the domination of one hand of circular polarization through the whole <b>averaged</b> <b>pulse</b> profile at all observed frequencies. For intermediate values of the difference between Lorentz factors both circularly polarized waves are generated, but the waves of one handness are much more effectively generated for high frequencies, whereas generation of another handness dominates for low frequencies. This should correspond to the pulsars with strong frequency dependence of the degree of circular polarization. The case of relatively small difference between Lorentz factors corresponds to the pulsars with sign reversal of the circular polarization in the centre of <b>averaged</b> <b>pulse</b> profiles.
