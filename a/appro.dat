50|$|<b>APPrO</b> {{describes}} {{its role}} as one {{in which it has}} “raised awareness and understanding of its members' concerns with senior decision-makers in government, regulatory bodies and the public at large.” One of its publications says “Through its consistent record of insightful and constructive input, top-notch spokespeople, landmark conferences and widely respected publications, <b>APPrO</b> has earned status as a key stakeholder in Ontario's energy sector that ensures it will be consulted on any major developments of concern.” <b>APPrO</b> has formally intervened in a large number of public hearings and policy development consultations.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>Appro</b> {{launched}} its first flagship product, the Xtreme-X Supercomputer based on x86 processors.

50|$|The Association of Power Producers of Ontario (abbreviated <b>APPrO)</b> is a {{trade and}} {{professional}} body representing commercial electricity generators in Ontario, {{and the largest}} organization of its type in Canada. <b>APPrO</b> was established in 1986 as the Independent Power Producers’ Society of Ontario (IPPSO) and {{changed its name to}} <b>APPrO</b> in 2003. It projects a unified voice of advocacy for Ontario-based generators of all types, addressing a range of public policy and regulatory issues of concern to the power industry. The organization also operates industry conferences and produces a number of publications, both hardcopy and electronic. The <b>APPrO</b> conference is the largest annual event of its type in Canada, and its magazine, IPPSO FACTO, is considered by many in the industry {{to be one of the}} most authoritative periodicals on electricity business and policy issues in Canada.|$|E
50|$|<b>APPrO</b> {{currently}} has about 100 corporate members {{including some of}} the most well-known names in the Canadian power business such as TransCanada Corporation, Bruce Power and Brookfield Renewable Power, along with many lesser-known companies. <b>APPrO</b> members produce electricity from a range of sources including natural gas, hydroelectricity (waterpower), cogeneration, windpower, solar energy, biomass (wood waste), biogas, nuclear energy, and other sources.|$|E

50|$|All {{research}} projects are conducted from a systems perspective. <b>APPRO</b> recognizes {{that in any}} policy environment intended solutions create new and unaccounted for problems. As a result, research at <b>APPRO</b> {{is focused on the}} close examination of the interface between new and pre-existing forms of organization. Particular attention is thus paid to identifying and mapping autochthonous structures and optimal ways in which policy solutions are absorbed by the system to establish what works and why.|$|E
50|$|Work under Aid Effectiveness is {{intended}} to inform the government, civil society, and the international development community about successes and pitfalls of aid through a systemic examination of the flows, processes, and outputs of the aid system. To this end, <b>APPRO</b> has evaluated {{a large number of}} programs and projects implemented by national and international organizations in Afghanistan since 2001. While the findings from these evaluations remain confidential to APPRO’s clients, the evaluations have provided <b>APPRO</b> with in-depth insights into operational issues and challenges associated with development aid provision in a variety of contexts including humanitarian aid, women’s rights, vocational training, security sector reform, access to justice, natural resource management and education. Based on the learning from these evaluations, <b>APPRO</b> provides training modules on the dynamics of the policy process and program / project design.|$|E
50|$|<b>APPrO</b> has {{frequently}} put forward {{the view that}} the greatest benefits for consumers of electricity are likely to be achieved through the development of open and competitive markets for the production of electricity. Since it was established in 1986, <b>APPrO</b> {{has been one of the}} most vocal and consistent advocates for increasing the use of renewable energy in Ontario. Originally incorporated as the Independent Power Producers’ Society of Ontario, the organization grew in scale and scope during the 1990s.|$|E

The organization is governed by a Board of 28 directors, and is operated on a day-to-day basis by a President, an Executive Director and support staff. 14 of the directors are appointed as direct representatives of major generator members or staff, and the remainder are elected from various categories of <b>APPrO</b> members. The first full-time (and current) president of <b>APPrO</b> is David Butters. The Executive Director is Jake Brooks.|$|E
50|$|This theme {{explores the}} {{organization}} of economic activity in rural and urban settings in Afghanistan at the macro-, meso- and micro-scales of analysis. <b>APPRO</b> views the Afghan political economy {{as a product of}} the interaction between various economic actors with vested interests constrained or enabled by different factors. Effecting change in the political economy thus requires in-depth understanding of the physical and material conditions, the institutions of governance and the policy decisions. To date, <b>APPRO</b> has carried out a number of research projects on informal labor markets, micro enterprises, urban economic development, service provision in urban areas, rural economic development, and value chain analysis of selected agricultural products.|$|E
5000|$|Over the years, APPrO's {{efforts have}} {{affected}} important {{decisions in the}} areas of ramp rates, natural gas supply services, net load billing for network transmission services, market design, and large number of technical rules and procedures. <b>APPrO</b> has worked closely with the Ontario government to ensure that the concerns and perspectives of its members are reflected in the contracting process for various procurement processes. <b>APPrO</b> says it intends to continue to advocate for “fair access to the market for all generators, reasonable terms for interconnection to the electric grid, a more efficient system in the future, and lower costs for all users of the electric system in Ontario.” ...|$|E
