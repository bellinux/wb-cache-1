Nevertheless, the standard-wheelbase model achieved output of 9,281 cars during a production run of slightly more than three years, while the long-wheelbase model achieved 6,341 cars during a shorter production run of slightly above two years.|$|E

In this paper, we derive a new general method for both on-line and off-line backward gradient computation of a system output, or cost function, with respect to system parameters, using a circuit theoretic approach. The system can be any causal, in general non-linear and time-variant, dynamic system represented by a Signal Flow Graph, in particular any feedforward, time delay or recurrent neural network. The gradient is obtained in a straightforward way by the analysis of two numerical circuits, the original one and its adjoint (obtained from the first by simple transformations) without the complex chain rule expansions of derivatives usually employed. 1...|$|E
