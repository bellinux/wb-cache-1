The first generation of these Bi-Level intercity cars, were dubbed the [...] "California Cars".When delivered these cars were plagued with problems and Caltrans actually refused the first <b>attempted</b> <b>delivery</b> due to cracks in the frame. That forced Morrison-Knudsen to ship the cars back to the manufacturing plant for repair. After Caltrans accepted delivery, these trains were first put in service on the San Diegan line (the predecessor to the Pacific Surfliner) and crews immediately encountered automatic doors that failed to function properly, causing delays in service. Attempted repairs failed to fix the problematic doors and failures continued for years with doors between train cars later failing to operate properly as well.|$|E
50|$|The United States Tax Court more {{concisely}} {{articulated the}} doctrine of constructive receipt in Davis v. Commissioner. The court stated that for income to be constructively received, the funds must {{be made available to}} the taxpayer without substantial limitations. At issue was whether or not a taxpayer faced such substantial limitations when a check was available to her at the post office {{on the last day of}} the tax year after the mail carrier attempted to deliver the certified letter containing it to her home earlier the same day. The taxpayer was not at home when the first delivery attempt was made and the carrier left a note that the letter would be at the post office for her. The taxpayer retrieved the check from the post office several days later, just after the new tax year began. Courts had previously held that when a taxpayer makes a decision to be unavailable to take delivery of a check, then he will not satisfy the substantial limitations requirement and he will be deemed to have had constructive receipt at the time of <b>attempted</b> <b>delivery.</b> However, in this case, the court noted that the check sender specifically informed the taxpayer on a prior occasion that the check would be arriving approximately two months later than it actually did. The taxpayer had no notice to expect that the check would be delivered; therefore she could not have made a decision to be unavailable to take receipt. The court held that this lack of notice, under the circumstances, meant that she faced substantial limitations on the availability of the funds and that they were not constructively received during the first tax year.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveEndoluminal {{grafting}} {{is emerging}} as a less invasive alternative {{to the treatment of}} descending thoracic aorta diseases. Endoleaks (continued pressurization of the treated aorta external to the endoluminal graft) are a potential complication. We reviewed our cumulative endovascular experience for descending thoracic aorta pathologies with respect to the management of endoleaks and associated patient outcomes. MethodsAs part of a single-site investigational device–exemption protocol, 249 patients (146 men, 103 women) with thoracic aortic diseases underwent <b>attempted</b> <b>delivery</b> of a TAG endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) between February 2000 and August 2005. Indications for study enrollment included 111 atherosclerotic aneurysms (44. 6 %), 67 aortic dissections (26. 9 %), 27 penetrating aortic ulcers (10. 8 %), 14 contained ruptures (5. 6 %), 11 pseudoaneurysms (4. 4 %), 9 acute aortic transections (3. 6 %), 7 aortobronchial fistulas (2. 8 %), 2 endoleaks (0. 8 %) after prior thoracic endoluminal grafting, and 1 (0. 4 %) adult coarctation. Endoleak surveillance was performed using serial computed tomography scans. ResultsMean patient age was 68 years (range, 23 - 91 years). Endoleak developed in 38 patients (15. 3 %) : 15 distal type I (39. 5 %), 13 proximal type I (34. 2 %), 8 type II (21. 1 %) and 2 type III (5. 3 %). No surgical intervention was performed in 26 patients (68. 4 %), in which the endoleak spontaneously resolved in 14 (53. 8 %), 8 (30. 8 %) are being monitored and are asymptomatic, 3 (11. 5 %) died of unrelated causes, 2 (7. 7 %) withdrew from the study, and 1 (3. 8 %) was lost to follow-up. Twelve patients (31. 6 %) required reintervention using an additional endoluminal graft: 8 (66. 7 %) with a proximal type I endoleak, 2 (16. 7 %) with a distal type I endoleak, 1 (8. 3 %) with both distal type I and type III endoleaks, and 1 (8. 3 %) with a type III endoleak. Open conversions were necessary secondary to device deployment difficulties in two patients (0. 8 %), and due to expansion of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm and rupture of an aneurysm secondary to a type II endoleak in one patient (0. 5 %) each. ConclusionEndoleaks are an infrequent, yet important, complication after thoracic endografting. Many endoleaks will resolve spontaneously, but some patients may require another endovascular intervention. Close surveillance is recommended for these patients; however, open conversion is rarely indicated. Because more diseases of the thoracic aorta are being treated using an endovascular approach, a standardized treatment algorithm is essential to safely and effectively manage associated endoleaks...|$|E
