500|$|In 1954 Holloway {{joined the}} Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After {{playing at the}} Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the {{production}} to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. [...] Holloway said of the experience: [...] "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> pleasant at my age." [...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy. [...] American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Lana Wachowski, a trans woman, {{has written}} her first {{transgender}} character {{in her career}} in the series: Nomi Marks. For that she partly used her own experiences. [...] "It has some very intense, autobiographical scenes, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult and surreal," [...] said Lana. Jamie Clayton, who plays Nomi, has provided {{the example of a}} scene where a young Nomi is bullied by boys in a gym shower, as a scene that was based on experiences from Lana's life. Freema Agyeman, who plays Nomi's girlfriend Amanita, has shared that her character was based heavily on Lana's wife, Karin Winslow. Straczynski has stated that like Lana felt the close to Nomi when writing, he felt the closest to Wolfgang Bogdanow, because both him and Wolfgang had a bad relationship with their respective fathers. [...] "Wolfgang was my true north in the storytelling," [...] said Straczynski. Straczynski did not reveal who was the character Lilly Wachowski felt the closest to during the writing process, saying it's up to her to do that. Since then, Lilly has come out as transgender too. The beginning of her transitioning process preceded the release of the first season, and Clayton had known about it early on.|$|E

That made him being with Addison at the end even better, because she was using him to sate a desire <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> clear." [...] Krause positively reviewed the idea of Ellis Grey's becoming temporarily lucid, deeming it [...] "amazing": [...] "She was not very endearing when she was lucid, that's for certain. She was unbelievably cruel to Meredith, telling her how disappointed she was that Meredith was merely ordinary. Ouch. But she did a great thing this episode too, during her short time as a sane person. She gave Cristina the answer she was looking for." [...] The arc involving Callie and George's sudden marriage, named by Krause [...] "a roller coaster", was described as being a way to emphasize {{the contrast between the}} two. Krause also noted the contrast between Stevens' kindhearted personality in the past, and the cruelty she proves to have in the episode, which was noted to have been [...] "a highlight in perfect fashion", as well as a reminder for the multi-dimensional personalities of the characters. Also noted was Cristina's way of accepting Burke's proposal, following Ellis' answer, which gave her the hope she had been previously looking for.|$|E

[...] Landini wrote 141 surviving ballate, but only 12 madrigals; his compositions appear in every corner of the Italian peninsula. [...] Other composers of this group besides Landini included Gherardello da Firenze, Lorenzo da Firenze, and Donato da Cascia. [...] Also by this generation of composers, the influence of French music was becoming apparent in the secular work of the native Italians. Greater independence of voices was characteristic of the music of this generation, and points of imitation are common; in addition, the uppermost voice is often highly ornamented. [...] Landini's music was particularly admired for its lyricism and expressive intensity: [...] his fame has endured for six hundred years, and numerous modern recordings exist of his work.|$|E

According to Basham, filming began on May 21, 2001, and {{took place on}} location in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. During a documentary featured on a special edition DVD of the film, Kazan said Lopez was [...] "very good" [...] at creating the character on film [...] "through unscripted details, physical gestures and fiddling with props."

[...] However, years later Lopez confessed that during the filming of Enough, she overworked and had a nervous breakdown. In 2008, she stated: [...] "I was suffering {{from a lack of}} sleep. And I did have a kind of nervous breakdown. I froze up on set. Well, not on a set, but in my trailer. I was like, I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything.

2500|$|In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher {{he lived}} with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: [...] "Basically {{it came down to}} this: she was a {{well-balanced}} woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of ordinary life." [...] Baker has described Schwarzenegger as [...] " [...] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" [...] but claims {{towards the end of the}} relationship he became [...] "insufferable– classically conceited– the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had [...] "little understanding of polite society" [...] and she found him a turn-off, she says, [...] "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me." ...|$|E
