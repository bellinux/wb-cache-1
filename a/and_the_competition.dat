5|$|British {{encroachment}} {{into areas}} of South Africa already settled by the Afrikaner Boers <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> for resources and land that developed between {{them as a}} result, led to the Second Boer War in 1899. Pre-empting the deployment of British forces, the Afrikaner Republics of the Orange Free State and the Transvaal Republic under President Paul Kruger declared war on 11 October 1899, striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony. After the outbreak of war, plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office {{and each of the}} six colonial governments sent separate contingents to serve with British formations, with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria, and one each from the other colonies. The first troops arrived three weeks later, with the New South Wales Lancers—who had been training in England before the war, hurriedly diverted to South Africa. On 22 November, the Lancers came under fire for the first time near Belmont, and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them.|$|E
5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Competition</b> Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E

5|$|The Slovenian {{football}} champions are {{the winners}} of the highest league of association football in Slovenia, PrvaLiga. Also known by the abbreviation 1. SNL, PrvaLiga is contested on a round robin basis and the championship awarded to the club that is top of the league {{at the end of the}} season. The league was established after the independence of Slovenia in 1991, originally containing 21 clubs. Before that, top Slovenian teams competed in Yugoslavia with only Ilirija, AŠK Primorje and after a forced merger of the two teams in 1936, Ljubljana ever reaching the country's highest division, Yugoslav First League. Olimpija, Maribor and Nafta Lendava were the only Slovenian teams who participated in the top division between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. While being a part of the Yugoslav football system, most of the Slovenian clubs competed for the title of regional champions in the Slovenian Republic Football League. However, the republic league was officially the third tier of football most of the time <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> was usually without the top Slovenian clubs, who played in the Yugoslav Second League or the country's top division.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1940 Lindwall made his first grade rugby league debut in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the St. George club {{alongside}} his older brother Jack, {{who had been with}} the club since 1938. He played at fullback and assumed goal-kicking responsibilities. Lindwall's cricketing improved during the 1940–41 season, taking 34 wickets at 16.45, approximately doubling his wickets while halving their cost. By this time, many of his colleagues had enlisted in the armed services <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>competition</b> was beginning to thin out during World War II. Lindwall missed the 1941 NSWRFL season due to illness, and in doing so missed out on the team that won the premiership that season. In October 1941, Lindwall was selected to make his first-class cricket debut against Queensland in Brisbane, just after turning 20. Playing along his childhood hero McCabe, Lindwall put in a wayward performance. He conceded an expensive 81 runs in 15 wicketless overs and made just one run with the bat. The Sheffield Shield season was cancelled a month later after the December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack, that signalled the widening of the war into the Pacific arena. The Sydney grade cricket competition continued, and Lindwall helped St. George to a hat-trick of premierships with 27 wickets at 22.19 and 405 runs at 27.00.|$|E
