40|$|The primary {{implementations}} of AspectJ to date {{are based}} on a compile- or load-time weaving process that produces Java byte code. Although this implementation strategy has been crucial to the adoption of AspectJ, it faces inherent performance constraints that stem from a mismatch between Java byte code and AspectJ semantics. We discuss these mismatches and show their performance impact on advice dispatch, and we present a machine code model that can be targeted by virtual machine JIT compilers to alleviate this inefficiency. We also present an implementation based on the Jikes RVM which targets this machine code model. Performance evaluation with a set of micro benchmarks shows that our machine code model provides improved performance over translation <b>of</b> <b>advice</b> <b>dispatch</b> to Java byte code...|$|R

30|$|The study <b>of</b> {{economic}} <b>dispatch</b> {{dates back}} to the 1920 s. The spatial and temporal distribution variation of load demand is the prime cause <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch.</b> The goal <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> is the advanced decision-making for base-point generations of units and configuration of spinning reserves based on load forecast. From classical economic dispatch centering on the concepts of incremental cost, incremental loss and hydro-coal conversion equivalent in the mid and late of 1950 s [1], to the optimal power flow considering network security in the 1960 s [2], thence to the theories <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and control which emphasizing the coordination <b>of</b> <b>dispatch</b> and automatic generation control (AGC) in the 1980 s [3, 4], the study <b>of</b> economic <b>dispatch</b> has been relatively mature in theory and practice.|$|R
