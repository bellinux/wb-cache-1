5|$|Tapp is {{beginning}} to learn that these people all have a dark connection to him. He proceeds to {{the offices of the}} building and finds Oswald McGullicuty in the next Jigsaw trap. Jigsaw felt that Oswald was perverting his message, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> placed into a Folding Table Trap, which would snap his body in half if Tapp failed to save him. Tapp saves Oswald, but he is swiftly killed by a compacting metal slab before either have a chance to react.|$|E
5|$|For most of George's regency and reign, Lord Liverpool {{controlled}} {{the government as}} Prime Minister, with little help from George. His ministers found his behaviour selfish, unreliable and irresponsible. At all times he was much {{under the influence of}} favourites. Taxpayers were angry at his wasteful spending at a time when Britons were fighting in the Napoleonic Wars. He did not provide national leadership in time of crisis, nor act as a role model for his people. Liverpool's government presided over Britain's ultimate victory, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed. After Liverpool's retirement, George was forced to accept Catholic emancipation despite opposing it. His only legitimate child, Princess Charlotte, died before him in 1817 <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> succeeded by his younger brother, William.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, {{but in the case}} of Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused {{but in the case of}} Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E

25|$|The bandits {{are a small}} {{community}} of thieves led by the Bandit King, Brendan, a wild, tough man, whose curly orange hair is always tangled in leaves and twigs from the forest. Curtis helps him {{and a few other}} bandit prisoners escape from Alexandra's prison, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> named a bandit. Their {{small community}} isn't very thriving, especially with the economy being down. The bandits are threatened by the Dowager Governess' ivy, as well as the whole forest, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> cornered into having to fight along the citizens of North Wood and Prue.|$|R
5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High {{received}} its world premi√®re at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, an annual film festival for documentary productions held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In the US it was screened on 29 April 2008 at the Tribeca Film Festival, and 1 August 2008 at the Traverse City Film Festival. The first time Winter and O'Mahoney met {{one of the}} film's subjects was at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, nearly {{a year after the}} filming had completed. Ali and his family had relocated to the US since completing the documentary, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to attend the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The producers had tried to get the boys visas to enter the UK for a screening in London, but they were denied entry by the British Government.|$|E
5|$|The term {{in office}} of Senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850. He sought reappointment, but he had aligned himself too {{strongly}} with the Fire-eaters, and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state. The moderates who favored working within the Union still dominated Florida politics, and they successfully sought to put Mallory {{in place of the}} radical Yulee. The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular, and Yulee protested, carrying his protest {{all the way to the}} Senate itself. That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> seated.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City had {{previously}} reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, {{and two years}} earlier in 1925, they were defeated finalists. The 1927 final was the first for Arsenal, so as a result whoever won the match would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman {{held a press conference}} prior to the final on 21 April, where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. He doubted whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both of those were still recovering, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. In the end, both Baker and Hoar were named to the Arsenal team. The Arsenal team trained in Highbury on their own pitch prior to the final.|$|E

5|$|Red Chillies Entertainment {{continued}} to work on other projects before finalising the production aspects of Ra.One. After providing the visual effects for My Name Is Khan (2010), the studio focused solely on Ra.One and did not take up any other films. Khan initially approached a number of directors to helm the film, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar, but they declined; eventually, Sinha was made the film's director. To prepare the film's premises and characterisation, Sinha spent several months viewing video clips, digital art portals and comic books. Sinha and Khan also watched around 200 superhero films {{from all over the}} world. The storyboards were designed by Atul Chouthmal, who was contracted after he met Khan at Yash Raj Studios. While the former began work on the storyboards, the producers hired a storyboard artist from Hollywood. Chouthmal revealed that Khan and the other artist differed on their visions of the film, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> brought back. Before filming, Khan reportedly took tips from actor Kamal Hassan regarding the production of large-scale films, having been impressed by Hassan's Dasavathaaram (2008).|$|E
5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E
25|$|Hibbert however {{was unhappy}} with what he {{perceived}} as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend Andy Rourke.|$|E
50|$|Alcorn {{recorded}} steadily {{after his}} dates with Ory, {{but many of}} them were released on small-issue labels with poor sound quality.

25|$|Timoji {{regained his}} post as tanadar-mor but his lowly caste {{as well as}} his mistreatment of underlings caused {{tensions}} within the Hindu society, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> replaced with his rival Melrao, who had at his disposal 5,000 men to assist with the defence.|$|E
25|$|The {{reorganization}} caused {{yet another}} conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin {{to command the}} Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> recalled from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|In {{late summer}} 1982, Mike Joyce was adopted as the band's drummer after a {{successful}} audition. In October 1982 they then gave their first public performance, as a support act for Blue Rondo √† la Turk at Manchester's The Ritz. Hibbert however {{was unhappy with}} what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend Andy Rourke.|$|E

50|$|Tucker's {{parents have}} divorced, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{forced to move}} into his despised aunt Claire's house, with her decidedly calmer {{airplane}} pilot husband Jimmy and strange cousin Leon. Originally disappointed at the arrangement, he spots their gorgeous neighbour McKenna. From that point forward, he valiantly attempts to become her boyfriend, competing with Seth Green.|$|R
25|$|Thus {{it came as}} no real {{surprise}} when his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, not apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> paid for his commission and the mural papered over at the instigation of Nelson, who was to become the Center's flamboyant president.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October Admiral Nelson ordered Long to take Vincejo on a fortnight's cruise off Toulon and the √éles d'Hy√®res. One month later, on 16 November, Vincejo {{communicated with}} Nelson at Palermo that six French vessels (two Venetian ships armed en flute, two frigates, and two corvettes) had left Toulon. Long {{believed}} that they were sailing to Malta to reinforce the French there <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> sailing there too to warn the Marquise of Niza, the commander of the Portuguese squadron that Nelson had sent to Valletta to initiate a blockade.|$|E
25|$|Caslon {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp the moulds or matrices used to cast metal type. He worked {{in the tradition of}} what is now called old-style serif letter design, that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen. Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London, which previously had not been common, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time. His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{known to}} the world for his cartoonish {{paintings}} of an existential, lugubrious nature that used a limited palette and were created in the period after 1968. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a lecturer and teacher {{at a number of}} universities <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also regarded for his words and teachings, collected in the book Philip Guston: Collected Writings, Lectures, and Conversations (Documents of Twentieth-Century Art).|$|R

25|$|Armstrong‚Äôs {{father was}} set on him {{following}} {{a career in the}} law, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> articled to Armorer Donkin, a solicitor friend of his father‚Äôs. He spent five years in London studying law and returned to Newcastle in 1833. In 1835 he became a partner in Donkin‚Äôs business and the firm became Donkin, Stable and Armstrong. Armstrong married Margaret Ramshaw in 1835, and they built a house in Jesmond Dene, on the eastern edge of Newcastle. Armstrong worked for eleven years as a solicitor, but during his spare time he showed great interest in engineering.|$|E
25|$|In his mid-teens, German's parents {{attempted}} to apprentice {{him to a}} shipbuilding firm, as they believed their son had an aptitude for engineering. His studies at a boarding-school in Chester had been delayed by a serious illness, however, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> turned away as too old to begin an apprenticeship. In his teens he formed a second band, a quintette, including himself on the violin, his sister on the pianoforte or the bass, and three friends of the family. He prepared the orchestrations for this band. He also led the town orchestra, did some amateur acting, and sang comic songs in local village halls.|$|E
