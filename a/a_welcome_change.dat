5|$|Determined {{to become}} part of the fashion industry, but unable to make a breakthrough, Everest decided to use his {{knowledge}} of tailoring. He answered an advertisement placed in the London Evening Standard, in 1982, by Tommy Nutter; 'Boy wanted in Savile Row'. He pestered Nutter for weeks, until he was given the job. Nutter's client base included rock stars, celebrities, politicians and businessmen; he famously dressed The Beatles and The Stones. Everest also mixed with future celebrities of the fashion world. John Galliano, who had been studying at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, passed on some design skills to Everest, while on work placement with Nutter. Everest met his future wife Catherine (now an actress and film producer) at this time, while she was also working with Nutter. The couple have two daughters. Everest's time under Nutter, a Savile Row revolutionary in the 1960s, inspired him to experiment with tone and pattern in his own designs. In 1986, after nearly five years as Nutter's apprentice, Everest was persuaded to move on to work for Malcolm Levene. He had become disillusioned with Savile Row, particularly with their lack of appreciation for Nutter's more modern approach. Everest found that working with Levene, a small menswear retailer based away from Savile Row, on Chiltern Street, provided <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>change.</b> During Everest's first year there, Levene's turnover doubled.|$|E

His first film under the new {{contract}} was the quickly produced The Murder Man (1935), which included the feature film debut of James Stewart. Thalberg then began a strategy of pairing Tracy with the studio's top actresses: Whipsaw (1935) co-starred Myrna Loy and was a commercial success. Riffraff (1936) put Tracy opposite Jean Harlow. Both films were, however, designed and promoted to showcase their leading ladies, thus continuing Tracy's reputation as a secondary star.|$|E

RPGFan derided Arikado's [...] "cool and impassive personality" [...] as stereotypical, but praised the game's character development as setting {{him apart from}} previous supporting characters in the series. The switch to an anime style for the character designs in Dawn of Sorrow was notably criticized, as many reviewers preferred the designs made by Ayami Kojima.

Eurogamer's Bramwell considered the graphics [...] "generally pleasant to look at", but considered it inferior to games like Gran Turismo 3 and Ico.

Game Revolution's Ben Silverman called the city a [...] "technological marvel ... that captures the essence of gritty city life in amazing detail".|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April 2013. Handlen remarked on the episode's farcical title and content, noting that the script was largely without substance. However, he granted that the episode served as <b>a</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>change</b> of pace from the ongoing [...] "agonies of war" [...] in the series. He notes that the main plot involving Grilka was [...] "wafer thin" [...] but nonetheless effective in creating humor and introducing the relationship between Dax and Worf. Still, Handlen thought Worf's strong attraction to Grilka lacked sufficient justification, given Worf's long-standing desire to maintain solitude on the station. In addition, Handlen disliked the subplot concerning Miles O'Brien and Major Kira, suggesting that the romantic tension between the two was forced and inconsistent with their personalities.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for the 2009 production was generally good. Paul Vale of The Stage wrote, [...] "John Stanley’s new play represents a sterling attempt to marry farcical comedy with weightier themes." [...] QX Magazine criticized the play as [...] "falling short of brilliant" [...] {{due to its}} dual nature of being a drama and a comedy, however eventually concluding that, [...] "...it makes <b>a</b> very <b>welcome</b> <b>change</b> for <b>a</b> gay play to aim to inspire rather than depress!

[...] On {{the other side of the}} coin, Bert Gangl of Jesus Freak Hideout found that [...] "while there's absolutely nothing wrong with the pop idiom, in and of itself, or even trading in one's punk roots for a kinder, gentler sound, much of what appears on the new record, pleasant though it is, fails to make much of a lasting impression." [...] New Release Tuesday's Jonathan Francesco asked a question about the album [...] "is it any good?", which he wrote that [...] "the short answer is: definitely."

Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] rating, stating [...] that the album doesn't change Bieber's beloved [...] "kiddie-soul vocals" [...] calling it [...] "perfunctory", but said that acoustic renditions such as [...] "Baby", [...] "One Time" [...] and new song [...] "Pray" [...] deliver their [...] "saccharine payload."

He writes that a few months later, the song played on shuffle and he realized that he had previously brushed off what he now believed {{to be one of the}} best and most underrated songs of 2016. Robbie Daw of the same publication was complimentary of Aguilera's vocal performance, opining that she [...] "sings beautifully amidst a swirling wall of sound."
