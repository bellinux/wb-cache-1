500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so {{if you were going to}} see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> turns out to be Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if we feel like it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of the}} {{surnames}} {{of known}} English serial killers {{for some of the}} main characters – Shipman, West and Sutcliffe — was condemned by some victims and their relatives. Ruth Jones said the choice was deliberate: [...] "I suppose we were hoping that people wouldn't realise <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> does come to light, it's even more delicious...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2014, Jason Autry's attorney, John Herbison, accused the {{prosecutor}} of arresting the defendants without probable cause as an unethical [...] "investigatory technique" [...] then adding and dropping charges strategically before hearings {{to avoid having to}} produce evidence against the defendants. In October 2014, when evidence tampering charges were dropped against Dylan Adams just days after he was charged with rape, Herbison said: [...] "If those reports are correct, it means that they're just playing games", Herbison said. [...] "They charged him with something less serious in order to keep him locked up, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes times to answer questions about the charge, they dismiss that and charge him with a more serious charge in circuit court, where he's not entitled to a preliminary hearing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Leland, drily, [...] "I almost {{think it}} is. A {{good deal of}} this stuff is tinder-dry, and you can't plough through the bluff. I don't know if you have ever seen a bad fire in the underbrush? You can't beat it out, as you can now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it's</b> in the grass." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, doosn't she though!" [...] cried Bruno; and he leant {{forwards}} {{and added}} in a solemn whisper, [...] "The moon's face gets dirtier and dirtier every night, till it's black all across. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it's</b> dirty all over--so--" [...] (he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke) [...] "then she washes it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Army depots in {{the city}} held 450,000 rifles and two {{thousand}} cannons. On 18 March, Thiers sent army units to move the cannons out of Paris. Many cannons were removed without difficulty, but on Montmartre, where the largest park of cannons was located the army encountered crowds of armed and hostile guardsmen. Fighting broke out, and two army generals were seized and killed by the Guardsman. A general uprising began, and the revolutionaries seized the major government buildings. The guardsmen {{did not know that}} Thiers was still in Paris, at the new foreign ministry on the Quai d'Orsay; if they had known he certainly would have been captured and probably killed. Instead, he escaped the city via the Bois de Boulogne and made his way to Versailles. Thiers then followed the same plan that he had proposed to Louis-Philippe during the 1848 Revolution, but which the King had rejected; [...] Instead of fighting the insurrection immediately [...] in Paris with the troops he had, he ordered regular army to withdraw to Versailles, to gather its forces, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was ready, to recapture the city.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was too late, {{he began}} to blame himself for not having insisted on staying behind as George proposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't mention it! I don't mind doing 'Every Other Week' a good {{turn now}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes in my way." [...] Fulkerson went out again, {{and this time}} March was finally left with Mr. Dryfoos.|$|E

5000|$|Before posting the {{official}} cover art on January 25, 2013, Buckcherry also posted artwork for an outer cover, they {{described as a}} [...] "...book [...] "cover" [...] - <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it's</b> opened you'll get the true cover of the album itself." [...] The day after, the band posted a picture of {{the official}} artwork, stating [...] "We wanted our album cover artwork to be symbolic and encompass {{the subject matter of the}} record in an image that's cool enough to be tattooed. Hope you like it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album's title {{may have}} come from a lyric in Ani DiFranco's song [...] "Gratitude": [...] "But I don't come and go like a pop song/that you can play incessantly <b>and</b> <b>then</b> forget <b>when</b> <b>it's</b> gone." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{a sudden}} he remembered that his hat was still on his head, and he {{snatched}} his hand out of Henri's to remove it, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was off, {{he wanted to go}} back to the hall to put it down.|$|E
6000|$|From {{what could}} be heard I knew that a man, or men, were making {{their way to the}} boat from the highway, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> seemed as if he or they were aboard, the voice which had given the command, said in greeting: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wouldn't {{the best}} way to settle the matter be to kindle the fire just now, before it grows dark," [...] {{suggested}} Will Osten, [...] "so that they will have a chance of seeing the smoke, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> grows dark, the fire will be getting brighter?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Were you upset <b>when</b> {{they did}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> they pulled <b>it</b> <b>and</b> {{replaced}} it with another photo?" ...|$|R

50|$|A {{drop kick}} in rugby union {{is a type}} of kick that {{involves}} someone dropping a ball <b>and</b> <b>then</b> kicking <b>when</b> <b>it</b> hits the ground, in contrast to a punt wherein the dropper kicks the ball without letting it hit the ground first.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jonas, [...] "here is some brown paper, {{which will}} do." [...] So Jonas rolled it up, and told Rollo {{to set it}} on fire, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was well burning, to step on it with his foot, and put the flame out.|$|E
60|$|This was {{all that}} Stephen saw. And yet the very plainness of the man's {{appearance}} only added to his curiosity. Who was this stranger? His words, his action, too, had been remarkable. The art of administering a rebuke like that was not given to many men. It was perfectly quiet, perfectly final. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was over, he had turned his back and dismissed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, master. I {{will go out}} {{tomorrow}} morning and choose my stone, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> begins to get dark I will go out and bury my money there. It would not do to hide it in the daytime, for even were there {{no one on the}} road someone upon the hills might catch sight of me and come down afterwards to see what I was disposing of." ...|$|E
30|$|For me the {{key word}} is ancestry. I am looking at ancestry {{as a tool to}} {{discover}} genes, that’s all that I’m doing… when you uncouple the issue of ancestry, where the genes of your ancestors, 5, 6 generations are coming from, then it is becoming a research tool and that’s all. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> is <b>when</b> <b>it’s</b> becoming useful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh if I didn't--!" [...] But {{the door}} closed on the dark idea. Yearningly <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> only <b>when</b> <b>it</b> had done so, Miss Cutter took up the money.|$|R
5000|$|Polythene is a British {{variant of}} the word polyethylene, a plastic material. The name 'Polythene Pam' came from the {{nickname}} of an early Beatles' fan from the Cavern Club days, named Pat Hodgett (now Dawson), who would often eat polythene. She became known as 'Polythene Pat'. She said in an interview, [...] "I used to eat polythene all the time. I'd tie it in knots <b>and</b> <b>then</b> eat it. Sometimes I even used to burn <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> eat <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> got cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{mother made}} that despairing [...] "Tchk!" [...] with her tongue, {{and fell back}} in her chair. [...] "I should have DESPISED {{him if he had}} written. He's acted just exactly right, and you--you've acted--I don't know HOW you've acted. I'm ashamed of you. A girl that could be so {{sensible}} for her sister, and always say and do just the right thing, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> comes to herself to be such a DISGUSTING simpleton!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What was Madonna {{thinking}} of? If she {{had been}} willing, and able, to utter her thoughts, she might have expressed them thus: [...] "I wonder whether he likes my drawing? Shall I try hard if I can't make it better worth pleasing him? I will! it shall {{be the best thing}} I have ever done. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is nicely finished, I will take it secretly to Mrs. Blyth to give from me, as my present to Zack." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps it is {{well that}} it should be so, for we moved here and there without {{apparent}} aim or purpose until every man and officer {{was on the verge of}} exhaustion, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> required no slight effort simply to remain on our feet, we were forced to meet the British army, which had advanced by short stages to the end that the men should be in the best physical condition for that struggle which decided the fate of the nation's capital.|$|E
50|$|The river flows west-south-west {{from the}} border with China before turning north-westward south of Taldykorgan <b>and</b> <b>then</b> northward <b>when</b> <b>it</b> reaches the Saryesik-Atyrau Desert, a large sand desert south of Lake Balkhash. The river empties into Lake Balkhash near the centerpoint of its {{southern}} side. Karatal freezes up in December and stays icebound until March. Because of irrigation, the river's flow into Lake Balkash is limited.|$|R
50|$|Back on {{the side}} project front, the money issues with Jugoton were solved by taking the {{material}} over to ZKP RTLJ label {{while some of the}} money was obtained through Bijelo Dugme bandmate Zoran Redžić. The album Stižemo ended up being promoted very ambitiously with high quality press material. It was also the first time in Yugoslavia that an album's release date was publicly announced in advance - a widely used practice at the time was to release an album <b>and</b> <b>then</b> promote <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is already in stores.|$|R
25|$|Market speculation. Producers and {{marketers}} use {{gas storage}} as a speculative tool, storing gas when {{they believe that}} prices will increase in the future <b>and</b> <b>then</b> selling <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> does reach those levels.|$|R
60|$|The {{night when}} he had {{stumbled}} into the cafe in Dalton Street {{might well have been}} termed the nadir of Hodder's experience. His faith had been blotted out, and, with it had suddenly been extinguished all spiritual sense, The beast had taken possession. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was least expected,--nay, when despaired of, had come the glimmer of a light; distant, yet clear. He might have traced the course of his disillusionment, perhaps, but cause and effect were not discernible here.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that the}} danger of the night was over, all the people on board became anxious to save Henry or {{ascertain}} his fate; but although they searched the ocean far and wide, they saw not a vestige of him or of the Wasp. During this period Gascoyne acted like a bewildered man. He never quitted the helm, night nor day. He only ate a biscuit now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was brought to him, and he did not answer when he was spoken to.|$|E
60|$|The {{explorer}} {{has never}} shot a lion, {{though he has}} tracked {{a good many of}} them. Once he thought he had one. It was reclining in a little grove, and Thomson felt that it was his at last. With a trusty native he crept forward till he could obtain a good shot, and then fired. In breathless suspense he waited for its spring, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> did not spring he saw that he had shot it through the heart. However, it turned out only to be a large stone.|$|E
50|$|The river flows {{north from}} the border with China before turning north-westward passing by Matay <b>and</b> <b>then</b> northward <b>when</b> <b>it</b> reaches the Saryesik-Atyrau Desert, a large sand desert south of Lake Balkhash. The river empties into Lake Balkhash {{just west of the}} Lepsy River on its {{southern}} side. Aksu freezes in December and stays icebound until March. Because of irrigation, the river's flow into Lake Balkash is limited.|$|R
6000|$|So Henchard {{set about}} his {{preparations}} {{for a really}} brilliant thing--such as should be worthy of the venerable town. As for Farfrae's little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>when,</b> on <b>it</b> coming into his mind, he said to himself, [...] "Charge admission at so much a head--just like a Scotchman!--who {{is going to pay}} anything a head?" [...] The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free.|$|R
