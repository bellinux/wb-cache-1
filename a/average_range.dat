Horses are a precocial species, and foals {{are capable of}} standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E

The residents of this municipality (located {{in the northern part of}} Portugal) are quite strong in their support to tourism. However, they do not keep a homogeneous perception of tourism impacts. A clusters analysis using data from a survey of 400 Guimarães residents’ has revealed the existence of three clusters, according the different degrees of perceived tourism impacts: the Skeptics - moderate in relation to the benefits (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 2. 89 - 3. 74) and the ones more concerned with its costs (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 2. 86 - 3. 74); the Moderately optimistic - very optimistic about the benefits of tourism (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 3. 74 - 4. 51) and conscious of the costs (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 2. 71 - 3. 49); the Enthusiasts - very optimistic about tourism benefits (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 2. 92 - 4. 52) and little worried about its costs (<b>averages</b> <b>range</b> from 1. 78 - 3. 26). Following the data from the survey, the findings are discussed and a few conclusions are extracted. Keywords: cluster analysis, Guimarães, residents’ perceptions, tourism impacts.

500|$|At first, a {{batch of}} Z-0s were built with the Fafnir for testing, the DB 600 again proving to be too hard to obtain. These were quickly {{replaced}} with the Z-1 model, which added another gun for the bombardier, but the additional weight of the nose and guns meant the bomb load was reduced to 500kg (1,100lb). The Luftwaffe, not being satisfied with the test outcome of the Z series, immediately ordered performance and design studies to increase the overall performance of the bomber. These resulted in very optimistic speeds and altitudes for all future Z variants, especially for the Z-5 aircraft. Planned performance altitudes of up to 7,620 m (25,000ft) at a maximum speed of 418km/h (260mph) with an aircraft weight of 8,100kg (17,800lb) were planned. Unfortunately, production aircraft never reached these optimistic performances during the service career of the Do 17Z.

2500|$|The {{gestation}} period lasts for about eleven months, or about 340 days (normal <b>average</b> <b>range</b> 320–370 days). During {{the early days}} of pregnancy, the conceptus is mobile, moving about in the uterus until about day 16 when [...] "fixation" [...] occurs. Shortly after fixation, the embryo proper (so called up to about 35 days) will become visible on trans-rectal ultrasound (about day 21) and a heartbeat should be visible by about day 23. After the formation of the endometrial cups and early placentation is initiated (35–40 days of gestation) the terminology changes, and the embryo is referred to as a fetus. True implantation - invasion into the endometrium of any sort - does not occur until about day 35 of pregnancy with the formation of the endometrial cups, and true placentation (formation of the placenta) is not initiated until about day 40-45 and not completed until about 140 days of pregnancy. The fetus sex can be determined by day 70 of the gestation using ultrasound. Halfway through gestation the fetus is the size of between a rabbit and a beagle. The most dramatic fetal development occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy when 60% of fetal growth occurs.|$|E

2500|$|The giant trevally's early larval {{stages and}} their {{behaviour}} have been extensively described, with all fins having formed {{by at least}} 8mm in length, with larvae and subjuveniles being silver with six dark vertical bars. Laboratory populations of fish show a significant variability in the length at a certain age, with the <b>average</b> <b>range</b> being around 6.5mm. Growth rates in larvae between 8.0 and 16.5mm are on average 0.36mm per day. The speed at which larvae swim increases with age from 12cm/s at 8mm in length to 40cm/s at 16.5mm, with size rather than age a better predictor of this parameter. Size is also a better predictor of endurance in larvae than age. These observations suggest the species becomes an effective swimmer (is able to swim against a current) around 7–14mm. No obvious relationships with age and either swimming depth or trajectory have been found. Larvae appear to also opportunistically feed on small zooplankton while swimming. The larvae actively avoid other large fish, and jellyfish are occasionally used as temporary cover. Larvae have no association with reefs, and appear to prefer to live pelagically. Daily growth is estimated at between 3.82 and 20.87 g/day, with larger fish growing at a more rapid rate. Length {{at the age of}} one year is 18cm, at two years is 35cm and by three years, the fish is around 50 to 60cm. The use of von Bertalanffy growth curves fitted to observed otolith data show an individual of around 1 m in length is about eight years old, while a 1.7 m fish would be around 24 years old. The maximum theoretical length of the species predicted by the growth curves is 1.84 m, but the largest reported individual was 1.7 m long. As previously mentioned, as the giant trevally grows, it shifts from turbid inshore waters or estuaries to reefs and lagoons in bays, moving finally to outer reefs and atolls.|$|E
