40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore how weather risk affects the value of nitrogen fertilizer use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed variety adoption to Sub-Saharan African (SSA) maize farmers. It contributes to the literature by providing additional broad support for the hypothesis that low rates of fertilizer use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed variety adoption {{can be attributed to the}} fact that the SSA landscape is heterogeneous, so fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed are not always advantageous, especially when considering the potentially high cost to farmers of obtaining fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> seed. The analysis finds a synergy between nitrogen fertilizer <b>and</b> <b>improve</b> seed varieties. While the benefits of nitrogen tend to increase overtime without <b>improved</b> seed varieties <b>and</b> the benefits of improved seed varieties tend to decrease overtime without nitrogen, combining the two provides more sustained productivity benefits. Therefore, securing both nitrogen use <b>and</b> <b>improved</b> variety adoption is important for promoting sustained productivity increases across most of SSA. The research also contributes to the literature a methodology for calculating willingness to pay bounds that assess the importance of farmers’ risk tolerances as a barrier to fertilizer use or improved seed variety adoption.

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead <b>and</b> <b>improves</b> the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E

The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment.

The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe insoles as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

5|$|For example, in most {{underdeveloped}} economies, {{the technology}} {{used to carry}} out agricultural activities is backward. There is a low degree of mechanisation coupled with rain dependence. So while {{a large proportion of}} the population (70-80%) may be actively employed in the agriculture sector, the contribution to the Gross Domestic Product may be as low as 40%. This points to the need to increase output per unit input and output per head. This can be done if the government provides irrigation facilities, high-yielding variety seeds, pesticides, fertilisers, tractors etc. The positive outcome of this is that farmers earn more income and have a higher purchasing power (real income). Their demand for other products in the economy will rise and this will provide industrialists an incentive to invest in that country. Thus, the size of the market expands <b>and</b> <b>improves</b> the condition of the underdeveloped country.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe <b>and</b> <b>improves</b> outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight <b>and</b> <b>improves</b> light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E
